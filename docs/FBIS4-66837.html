			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fatin 'Abd-al-Razzaq: "What Are Egyptian </F> Businessmen Abroad Thinking?"]    [Text] There has been a constant improvement, in recent  years, in the investment climate in Egypt. The government has  now adopted the goal of simplifying procedures. The steps it has  taken to reform the economy have helped to reaffirm the  government's policy of encouraging the private sector, with  investment now registering growth of 15 percent. Although  figures show that nearly 60 percent of the total volume of  investments in Egypt were made by Egyptians, and that they own  853 projects, of which 229 are in the free zones, providing 6.5  billion [Egyptian] pounds, there is $70 billion in investments  from Egyptian citizens abroad. In order to attract more assets  to assist in the country's development, the second conference of  Egyptian businessmen abroad has been held in Cairo, presided  over by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. It was attended by 150  expatriate Egyptian businessmen residing in Europe, America, and  the Arab countries. What are the views of these Egyptians,  absent for long years, on the investment climate? What are their  thoughts about further encouragement of participation in  development projects?    At the outset, Dr. Mahmud Wahbah, Chairman of the Board of  the Societies of Egyptian Businessmen Abroad, asserted that the  investment climate in Egypt was excellent, and that "we are one  of the world's five most investment-attractive countries, but we  lack clarity of vision, in the sense of not setting clear and  specific goals for the type and volume of investment at a given  time, then setting out to achieve them. And there is another  negative point: the absence, or nonexistence, of coordination  among ministries in the area of investment. But I emphasize that  evolution towards betterment has been a major characteristic in  recent years, since the first conference of Egyptian businessmen  living in America was held in Cairo three years ago. The proof  of that is the establishment of 30 projects for the production  of textile and fabrics, wood, leather, computers, television  screens, eyeglasses, and photocopiers. These were all funded in  full by a group of Egyptians living in America. We also joined  up with officials to prepare a financial market law, a financial  leasing law, freeing cotton and selling cotton stocks in foreign  markets, in cooperation with the New York Cotton Exchange, which  is the world's only specialized market for dealing in cotton,  both buying and selling." Mechanic for reforming companies: "Due  to our confidence in the future of the Egyptian economy, I will  take part, with a group of Egyptian investors in America, in  buying some of the business sector firms offered for sale, for  restructuring. We are, in America, specializing in buying  faltering companies, then rebuilding their economies, and  putting them back on the road to success and profit. I am called  a `mechanic for companies' because I recently bought 10 failing  companies in various industrializing sectors and returned them  to profitability."  <H5>  "For Egypt's Sake" </H5>   Businesswoman Dr. Zaynab Karam, owner of a medical  instrument  and equipment export company in England, who has been outside  the country for 15 years, said that she was participating for  the first time in an investment conference, and that she was  attending out of love for Egypt, and to see what projects could  be established to serve the citizens of the nation. "They are  people with integrity among whom I refuse to believe there are  those who would bear arms against one another or be deceived  into joining terrorist groups that damage Egypt's reputation. I  am confident that the terrorist events we are now seeing are  only fleeting crimes and will stop sooner or later, even if they  do affect the feelings of some Egyptians abroad; but they do not  in the least affect our determination to work and invest in our  country in order to raise the standard of living of Egyptian  citizens. I call for a greater media effort inside and outside  Egypt to explain the advantages and guarantees granted to  investors, both Egyptian and foreign, and to present the success  that investment companies have achieved in the free zones and  inside the country."  <H5>  Evolution of the Financial Market </H5>   Dr. Wahid al-Mantawi, Egyptian oil expert in the United Arab  Emirates, says that he and a group of Egyptians working in the  UAE [United Arab Emirates] established in 1987, "a holding  company for investing in Egypt. Capitalized at 20 million  pounds, in the early years of the open-door economic policy it  faced various bureaucratic and routine problems, which we are  aware can happen in any country in the world. But we overcame  the problems and the company achieved a general success in just  a year, with actual investments in Egypt of 40 million pounds."    Turning to his suggestions for encouraging investments, Dr.  al-Mantawi says that the stock market should be further  developed and activated, "as a stock market is a key instrument  for attracting capital. On this front, I seek the granting all  exemptions for stock investment returns that are granted to  other deposit facilities."  <H5>  "Investment Promotion" Needed </H5>   Dr. Murad al-Damasi, an Egyptian businessman resident in  Ireland for more than 20 years, has this view of a means for  attracting the deposits of Egyptians working abroad: "Why  doesn't the government facilitate the purchase of desert land by  investors, and grant incentives to reclaim and farm it? If that  were the case, Egyptians abroad would be able to bring in  advanced technology and provide a high level of expertise, which  would supply agricultural products to local markets, plus  exports. It would bring in national economic revenue, in  addition to offering job opportunities to citizens.    "No one denies that the government has recently offered many  facilities and incentives to encourage investment, espcially  with regard to small investors. But we still say that so far  Egypt has not worked hard enough to promote its available  investment opportunities abroad and offer each project's  statements."  <H5>  "The Problem Is Management" </H5>   Shakir al-Khayat, an Egyptian businessman living in America,  and one of the major investors in 6 October City, says that: "We  have many relative privileges for making great investments in  Egypt. We can compete with many countries of the world for which  investment has become very important. The only problem, in my  view, is management; and then management again. It must be  developed. Training centers should be set up to graduate  technical and specialized workers. I'm not saying this in a  void, but based on my practical experience setting up a factory  to produce photocopiers and typewriters."    Businessman Musa Ahmad Abu-Jabal says, "We have great  confidence in the Egyptian economy. It has all the elements  needed for global launch, especially the ability and  qualifications of Egyptian workers to work with advanced  technology. We have come to Egypt with open hearts and minds,  hoping to take part in achieving a better economic future. The  global changes and political events in the Middle East region,  after the comprehensive peace, impose a new regional role on  Egypt. This means that we must all prepare ourselves, as  Egyptians, to carry out this role at home and abroad."  <H5>  More Facilitation Measures </H5>   In the end, AL-AKHBAR met with Dr. Muhi-al-Din al-Gharib,  president of the executive council of the Investment Commission  for promoting and attracting Egyptian businessmen residing  abroad, who have been successful in various investment areas  throughout the world. He said, "We welcome Egyptian businessmen  residing abroad. We expect much of them, because we know that  Egypt can be built only by its own people. We want to convince  every Egyptian investor to invest in his own country; the  success of his project is the greatest gain, and the best  advertisement to attract foreign company owners and investors to  establish more projects in Egypt."    Dr. al-Gharib adds that a number of steps are now being  taken  to broaden investment horizons in the near future. Some of these  are the establishment a number of new industrial zones in  various governorates in which projects would enjoy tax  exemptions for 10 years. Investments in them would be limited to  small and medium-sized, nonpolluting projects. The amount of  credit earmarked for the expansion of the vocational training  programs will be increased. Training centers at production sites  will also be provided. The government welcomes investment in the  areas of manufacturing investment devices, transport and  passenger vehicles, and on modern technology projects in the  electronics, computer, and systems and programming areas. The  government is also encouraging investors to go into projects  involving the reclamation and cultivation of large expanses of  desert land, through leasing. Long-term leasing, of up to 50  years, would be permitted, and land can be offered now in  several regions of Egypt.    The Investment Commission has also completed a regulation  for  the inner work system of the free zones in order to simplify  measures. It will come into effect in the middle of this year.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Barclays adds Pounds 200m to capital base BARCLAYS BANK has added Pounds 200m to its capital base at an attractive cost, by using an innovative structure which may be imitated by other banks, writes Tracy Corrigan. The structure of the undated, subordinated issue gives the bank the option of extending the maturity of the debt indefinitely. Unlike most perpetual debt, the upfront cost of the deal is only about half a percentage point more than for dated, subordinated debt, for the first 15 years. 'If investors accept that this is the correct pricing, we could certainly see more of these deals,' said one UK investment banker. International bonds, Page 29</p>

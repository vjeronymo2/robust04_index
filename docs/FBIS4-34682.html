			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Indians have announced they will continue their  uprising to pressure the Court of Constitutional Guarantees to  declare the Land Development Law unconstitutional. Indians from  the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador [Conaie]  appeared today before the Court of Constitutional Guarantees to  pressure the court into handing down a decision that declares  the Land Development Law unconstitutional. Conaie President Luis  Macas denied having reached an agreement with the government  regarding the formation of a joint commission to regulate the  law's enforcement.    [Begin Macas recording] The government is responsible for  what has happened up to now. Obviously, the National Congress is  equally responsible. We would also like to make one thing clear:  We realize it is extremely difficult for the Ecuadoran people to  understand us. We would like to say, however, that those who are  spreading uncertainty and violence in the countryside are those  who violated the Constitution at the National Congress, followed  by the president's sanctioning of an unconstitutional law. [end  recording]    The Indians, who came down from several Ecuadoran mountain  provinces, chanted slogans and said their protests will only end  with the repeal of the law or with their deaths.    Carlos Jaramillo, president of the Court of Constitutional  Guarantees, promised to process the Indian request as quickly as  possible. Luis Macas, on behalf of the Ecuadoran Indian  communities, discarded the possibility of reaching any type of  agreement with the government. He assured that the Indians would  only end their protest when the land law is repealed. The Indian  uprising, then, will continue to pressure the Court of  Constitutional Guarantees to overturn the law.    Chimborazo Province is completely paralyzed at this time by  the Indian demonstrations. In our midday newscast, we reported  on the situation there with statements by one of the strike  coordinators. In the town of Guamote, Indians occupied the main  administration building. This morning, they said they are ready  to go as far as they have to. They are also demanding the  government revoke the law. Deputy-elect (Cesar Vuelva) of  Chimborazo Province said they will not return to their homes  until the law is annulled.    [Begin (Vuelva) recording] Three Indians have died -- one  from Tungurahua and two from Canar province -- and we still have  no specific answer to our request from the president. They may  propose we reform the law's articles, or to draft the  regulations to enforce the law. We cannot support this. The rank  and file of the Indian organizations have ordered us to demand  absolute repeal of the law.    (Vuelva) maintains that the peasant-Indian coordinating  board  is more united now than ever before, and no one will be able to  dissolve the peasants' organizations.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / African trade groups at odds TWO economic groups in eastern and southern Africa appear locked on a collision course, Reuter reports from Harare. The 18-nation Preferential Trade Area (PTA) of eastern and southern Africa called last week for a merger with the 10-state Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). But the latter shows no intention of accepting this idea despite a nine-nation overlap in membership. 'Ministers don't talk to each other within the same government, let alone communicating adequately with other governments,' one diplomat observed. SADCC, comprising Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia. Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, was formed in 1980 to lessen economic dependence on an apartheid South Africa. Almost two years later the PTA - which includes the SADCC members except Botswana, but with the addition of Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia and Uganda - was set up to promote trade and lead to an eventual common market. Diplomats say relations between the two groups have been rancorous at times, particularly on the part of the PTA which appears to resent SADCC's ability to raise development funds. In an embarrassing clash of dates, the PTA held its annual summit in Lusaka and SADCC its important annual donors' conference in Maputo on the same days last week. PTA members pledged to seek a quick merger with SADCC. Officials of the SADCC agree there must be greater co-operation between the two groups, but say there is no suggestion SADCC will disappear.</p>

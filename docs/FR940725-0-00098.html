Treatment of Room and Board in Submitting Estimates of Expenditures for Personal Caregivers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1915(c)(1) of the Act provides for payment, as medical assistance, of part or all of the cost of home and community-based services under an approved waiver (other than room and board). Except for respite care furnished in a State-approved facility that is not a private residence, FFP is not available for room and board as part of a home and community-based service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4741(a)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1915(c)(1) to specify that, for purposes of this section of the Act, ``the term `room and board' shall not include an amount established under a method determined by the State to reflect the portion of costs of rent and food attributable to an unrelated personal caregiver who is residing in the same household with an individual who, but for the assistance of such caregiver, would require admission to a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provisions of the final rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are adding a new &sect;441.303(f)(8) to provide that, in submitting estimates for waivers that include personal caregivers as a waiver service, the State may include a portion of the rent and food attributed to the unrelated personal caregiver who resides in the waiver recipient's home or residence. The method of apportioning the costs of rent and food is determined by the State, subject to review and approval by HCFA. The method used must be explained fully to receive HCFA's approval. A personal caregiver provides a waiver service to meet the recipient's physical, social, or emotional needs (as opposed to services not directly related to the care of the recipient; that is, housekeeping or chore services). FFP for live-in caregivers is not available if the recipient lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence that is owned or leased by the caregiver. We have interpreted language in the statute that rent and food costs attributable to the live-in caregiver may now be included in the State's estimates of cost-neutrality to include situations in which the live-in caregiver resides in the recipient's home and the recipient would incur additional costs for such a caregiver. When the recipient lives with the caregiver, the caregiver incurs the additional costs for the recipient. We believe the payment to the caregiver for the recipient's rent and food would violate the room and board exclusion under section 1915(c)(1) of the Act. We will consider timely comments on this addition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

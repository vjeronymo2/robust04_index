			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Battle to curb powers of Malay sultans leaves deep scars: The royals have yielded to a government campaign and agreed to constitutional changes THE royal bashing season in Malaysia is over. Last week the country's nine sultans, each of whom takes a turn as Malaysia's king, finally agreed to constitutional changes limiting their powers. A three-month battle between government and royalty which threatened unrest in one of Asia's fast growing countries has ended. The guns of the heavily government-influenced media, trained on the royals since late last year, have fallen silent. But the tussle between the government led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, and the royals has left deep scars. Malaysia's monarchy now faces an uncertain future. Politics in Malaysia is unlikely to be the same again. The royal rumpus started last November after one of the sultans had allegedly beaten up a sports official. The behaviour of the sultans and their increasing involvement in politics and Malaysia's business sector had been a growing cause of concern to the government. Dr Mahathir, 12 years prime minister, decided he had enough public support to go for the royal jugular. He launched an unprecedented campaign against the sultans. Before this, any mention of royal misdeeds had been forbidden. Now the public was fed an increasingly rich diet of alleged royal misdemeanours, ranging from corruption to murder. Revelations were made about the spendthrift ways of the royalty - their polo ponies, their Italian sports cars, their private armies, their palaces and their yachts. Dr Mahathir's initial campaign against the sultans backfired. According to Malaysia's constitution, the sultans have to agree to any changes which affect their position. Incensed by Dr Mahathir's public assault, they refused to accept constitutional amendments which would, among other things, take away their immunity from prosecution. Dr Mahathir responded by withdrawing various royal privileges. Most seriously for the sultans, a number of financial stipends were removed. The sultans would no longer be entitled to preferential share allocations. Thousands of hectares of valuable forest concessions were taken away. There was talk of investigating certain royal business deal ings. Now the sultans, some apparently fearing bank-ruptcy, have agreed to what amounts to a humiliating truce. The royals accept Dr Mahathir's amendments, though some limited concessions appear to have been made by the government. Royal status has been severely dented by the three-month campaign against them. The palace gates have been thrown open: public prying into royal affairs is unlikely now to cease overnight. Dr Mahathir has already said that certain royal privileges will not be restored. That could mean that some sultans might still face severe financial hardship, if not ruin. On one hand Dr Mahathir, already invested with considerable executive powers, emerges from the royal fray in an even stronger position, with his reputation for tough dealing enhanced. However, Dr Mahathir has encouraged public prying into the financial affairs of the monarchy. There are those who say that equally close examination should now be made of the business dealings of what critics call Malaysia new rajas -  some senior government officials themselves. The royals might not be the only people to have been damaged by the events of the last three months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Australian Government is encouraged by a  Chinese decision to cut tariff on some wool imports. From the  start of this year, China reduced the tariff on short greasy  wool from 15 percent to 10 percent, in recognition of the  exchange rate effects of the recent float of the Chinese  currency. Australia's trade minister, Peter Cook, and the  primary industries minister, Bob Collins, say although the  decision is subject to review in 12 months, it is a constructive  development they say will help maintain wool's position as a  textile in China. China also decided last November to reduce  from 20 to 15 percent its tariff on wool tops. Australia has  actively lobbied China on wool tariff reductions, including  representations from Prime Minister Paul Keating during a visit  to China late last year.</p>

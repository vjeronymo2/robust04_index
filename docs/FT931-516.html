			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Community care guidelines attacked LOCAL AUTHORITY social services directors yesterday attacked guidelines issued by the government for its care-in-the-community proposals. The proposals, which are due to be implemented on Thursday, will give local authorities a leading role in assessing needs and arranging care for the elderly, disabled and mentally ill. The directors said guidance on measuring the care needs was 'unrealistic' and should be more precise. The Association of Directors of Social Services is seeking discussions with the Department of Health and local authority associations to clarify the guidance. Fears about the reforms' funding have been fuelled by a government circular, which has been interpreted as advising councils not to tell people what their needs are, in case they cannot be met. A second circular - intended to allay local authority fears - predicted that town halls would face legal challenges from people dissatisfied with community care. It has also emerged that ministers have no plans to collate evidence of needs that are not met - leaving the government without a way to check the effectiveness of community care. A survey published yesterday said social services staff assessing the community care requirements of disabled people were failing to report needs they considered too expensive or difficult to fulfil. The report, based on interviews with 50 disabled people and conducted by the poverty research group The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, studies community care practices in two unidentified local authority areas.</p>

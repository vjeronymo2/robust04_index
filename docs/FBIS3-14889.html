			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At his own initiative, President Kravchuk met with  directors of nuclear power plants [AES]. How do the plants work  at this difficult time of deficits and meager funding? Will  they manage to keep afloat? These were the question that  worried the president. At the beginning of the meeting,  Kravchuk said that nuclear power plants are Ukraine's salvation  today. This phrase became the leading idea of the hour-long  meeting. The meeting was attended by Directors Volodymyr  Bronnykov, from the Zaporizhzhya AES; Volodymyr Korovkin, the  Rivne AES; and Viktor Sapronov, the Khmelnytska AES. After  outlining the situation at the stations, they centered on two  issues -- the drain of qualified experts and nuclear fuel  supplies. The experts are fleeing to Russia, where salaries are  much higher. As a temporary solution to this problem, the  station managers asked the president to help reduce by 10  percent the income tax for AES key professionals -- something  that was done for coal miners. With the moratorium on the  development of nuclear engineering being lifted, the industry  got its second wind. Substantial credits are about to come from  abroad. But how are we supposed to repay them? Should we pay  with ecologically clean electric energy, a deficient commodity  for Ukraine itself, or by transferring ownership of our atomic  facilities to international companies? The solution of those  complex questions requires profound analysis, the president  said. Also discussed was the issue of whether Ukraine should  have its own so-called nuclear fuel cycle that would consist of  extracting, processing, enrichment of uranium, manufacturing of  fuel rods, and burial of nuclear waste. After all, Ukraine has  its own uranium. But is the country in a position to manage  this today?    Volodymyr Bronnykov presented a report on a project to build  U.S.-licensed dry fuel waste warehouses. Viktor Safronov  briefed those present on experience gained from cooperation with  foreign partners in providing the stations with modern  equipment. Volodymyr Korovkin talked about the successful  handling of the problem caused by the karst layer under the  Rivne AES.    As a UKRINFORM correspondent reported, the meeting was quite  useful and fruitful. Its final result was the president's edict  on urgent measures related to nuclear power engineering.</p>

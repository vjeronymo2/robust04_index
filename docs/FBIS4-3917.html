			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Economic integration  is emerging around the Bohai bay area in north China, as the  nation has quickened the pace of reform and opening to the  outside world over the past few years.    The fast-growing regional economic integration, which  gradually has changed China's pattern of economic development,  has now caught the eye of the world.    The Bohai economic rim includes north and northeast China's  Shandong, Liaoning, Shanxi and Hebei Provinces, as well as  Beijing and Tianjin, covering an area of 680,000 square  kilometers.    The area boasts good geographical conditions and is rich in  natural resources. It also has well-developed industries,  express transport systems and a highly-trained work force,  playing a leading part in the country's economy.    The idea to develop the Bohai economic zone began in 1985  when senior officials of 16 big and medium-sized cities around  Bohai bay, including Tianjin, Dalian (in Liaoning Province) and  Qingdao (in Shandong Province), met for the first time to  discuss economic cooperation in the Bohai area.    In 1992, the Bohai rim was approved by the state as an  independent economic zone under the country's general strategic  economic development plan.    The opening and development of the Bohai area, in accordance  with the decision of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist  Party of China, was to be accelerated. After 20 years of effort  it would be built into China's first modernized region, marking  the economic rim's going into operation.    Efforts made in the past eight years laid the groundwork for  the realization of regional economic cooperation along the  coastal areas of the Bohai bay and interior zones next to them.    Economists maintain that the close ties for an  inter-regional  economy needs are based on the density of cities.    So far, there are 85 cities of various size around Bohai  bay,  accounting for 17.7 percent of the country's total. The number  of cities with a population of over 500,000 adds up to 18, about  58.1 percent of the total in east China's coastal areas.    What is more, each of 11 cities there has a population of  over one million people, accounting for 61 percent of the  country's total, ranking first among the coastal regions.    Concentration on heavy industries is another distinct  feature  of the bohai economic rim. The scale and influence of the  densely packed heavy industries within the rim have remained  first in the country since it was founded in 1949.    Located in the rim are China's biggest chemical and  petrochemical industry bases, such as the Yanshan Petrochemical  Corporation and the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Group.    The three biggest iron and steel producers also are located  around the bay, namely, the Shougang Company (the Capital Iron  and Steel Company), the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the  Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company.    Data from an official department shows that the output in  internal combustion engines of this area accounted for 32.15  percent of the country's total in 1991, that of soda ash 62.17  percent, and that of steel 36.76 percent.    Experts involved believe that the Bohai bay economy features  an industrial development pattern with the heavy chemical  industry taking the lead. The driving power of this pattern is  beyond comparison with that of the light industries in south  China.    On the other hand, the population employed in the first  industry in this region is relatively low compared with that in  the interior areas. And more farmers there have shifted to  other industrial sectors.    But in the past eight years, the provinces and cities  involved have tried hard to seek their local interests instead  of paying attention to the integral ones.    This has resulted in redundant construction projects and  low-  efficiency production, which waste a lot of resources.    It was in the past few years that the local governments have  been aware of the importance of the regional economic  cooperation in their own development.    As a result, a new port with a handling capacity of 35  million tons will be put into operation by the year 2000 in  Tangshan (Hebei Province) through the joint efforts of Beijing  and Tangshan city.    Also, Beijing and Tianjin have jointly invested 40 million  yuan to build China's biggest liquid chemicals berth in Tianjin.    A Bohai Economic Cooperation Development Stock Company is  expected to go into operation this year.    All these indicate that a third economic zone is rising in  north China that will exert great influence on the country's  economic development.</p>

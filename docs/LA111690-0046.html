			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'NORBERT SMITH' A WITTY BRITISH PARODY  </P> <P> In "Sir Norbert Smith: A Life," a British send-up of the reverential TV  biography, English comedian Harry Enfield plays an 80-year-old Olivier-like  actor whose life and career are chronicled in an insufferably stuffy television  retrospective.  </P> <P> The parody, airing on "Great Performances" tonight (9:30-10:30 on Channel 28,  9-10 p.m. on Channels 15 and 24) is delicious, managing to be droll and pungent  at the same time.  </P> <P> Here's a show to tape and keep in your library and play back at parties.  British humor doesn't always cross our shores intact, but "Sir Norbert Smith,"  with a swipe at the superior manner of British interview shows, is hilarious.  </P> <P> The British are making fun of themselves here, but it's easy to imagine  American celebrity TV shows, too. Barbara Walters' post-Oscar star interviews  come instantly to mind. The high-toned interviewer prodding Sir Norbert Smith  is smugly played by British TV host Melvyn Bragg, who, in fact, once  interviewed Lord Olivier on "Great Performances' " "Laurence Olivier: A Life"  in 1985.  </P> <P> Enfield, who's 29 and something of a cult figure in London, is a discovery --  for this viewer not unlike catching Sid Caesar on television for the first time  in "Your Show of Shows."  </P> <P> In "clips" affectionately staged by director Geoff Posner, Enfield's takeoffs  on beloved British movie actors and their famous roles are ripe. Among other  gems, the comedian (who co-wrote the material with Geoffrey Perkins) plays a  gay, chain-smoking Hamlet "with additional dialogue by Noel Coward," and, in a  commercial for a detergent called Sudso, recreates in a savory satire the  doomed romance in "Brief Encounter." His Andrew Lloyd Webber impersonation is  choice, too. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

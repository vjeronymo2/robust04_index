			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 22 (XINHUA) -- In what may be  the most serious espionage case in U.S. history, a senior U.S.  intelligence officer and his wife were arraigned today for  spying for the former Soviet Union and later Russia since 1985.    President Bill Clinton described the case as a "very serious  one and would lodge a strong protest with the Russians."    Aldrich Hazen Ames, 52, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  employee for more than 31 years, was chief of the Soviet branch  of the CIA's Counter Intelligence Group, before being arrested  Monday [21 February] by the Federal Bureau of Investigations  (FBI).    Ames and his wife, the 41-year-old Maria del Rosario Casas,  allegedly received more than 1.5 million dollars from the former  Soviet Union's KGB and its Russian successor for giving vital  information on CIA's operations and personnel.    If convicted, the couple could be sentenced a maximum of  life  imprisonment and 250,000 dollars in fines.    According to Helen F. Fahey, U.S. attorney for the eastern  district of Virginia, Ames also passed classified information  to, and received cash from, the Russians through "dead drops" in  the Washington, D.C. area.    A "dead drop" is a prearranged location where a foreign  agent  drops off or picks up material from his contact.    It is not clear for the time being if any Russian diplomats  here would be pronounced as "persona non grata" as a result of  the couple's arrest.    Attorney Fehey said in the complaint that Ames and his wife,  native of Colombia and a naturalized U.S. citizen, used at least  two Swiss bank accounts to store and transfer the money they got  from the Russians.    The couple spent the money on, among other things, a 540,000  dollars house, jaguar automobiles and more than 165,000 dollars  in stocks and securities.    FBI agents have seized the couple's residence in Arlington,  Virginia and frozen numerous bank accounts belonging to or  controlled by the couple in the United States and abroad.    Ames' wife is a part-time student at the Georgetown  University and previously acted as a paid source for the CIA in  Mexico City, Mexico.    "FBI agents worked doggedly on this case -- not for months  but for years -- with the CIA's unwavering assistance every stop  of the way," FBI Director Louis Freeh said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Jaquez] </F>   [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon--Popular Line (PP) emerged on  the eve of the 1968 student rebellion in the Federal District,  made its presence felt through brigades during that movement,  later dispersed after the 2 October massacre in Tlatelolco,  regrouped the following year, and again through brigade members,  penetrated many communities around the country, including the  Chiapas jungle, during the 1970's, some of the founders of the  group have revealed.    College students, mainly from the UNAM's National School of  Economics (the 1964-69 generation), came together to form PP and  get it off the ground. Some of them were Alberto Anaya, Hugo  Andres Araujo, Rolando Cordera, and Gustavo Gordillo, under the  intellectual leadership of Adolfo Orive, who was their  professor. Also contributing to the expansion of PP, with  financial support, were officials in the governments of Luis  Echeverria and Jose Lopez-Portillo, some of whom were members of  that generation and are currently in the Salinas cabinet.    This information came to PROCESO from Agustin Acosta,  Alberto  Anaya, and Hector Camero, who founded one of the PP's  strongholds, the Land and Liberty Popular Front, in this city.  Interviewed separately, the three agreed that the PP never had a  well-defined organization and that its growth led to fierce  internal squabbling, which ultimately split it into two major  blocs: Mass Line and Proletarian Line, led respectively by  Araujo and Orive.    The distant forerunner of Land and Liberty, Costa related,  was the movement that emerged in the Autonomous University of  Nuevo Leon against the increase in fees in 1967. Acosta, then a  student in the Department of Philosophy and Letters, was  involved in the formation of the Coordinator of Preparatory  Schools, which sought to expand the student movement with an eye  towards incorporating it into grass-roots movements. The goal  was achieved three years later when a group of college students  backed 400 colonia residents from Topo Chico in their invasion  of some lands, on which Land and Liberty was later to emerge.  "We invaded...and three days later they pounded us out of there."    Nevertheless, he continued, "we realized that we had a gold  mine there and that we had to start working in an organized  fashion." The government, he explained, had the workers and  peasants under control, but had neglected the new residents who  were arriving in droves from the countryside and had no options.  We saw that we could slip in there. We studied the  situation...and we prepared to invade once again. On 30 August  1971 we invaded the first colonia in the group that later formed  the Land and Liberty Popular Front, colonia Martires de San  Cosme."    Some months before, he recalled, Marcos Cruz, who was a PP  brigade member in Durango, arrived in this city. He gave us a  lecture, saying: `We are doing the same thing. We have a lot in  common. We ought to work together.' And he left us the document  that you talked about in PROCESO (897), `Hacia una Politica  Popular,' so that we could study it." Then came Alberto Anaya,  another brigade member in Durango: "He gave us the same speech  and asked us to join the organization. Which one? I asked...The  fact was that there was no such organization; there were just  scattered groups of brigade members. He then asked me whether I  wanted to know `the guy who has the whole story...' and I told  him I did. This was how Adolfo Orive first came here. We had our  first official meeting in April 1971. He recommended that we  step up our political work, that we become more professional,  that there was funding for this. And that was what happened."    Both Anaya and Cruz, who served as federal deputies in the  1988-1991 Legislature representing the PMS [Mexican Socialist  Party]-OIR-Mass Line coalition, later left Durango "because we  called them back as reinforcements, but also because most of the  cadres that they had over there split and joined the guerrillas.  Many joined the 23 September Communist League."    Acosta recalls that in 1968 Acosta was in a postgraduate  program on economic planning at the Advanced Teachers College in  Paris. "He lived through May 1968 in France and, showing great  intuition, sensed the coming worldwide revolt; he came back to  Mexico in early July of that year and started giving economics  classes at UNAM. His philosophy was quite well developed; it was  Maoist, a product of the studies that he had done on the  People's Cultural Revolution in China, particularly with  Professor Charles Bettelheim, who was his adviser, the president  of the French-Chinese Friendship Association, and the main  Marxist theoretician of that revolution."    Orive, the son of Adolfo Orive Alva, the secretary of water  resources under Miguel Aleman, had graduated as a civil engineer  from UNAM in 1963. His thesis was entitled "Modern planning  techniques for the comprehensive development of the Grijalba  River Basin," which already evinced his interest in solving  specific problems facing the country.    When the student movement erupted, Acosta said, "a lot of  brigades were formed, and the factions began to multiply: the  Communist Party, the Trotskyites, the Maoists...The latter had  just emerged; its source was the Espartaco Communist League. The  factions came together in the brigades, and the so-called  Coalition of Emiliano Zapata Brigades was formed. It was the one  that issued the first version of the document "Towards a Popular  Line" (Originally "For a Popular Line"). Orive wrote it up,  pursuant to a consensus among university professors, mostly in  economics, among them Araujo, Gordillo, and Anaya."  <H5>  The Brigades Regroup </H5>   After the crackdown on the student movement, the brigade  members scattered. Orive regrouped them in 1969, and a decision  was made to implement the principles of the PP, a task that  began the following year in several regions around the country.  The first place was indigenous communities in Guerrero, Chiapas,  and Oaxaca. They "did almost social-welfare work, sending in  medical brigades, for example. Back then there was a lot of  discussion about the best way to integrate with the masses...and  splinter groups kept forming, later giving rise to other  organizations, such as the Mexican Party of the Proletariat,  which Gustavo Gordillo headed."    Anaya, a current leader of the Labor Party in this state and  president of the Land and Liberty Popular Front, confirmed that  the PP emerged "before 1968. It was based on Maoist principles  concerning the so-called mass line, which basically says that  everything has to come from the decisions of the people, on the  basis of which a line of action is developed."    He pointed out that the PP did its work in three stages. The  first was "integration with the masses and it ran from mid-1968  to 1971. The second was mobilization of the masses, from 1971 to  1976. The third was organization and consolidation of the mass  groups and the construction of social support bases; we are  still doing this work." The movement spread at first to Durango,  Monterrey, Bahia de Banderas in Nayarit, the Yaqui Valley in  Sonora, Las Truchas in Michoacan, Torreon, Monclova, Tlaxcala,  and Zacatecas.    He explained that "the regions into which we went had been  selected according to their political profitability, that is to  say, the ones in which the people were willing to become  involved."    The selection was also made on the basis of "Orive's  political contacts and interests within the State apparatus,"  says Hector Camero, the current leader of the Land and Liberty  Civil Association, a group that split from the Front that Anaya  heads. For example, he notes, brigade members went to Las  Truchas because the iron and steel plant was run by Orive's  father, and they went to Bahia de Banderas because Orive himself  worked there.    During the time that Orive worked in Monterrey, he adds, "we  realized more clearly that he had political contacts at the  highest level, including President Echeverria and his interior  secretary, Mario Moya Palencia. Besides drafting PP documents,  Orive was explicitly charged with raising funds for the  movement, and we brigade members had only hints of where they  came from. For example, he brought in vehicles from Las Truchas.  Orive's and Anaya's contact man with Echeverria was the rector  of the UANL, Luis Eugenio Todd."    Through Todd, Camero contends, Echeverria supported some of  Land and Liberty's projects.    Acosta, who at present has his own law practice, says that  Orive had "direct ties with Echeverria and was very good friends  with his eldest son, Luis Echeverria Zuno; they studied together  in Paris. As of 1971 Adolfo was very much involved in the Bahia  de Banderas Trust. He did the organizing; I was there for four  months."    Later, "we realized that other politicians were supporting  the movement. In 1975 some of us brigade members were in the  Huasteca Hidalguense [the Hidalgo State portion of the Huasteca  region]. It was a dangerous zone, owing to the presence of the  caciques' white guards, like the Austrias, so we needed cover  for our work. We got it from Raul Salinas de Gortari, the  director of rural roads for the SAHOP (Secretariat of Human  Settlements and Public Works), who introduced us as researchers.  Another who backed us was Emilio Lozoya; I do not recall what  post he held at the time, but I once went with Orive to pick up  money at his office."    "Humberto Perez Hinojosa, who was working with Araujo in La  Laguna, once invited me to Manuel Camacho Solis's home in the  Federal District. There were a lot of people there whom we had  to tell what we were doing because of the financial support they  were giving. That kind of thing bothered me. I felt like a  clown, but Orive justified it...Lozoya and Camacho also studied  economics at UNAM; hence their relationship with Orive and other  members of that generation. The fact is that this support  enabled us to maintain a roster of around 300 professional  brigade members throughout the country from 1976 to 1979."    Camero recalls that in late 1975 "Orive settled here; we  ourselves asked him to do so, to integrate with the masses,  because he would only visit occasionally on the pretext that he  had to raise funds. His presence was ill-fated; the cultural  revolution that he advocated led to the death of six colonia  residents on 18 February 1976."    Orive began his "cultural revolution" here with the argument  that we had to wage a battle to the death against Social  Democracy, represented by Anaya, because it put the leaders  above the masses. The masses, Orive said, are the ones that must  lead movements. He indicated that the leaders who do not teach  these methods are bourgeois Social Democrats who must be swept  away by the masses. In this way he carried the ideological  struggle to bitter, terrible extremes."    Against this backdrop a problem arose in colonia San Angel,  which is between colonias Francisco Villa and Tierra y Libertad,  when some patrolmen arrested a group of colonia residents on  charges that they had stolen electrical equipment: "We went to  help our comrades. The patrolmen called for reinforcements, and  just when we had reached an agreement with the police to release  them, residents of colonia Francisco Villa showed up and began  provoking them. They were people whom Orive controlled; he  called them `red guards.' The police shot at them, killing six."    He charges: "Orive sent those comrades to their death. We  did  not criticize him publicly at the time, but we did complain to  him in private. We told him that his cause had brought death. He  said: 'Revolutions shed blood.' The fact is that his goal was to  sweep away the leaders here."    After the slayings, Acosta says, the grass-roots movement  posted "huge growth, in this city and in others, which also  caused the organization to grow excessively...and the internal  feuding to intensify. After the ideological battle that he had  with Anaya in Monterrey, which in the end was just a struggle  for control, Adolfo maliciously saw that the situation could be  repeated in La Laguna, where Araujo was the natural leader.  Orive himself had bequeathed that influence to him, just as he  did with Anaya in Monterrey, but his disciples turned out to be  cheeky. The fact is that Orive maneuvered to get Araujo to go to  the Huasteca Potosina [the San Luis Potosi State portion of the  Huasteca region]."    Araujo got to the region in early 1977, shortly after being  released from prison in Saltillo, where he had been held for two  months on orders from Governor Oscar Flores Tapia. "He arrived  in the Huasteca Potosina with a lot of backing. His political  contacts were very obvious by then, most notably with Raul  Salinas de Gortari. The so-called Land and Liberty Camp was  founded there, comprising a lot of ejidos near Ciudad Valles.  Some of us brigade members settled in the Mezquital Valley, more  or less where the Huasteca Potosina and Hidalguense meet. It was  very difficult work, in communities as backward as the ones in  Chiapas...and around which the army started building heliports  as a precaution."    Meanwhile, Acosta continues, "Orive settled in Chiapas,  where  he had been making contact with religious groups since 1974. He  lived there from 1978 to 1988. His presence has great  significance in the region, given its characteristics. Suffice  it to say that in 1988 he organized an assembly at which some  2,500 Indians got together to discuss their problems. But I  doubt whether Orive planted the ideological seed for the  guerrilla war that has now erupted. He is very cool towards such  things. What could have happened is that some of his people  broke off and became radicalized, just like what happened with  the network of catechizers that outstripped Bishop Samuel Ruiz."    Anaya: "The self-styled Proletarian Line, headed by Orive,  worked in Chiapas to build social support bases by organizing  the indigenous peasants economically and socially. He never  proposed the armed struggle as a solution. He sought to combat  the caciques and great estates and fought to start solving  problems with the Chiapas governments, which at least over the  past 15 years have been characterized by authoritarianism,  political narrow-mindedness, and intolerance."    Camero concludes: "It would be going too far to say that  Popular Line planted the ideological seed of the Chiapas  guerrilla war. At least not its leaders, although some of its  people may have split off and become radicalized. But I do not  think it was people like Orive and Araujo. They showed their  true faces a long time ago when they joined right in with the  State apparatus. There is a reason why they are together in the  CNC, to which in one way or another they were always linked,  probably as part of a project that Echeverria started and the  Salinas brothers later picked up again."</p>

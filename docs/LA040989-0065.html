			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 117 ARRESTED IN S.D. ABORTION DEMONSTRATION  </P> <P> More than 100 anti-abortion protesters were arrested by police Saturday after  they temporarily closed access to the office of a Hillcrest doctor who performs  abortions.  </P> <P> Police, who had warning of the demonstration, sent more than 100 officers to  surround the building that houses the Third Avenue offices of Dr. Donald G.  Byrnes. By the end of the protest, 117 people associated with Project Rescue  had been arrested -- 109 on misdemeanor charges and 8 on suspicion of felony  conspiracy.  </P> <P> Just after anti-abortionists blocked the three entrances of the complex shortly  after 8 a.m., police arrested those they identified as the protest's leaders.  Will Lehman -- founder of Project Rescue, San Diego's version of the national  anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue -- was among the first arrested.  </P> <P> Over the next two hours, protesters sang, prayed and read Scripture while  police cordoned off the building around them. Around 10 a.m., several paddy  wagons arrived and officers began to arrest the protesters -- many of whom went  limp when police confronted them -- by either dragging or leading them to the  vehicles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Roughness Claimed  </P> <P> Three hours after the demonstration began, police had cleared the entrances to  the building, but not before some protesters claimed they had been roughly  treated.  </P> <P> Lehman, who was taken to San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, said  from the hospital that he momentarily passed out after a chokehold and inhaled  his vomit when he began to throw up in the police car. He said he also suffered  from back and neck pain as a result of his arrest. A hospital spokeswoman said  Saturday night that Lehman had been treated and released.  </P> <P> Mick McCoy, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in El Cajon, said  Saturday night that "We were saddened over the use of excessive force in the  arrests. Pain and personal injury were inflicted upon peaceful, nonviolent  citizens who were not resisting arrest."  </P> <P> McCoy argued that even some of those who complied with officers' orders were  treated badly. "In fact, many that were walking as ordered continued to have  pain-compliance holds used even after they were already injured," he said.  McCoy said five demonstrators went to area hospitals with wrist and arm  injuries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defended Tactics  </P> <P> But police spokesman Dave Cohen defended the tactics, saying officers used  "pain compliance" measures to get the blockade of anti-abortionists to move.  </P> <P> "You get somebody to move by applying pressure at the right spot," he said.  "It's extremely painful, and it's taught . . . as a pain-compliance point.  There is no permanent damage but, yes, it's painful."  </P> <P> Pro-choice advocates applauded the way police handled the situation.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased," said Betty Wheeler, legal director for the American Civil  Liberties Union Foundation for San Diego and Imperial Counties. "Police  response was very effective and very prompt. Some patients were in before  (Project Rescue) arrived, the police were able to get the other patients in by  10 o'clock, and that's what's important. They (Project Rescue) have to chalk  this up as a complete failure."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eve of March  </P> <P> The demonstration came on the eve of a march today in Washington billed as the  largest demonstration ever in favor of abortion rights. Thousands of pro-choice  activists, including Hollywood stars, have descended on the capital.  </P> <P> Saturday's protest came after a series of larger ones in Orange and Los Angeles  counties two weeks ago that climaxed March 25 with the arrests of more than 700  anti-abortion activists blockading a Los Angeles clinic. Three weeks ago  Project Rescue demonstrated in front of a doctor's office in Escondido, but  police there made no arrests.  </P> <P> Cohen said that the vast majority of the protesters Saturday will face  misdemeanor trespassing and illegal assembly charges but that eight were  arrested in connection with conspiracy. Felony charges can be brought for  conspiracy against anyone who urges people to break the law, Cohen said.  </P> <P> "We're not in any way taking sides, but if they are keeping people from getting  in, that is a violation of the law," he said, adding that Lehman will be  charged in connection with felony conspiracy for his role in the demonstration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Willing to Go to Jail  </P> <P> Project Rescue participants have expressed their willingness to go to jail in  their crusade to "rescue" unborn children. Operation Rescue counts about 23,000  sympathizers who have been arrested for similar actions across the country.  </P> <P> The number of demonstrators Saturday was significantly lower than the more than  300 that shut down the office of Dr. Ying Chen on March 18 in Escondido.  Nevertheless, the protesters said they were determined to block the office for  as long as they could.  </P> <P> "We always could use more, but we're thankful for the ones who are here," said  Sylvia Sullivan, spokeswoman for Saturday's protest. "It only takes a few to  block the door," she said shortly before her arrest.  </P> <P> From inside his office, Donald Byrnes, who runs the O-B Medical Group at 3330  Third Ave., said that to him, the protest was "incredible."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Middle-Aged Men  </P> <P> "Most of the pro-life people happen to be middle-aged men who should have  nothing to do with a woman's choice," he said. "They don't want to take care of  (the children). So what happens? The child becomes a millstone around society's  neck."  </P> <P> Byrnes said that his office is not usually open on Saturdays, but within the  past year he has occasionally been open. "We're not going to be dissuaded;  we're not doing anything here that we're ashamed of. . . . Nobody enjoys  undergoing an abortion, but it's important that women be able to have that  choice," he said.  </P> <P> By the time the protesters arrived at the office about 8 a.m., employees and  seven patients had already entered the building, said Betty Dempsey, an  administrator of the office and wife of Byrnes.  </P> <P> "They got here by 7:30 a.m.," Dempsey said. "We were fully aware that this  might happen." She added that some of the 24 patients scheduled for  appointments Saturday called and said they would reschedule. Not all of the  patients were scheduled for abortions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ready for Protest  </P> <P> Laura Byrnes, 23, daughter of Donald Byrnes, said that her father was ready for  the protesters.  </P> <P> "We knew all about this. They were here obviously during the week. I noticed a  man in a truck who looked like he was a building inspector or something and I  didn't think anything of it, until he drove away and I saw a bumper sticker  that said, 'Abortion is murder.' "  </P> <P> "Certainly they have a right to be here. They think they are protecting the  rights of children, but the same rights that allow them to be here are the same  rights that allow abortion. . . . If you limit a woman's rights to do what she  wants with her body, where does it stop? Individuals are the only ones who know  what's right for them," Laura Byrnes said.  </P> <P> Anti-abortionists weren't the only ones demonstrating in front of the building  Saturday. Across the street from where anti-abortionists were peacefully  congregating, pro-choice advocates chanted slogans such as, "Hey, hey, ho, ho;  Project Rescue has got to go," and "No more coat hangers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Screamed  </P> <P> One by one, protesters were arrested, some screaming and complaining of pain.  </P> <P> "You are proving nothing," one officer told a protester as he held a handful of  his hair. Police repeatedly told protesters, many of whom went limp before  being arrested, "Stand up and walk and it won't hurt. The pain goes away if you  stand up."  </P> <P> In Byrne's waiting room, two anti-abortionists, who had scheduled a phony  abortion with Byrne, talked with patients about their decision until Dempsey  ordered them out of the office. "You have no business talking to our patients,"  she said.  </P> <P> Kathy Mullen, a Project Rescue participant, told the patients before she left,  "This is a decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your life. These  are real babies."  </P> <P> Outside the office, Mullen, a single mother, said that the women weren't given  options they need to be able to make a reasonable decision.  </P> <P> "They need to be told what they're doing. Five to 10 years from now, they'll  suffer from post-abortion depression," she said. "I've been on both sides. I've  been told I couldn't have a child. 'How would I take care of him?' they said.  But I have been able to. So it's postponed my life a little; I just don't  believe there's such a thing as an unwanted child."  </P></p>

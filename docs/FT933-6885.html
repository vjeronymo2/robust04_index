			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Anti-intervention argument is weak Sir, Michael Prowse's main argument against President Bill Clinton's redistributive budget ('The case against redistribution', August 16) is as fallacious as it is familiar. Mr Prowse assumes that an individual's pre-tax income is some sort of personal creation, a gift from God or nature. Only taxes or benefits represent a 'political intervention'. He can only see politics at work when it threatens the status quo, not when it preserves it. Instead of lauding the rich for shouldering such a large share of the US tax burden, Mr Prowse might consider why they are rich in the first place. Also, he ought to ask why it is that one of the hardest and most important jobs in society, bringing up children, is done by people who are among the poorest. The fact is that incomes from employment - not to mention earnings from property - are profoundly shaped by inequalities in power. Few, even of the most liberal economists, would pretend that economic theory can even begin to explain it. Supply and demand schedules rest on social inequalities. The truth is that politics is already inscribed in the so-called 'initial' distribution of income. Income is indeed a 'distribution' and the unfashionable cake metaphor is not completely inappropriate. Governments cannot but be implicated in the way the cake is divided. Employment legislation (or the lack of it) underwrites the way a few select among the many. Education and welfare policies allocate access to the game. Property rights guarantee the power to receive income from others long after you have ceased to do any work. Governments are already there, ratifying the way the market is rigged one way or another. All that Mr Prowse really has to say is that they should do it his way, favouring those who are already lucky (scribbling apologias, I imagine, is quite nicely paid). To question the distribution of income and to try to tinker with it is, apparently, to commit the archaic sin of plotting a bit of 'social engineering'. But there is an awful lot of engineering going on all the time. Mr Prowse's inability to see this, and his delirious idea that politics lives in some separate domain inhabited by unreasonable types, is pure ideology. There is a lot of it about.

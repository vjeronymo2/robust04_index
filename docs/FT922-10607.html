			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Reuters launches foreign exchange dealing system REUTERS' long-awaited foreign exchange dealing system, Dealing 2000-2, was finally launched yesterday, although with fewer banks ready to participate than had been planned. The UK-based information group said yesterday that 18 banks were ready to use terminals in 22 sites in London and New York. Coming after a lengthy development process and a hefty, though undisclosed, investment, the launch puts Reuters ahead of two rival groups which plan to launch similar products in the coming months. One bank using the system said yesterday it had experienced no problems, and had completed a number of transactions. 'It's going well. We're trading on it,' a dealer said. However, several banks were not ready for yesterday's launch. The IRA bomb that devastated the St Mary Axe area of the City of London this month has prevented some banks from joining the system at the beginning, while delays in installing lines to some US banks had also kept others away. Also, a dealer in one London dealing room said his bank had been unable to start trading since internal technical developments had not been completed. Reuters said, though, that the 18 banks ready on day one represented a successful launch. 'The more people who are using it, the better it will be. But we wouldn't have launched it if we didn't think there were enough banks ready,' a spokesman said. The system initially allows banks to trade three currencies against the Dollars - D-Marks, sterling and yen.</p>

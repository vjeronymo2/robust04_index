			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LESS TRASH  </P> <P> I have just recently returned from a camping trip in Anzo Borrego State Park  and I am happy to say that for the first time in many years I have not had to  pick up the trash of other careless campers. Usually when I go I bring a trash  bag for my own refuse and another one for the garbage that other people have  left behind.  </P> <P> I take it as a good sign that people are finally becoming aware of how delicate  nature is and that we should live with nature, in harmony, and not against it.  </P> <P> PAUL JURGENS  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

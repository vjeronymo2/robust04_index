			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Rabin pledges to complete work on settlement units THE concession made by President George Bush to secure this week's rapprochement with Israel became clearer yesterday when Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, returned home boasting of the extent of settlement building in occupied Arab territories despite US conditions for Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees. At a press conference at Tel Aviv airport, Mr Rabin said: 'I don't know what you mean when you talk about freezing settlements if one talks about continued building on 11,000 housing units in the territories.' All that had been cancelled, he said, were some 6,000-7,000 units on which work had not started and anyway had no 'practical possibility' of being built. Mr Rabin added that even with the cancellation of those units he had never known such an intense period of settlement building activity. The Palestinians and other Arab delegations have demanded a total freeze on settlements as a pre-condition for progress at the peace talks due to resume in Washington in just over a week. Mr Rabin's boasts that he secured the loan guarantees despite intense settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza, together with the departure of Mr James Baker from the State Department, seem certain to increase Arab suspicions about US priorities and its intentions towards the peace process. The US had refused to grant the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, defeated in the June elections, the Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees until it halted building settlements which the administration said were a major obstacle to the Middle East peace process. However, this week Mr Bush urged Congress to approve the loan guarantees, apparently as a result of Mr Rabin's pledge not to build more settlements beyond those already under construction. The reconciliation between the US and Israel was presented as a foreign policy triumph for Mr Bush in his uphill battle to win re-election. Neither the US nor Israel has yet made public the details of the agreement, a key element of which may be the amount the US will deduct from the loan guarantees if Israel completes the 11,000 units said to be already under construction. Under a compromise formula discussed with the Shamir government the US planned to deduct the entire cost of the new settlements from the loan guarantees. Mr Rabin made no mention of this yesterday.</p>

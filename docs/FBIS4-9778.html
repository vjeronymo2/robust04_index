			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded; all speakers </F> unidentified]    [Text] In the midst of the potato harvest, an intense and  comprehensive system aimed at preventing misappropriation of  agricultural products is being implemented in Havana City  Province as well as in Havana Province. Thus, a source of  profiteering is on the decline in both provinces, or at least  that is the expected end result. This is the result of an  experiment that began in early March, with Operation  Agriculture-94 [Agro-94].    [First speaker] "We stop them here. If they are carrying too  many products, we confiscate the products and then fill out a  confiscation form and send the products back to the units."    Local authorities affirm that in Guira de Melena alone, 109  quintals of agricultural products were confiscated between  January and March, products that allegedly would have ended up  on the black market. So far, 623 people have been arrested.    [Second speaker] "Several checkpoints were set up along the  access roads to the city as well as measures implemented at  distribution centers and grocery stores in Havana, which allow  the authorities of the different organizations in both provinces  involved in this campaign to work jointly."    Someone said: If we do not do something, all Guira de Melena  is going to be moved into Havana. In any case, this provincial  traffic unit official affirms that these measures are not  excessive.    [Third speaker] "Any individual citizen can come and solve  his immediate problem with a stalk of plantains or a little bit  of malanga for home consumption. What we confiscate here are the  large quantities seized from people from Havana who come, buy  from the farmers, and resell the produce on the black market.    "I wanted to clarify this. People are saying that we  confiscate even a bag with three potatoes in it at the  checkpoints. That is not true".    It seems the problem is abating: The flood of bags of  agricultural products transported via bicycles, trucks, and cars  [words indistinct]. This experiment can serve as an example for  the rest of the country.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / C&amp;G bars new deposits as it mulls over ruling The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday closed its doors to new customer deposits in the wake of the High Court ruling barring the terms of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash bid. In what it said was a short-term measure to prevent people in ignorance attempting to make a speculative gain from the Lloyds offer, it barred any new customers depositing money in any of its four investment accounts. It said last night it would not allow new deposits for a few days while it examined the court's decision and to prevent people 'chasing a fast buck on the wrong basis'. The court ruling would not in fact allow new depositors to take advantage of the Lloyds offer, but the building society believed that some might interpret the judgment in this way. The action came as Lloyds and C&amp;G executives and advisers met to consider ways of restructuring the offer to bring it within the ruling by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor. They may also appeal. Sir Donald ruled on Tuesday that Lloyds could not make cash payments to more than 220,000 C&amp;G investors who had been shareholding members of the society for less than two years. This would make it hard to achieve the necessary majority in favour of the deal. Lloyds and C&amp;G could instead offer preference shares to all 1.2m C&amp;G shareholders and borrowers, or offer such shares to new members. They are unlikely to be allowed to offer shares that could be immediately sold. Lloyds said yesterday that the two groups were unlikely to make an early decision, and could delay a statement until next week. Lloyds' share price closed 5p down at 566p. Mr Donald Kirkham, Building Societies Association chairman, said the association welcomed the principle that 'you cannot join a society one moment and then share in the whole value of it the next'.

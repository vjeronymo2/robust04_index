			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Young may bid in coal sell-off YOUNG GROUP, the private UK coal mining company, may bid for part of British Coal when it is privatised next year. Mr Joseph Stevenson, formerly chief executive of Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, has been appointed director and non-executive chairman of the company, replacing Mr Bob Young, chairman and chief executive. Mr Young, who agreed to leave earlier this year when the company restructured its finances to avoid financial collapse, set up the company as a family business but had no other private-sector experience. Young Group, one of a handful of privately owned UK coal mining companies, has always been tipped as a possible bidder for part of British Coal. The company had a profit after tax of Pounds 283,000 on a turnover of Pounds 41.5m in the year ending November 30 1991.</p>

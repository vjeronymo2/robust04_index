Jordan, which emphasized its commitment to the international  legitimacy and Security Council resolutions, and which  implemented them as part of international law, should not pay a  heavy price for such a commitment and for its respect for the  international resolutions and UN Charter.    Jordan has suffered a lot. It has endured the results of  major developments in the Middle East more than any other party.  This has substantially harmed its economy, and its limited  capabilities have been overburdened. This situation has  obstructed its economic, development, and social plans.    Since Jordan is geographically in a central location, and  since it depends on transport, transit, a free market, and the  Gulf of Aqaba, and because several projects depend mainly on the  Iraqi market, the imposition of an embargo on Iraq, together  with Jordan's commitment to implementing Resolution 661, has  caused Jordan losses of $300 million annually. This does not  include the losses caused by the siege imposed on al-'Aqabah  port; that is to say the inspection and diversion of ships.  This situation has adverse effects on Jordanian citizens and  Jordanian trade in general.    Jordan's firm commitment to peace in the Middle East, and  its  efforts to reach a just and comprehensive peace in the region at  the same time it is eagerly trying to establish democracy and  human rights should urge the international community,  represented by the Security Council and the international  organization, to support this effort and entrench the concept of  justice in applying the resolutions of the international  legitimacy and the UN Charter.    The prime minister presented the Security Council's  sanctions  committee with documents containing facts and figures on  Jordan's losses resulting from the implementation of Resolution  661 and its commitment to this resolution. The sanctions  committee and the influential states in the international  organization should respond to these fair Jordanian demands  because we should not be rewarded for our commitment and  implementation of the international legitimacy and its  resolutions with more losses, pressures, and frustration.</p>

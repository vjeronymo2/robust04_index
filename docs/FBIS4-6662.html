			<p>BFN     [Text] In its front-page story in the 19 April evening  edition, SANKEI SHIMBUN reported that President Clinton and  other U.S. officials have made remarks suggesting "there are  pro-North Korean forces within the ruling coalition parties."  On 19 April, a top government official denied the remarks as  groundless, saying: "We have let officials check whether remarks  have been made to that effect, but at the end of the check no  such remarks were found to have been made."    The front-page article cited the testimony of a source  familiar with Japan-U.S. relations, the Japan-U.S. summit  between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa in February, and the talks held between Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Vice President Al Gore in  Marrakech, Morocco, on 14 April during the ministerial talks of  the Uruguay Round. According to the testimony, during the  Japan-U.S. summit, President Clinton pointed out to Prime  Minister Hosokawa that a political party which maintains a close  relationship with North Korea is positioned at "the center of  the government." Clinton then asked the prime minister whether  Japan would be able to enforce economic sanctions against North  Korea. Also, Vice President Gore candidly told Foreign Minister  Hata that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is  believed to have friendly ties with North Korea. Gore said he  was wondering if Tokyo could really accept economic sanctions  against North Korea as long as the SDPJ participated in the  coalition government.</p>

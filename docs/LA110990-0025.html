			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HONK IF YOU VOTED FOR POWAY'S SNESKO  </P> <P> On a busy Poway street corner Thursday, B. Tony Snesko was waving a sign and  savoring the fruits of victory. His sign said simply: "Thank you."  </P> <P> The sound of motorists' horns honking a hello sounded like trumpets to him and  the waving shouts of passers-by were music to his ears. He let out a hearty  "har, har, har" reminiscent of St. Nicholas and waved his thank-you sign in  response.  </P> <P> Snesko, 44, a self-proclaimed born-again Christian and anti-abortionist, tossed  his 10-gallon hat in the ring for a Poway City Council seat last summer and  devoted all of his time and energy, and a little bit of money, to his first  political campaign.  </P> <P> For weeks, Snesko rose before dawn and was out on one of Poway's busy streets  by 5:30 each morning, setting out his rhyming Burma Shave-style signs, then  positioning himself in a prominent place to wave a poster urging people to  "Vote for Tony Snesko."  </P> <P> "Sometimes I'd take four hours off in the middle of the day to attend to other  campaign matters," he confessed. "But I was out there every day on the street,  dawn to dusk."  </P> <P> He used his Burma Shave signs to sum up the issues. One of his favorites:  "Traffic bad?" "Development, too?" "Promises broken" "Got you blue?" "Vote Tony  Snesko."  </P> <P> Why did he take to the streets to get his campaign message across? Because  Poway is a commuter community, and Snesko knew he could get more name and face  recognition on one of the three main streets than he could knocking on doors.  </P> <P> Mayor-elect Jan Goldsmith paid him an oblique compliment after the election:  "The face of politics in Poway has been changed forever," Goldsmith said of  Snesko's cowboy attire and street-corner campaigning.  </P> <P> Traffic congestion, Poway's main gripe, was Snesko's main campaign theme. He  started off in July by announcing his candidacy for Poway City Council in front  of the barricades placed across a popular Poway "shortcut" to San Diego --  Pomerado Road -- and blasting incumbent council members for "taking a  wait-and-see attitude toward problems of growth, traffic, the city's youth and  housing for the elderly." He criticized the council for not filing suit against  San Diego City Council to force reopening of Pomerado Road.  </P> <P> After his unexpected victory in Tuesday's election, Snesko was back on his  street corner, this time with his thank-you sign.  </P> <P> "When I was out early this morning it was so cold that the breeze from the  passing cars brought tears to my eyes, which froze on my cheeks," he said, "but  I had to say thank you to my friends who voted for me."  </P></p>

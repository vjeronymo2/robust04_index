			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: BASF plans to cut workforce by 2,400 BASF, one of Germany's top three chemical companies is planning to cut its workforce by a further 2,400 people next year, according to members of the works council. The cuts, which follow 2,000 this year, will bring the payroll down to 45,000 people. The company aims to manage the reductions by natural wastage, early retirement and non-renewal of short-term contracts. The group, due to unveil its nine-month results in Ludwigshafen tomorrow, closely followed by figures from rivals Hoechst and Bayer, recently announced it was to reduce its employees' annual bonuses. A cut in this annual payment last year was accompanied by a DM1 reduction in the dividend to DM12. German analysts have suggested that all three industry leaders will cut their dividends again this year. BASF's half-year figures, published in August, showed profits down 37 per cent at DM972m (Dollars 607.5m), while Hoechst and Bayer fared a little better with earnings reductions of 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. There have since been no signs of any recovery in international chemicals markets and the German industrial climate has deteriorated since the middle of the year. According to recent forecasts from the chemicals industry association, overall sector profits are set to fall 30 per cent this year. BASF and its competitors are expected to confirm the job losses and other cost-cutting measures when they release their results in the next few days. It is normal practice for such moves to be confirmed before announcement by works councils comprising senior management and employee representatives.</p>

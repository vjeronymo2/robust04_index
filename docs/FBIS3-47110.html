Armed with Molotov bombs and metal weapons, the local  fishermen aboard some 30 to 45 motor boats Friday attacked  several Thai boats operating in the waters off the west coast of  Aceh, the source said.    "Several Thai fishermen were injured, but there were no  casualties," the source said.    Deputy Police Chief Major Wahid confirmed the report.    A fisherman blamed the attack on the marine authorities for  their alleged lack of response to reports in the last six months  that an increasing number of Thai boats have been operating in  Indonesian territorial waters.    The fisherman alleged that Indonesian Navy officials based  in  Sabang had protected the Thai fishermen.    The fisherman quoted a Navy official as saying that "the  Thai  fishermen have the permit to fish around the waters of the  exclusive economic zone."    But the fisherman said that "in fact, they fish only two  miles from the coast, using trawls, which have been banned by  the government," the fisherman said.    Sabang Navy Base Commander Lieutenant Colonel Azmi Idris  told  AFP that the Thai fishermen were cooperating with the navy.    However, Indonesian marine patrols last month nabbed Thai  fishing crews for alleged illegal fishing about 360 kilometers  (223 miles) off Aceh.    The Thai fishermen held three Indonesian policemen hostage  for five hours following the arrest of their colleagues.    They demanded to exchange the three police officers for the  16 Thai fishing boat crews the police had arrested earlier.    The three policemen were released after an exchange of fire  between the Thai fishermen and a police team specially deployed  to free the hostages.    Reports also said that Indonesian fishermen in Aceh had been  repeatedly shot at by Thai fishing boats armed with modern  fishing equipment.</p>

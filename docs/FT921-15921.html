			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Boom] Crash] Popcorn whizz bangs pan - Ken Lewis, Nicholas Saphir and Butterkist MR NICHOLAS Saphir has lost his taste for popcorn. That innocuous confection brings back bad memories to the chairman of Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce and herbs and spices group. Just two weeks ago, Hunter Saphir sold Butterkist, the toffee popcorn manufacturer, for Pounds 2.9m to privately-held Portfolio Foods. The sale was completed only four years after Hunter bought Butterkist for Pounds 19m in cash and shares - although the actual cost to the company was closer to Pounds 12m, according to Mr Saphir. The sale to Portfolio - and the resultant loss of more than 100 jobs - has aroused the anger of shareholder and former Butterkist owner, Mr Ken Lewis. Mr Lewis, who became a multi-millionaire as a result of the sale to Hunter at a price which he himself agrees was too high, claims the business is worth up to Pounds 5m. Mr Saphir, for his part, maintains that the company got the best price in the shortest amount of time possible for a loss-making business. 'The offer was very quickly on the table,' he says. Yet it is believed that Portfolio was offered an exclusive opportunity to bid for Butterkist. The only sure thing appears to be Portfolio's acquisition of more than 80 per cent of the butter toffee popcorn market. The Office of Fair Trading said yesterday it was reviewing the deal, although there was some confusion as to how candycorn should be classified - as popcorn or as confectionery. Butterkist's history and the passions which surround it are as volatile as the popcorn itself. Under Mr Lewis' stewardship Butterkist more than trebled its profits in two years. Within a similar period, he says, Hunter let the business run down. When Hunter sold Butterkist, the business was losing up to Pounds 50,000 a month. But Hunter says its biggest mistake was to agree an unfavourable earn-out on the purchase and a deal whereby Mr Lewis had complete control of marketing and distribution. Mr Lewis took over Butterkist through a Pounds 3m management buy-out in 1986. Then, as in recent years, the popcorn industry was in the throes of a fierce price war. When he sold the business in 1987 to Hunter Saphir, Butterkist was making annual profits of Pounds 595,000. The deal agreed by Hunter included a Pounds 6.3m acquisition price, backed up by a two-year earn-out - 4.5 times any profit above Pounds 595,000. Within a year, Butterkist was making profits of Pounds 1.5m. The following year, it reported more than Pounds 2m. 'We were pleasantly surprised and a little concerned,' says Mr Saphir. 'We didn't expect profits to climb as fast as they did.' How Mr Lewis achieved these profits is up for debate, but it would appear that Butterkist moved into supermarkets, which gave the operation a significant boost, and production was operating round-the-clock. Also, margins - at between 60 and 70 per cent gross, according to a rival popcorn manufacturer - were much higher than was common in the Pounds 25m-per-year candycorn market. Mr Lewis was also well-known in the industry. The former managing director of Butterkist began at the popcorn factory more than 25 years ago as a truck driver. A leading manufacturer says he was a popular figure who inspired considerable customer loyalty. Loyalty will only go so far, however, and is significantly curtailed when it dents the purse. Butterkist's high margin was a golden opportunity for Bard Brothers, a subsidiary of Portfolio Foods, to take business. By 1990, the rival popcorn manufacturer had moved aggressively into the market, slashing prices and sparking a war in which Butterkist was seriously wounded. After Mr Lewis left, Hunter backed the brand through television advertising, introducing novelty products such as Teenage Mutant Ninja popcorn, and increasing capacity for the expected market growth. Margins were also gradually reduced, although they were still higher on average. Something went seriously wrong, however: the expected growth never appeared. The extra capacity lay dormant and Butterkist began to go stale. Bard had snapped up 40 per cent of the market by last year and claims it was on target for more than 50 per cent, before buying Butterkist. By the middle of 1991 Hunter was carrying a business laden with over-capacity and plunging margins. To make matters worse, the rest of the group was under pressure. A takeover approach - believed to be from Dalgety  -collapsed, and the group had just completed an expensive refinancing. So, without the management resources or will to tackle Butterkist's problems, the business was sold. Mr Saphir says the experience has taught him some tough lessons: 'It was a painful saga.' Painful not only for Hunter, but also its shareholders. These include Mr Lewis who has seen part of his profit on the original sale - 400,000 Hunter shares - fall in value from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 204,000.</p>

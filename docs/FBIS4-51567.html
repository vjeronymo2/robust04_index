			<p>BFN     [Text] BAVEL, Cambodia, May 1 (AFP) -- Foreigners taking  part in a peace march which was attacked by Khmer Rouge [KR]  guerrillas in northwest Cambodia were briefly detained by the  guerrillas and then released safe and unharmed, one of the  foreigners said Sunday. A group of six foreigners was detained  by the guerrillas along with Cambodian marchers for several  hours Saturday, Liz Bernstien said.    The group was marched into the forest where they met a  guerrilla commander who later said they were free to go and told  a Cambodian marcher to guide them back to the peacewalk.    The Khmer Rouge stole cameras watches and other valuables  but  released the group unharmed, she said.    Earlier Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk expressed sorrow  and  outrage over the Khmer Rouge attack on the march which left  three Buddhists dead as well as the foreigners and others  missing.    "I would like to express my condolences and sorrow to Maha  Ghosananda, the monks, laymen, compatriots and foreign  friends...who sacrificed to serve the ideals of peace, national  reconciliation, non-violence, and friendship through the  peaceful ways of our Lord Buddha," the king said in a statement.    A spokesperson for the march, known as the "Dhammayietra  Walk  for Peace" and organised by Cambodian spiritual leader Maha  Ghosananda, said one Buddhist monk, a nun and a layman were  killed and at least three other monks were injured in the  attack. Police in Battambang however reported that four people  had died in the attack.    King Sihanouk advised that the peace march be cancelled to  avoid "other accidents which could...happen again."    The marchers were attacked by Khmer Rouge guerrillas late  Saturday near Bavel district in Battambang province, the police  said. They were being escorted by government soldiers when the  guerrillas attacked with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled  grenades, a police officer in Battambang said.    An injured monk, one of three brought to Battambang  hospital,  told AFP that many people ran into the forest when the  guerrillas attacked. The guerrillas then robbed the marchers of  valuables, march spokeswoman Nou Sambo said.    King Sihanouk said in the statement that the Khmer Rouge  were  "responsible for this sad and tragic act," and asked them to  "cease their violent ways."    Some 1,000 marchers set out on 400 kilometer (250 mile) walk  from Battambang on April 24. Their route was to take them along  National Route 10 to the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, and  then on to the heavily mined and strife-torn regions of  northwestern Cambodia before ending at the temples of Angkor  Wat. But Maha Ghosananda decided to change the course Saturday  after heavy fighting between the government and Khmer Rouge  guerrillas blocked the march's progress along Route 10 and after  the radical faction refused to give a guarantee of safe passage.  Another spokeswoman for the march expressed her indignation at  the attack.    "How can the Khmer Rouge dare attack Buddhist monks like  that? When will our country ever have peace?," Kong Nary said  late Saturday. "When they attack the Dhammayietra, it's just  like they attack the nation," she said.    Maha Ghosananda, who has been labelled the "Gandhi of  Cambodia" and has been nominated for a Nobel peace prize, led  two previous walks through the militarily volatile provinces to  call for peace in Cambodia, one in 1991 and the other in the  run-up to the May 1993 UN-organised elections.    Bernstein, an American who lives here and works with Maha  Ghosananda, said the guerrillas opened fire on two government  soldiers who were walking in front of the peace march near  Kompong Pouy about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Battambang.  A monk and a nun were shot dead and six other people, including  four monks, were injured, Bernstein said. Other monks pleaded  with the government soldiers not to fire back.    A guerrilla leader later apologised and said his men didn't  intend to kill the monk and nun.    Around six other foreigners were on the march but were  further behind and were not stopped by the guerrillas.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> WANTED: A FULL-TIME MAYOR  </P> <P> When San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor announced in January -- one year into a  four-year term -- that she would not run for reelection, it appeared as if she  were abdicating her role as mayor. She tried to offset the considerable  liabilities of such a long lame-duck status by saying it would allow her to  work more freely for City Hall reforms.  </P> <P> But just eight months later, those reforms have gone nowhere. Last week, in a  sort-of midyear State of the City address, O'Connor said that the "San Diego  tradition of stability, civility and community" is being destroyed by a  "mindless smorgasbord of silliness."  </P> <P> Few who followed the recent redistricting fight would dispute that.  </P> <P> But we are troubled by O'Connor's response to the frustrations. Instead of  redoubling her efforts, she has decided to absent herself more often. The  ambitious international travel schedule she announced -- with trips to Japan,  Mexico, France and New York City by the end of the year -- is likely to  exacerbate the instability.  </P> <P> If abdication was too strong a word in January, it isn't now.  </P> <P> Ironically, stability was what O'Connor originally promised to bring to City  Hall, which had been plagued by scandals and the felony convictions of former  Mayor Roger Hedgecock.  </P> <P> But O'Connor has had trouble providing the leadership to sustain the initial  stability she brought to the office.  </P> <P> Instead of building coalitions, she turned her attention to the Soviet arts  festival.  </P> <P> If O'Connor's attentions are concentrated on international goals to the extent  they were on the arts festival, there will be little time for the  responsibilities she was elected to carry out.  </P> <P> O'Connor deserves credit for her personal diplomacy skills. And if she is able  to use them to move along the idea of a binational airport, the whole San Diego  region will benefit. But however meritorious her international agenda is for  San Diego's economic future, the city needs a full-time mayor.  </P></p>

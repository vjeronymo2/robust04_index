			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> WILANDER LOSES, AND LENDL TRIES FOR NO. 1  </P> <P> After just 2 matches, Mats Wilander is gone from the Australian Open, but his  No. 1 ranking may not be going anywhere.  </P> <P> Wilander's sudden and shocking departure from the year's first Grand Slam, the  result of a straight-set loss early Thursday evening to Ramesh Krishnan of  India, sent the rest of the top men's singles players elbowing each other to  replace him as defending champion.  </P> <P> But Wilander, who lost to Krishnan, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), may keep his No. 1  ranking after all. There is only one player who can replace him: Ivan Lendl.  </P> <P> Lendl can become No. 1 again in the near future, but only if he wins the  Australian Open, which would give him enough points to move ahead of Wilander  in the computer rankings.  </P> <P> Lendl won his second-round match Friday morning, defeating Carl-Uwe Steeb, 6-2,  2-6, 6-0, 6-3.  </P> <P> On the women's side, top-seeded Steffi Graf breezed through a 47-minute, 6-0,  6-1 victory over Marianne Werdel.  </P> <P> Wilander, who fought off 3 match points before finally losing, had a simple  explanation for what went wrong: "I just played terrible."  </P> <P> After being forced to go 5 sets before winning his first-round match, Wilander  knew he was far from the top of his game.  </P> <P> "I guess I came into the match in a bad way," he said. "I don't know. To me,  it's just been difficult to motivate myself after the U.S. Open because that,  for me, was such a big thing."  </P> <P> Since his success at the Open, when he replaced Lendl as No. 1 in the world,  Wilander has fallen upon hard times. He was an early loser in the Nabisco  Masters and then was a shocking loser to West German Steeb in the Davis Cup  final.  </P> <P> Wilander lost in 5 sets after being up 2 sets and a break.  </P> <P> Now, after his latest disappointment, Wilander said he is going to consider  taking a break from tennis. He said the last time he had such a concentration  lapse, he tried something different.  </P> <P> "That was in 1986 and that was from playing bad," he said. "This is from  playing good, I guess. Then, I took time off and got married. I'm already  married, so I can't do that again."  </P> <P> Unexpected as Wilander's defeat might have been, it was not the first time a  defending champion or top-seeded player lost in the second round of a Grand  Slam.  </P> <P> It last occurred in 1987, when top-seeded and defending champion Boris Becker  lost in the second round at Wimbledon to Peter Doohan.  </P> <P> Krishnan said of Wilander: "This is probably the worst I've seen him play."  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, seeded No. 4, turned in another strong performance and won his  second-round match Friday, defeating Heiner Moraing of West Germany, 6-4, 7-5,  7-5.  </P> <P> Other men's singles winners in early matches Friday were Johan Kriek, Darren  Cahill, Thomas Muster and Amos Mansdorf.  </P> <P> They advance to the third round with Becker and Miloslav Mecir, who won matches  Thursday.  </P> <P> Helena Sukova and Hana Mandlikova won their matches Thursday, as did Martina  Navratilova, who defeated Jenny Byrne, 6-4, 7-6. Pam Shriver moved to the third  round with a difficult 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Sarah Loosemore.  </P></p>

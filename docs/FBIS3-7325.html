			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Ramos prior his departure for </F> Vietnam at Ninoy International Airport in Manila on 28 March --  recorded; passages within slantlines in Tagalog]    [Text] At the gracious invitation of President Le Duc Anh  of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, I leave today on a  three-day official visit to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with a  small official delegation. Accompanying us are four members of  my cabinet, three senators and two congressmen, the president of  the University of the Philippines, and a business delegation of  our most prominent industrialists and traders.    This trip reciprocates Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to  our country three years ago. I regard this visit as one of the  most significant I have made. Vietnam is one of our closest  neighbors. It is less than two hours away across the South  China Sea. Our two countries are alike in terrain, area,  natural resources, and population. Our cultural connections  date back at least a thousand years, and our struggles against  colonialism and foreign conquest were inspired by the same  ideals of freedom and national independence. But in the course  of history, we adopted different ideological systems for  organizing our national societies. The Cold War and the  Indo-China [words indistinct] raised even greater barriers  between our two countries. Today, mutual goodwill between our  two countries have brought down those barriers. Our paths  converge again on the road to self-sustaining economic growth,  and our two countries today seek national security and regional  stability, neither in military alliances nor in accumulating  weapons but in friendly consultation and economic cooperation  with neighbor countries.    With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, our  country has a shared destiny. We have found that there is no  alternative to peace and economic cooperation among us in this  region. Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become  one of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force  in the regional balance of power. Its incorporation in the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, is an imperative  of Southeast Asian peace, security, and prosperity. In Manila  in July 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty of the ASEAN  States, which binds iis signatories to settle regional disputes  peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a matter  no longer of policy or principle, but merely of time and  procedure. Even now, Vietnam already takes part in a wide range  of ASEAN cooperative activities. For instance, it is a part of  the ASEAN Regional Forum, to which ASEAN and friendly outside  powers consult on regional security.    The Philippines took the initiative of wholeheartedly  supporting Vietnam's membership in ASEAN and its associated  institutions. We have also consistently supported Vietnam's  efforts to re-establish normal relations with the global  community and to secure membership in international financial  and political organizations. Philippine-Vietnamese relations  are a critical force for the solidarity of Southeast Asia and  consequently for peace and progress of the Asia- Pacific region.  I am confident that this visit, the first by a Philippine  president to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, will advance  this relations substantially.    The facets of our bilateral relationships are many and  increasing. There are, therefore, important things for my  delegation to discuss with Vietnam's leaders. There is the  security of East Asia and the Pacific. Its present status can  now be enhanced cooperatively by the nations of the region. I  shall be exploring avenues of possible cooperation between our  two countries in seeking a breakthrough to the multiple  competing claims to the Spratlys archipelago in the South China  Sea. Perhaps a joint venture in marine research of the islands  related to ocean research, weather forecasting, and  environmental protection, and participated by all the claimants,  for a start of the confidence-building mechanisms that we need  to settle these claims for our mutual benefit. [sentence as  heard] There are other creative proposals that I intend to  discuss with our Vietnamese neighbors. Then, there is the new  thrust in economic cooperation which ASEAN has undertaken.  Through the ASEAN Free Trade Area or AFTA, to which a talented  and hardworking Vietnamese people have a great deal to  contribute.    I look forward to inform the leaders of Vietnam of the  political consolidation and economic reforms that we are  undertaking in our country and the results these measures have  so far achieved in our overall effort to open our economy to  market forces and to global competition. In turn, I hope to  learn from them the workings of their own economic renovation or  doi moi which has made Vietnam one of the fastest growing  economies in the world this past seven years. The lifting of  the American trade embargo last month and the American  investment it is expected to bring should both speed up the pace  and broaden the scope of its economic growth. The increasingly  favorable economic situation in Vietnam should also make it  easier for our two countries to find a durable solution for the  problem of Vietnamese asylumseekers in the Philippines.    Great potentials for economic cooperation between our two  countries are opening up. My delegation will look into  possibilities of counter trade, investments, complimentation,  and joint-ventures in each other's economies. We shall offer  the Vietnamese the help of our industrialists, managers, and  technologists in rebuilding their infrastructure and  telecommunications systems, planning their new cities, and  managing their tourist facilities. There should also be great  room for collaboration between us in education, language  training, and training of technical people. We shall be  proposing the activation of our joint commission on trade and  economic cooperation.    The business leaders in my delegation intend to identify  with  their Vietnamese counterparts specific products that we can  profitably exchange in the light of the present low level trade  between our two countries and of the prospects offered by the  growth and diversification of our respective economies. There  are opportunities also in agriculture and in agricultural  research. Like our country, Vietnam is a major producer and  exporter of agricultural products. We can operate also in  promoting tourism, both from our neighbors and from outside the  region. There is also much room for collaboration in science and  technology, in education, and public health. We have much to  learn from each other.    I expect to discuss these prospects with President Le Duc  Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, General Secretary Do Muoi of  the ruling party and the country's other policymakers and its  private sector. Finally, I look forward to visiting with a small  but growing community of Filipino businessmen and professionals  in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.    This, then is a historic visit to a very important neighbor,  a neighbor destined to become even closer to us bilaterally and  in ASEAN. My dear countrymen, we leave our beloved Philippines  in a good situation and in good hands. I ask you to pray to the  Almighty for the success of our mission and for our safe return  two days from now. Long live the Philippines. Thank you  very much to all of you.</p>

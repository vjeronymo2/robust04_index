Tianjin University recently developed the high-tech machine  tool to make the bit, after decades in which this sophisticated  cutter had been hand-made.    The machine tool developed by the university in north  China's  Tianjin city is among the most advanced ones in the world. It  can make a bit that has different irregularly shaped blades.    According to a university official, the highly efficient bit  has been widely used in machine-making industry in the world.    Ni was then elected a model worker because of his invention,  and later became the head of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions (ACFTU).    The official said that though the bit has been updated with  different models in the past decades, the fact that it had to be  hand-made caused problems in assuring uniform standards of  quality.    The newly developed automatic machine tool has solved the  problem. It uses a computer to control the making of bits.</p>

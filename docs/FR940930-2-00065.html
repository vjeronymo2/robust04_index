HIV prevention in health-care settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  3. Development of HIV prevention strategies with a broad range of community partners including those who have not traditionally been involved with public health programs (e.g., business, religious leaders).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  4.

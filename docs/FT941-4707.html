			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Auditors split on cap to liability Medium-size accountancy firms yesterday started to fight back against the campaign by their larger competitors to limit the exposure of auditors to big litigation claims. Mr Peter Douglas, national managing partner of Kidsons Impey, the UK's 12th-largest firm, said he was considering organising a group of mid-size firms to object to proposals which would allow auditors to cap their liability at a multiple of audit fees. 'I just find it difficult that auditors should be given some protection against being negligent,' he said. His comments follow the decision by the ruling council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week to support a paper in favour of reform to be sent to the Department of Trade and Industry. The institute is echoing a campaign being run by the UK's largest eight accounting firms calling for removal of section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which forbids auditors to negotiate any limit on their liability. A number of partners from smaller firms have objected to the campaign as being self-interested and serving the interests of the larger firms. Mr Douglas, who joins the institute's council in June, said he had arranged a meeting on the subject with Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the DTI. 'The larger firms are not in the same market as the rest of us, and that is because they have tried very hard to ensure we are not,' he said. Mr Graham Ward, a partner with Price Waterhouse, has argued that part of the case for reform is that executors of wills of deceased accountancy firm partners were restricting payments to their widows and children because they could not quantify the risk of future liabilities the estates might incur as a result of litigation settlements.</p>

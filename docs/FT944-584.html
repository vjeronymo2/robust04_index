			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Snow gets in the way of skiing - Arnie Wilson is halted by the Highway Patrol on Interstate 70 Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are nearing the end of their attempt to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are spending the last few days of their odyssey in North America There is still no let-up, even though it is Christmas. We faced a journey of almost 1,000 miles to get from Crested Butte in Colorado to Jackson Hole in Wyoming, where we started our journey almost a year ago. But we needed somewhere to ski en route - hence the plan to visit a resort in Utah. We chose Brian Head as our 'stepping stone' - a resort I had always wanted to ski because of its unusual name. But 373 desolate miles after leaving Crested Butte - the last 100 through the remote Fishlake National Park in Utah's Rocky Mountains without a single sign of habitation, except for the occasional deer - our route was barred by two Highway Patrol cars. 'We've had to shut the Interstate,' said one of the officers. 'The weather's really bad five miles ahead and there are 17 cars abandoned. You'll have to find somewhere to spend the night here in Rich-field.' And so our dash south to Brian Head was halted in its tracks. The local paper, the Richfield Reaper, had a field day. Even in Utah, where they claim to have the 'Greatest Snow On Earth', it is almost unheard of for Interstate 70 to close. So we headed north instead, to Snow Basin, owned by Sun Valley, Idaho. It is to be the venue for the men's downhill in 2002 if Salt Lake City at last gets the Winter Olympics. The omens were good when we arrived: Snow Basin's logo is almost identical to that of Nottingham Forest, my favourite football team. And here was Utah's legendary powder in abundance. It had been snowing at Snow Basin for hours and now there was more than enough - the resort could even have exported a few inches to the barren slopes of Europe. Meanwhile Crested Butte, our launching pad for this latest adventure, is no longer the ghost town it was 40 years ago. Today, the old town - perhaps the most quaint, colourful and higgledy-piggledy community in the Rockies - attracts hordes of people by offering free skiing in the run-up to Christmas. With its legendary extreme-skiing terrain as well as benign family skiing, it also attracts great skiers. Dave Swanwick the new world extreme skiing champion, whose parents are both British, lives there, the Olympic gold-medallist Bill Johnson is the resort's 'Ski Ambassador', and Martin Bell, the British downhill racer is going to run a series of ski clinics there next spring. After the long drive north from Snow Basin, we finally approached Jackson Hole and the twinkling fairy-lights of Teton Village below the huge monolith of Rendezvous Mountain. Here, our year-long odyssey had begun 350 days earlier, and we started to feel a little emotional.</p>

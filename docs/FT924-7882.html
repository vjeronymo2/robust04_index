			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee surges to fresh 9-month high LONDON'S ROBUSTA coffee market continued to rally strongly yesterday, with the January contract breaching resistance at Dollars 950 a tonne to hit a nine-month high of Dollars 955. In New York the December arabica contract was up more than 2 cents at 67.45 cents a lb in late trading. Last week the London market briefly touched Dollars 950 a tonne, partly on reports of a smaller Brazilian crop. But the inevitable technical correction set in, and dealers, pointing out that the market had risen Dollars 200 in just two months, were hoping towards the end of the week that the January price would hold above Dollars 900 a tonne. The recent recovery also appears to be technical. 'This is a beautifully trending market,' said Ms Judith Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. However, she noted that prices, while well above the summer's 20-year lows, remained relatively depressed. 'We are only just beginning to dig out of the hole.' ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, suggested in its latest coffee report that, with producers delaying sales in expectation of even higher prices there appeared to be plenty of scope for further gains. Man now estimates the 1992-93 Brazilian crop at 19.15m bags (60 kg each) - at the low end of expectations but above the Brazilians' own estimate of 18.9m bags. This is thought by most analysts to be the biggest single fundamental factor in coffee's recent rise. FO Licht, the German statistician, on Monday estimated Brazilian production at 20m bags, down from 27.9m bags in 1991-92. Total world output was put at 93.3m bags, down from 102m last year. However, stocks are high. On Tuesday US certified stocks for delivery against New York hit a record 5.33m bags. As Licht put it: 'Even though coffee production is forecast to decline this season, the road to recovery will be painful and slow as there is still too much coffee around'.</p>

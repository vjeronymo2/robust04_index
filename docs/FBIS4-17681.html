			<p>BFN     [Text] A copy of the now-amended draft of a civic accord  for Russia has been made available to INTERFAX.    One crucial amendment allows for stabilizing changes to be  made in Russia's basic law but as before, the signatories are  banned from launching campaigns in favor of an early general  election which is not envisaged in the constitution.    One other amendment binds the government to try to narrow  the  income gap this year.    Unlike the previous version shifting the burden of  responsibility for CIS integration and Russia's breakthrough  into the world market on the government alone, this is to be  shared by the president and two houses of parliament as well.    At the same time, the Federal Assembly is bound to approve  this year's budget come what may.    The clause binding the republics and regions to drop any  claims for a change in their constitutional standing has been  deleted and a new paragraph inserted in the chapter on ethnic  relations which outlines mechanisms for implementing the law on  the rehabilitation of deported peoples.    The section on ways of implementing the civic accord was  largely amended including a new clause saying the president can  hold regular meetings with signatories to discuss key issues  relating to the enforcement of the accord. Apart from a  monitoring function, the conciliatory commission is now vested  with powers of permanent coordination.    Parts of the document dealing with its validity term and  signing procedure have also been deleted.</p>

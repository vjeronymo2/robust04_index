			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Tapie statement casts doubt over empire MR BERNARD Tapie, who on Saturday resigned from the French cabinet and tomorrow will appear in a Paris court to give evidence in a fraud case, is considering selling his controlling stake in Adidas, the German sportswear company which is one of the world's best known brand names. Mr Tapie said he may cede control of Adidas, the lynchpin of his business. Coupled with his resignation on Saturday night as France's minister of urban affairs after only seven weeks in the post, the statement marks a watershed in the career of one of the most controversial figures in French industry and politics. Mr Tapie, 49 has rarely been far from the headlines since shooting to prominence as one of France's most aggressive entrepreneurs in the mid-1980s. He had made his fortune by buying up bankrupt businesses. By the late 1980s he had set his sights on politics. In 1989 he became a member of parliament for Marseilles and the following year he bought Adidas, reportedly for FFr2bn (Pounds 202.6m), announcing the deal - in true Tapie style - on the eve of the World Cup final. However, the French business establishment doubted the feasibility of buying Adidas, which was worth much more than his existing interests. There was also controversy over his chairmanship of the Olympique Marseille football club and a French stock market investigation into his share dealings. His political career was viewed with the same suspicion. President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, were criticised for championing his appointment as minister. Last week's news that Mr Tapie was to appear in court after accusations from his former business partner that he embezzled FFr13m from the sale of a company in 1985 to Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group, was the final straw. His resignation has been interpreted by the French press as an embarrassing blow for Mr Beregovoy. Now, the future of Adidas, which made pre-tax profits of DM44m (Pounds 14.9m) on sales of DM3.53bn last year, is in the balance. If Mr Tapie does sell his 54 per cent holding, the likeliest buyer is Pentland, the cash-rich UK consumer products company which last year paid DM134.5m for 20 per cent of the company.</p>

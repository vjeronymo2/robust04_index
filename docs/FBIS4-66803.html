			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashok Row Kavi: "RSS Too Plays the Caste Card" </F> -- all quotation marks as published]    [Text] Bombay, March 15--It is about as revolutionary as  the Princes of the Roman Catholic Church electing a black bishop  as Pope. A little over half a century after it was born as the  Brahminical response to the challenges of colonial India, the  Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has a `Sarsangchalak' from the  non-Brahmin castes within the Varna-system.    The 79-year-old faltering head of the RSS, Balasaheb Deoras  (Dada to his close circle), has stepped down; in line with RSS  heads nominating their successors, Deoras has hand-picked Prof.  Rajendra Singh, as his heir.    Brushing aside the close coterie of South India Brahmins who  have risen fast within the gargantuan body that will carry on  the mandate of `Hindutva', Deoras has broken with the past.    Prof. Rajendra Singh, Rajju-Bhayya to the Sevaks, the first  non-Brahmin to head the RSS, comes from the backward Kshatriya  castes of the cowbelt. The battle with both the forces of Mandal  and Kanshi Ram has now been truly joined.    For the last 10 years, it was Rajju-Bhayya's mandate to  expand the incredible social net of the RSS into backward areas  like slums and Dalit bustis. This appointment is,  therefore, a clear indication to Brahmins that the RSS is  serious about its mission to broadbase its cadre. It is also a  snub to the Pune-Nagpur Chitpavan-Deshasth-Kokanasth Brahmin  elite of Maharashtra; they have been effectively sidelined by  the old man himself.    As the saying in the Konkan goes, the Mother Banana Plant  kills herself to let her daughter grow. In a similar fashion,  the RSS is now sidelining the Brahmins to accommodate the great  big push from below. However, unlike the chaotic political  electoral process the RSS is doing it systematically, opening up  its powerlines to let the backward caste muscle rise to the top.    Rajju-Bhayya, like Deoras, started as a common foot soldier  in the formative years of the Sangh. Both remain bachelors and  have worked together right from the beginning. Prof. Rajendra  Singh has cut his teeth as the General-Secretary and has  maintained close contacts with Marxists in Allahabad University  where another illustrated RSS-ite worked in the faculty--Dr  Murli Manohar Joshi. Hence, he is eminently suited to bridge the  widening gap between the RSS and Bharatiya Janata Party in the  coming future over the RSS' new Swadeshi policy.    Prof. Rajendra Singh, against great odds, first pushed the  RSS to a positive discrimination towards backwards and Dalits.  It was said to be his idea to get the ground broken at Ayodhya  for the Shilanyas by a Dalit. This has empowered numerous Dalit  castes like the Valmikis, leather workers like Chamars and even  agricultural tribals like the Dangs and Mangs to join the RSS in  1989.    It was also during his tenure as General Secretary that the  RSS started analysing the Mutiny and the national movement in  material terms. The ORGANISER had a series of articles on a  proto-Marxist analysis of the rising bourgeoise who were crushed  by the British during the Mutiny in 1857 which is at variance  with the Marxist analysis that it was a purely feudal revolt.    Prof. Rajendra Singh will now have to coordinate the RSS'  new  focus on Ayodhya and face up [to] the Mulayam-Kanshi Ram Axis  which will seek to pit the backward-Dalit castes against the  upper castes. He knows full well that whereas the backwards have  both the muscle and monetary power, the Dalits have the mass  base.    The alliance between the two is basically unstable: if the  Mulayam-Kanshir Ram regime goes in for serious land reforms, it  loses the backward-kulak social base of the Samajwadi  Party and if it doesn't, it loses its landless Dalit  constituency. Either way, the RSS stands to gain.</p>

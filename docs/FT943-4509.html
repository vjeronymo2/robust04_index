			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Simon reduces loss to Pounds 12.4m - Recovery trend as debt position shows significant improvement Simon Engineering yesterday reported a sharply reduced first-half loss of Pounds 12.4m and a much-improved debt position, but as expected is paying no interim dividend. The pre-tax loss compares with a deficit of Pounds 52.6m in the first half of 1993 and Pounds 160.3m for the full year. The interim loss per share was reduced from 51.8p to 12p. Mr Michael Davies, chairman, said the result reflected the progress made towards restoring Simon as a 'sound and profitable' engineering group. The group is being restructured to concentrate on three core businesses: the access division, the storage division and Simon-Carves, the process engineering contractor. Mr Davies said the new management team, headed by chief executive Mr Maurice Dixson, had vigorously maintained its focus on debt and trading. 'We have reiterated the message today that we are sorting out the company in 1994 and will deliver the results in 1995,' said Mr Dixson. Proceeds from May's Pounds 52.5m rights issue, along with receipts from business and property divestments, had cut borrowings from Pounds 117.8m at the end of 1993 to Pounds 72.1m on June 30, reducing gearing from 264 per cent to 85 per cent. Asset disposals since last September had raised Pounds 36m and more property disposals were expected to be completed in the second half, further reducing borrowings. Stringent financial controls were imposed last year but it was taking longer than expected to reduce working capital, especially at Simon Access, where some US business taken on at low margins was being unwound. The group's first-half turnover dropped from Pounds 190.8m to Pounds 154m and the trading loss of Pounds 8.4m was down sharply from the previous Pounds 23.4m loss. Continuing businesses accounted for only Pounds 655,000 of the loss, apart from Pounds 3.75m of exceptional restructuring costs. The largest division, Simon Access, had a trading loss of Pounds 3.66m (Pounds 1.59m profit), as turnover slipped to Pounds 71.6m (Pounds 79.2m). There were trading losses in the UK but the recent reorganisation was expected to result in a much reduced cost base. Simon-Carves lifted turnover from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 23.3m and cut its trading loss from Pounds 546,000 to Pounds 193,000. Simon Storage, in contrast, raised trading profits from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.58m on turnover of Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 20.6m). Mr Davies said the operating profits achieved in the past three months provided a clear indication that the trading performance had turned the corner. All the businesses were reporting increased inquiries and order books were looking better. Mr Dixson said there was no reason to change the view expressed at the time of the rights issue that dividends would resume next year.</p>

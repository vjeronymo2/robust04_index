			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Jobless total falls to 11-month low: All regions improve - High street spending 'robust' / Treasury strategy talks today UNEMPLOYMENT dropped to its lowest level for almost a year in September, reversing the rises of the previous two months. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally-adjusted 13,600, bringing the total last month to 2.908m or 10.3 per cent of the workforce - the lowest level for 11 months. Unadjusted unemployment fell 47,834 to 2.912m. The drop was spread across the country, with the sharpest falls occurring in the north-west and Scotland. Male unemployment fell by 10,200, and female by 3,400. The respective rates are now 13.9 per cent and 5.6 per cent of the workforce. Unemployment has fallen by a total of 84,000 since the beginning of the year. Although the UK has the eighth highest unemployment rate in the industrialised world, Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the latest figures showed that the UK was 'bucking the trend'. He added: 'While unemployment continues to rise generally across Europe, unemployment is falling in the UK and is now below the (European Community) average.' The EC average is 10.4 per cent. Seasonally-adjusted figures show that there are fewer people joining the unemployment count and more leaving it than earlier this year. Some 358,800 joined the count in September - 15,100 fewer than in August and the lowest number since May. Those leaving the count totalled 376,500 - a 4,000 improvement on August and the highest figure since October last year. However, the number of people employed in manufacturing industries dropped to 4.17m in August - down 24,000 compared with July. Since the beginning of the year manufacturing employment has shrunk by 153,000 but this compares with 229,000 over the same period last year. A drop of 700 in the month of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres - about one third of all vacancies in the economy - represented a setback since a drop tends to point to tighter labour conditions in the future. But in the three months to September, vacancies in-creased on average by 2,500 compared with 1,500 in the three months to August. The rise in underlying average earnings was 3.5 per cent in the year to August - unchanged from the previous month. The rate was also the same for the service sector where earnings rose an underlying 2.75 per cent. For manufacturing there was a slight drop from 5 per cent to 4.75 per cent. The 0.6 per cent fall in manufacturing unit wage costs in the three months to August was the smallest fall this year. There was also a slowdown in productivity growth, reflecting the drop in manufacturing output in the three months to August. Productivity grew a seasonally-adjusted 5.1 per cent in the three months to August, compared with the previous three months. This compares with 6.7 per cent in the three months to July and a high of 7.8 per cent in the three months to March.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the </F> Council of Ministers in South Yemen, with unidentified  correspondents after Muhammad's meeting with Prime Minister  Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 24 June--recorded]    [Text] [Muhammad] I discussed with his excellency the prime  minister the latest developments in the current fighting in  Yemen, and the importance of a serious Arab effort to stop the  current fighting by recognizing the existing situation in Yemen  and the existence of two regimes and states. We have been  unable to establish a true merger during four years of unity.  We asked Lebanon--government, president, and people--to support  the justness of our cause. We are defending our right to live  and the right of our children to stop this destructive war,  which has entered its eighth week. All types of weapons are  being used in this war. Sanaa is sending thousands of people  into this battle to occupy Aden and the south. It is trying to  impose its will by force and is disregarding domestic and  foreign will through its military action and option.    [Correspondent] Have you made any specific requests to the  prime minister?    [Muhammad] We are asking our Arab brothers and Lebanon for  their assistance, particularly political, to end the current  fighting and to recognize Democratic Yemen.    [Correspondent] Is there any hope for a cease-fire soon?    [Muhammad] We hope so. We pin our hopes on Arab and  international efforts, particularly on what will take place at  the UN Security Council in the next two days. We hope the  results will satisfy the parties and end the bloodshed and  destructive war.    [Correspondent] Will you tour other Arab states?    [Muhammad] There are other delegations undertaking the same  mission both on Arab and international levels. We will also  make a tour of some Arab areas in the future.</p>

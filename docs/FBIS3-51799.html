The management of each work center must  prepare a detailed economic analysis including specific  proposals to improve operations. This analysis must be exact  rather than saturated with unintelligible lingo masking the  essential points. It is possible that not all centers have an  accounting system that makes an in- depth economic analysis  possible. The first measure to take in these centers is  precisely the creation of such a tool listing the main expenses  incurred per peso of goods produced.    Apart from the current difficulties, untracked expenses are  due to disorder in place of order, confusion in place of  discipline, indolence in place of rigor. Thence, the prime  importance of discussing in the Parliament in the Workplace  meetings the center's own operations and specific, feasible  measures to increase efficiency. If a step forward is taken in  every workplace, much can be gained by simply adding the effect  of many positive steps. The TRABAJADORES editorial adds that we  will see then the results of the general measures being taken  nationwide, which can be truly effective only through the  efforts of the individual workplaces.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Dirk van Zyl] </F>   [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- Mr Tony Leon, appointed  interim leader of the Democratic Party [DP] on Sunday, has  pledged himself to promoting liberal democracy as the "salvation  of South Africa". In his first press interview after he had  beaten DP Federal Chairman Ken Andrew to the position, Mr Leon,  37, told SAPA he also intended writing a letter to President  Nelson Mandela on Monday, pledging the DP's support in principle  for the African National Congress' Reconstruction and  Development Programme [RDP] and for Mr Mandela's "very valued  effort" at nation building.    But he stressed the RDP would only touch peoples' lives if  it  was sustainable and cost-effective. "At the moment it is a menu  with a variable price list. We've got to create durable job  opportunities, not just once-off job creation schemes," Mr Leon  said.    He also believed Deputy President F W de Klerk should be  called to the bar of Parliament to explain the "squalid" KwaZulu  land deal.    Mr Leon said the DP could make a "very postive" contribution  and the party had to "come into its own through glasnost  (openness)". Total public accountability had to be applied in  all facets of public life -- including the KwaZulu land deal.    Mr Leon said a second "acid test" facing South Africa in the  immediate future was whether the judges of the Constitutional  Court would be appointed through a process of public hearing.    Mr Leon added: "I also want to expand very rapidly and  transcendingly the DP's base in South Africa. We have a rare  opportunity to do so."    He said he was "humbled but challenged" by his leadership  appointment. The election -- in the 75 member DP Federal Council  -- had been "the most creative of all contests I've been in."    Mr Leon joined the Progressive Party youth wing at the age  of  11, was a Johannesburg city councillor at 29, and succeeded Mrs  Helen Suzman as MP for Houghton in 1989 at the age of 32.    He is a son of Mr Justice Ramon Leon, head of the  Independent  Media Commission.    Sources at Sunday's Federal Council meeting -- which was  called to appoint an acting leader to replace Dr Zach de Beer,  who retired from public life recently -- said Mr Leon had been  given a standing ovation after the straight contest with Mr  Andrew in which he had obtained a clear majority. Mr Andrew had  gone up to congratulate him immediately after the results had  been announced, one of the sources said.    The DP is to elect its permanent new leader at a federal  congress, scheduled for Durban in September.</p>

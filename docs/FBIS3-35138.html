			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kathmandu, Feb 17 (AFP) -- King Birendra has called  parliament to reconvene February 24, officials said Thursday,  thwarting Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's plan  to dissolve the legislature and call mid-term polls.    An internal feud in the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) has  already delayed the winter session of parliament for more than a  week.    The main opposition in the parliament, the Nepal Communist  Party- United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), had appealed to  the king to urgently call a parliamentary session to discuss the  current political situation.    The NCP-UML argued that a call for mid-term polls 26 months  ahead of the expiry of the current parliament's five-year term  should not be made on Koirala's recommendation alone, and should  be debated in parliament.    The row in the NC started after the defeat of party  president  and bitter Koirala rival Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in a  parliamentary by-election February 7.    Koirala had bitterly flayed Bhattarai for criticising him  and  the government in a by-election campaign speech. Bhattarai  supporters and more than 50 NC MPs for their part said the prime  minister's comments, as well as a deliberately poor campaign  effort by some NC officials, cost the party the election.    Analysts said Koirala wanted a snap election to force the  party to unify behind him. His party has a fairly comfortable  majority of 113 seats in the 205-member parliament.    Since Bhattarai's defeat, students and front-line NC youth  supporters have taken to the streets to denounce Koirala, and  the party's executive body, the Central Working Committee, is  deciding whether to take action against Koirala for his alleged  misconduct during the recent by-elections.    Most committee members are loyal to Bhattarai and he is  expected to repeat his call for Koirala to resign when the  committee completes deliberations, probably on Friday.    Party sources said that would lead to a crisis within the NC  and a possible bid to oust him from the party, but that Koirala  was seeking support from students and MPs ahead of a showdown.</p>

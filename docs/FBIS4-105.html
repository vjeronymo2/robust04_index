			<p>BFN     [Text] Many South African mercenaries are piloting Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT]  combat aircraft in Angola. Reports from the Armed Forces for  the Liberation of Angola Military Command in Cuango area  yesterday said the involvement of mercenaries in the MPLA-PT air  force was confirmed in the last bombings. Our source said the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] will  not take responsibility for what will happen to those  mercenaries and others on the battle fronts. Recently the head  of the South African Army said mercenaries operating in Angola  did not do so with the government's consent. However, when  UNITA killed 12 South African nationals, including a colonel, on  22 March during clashes, Pretoria became agitated.</p>

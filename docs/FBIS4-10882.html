			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The peace agreements with the Socialist Renewal  Movement [CRS] will give the former guerrillas the possibility  of putting two members into the Chamber of Deputies for the 1994  to 1998 term. CRS leaders went to Narino Palace today.    President Cesar Gaviria and the former CRS guerrillas made  official the peace agreements today. For the first time, the  former guerrillas entered Narino Palace to announce to the  country that from now on they will be a political alternative  within the law. This is the fifth guerrilla movement to set  aside its weapons during the past six years to reach a peace  agreement.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADDING SOME NAMES TO THE LITERARY CORRAL  </P> <P> I read "The West -- a Literary State of Mind"(April 1) with great pleasure and  interest, and I applaud your effort to promote Western writers.  </P> <P> It is a pity you could not acknowledge some of the pioneers in the field --  Jack London, William Saroyan, John Steinbeck. And surely a tip of the hat could  have been given to the late Lawrence Clark Powell, UCLA Librarian, who promoted  Western writing and writers all of his life. And how about recognition for the  foresight of the University of Wyoming in establishing the American Heritage  Center, which is collecting the papers and manuscripts of Western writers?  </P> <P> ETHEL H.

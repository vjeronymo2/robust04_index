			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Riyadh, 10 May, KUNA -- Shaykh 'Abdallah  al-Ahmar, the speaker of the Yemeni Parliament has said that he  is visiting Riyadh to clarify what is happening in Yemen "within  the framework of the solid and traditional relations between the  two countries."    Shaykh al-Ahmar, who arrived in Riyadh tonight, told KUNA:  "We have not come to look for mediation." In reply to a  question whether he was hoping for a Saudi role to solve the  Yemeni crisis, Shaykh al-Ahmar said: "The Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia strives to do good deeds always and everywhere."    Shaykh al-Ahmar, who is accompanied by the planning  minister,  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, is carrying a message for King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques, from the  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on "the developments of  the situation in Yemen and issues of mutual interest."    Shaykh al-Ahmar has denied the existence of Arab mediation  to  resolve the conflict, indicating that "since he left Sanaa this  afternoon he has not heard of any mediation." He added that  "the conflict has been decided militarily after the northern  troops reached Shaykh 'Uthman area, situated north of Aden." He  further said that the southern air base of al-'Anad had been  captured and "it was brought under control this afternoon."  [passage omitted]</p>

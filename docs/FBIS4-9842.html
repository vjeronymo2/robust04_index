			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with new Government Minister Danilo Parrinello </F> Blanco by Jeovany Ibanez; place and date not given]    [Text] [Ibanez] Why did you accept the appointment of  government minister at a time when the country is experiencing a  political, economic, and social crisis, which in turn has led to  a complete lack of security?    [Parrinello] Because I am optimistic and feel certain that  we  can do something for Guatemala. I am aware of the responsibility  I assumed and know that a difficult task awaits me. We must be  realistic, however. We know we cannot fully resolve the  security problem, but we can lay the groundwork for society to  walk the path of justice. We must struggle to recover the values  we have lost -- ethics, respect for the family, church, and  homeland. We Guatemalans need a reassessment of moral values. It  is a difficult process, but it must be started soon. I have been  given an opportunity and I am determined to use it.    [Ibanez] Why do you think you can succeed where many others  have failed?    [Parrinello] I trust myself and my team. Ortiz Moscoso had  good intentions, but he is the one who should talk about why he  failed. We will show, with short-term results, that we can  provide the security Guatemalans desire. For this reason, I have  outlined an emergency plan to be put into effect within the next  60 days. We will see what happens after that date.    [Ibanez] What methods will you use to attain results and  what  experience do you have in security matters?    [Parrinello] I have used my first days in office to organize  a full team, which includes National Police [PN] directors,  immigration officials, and Finance Police, two deputy ministers,  and several advisers to outline strategies to fight crime. The  team complements the plan I have already mentioned. Regarding  your second question, I have prepared myself for the post of  government minister, not for PN director. I have taken courses  related to security issues in the United States and Brazil.    [Ibanez] Security is a universal demand. How do you intend  to  meet this nationwide need?    [Parrinello] We are aware of a great lack of security, which  has created a climate of instability and led people to mistrust  the authorities. My most important role at this time, however,  is to restore social order. I am certain that, with the  creation of the Immediate Reaction Platoon, which will be an  elite PN group initially comprising 300 men, we will fight crime  better. We will work vigorously and in some cases employ  reasonable uses of force. Also, an investigation section will be  created, which will operate independently from the PN's Criminal  Investigations Department.    A special remanding unit, which will try to prevent judges  from releasing criminals because of police errors, will also be  created. Respect for human rights and compliance with the law  are part of my principles, and I intend to stick to them while  in office. Nevertheless, I will also use all available resources  and mechanisms to prevent crime. We are determined to raise the  status of the police to one of dignity. In exchange, we will  demand that the police make a commitment to the people. As for  weapons, patrol cars, and other equipment, we will update these  to curb crime.    [Ibanez] How do you intend to carry out these plans  considering there is not an adequate budget to fund programs of  this kind?    [Parrinello] It is true that a shortage of resources is one  of our greatest problems. Nevertheless, I not only have the  president of the Republic's backing, but I also have been  offered economic support from private sector representatives  willing to cooperate with the government. This support  represents a mutual benefit. This is why we will create a kind  of patronage or committee to manage the funds we will collect.  In addition, we will seek advice on security matters.  Meanwhile, we will do our best with whatever we have. Also, we  will ask the government to allocate the necessary funds so  people can have a PN that truly offers protection.    [Ibanez] People do not trust the police. How will you change  this image?    [Parrinello] We are aware of this. For this reason, we do  not  intend to reorganize it but to start a program to purge it,  whereby police officials involved in corruption will be fired  and tried. For this purpose, I have appointed a PN director who  will be responsible for initiating the appropriate proceedings.  Nevertheless, we must be realistic and admit that we do not have  a magical formula to purge the PN.    [Ibanez] How do you explain the appointment of a military  officer as deputy minister in charge of security? Does this  appointment represent the establishment of a hard-line in the  Government Ministry?    [Parrinello] I want to be very clear on Colonel Merida's  appointment. In relation to his appointment, there was no  pressure and there will be none in any other appointment I might  make. I nominated him because he is a very good friend of mine,  because I have confirmed that he is truly a security expert, and  because he will contribute all of his expertise to eradicating  crime. As for the hard line, I am willing to do a good job.  This means I will act with a heavy hand, but according to law  so no one can violate the Guatemalan people's rights.</p>

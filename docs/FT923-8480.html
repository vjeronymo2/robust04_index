			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Management: Small companies create more jobs - In A Nutshell Smaller companies account for a disproportionately large share of total job creation in the UK, according to the latest government findings. In the service sector, companies employing fewer than 10 people accounted for half of the new jobs created during 1987 and 1989. Such companies provided only a quarter of total employment in the sector. The contrast was even more marked in the production sector. Firms employing fewer than 10 people accounted for two-fifths of new jobs but provided just one-tenth of overall employment. Employment Gazette, August 1992. Available from HMSO, Pounds 4.50.</p>

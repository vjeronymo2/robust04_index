			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hungary issue aimed at western investors HUNGARY'S corporate debt market was opened up further to foreign investors yesterday with the announcement of a new commercial paper issue. Hunguard, the Hungarian float-glass maker owned by Guardian Industries of the US, has established a programme to issue commercial paper worth up to Ft1.5bn (Dollars 16.7m). It will be the first forint-denominated CP issue accessible to western institutional investors. The notes, carrying the guarantee of the parent company and an A1 credit rating, are to be priced to yield just above Hungarian Treasury bills. The 180-day T-bills currently yield 16.5 per cent. Credit Suisse First Boston, dealer and arranger of the issue, expects to place about a quarter of the paper internationally. The opening of the CP market has been driven by interest from international institutions drawn to the relatively high yields on forint debt and sanguine about the risk of devaluation. For its part, the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, said it would permit foreign take-up now that forint interest rates were lower and the margin for disruptive speculative investment had narrowed. However, the NBH said that it would continue to grant licences only on a case-by-case basis for the issue abroad of Hungarian corporate debt. The market, officials said, was too thin to allow general liberalisation which would bring sudden capital movements.</p>

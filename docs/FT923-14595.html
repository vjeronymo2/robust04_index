			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (36): Tying the knot between training and the needs of business - Analysis / Companies can choose from a wide range of training options to support new software applications, ranging from traditional 'blackboard-and-chalk' to advanced multimedia technology. But increasingly the emphasis is on the end result, rather than on the way it is achieved INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) has had an enormous impact on training and education in the last decade. Computer-based training (CBT) packages for personal computers have spread computer skills, techniques for creating training material have improved and people are generally more receptive to the idea of learning from a computer. CBT has been especially effective in training novice users of personal computers in basic skills. The art of 'wordprocessing,' or the skills involved in designing a useful spreadsheet, can be presented in a simple instruction package and easily absorbed by users. All popular software packages nowadays come with several diskloads of CBT tutorials and a wealth of instruction manuals and back-up material. Despite these developments, the tried-and-tested training methods of the past are still in wide use - particularly if users want to get the most out of their 'home-grown' application systems or when they need to train non-IT staff. If CBT is used, it is used as part of comprehensive training package which includes 'blackboard and chalk' sessions, self-study and workshop discussions. There is, it seems, still room for the human touch -and, if anything, the need for good lecturers, tutors and teachers is as important as it ever was. 'CBT is great back-up - but it needs a dynamic person acting as a tutor to help people get the most out of it,' says Rosalyn Stein, a director of training specialist Stein-Hodgins. 'It is good for reinforcing what has been learned in lectures and workshops. The technology is really just icing on the cake - a bit of multimedia or a bit of animation helps - but it can't do the whole job.' Stein-Hodgins devises tailor-made training programs for customers who use Microsoft's Windows environment. Ms Stein goes on to say that the demand is for 'customised training which fits in with wider business aims. 'We aim to get people productive with an application as quickly as possible. It is not just training; it is making sure that the training is relevant to the aims of the business,' explains Rosalyn Stein. Richard Atkinson, head of FI Group's training subsidiary FI Training, takes a similar view: 'We see CBT as offering a useful set of tools. But you must see what the training needs are and develop a training programme which fits them.' Market research backs this up, pointing to greater emphasis on the end-result of training, rather than on the method used to achieve it. 'There are clear indications within the marketplace that demand for training is moving from technology in isolation towards a requirement for consideration of commercial and strategic issues,' says the research group, IDC, in its recent report on the UK IT training market. Although revenues for IT training suppliers in the UK fell by three per cent in 1991, IDC says there is a still a strong demand. It also notes that most organisations look outside for their training needs. The training demand varies from sector to sector. Central government is the top consumer, with 87.9 per cent of the IDC sample using external training services. About 80 per cent of financial institutions use external training, and the mining and construction sector uses the least amount; only 58 per cent. IDC sees management training for IT staff as one of the key growth areas and also notes a latent market for general IT appreciation for non-IT staff - although it suggests that the recession will hold back growth in this area in the short term. More important are the observations that training must show a genuine cost-benefit, and must be related to business needs. Users want to see productivity gains and improved performance coming from their training investments. IDC notes that training organisations will need to 'align training with service products that meet demonstrable business need.' This is especially true with training staff who are to use custom-built software applications. These applications are often most likely to be the basis of any strategic IT system. Training staff to use generic software - like spreadsheet programs and wordprocessors - is much less demanding and can be accommodated within CBT tutorials and self-study. But the specific nature of custom-built applications requires specific training and, here, the old methods prevail. There are sound economic and eminently practical reasons for this. Good CBT tutorials are costly to produce. So, if the investment is to be worthwhile, a tutorial must have a large potential audience. Most custom-built applications are used by only a small number of people - which means that it is uneconomical to use CBT. It follows, therefore, that training staff to use custom-built software applications, demands custom-built training materials - which are cheaper to produce with the traditional approach. The obvious starting point for custom-built application training is, of course, the application supplier. Users recognise that the builders of the custom application system are in the best position to train those who are to use it. FI Group's decision to acquire Kernel Training last year was typical of the gambits that service companies are using to get into the training business. The FI Group is an established custom software developer and saw good reasons to expand its training resources: 'Training has always been an important part of the service industry. We saw that the primary route in to it was through acquisition. And we wanted to take Kernel Training and expand into a more general role within the FI Group,' says Mr Atkinson of FI Training. Services suppliers are keen to exploit this useful 'add-on' market and are, increasingly emphasising training as part of a full systems integration service. This market has also attracted established hardware manufacturers such as ICL and Siemens Nixdorf. Hardware builders have a long tradition of providing technical training to customers. They are now looking for ways to extend their existing training services into the applications area and have chosen CBT packages as one of their tactics. ICL recently signed the distribution rights for a multimedia authoring tool called Authorware to support its training initiatives. Nationwide Building Society is an early customer and is using the package to create training materials for cheque-clearance procedures. Siemens Nixdorf introduced its SITE CBT package earlier this year - with the aim of making it easier for users to produce good-quality training materials for their internal applications. SITE can work across a range of different hardware - making it possible to distribute training materials in the same way as the software itself. Even more promising is the looming prospect of multimedia technology - which seems destined to have its greatest initial impact in the training area. Some users are taking the lead in the use of multimedia - but once again within the context of a wider training strategy. The Bradford and Bingley Building Society set up a training project back in 1990 which uses a Sony interactive video (IV) system to train its staff in a variety of skills. The building society wanted to see a pay-back from the system within two years and recently claimed to have achieved this. But despite the cost-benefits from the IV system, it is still seen as only one part of a much wider training strategy. 'Our training is a mix of media because each type of delivery has its benefits. Disadvantages of IV occur if you try and use it for everything; it's no good for a target audience of five people, for example,' says Philip Hunter of Bradford and Bingley's training department. He goes on to say, however, that it is not just cost savings which are driving users to look for new training methods - 'we are saying that if we don't adopt these alternative methods of training, we will have to recruit more staff in order to cover our training needs. In fact, IV methods are sometimes the only way that training can be done.' This supports the view that successful training of staff in the use of new software lies in combining traditional methods with advances in technology. And as computer technology continues to improve and becomes easier to use, the emphasis in training will shift from the technology to the application and the demands of the business.

The meeting at the Russian Embassy here,  organised by Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly  Churkin in coordination with U.S. officials, is the first of its  kind to be held in the Croatian capital under the auspices of  the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    The two sides last year held several similar meetings in  Norway and Austria, with the Serbs demanding neutral territory  for the talks. But those talks failed because of Serb insistence  on autonomy for the Krajina region which they have proclaimed an  independent republic. The separatist Serbs seized the Krajina  region in the war that broke out between Croatia and the  Yugoslav army when Zagreb declared independence from the old  Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation in 1991.    John Mills, the spokesman for the international peace  conference on former Yugoslavia, told journalists the  discussions would focus on "a comprehensive ceasefire and  separation of forces" of the two factions. The Krajina Serbs  occupy a quarter of Croatian territory, and Mills acknowledged  that separating the two forces was a "very difficult problem."    Shortly before the start of the talks, some 300  intellectuals  gathered in the centre of the city to protest the start of  dialogue with the separatists, whom they denounced as "war  criminals." They accused Russia of making moves to "cement the  Serb occupation" of Krajina, a UN-monitored area. Questioned on  the demonstration, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who has  ruled out any kind of "enlarged autonomy" for the separatists  and is demanding the unconditional return of Krajina, told  journalists that "not only Russian envoys but also those from  the United States" had entered the talks with the "war  criminals." He said the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, Peter  Galbraith, had joined the negotiations. Tudjman stressed the  talks would continue for as long as was needed to reach a  solution. "We are obliged to have discussions and we want to do  so to ensure there are no more (war) victims. We will continue  talking for as long as there is a chance" of a settlement, he  said. Tudjman said he had received pledges of support for  Zagreb's efforts to reassert its authority in Krajina from the  United States and the UN Security Council, adding that this was  an essential precondition should Croatia be forced into taking  "extreme measures" in the event of the talks failing.    Tudjman last week asked the Security Council to authorise  the  use of force to disarm the rebels. He is insisting that the UN  peacekeepers, whose mandate for operations in Croatia is up for  renewal at the end of March, maintain strict control of a  demarcation line.    Churkin has worked closely with his U.S. counterpart Charles  Redman, who helped broker the Croat-Moslem agreement on a  federation in Bosnia that was sealed in Washington on Friday [18  March].</p>

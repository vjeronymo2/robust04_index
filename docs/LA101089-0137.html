KOREA REJECTS U.S. DEMAND FOR LIBERALIZED BEEF IMPORTS  </P> <P> U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills got an early rebuff today when  South Korea's agriculture minister rejected her demand that Seoul liberalize  beef imports.  </P> <P> As trade talks began, Kim Sik refused even to consider a full opening of South  Korea's beef market for fear of its effect on domestic prices, Agriculture  Ministry officials said.  </P> <P> Hills, starting three days of bilateral trade talks, threatened to retaliate in  mid-November with duties on South Korean goods if the beef dispute is not  resolved.  </P> <P> Washington is pressing Seoul to take a wide range of steps to reduce its huge  trade surplus with the United States, which is trying to cut its massive trade  deficit.  </P> <P> Though disputes simmer in other areas, beef remains the most volatile trade  issue between the two nations.  </P> <P> In a separate meeting with Trade Minister Han Seung Soo, Hills demanded that  Seoul crack down on illegal copying of textbooks and records as well as  infringement of semiconductor patents.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: West's farmers reap Dollars 354bn in subsidies - Governments resist reform TAXPAYERS and consumers in the industrialised world subsidised farmers to the tune of Dollars 354bn (Pounds 229.8bn) in 1992 - or about Dollars 440 per head - according to the OECD. Subsidies were up 7 per cent from 1991 as governments continued to resist reforms in the sector. World farm trade grew by about 6.6 per cent last year, but falling prices meant that earnings barely rose. In its annual study of the farm sector the OECD forecast a sharp fall in cereal exports this year, as China and the former Soviet Union cut imports, and predicted falling prices for most key farm products over the next four years. Since 1971, agriculture's share of world trade has dwindled from 15 per cent to 9.4 per cent, the OECD said. Total transfers to the OECD farm sector, largely made up of contributions from taxpayers and consumers, fell in Canada, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden. But these were more than offset by a 10 per cent increase in the US, from Dollars 81.1bn to Dollars 91.1bn, and a similar increase in Japan, from Dollars 65.6bn to Dollars 74bn. In value terms the biggest subsidiser remained the European Community, which transferred Dollars 155.9bn (up from Dollars 146.4bn). But the heaviest individual burdens fell in Finland, where transfers amounted to Dollars 910 per head. By comparison, people living in the EC paid Dollars 450 apiece, while those in Japan paid Dollars 600 and those in the US Dollars 360. The biggest beneficiaries of these farm subsidies were Scandinavian farmers. Transfers averaged Dollars 39,600 per farmer in Norway and Dollars 38,600 in Sweden. US farmers benefited from transfers averaging Dollars 36,100. Transfers for each Japanese farmer averaged Dollars 31,300, while EC farmers gained by Dollars 17,700 per head. In a largely gloomy examination of prospects for the farm sector up until 1997, the OECD saw three possible grounds for optimism: Hopes that reform of the EC's common agriculture policy, which began to take effect in January this year, would trim levels of EC farm support; Hopes that a successful outcome in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks would begin to erode farm subsidies; Strong economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which might stimulate world demand for certain farm products, particularly meat. The OECD report was, however, concerned that a slower than forecast recovery from recession would depress demand for farm products and prices. 'Most countries have not so far embarked on reform leading to significantly reduced levels of agricultural support,' the report said. Complaining of the 'competitive subsidisation' of farm exports by the US and the EC, it said these subsidies 'have changed the structure of the world market, have resulted in significantly lower world prices, and reduced production incentives for farmers in non-subsidising countries'.</p>

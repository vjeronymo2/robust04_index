			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation State Duma, by Valentina Nikiforova, under the  general heading "Spring. Another Thaw in Russia?"; place and  date not given: "Ivan Rybkin, Chairman of the Russian  Federation State Duma: On Amnesty Without Hysteria"]    [Text] Hardly had the cell doors closed behind those  accused of the events of September-October last year than the  State Duma came under fire: "They have released the criminals!"  "They have intervened in the president's prerogative!"  Prosecutor A. Kazannik, admittedly after a slight delay, called  the State Duma decree on the amnesty "the most shameful page in  the history of Russian parliamentarism."    What actually happened? Your PRAVDA correspondent put that  and other questions to Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, chairman of the  State Duma.    [Rybkin] One has to view the amnesty calmly and without  hysteria. The Duma adopted two decrees on the amnesty in  connection with the adoption of the Constitution on the  president's initiative. The first decree allows a little over  20,000 people to be released from their places of confinement  and around 200,000 people on probation. The second decree -- on  the economic and political amnesty -- will set 20 times fewer  people free. The point of the amnesty is that all those who  have erred are being given a chance to enter life at a quite  difficult and critical time. The aim is to consolidate society  so as to pull the country out of chaos by joint efforts.    [Nikiforova] It is a humane act. After all, the idea of the  amnesty came from the president himself and was supported by  virtually all factions in the Duma.    [Rybkin] That clearly does not suit those who look forward  to clashes between the branches of power, between the State Duma  and the Federation Council, and between the president and the  Federal Assembly. But I think that we -- the deputies and the  executive -- are intelligent enough not to organize  Russian-style gladiatorial contests for everyone else's  entertainment. My advice is not to wait with malicious relish  until the pendulum swings the other way but to remember that we  are fellow countrymen.    [Nikiforova] Nevertheless, they are accusing the Duma of  haste.    [Rybkin] I do not believe that. We did a lot of work in  committees. As for the procedure for the application of the  decree, we discussed it with the Interior Ministry. The general  prosecutor asked for clarification -- and members of the  committees on legality and security clarified every point. They  worked on Friday and Saturday.    [Nikiforova] But on Saturday people were already coming out  of jail, in other words they were released immediately. That  clearly was alarming.    [Rybkin] But that is just the beginning. No amnesty is an  instantaneous act. There are different situations, they have to  be examined. And an adequate time limit is set for this -- six  months.    [Nikiforova] How do you assess the general prosecutor's  conduct?    [Rybkin] It is vexing that A. Kazannik has behaved so  inconsistently. He knew that the decree on the amnesty had  been adopted as part of a package in which the main  document is the "Memorandum on Accord," signed on 22 February by  all the factions, even Russia's Choice (although unfortunately  the next morning, 23 February, they changed their stance). Now  when a mountain of work has been dumped on the General  Prosecutor's Office -- work that is necessary for society (it  must be cleansed and stabilized) -- the general prosecutor is  resigning. The new man will need time to settle in.    [Nikiforova] Ivan Petrovich, are those who have been  amnestied completely exonerated?    [Rybkin] That is a difficult question. In adopting the  decree the deputies created an area of accord. In consenting to  this release, those under investigation wrote a statement to  that effect. For them that is a serious warning. It is no  coincidence that the Criminal Code includes amendments  increasing punishments which coincide with those contained in  the articles of the decree on the amnesty.</p>

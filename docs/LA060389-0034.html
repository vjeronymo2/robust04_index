			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> SKIP FUCHSIA PAMPERING: PLANT 'EM AND ENJOY 'EM  </P> <P> "Plant them in the ground and enjoy them," Bill Rietkerk says.  </P> <P> He's the president of the National Fuchsia Society and a champion exhibitor who  doesn't pamper his fuchsias. Too many people make hard work out of fuchsias,  surrounding them in a mystique that belies their rugged nature and versatility.  </P> <P> Rietkerk and other fuchsia fanciers will exhibit their prize plants, share  their expertise and sell special fuchsias this weekend at the NFS Fuchsia Show  at Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge. At this show, visitors will  discover some of the latest fuchsia hybrids and rare varieties as well as many  old favorites rarely available at nurseries.  </P> <P> Once known as "ladies' eardrops" and popular in Victorian gardens, fuchsias  range from tiny single red and purple blossoms to large, tetraploid specimens  in hues of violet, coral, cream and mauve.  </P> <P> Rietkerk and his wife, Agnes, also a prize-winning grower, prefer the  less-demanding varieties with smaller blooms and rugged constitutions. Their  back yard in Artesia is filled with more than 1,000 fuchsias in pots, some of  which are being shaped into standards (trees) or trained along wires into rings  of living blooms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baskets, Trees, Planters  </P> <P> Fuchsias hang from baskets, drip from trees, shoot up from planters on the  pavement and spill out from a small corner nursery. Overhead, plastic surah  cloth and an aging walnut tree provide the filtered light that fuchsias love.  </P> <P> The proportions of Rietkerk's collection and his own personal philosophy  preclude pampering. The fuchsias in pots are watered only once every two days;  any that don't make it are lost. Those in the ground require less water. Most  of his plants are fed with organic pellets (such as GroPower) and a  slow-release fertilizer (such as Osmocote) in the late fall or early spring  when they are pruned.  </P> <P> For show plants, he adds liquid doses of a diluted fertilizer (such as Miracle  Gro). To control pests, notably whitefly, spider mite and fuchsia mite, he  sprays every two weeks with a mixture of Volck oil (1 tablespoon) and Cooke's  garden insect spray with thiodan (1 tablespoon per gallon).  </P> <P> Newly purchased plants can be a little temperamental. Fuchsias have to become  acclimated to new surroundings. Instead of immediately planting a new specimen,  leave it in its pot and set it where it will be grown. Observe it for a week.  Let it become accustomed to your microclimate, then plant it in a slightly  larger container using a light mix (commercial potting soil plus lots of  perlite).  </P> <P> To plant in the ground, use 1-gallon-size fuchsias. Prepare the soil so that it  drains well. Add fertilizer and stake the new bush. Some successful varieties  in the ground are Cardinal, Rocket, Mrs. J. D. Fredericks, Glendale, Nonpareil  and Voodoo.  </P> <P> Two reasons for the continuing popularity of fuchsias are their long blooming  period and short propagation period. If you take cuttings now, you can have  plants in bloom next Christmas. In fact, it's always a good idea to take one or  two cuttings of a new plant as a safety measure. Select a strong branch,  preferably without blooms, cut off a 3-inch portion from the tip, remove all  leaves except two or three at the tip and insert in moist perlite.  </P> <P> Some growers put a plastic bag over the pot to prevent drying out but Rietkerk  doesn't bother -- and he has hundreds of cuttings that attest to his method. In  five or six weeks, cuttings are usually ready for potting.  </P> <P> Probably no flowering plant benefits more from pinching than does the fuchsia.  Pinching out the growing tip forces two, sometimes more branches to emerge, and  because fuchsias bloom on new growth only, many branches are required to  produce profuse blooms. Some of the Rietkerks' show plants have more than a  hundred growing tips, the result of considerable pinching.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Show Competition  </P> <P> The Rietkerks and many other fuchsia enthusiasts will compete for prizes at the  NFS show this weekend. You can see, in addition to specimen plants, hundreds of  labeled fuchsia flowers at the bloom display. If you're very lucky, you may get  to meet America's leading fuchsia hybridizer, Annabelle Stubbs, from Oceanside,  who has three new introductions this year: Orchid Flame, Pink Parasol and Mary  Ellen Guffey.  </P> <P> The NFS fuchsia show at Descanso opens to the public at 10 a.m. today, with  sales of plants from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. today and Sunday. The gardens are  located at 1418 Descanso Drive, La Canada Flintridge.  </P> <P> For gardeners in the southern area, the South Coast NFS branch will present its  fuchsia show and sale today and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the South  Coast Botanic Gardens, 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> If you can't get away this weekend, on June 17-18 the NFS will stage a fuchsia  show and sale at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia.  </P> <P> Admission to all county gardens is $3 for adults, $1.50 for seniors and  students with ID and 75 cents for children ages 5-12. To join the National  Fuchsia Society, send $12 to 15103 McRae St., Norwalk, Calif. 90650.  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Annual subsidy of Pounds 1.25bn needed to keep open pits earmarked for closure BRITISH COAL would need an annual subsidy of up to Pounds 1.25bn if it were to keep open all 31 pits earmarked for closure, according to figures drawn up by the corporation for the trade and industry committee, Michael Smith writes. The estimate, published yesterday in a 311-page book of evidence to the committee, assumes that the pits' annual output of 33m tonnes would not be sold and so would have to be stockpiled. British Coal says the subsidy would fall to Pounds 170m at 1992-93 prices if the output of all 31 pits could be sold to the electricity supply market at Pounds 1.30 a gigajoule, well below expected contract prices. However it says sales of that size would be inconceivable without changes in the market.

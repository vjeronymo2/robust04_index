			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network  in Arabic in a linkup with Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio  Network in Arabic, at 0905 GMT on 2 March begins a live relay  from al-Qardahah of a ceremony eulogizing Basil al-Asad 40 days  after his death.    At 0906 GMT, President al-Asad arrives at the site of the  ceremony where he was welcomed by Lebanese President Ilyas  al-Hirawi, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Lebanese  Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, and senior Syrian  officials.    President al-Asad, wearing sunglasses, then takes his seat  in  a pavilion overlooking an open area in which thousands of people  are gathered to mark this occasion. Behind him, hundreds of  officials and dignitaries are sitting in rows. Basil's tomb, in  the middle of the ceremony area, is covered with flowers.    Al-Asad is flanked on his right by Lebanese President Ilyas  al-Hirawi and on his left by Lebanese Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Nabih Birri. Ba'th Party Assistant Secretary General  'Abdallah al-Ahmar and Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam sit  next to Nabih Birri. Al-Asad's son Dr. Bashshar and Lebanese  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri sit next to al-Hirawi.    After the recitation of Koranic verses, Sulayman Qaddah, the  assistant secretary general of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party,  delivered the Ba'th Party speech at 0912 GMT. Qaddah begins by  praising President Hafiz al-Asad's leadership and achievements  and the Syrian people's support for the president. He then  speaks about Basil, his characteristics, and the Syrians' sorrow  on his loss.    Lebanon's Nabih Birri then addressed the ceremony at 0930  GMT. After praising Basil al-Asad, and enumerating his many  qualities and offering condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad,  Birri speaks about the Beirut church explosion and the Hebron  mosque massacre, saying "Israel, using sinful hands, has  perpetrated a new crime against a house of God in the heart of  Lebanon." Birri adds: "It is no coincidence that only 50 hours  separated the two crimes committed against peace in both Lebanon  and the region. One of these crimes targeted faithful people  and the church in Lebanon and the other targeted faithful people  and the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron."    Birri adds: "The blood bath witnessed in the holy lands of  Palestine and Lebanon are the best evidence that Israel is  incapable of making peace."    He then criticizes world reaction to these two incidents,  noting that "Despite this bloody Israeli record, we still feel  that Israel is granted immunity by the international community.  It is allowed to act as it wishes, depending on the right of  veto, which is preventing the passage of firm international  resolutions and the implementation of the provisions enshrined  in Chapter 7 of the UN Charter against it. This renders the  killing of our peoples, as is happening at present, a condonable  crime, and the killing of a single Israeli settler or soldier on  our occupied territories an unforgivable crime. Their  occupation of our territories is justified, whereas our  resistance on our own national soil is deemed terrorism."    At 0940 GMT, Safwan Qudsi, secretary general of the Arab  Socialist Union and member of the National Progressive Front  [NPF] delivers the NPF speech. His entire speech is devoted to  eulogizing Basil and praising President al-Asad.

Talas,  and after offering condolences to al-Asad says: "We all ask God  Almighty to spare you calamities and to keep you a refuge for  this nation after the Judas of the 20th Century has sold out  this nation's principal cause in the labyrinths of Oslo." He  adds that the Israelis then "dared to slaughter this nation's  worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque on a Friday during Ramadan, in  the same manner that they dared to attack the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church in Beirut on that bloody Sunday in an overt attempt to  cover up for their first crime".    At 1023 GMT, Elie Farzali, deputy speaker of the Lebanese  Chamber of Deputies, reads a poem in praise of Basil al-Asad,  after which he praises President al-Asad's pan-Arab policies,  and says that the Lebanese people appreciate Syria's support for  Lebanon and its stand at the peace negotiations "which does not  differentiate between the regaining of southern Lebanon and the  regaining of the Syrian Golan, between the interests of Beirut  and the interests of Damascus."

He  praises Syria and notes how it has managed to face all world  challenges and "Zionist challenges" because Syria knows the  nation has many elements of strength and positive points that  can help it face all challenges. Syria managed to assert its  role. He says that some people are in a rush to normalize  relations with Israel and to drop the Israeli boycott, citing  new world realities as a reason for this.

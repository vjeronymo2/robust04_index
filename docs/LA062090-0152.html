Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GO TO BAT FOR BABE, FANS ASKED  </P> <P> Talk show host Larry King is asking fans "to go to bat for the Babe" in a fund  drive to expand the Babe Ruth Museum.  </P> <P> "These are exciting times for baseball fans. Starting today we're going to  offer fans across the country membership to the Babe Ruth Museum," King said  Tuesday behind the house where the Sultan of Swat was born 95 years ago.  </P> <P> "We hope we can count on all of you to go to bat for the Babe."  </P> <P> The museum hopes a broadened membership will pay for a 12,000-square-foot  addition, including a 6,000-square-foot auditorium.  </P> <P> The museum was built in 1974 around the birthplace of George Herman (Babe)  Ruth.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the other hand, the nature of the appliance standards program may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imply that a household average required rate of return, whether based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual appliance purchase decisions (in the absence of potential market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure distortions) or on comparable investments, may understate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate rate. Because the Act requires minimum standards, their effect is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally greater on the low-efficiency, low purchase-price end of the market,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sometimes eliminating the lowest-priced models. To the extent that low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households purchase a disproportionate share of these low-efficiency/low-price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliances, they will be disproportionately represented among the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, limited empirical research <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  suggests that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households exhibit higher-than-average discount rates (i.e., required rates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return) across all of their time-sensitive decisions, including (but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to) their appliance purchases. If, indeed, these households are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionately affected by standards, their discount rates would need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be given greater weight in determining the effects of alternative standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels on consumers. The Department seeks comment on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Train, Kenneth, Discount Rates in Consumers' Energy-Related Decisions: A Review of the Literature; Energy, December 1985. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the information now available, it appears that the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer discount rate lies in the range of 4 to 10 percent. As discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the Department has used a 6 percent consumer discount rate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses in this rulemaking. The Department has conducted sensitivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses using the 4 to 10 percent range and will continue to solicit data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments that would provide a better basis for the derivation of consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discount rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commercial discount rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a discount rate that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable in the fluorescent ballast analysis, the Department believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one based on consumer expenses is inappropriate; the rate should be based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs in the commercial sector, since fluorescent lamp ballasts are purchased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for use primarily in that sector. In developing a rate for use in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial sector, the Department considered a procedure similar to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure used to develop a consumer discount rate, and examined possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods of financing purchases of more efficient lighting equipment. One such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method would be to finance a loan. For the most credit-worthy customers, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prime rate of interest would be applicable. Tables 15 and 21 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRI/McGraw-Hill  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review of the U.S. Economy; Long-Range Focus; Winter 1990&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> presented forecasts of prime interest rates and percentage changes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer price index (CPI) for each year between 1995 and 2015. During this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, the prime rate is expected to be fairly stable, ranging from 8.37  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent to 8.50 percent. The changes in the consumer price index are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected to range from 3.88 percent to 4.90 percent. The resulting real  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates of interest are projected to range from 3.55 percent in 2014 to 4.64  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent in 1995, with a 21-year average of 3.85 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

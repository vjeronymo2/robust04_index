			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO WHAT'S THE BIG JOKE FOR TODAY?;  </P> <P> CHILDREN: WHAT KIDS THINK IS FUNNY DEPENDS ON THEIR AGE. AS A CHILD STRUGGLES  TO DEVELOP NEW SKILLS, THE JOKES AND GAMES THAT TICKLE HIS FUNNY BONE CHANGE.  </P> <P> What makes children laugh tells us a great deal about what's on their minds and  their level of development, according to Lawrence Kutner, a clinical  psychologist and associate professor of public health at the University of  Minnesota.  </P> <P> "The specific things children laugh at tell us which developmental tasks they  are struggling with," says Kutner, author of "Parent &amp; Child: Getting  Through to Each Other" (William Morrow and Co., 1991, $18.95). "That explains  why 3-year-olds, who are mastering toilet training, love bathroom humor.  Seven-year-olds, who aren't worried about toilet training anymore, think  'potty' jokes are just stupid."  </P> <P> It also explains why peek-a-boo makes a toddler laugh. Kutner says babies learn  some very complex things during their first year, including the fact that  objects and people exist even when they can't be seen. While a baby is learning  this, peek-a-boo is fraught with tension and excitement. He's pretty sure Mom  is still there and will come back, but he's not certain. When she does  reappear, the baby laughs with relief and glee. He can predict the future. What  was scary is now fun.  </P> <P> "But if Mom keeps her face hidden for too long," Kutner says, "the child's  tension will turn to fear, and he'll cry."  </P> <P> Once children grasp a new concept, they love to play with it. That's why  2-year-olds go for combinations of words and nonsense syllables. "They've  learned to tell the words from the nonsense," says Kutner. "Nonsense words are  sounds that are out of place. They're funny."  </P> <P> Similarly, putting mittens on hands isn't funny. But putting a mitten on his  nose is hysterical to a 2-year-old because he knows it doesn't belong there.  He's done it on purpose to be silly. He's learned to make a joke.  </P> <P> A 6-year-old, struggling to master logic and abstract ideas, finds riddles and  jokes full of mismatched combinations, plays on words or logical flaws to be  her favorites. "Why did the elephant wear blue sneakers?" "So he could hide in  the blueberry bush."  </P> <P> The elephant who thinks he can blend into the blueberries by making part of  himself blue doesn't understand something that the child does. "It's a funny  image to 6-year-olds because they can imagine and identify with the elephant  who is trying in vain to hide," says Kutner. "The small child knows more than  the big elephant."  </P> <P> The innocent tone of children's jokes changes toward the end of grade school.  By the time boys are 10, they are telling jokes that are very physically  violent and very sexual. Girls that age like humor that is verbally aggressive,  perhaps because they often have better verbal skills than boys. They may tease  each other about boyfriends.  </P> <P> While the kids' jokes may seem quite different to their parents and teachers,  boys and girls use humor to do the same things. When an 11-year-old boy  snickers at a joke about rape or prostitution, he's not making a judgment about  those topics. Sexual issues are much too stressful for him to deal with  directly. "The child uses the joke to check out what feelings and behaviors are  acceptable," says Kutner. "He can try out a position and, if necessary, back  away fast."  </P> <P> Jokes can serve another purpose at this age as well. They can be like team  sweat shirts, letting the other children know who belongs and who doesn't.  Those who "get" a particular joke are in the group; those who don't aren't.  </P></p>

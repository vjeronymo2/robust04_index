			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks by Noboru Hatakeyama, deputy vice </F> minister of international trade and industry until recently, at  an interview with an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter;  place and date not given]    [Text] Partly as a congratulatory gesture to the new  administration, the United States has softened its tough  attitude toward Japan. Behind this is the realization that  Japan would never accept numerical targets, and apprehensions  over the recent trend of yen appreciation and comprehensive  dollar depreciation. Dollar depreciation will trigger a drop in  U.S. bonds and stocks, and bring about a rise in interest rates.  If interest rates go up, U.S. President Bill Clinton's  reelection strategy of maintaining low interest rates to sustain  economic growth will be undermined. Such a change of U.S.  attitude is also partly a result of domestic considerations in  the United States.    Japan and the United States will start negotiations to  resume  the economic framework talks this week. The key to successful  negotiations is Japan's macroeconomic policies, including  sustained income tax reduction. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  should exercise leadership to make the decision to continue  substantial tax cuts beyond 1994, and implement additional  public investments before the end of June. Of course, finding  revenue sources for this will be difficult, but I do not think  it is necessary to come up with a concrete figure for the  politically unpopular consumption tax hike.    If prior consultations on macroeconomic policies are  successful, the framework talks can be resumed before the end of  June, and there is a strong possibility that an agreement may be  reached in automobiles and the two other priority sectors during  the summit meeting in early July. As to negotiations on  specific sectors, Japan should not change its position of  rejecting numerical targets because such a demand is absurd, in  the first place.    If, due to the political situation, a decision on sustained  tax cuts could not be made, and an agreement on macroeconomic  policies could not be reached by the end of June, there will be  no progress in negotiations on specific sectors as well. Since  Japan's surplus essentially has to do with macroeconomic  policies, the United States will not be content merely with an  agreement on specific sectors. Furthermore, since Japan is also  saying it wants to resolve the trade imbalance, it would not be  logical to go ahead with negotiations in the specific sectors.    After June, the right timing for Japan to arrive at a  conclusion on tax cuts will be around December. Although the  United States has set the deadline for identifying priority  countries to negotiate with under the Super 301 provision of the  Omnibus Trade Act (on the identification of and sanctions  against countries guilty of unfair trade practices) in  September, Japan should formulate its policies according to its  own domestic schedule. If Japan tries to deal with this matter  before the end of September, it would only prove that the Super  301 provision is effective. Even for the sake of other  countries, Japan should absolutely refrain from doing this.</p>

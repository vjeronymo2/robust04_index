			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Observer: Like father, like son? James Packer, Cameron O'Reilly and now Lachlan Murdoch. One by one the next generation of media tycoons are being tested out quietly in various parts of their families' Australian newspaper businesses. When Rupert Murdoch took the helm of the struggling Adelaide News in 1953 few would have predicted that he would end up far more powerful than his late father, Sir Keith Murdoch. The same goes for Kerry Packer who inherited Consolidated Press from Sir Frank Packer. Despite being a ferocious gambler, he is now Australia's richest man and few dare cross him. Will James Packer, or Lachlan Murdoch, out-shine their fathers? Cameron O'Reilly, 29, who runs Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial Newspapers, has the least downside risk. His father is a recent entrant to the media game and has yet to make his mark. Jamie Packer, 26, has an advantage in that he is Kerry Packer's only son and heir to a fortune estimated at Dollars 2.3bn. However, the speed with which young Warwick Fairfax lost his family business shows what can happen to prodigal sons. Princeton-educated Lachlan Murdoch, 22, who starts today as general manager of Queensland Newspapers, is not the first Murdoch offspring in the family business. Elisabeth, 26, his elder sister, runs a couple of TV stations in the US, and another brother, James, 21, is still at Harvard. However, Lachlan has been put to work in a part of the group which has always been close to the heart of his father and grand-father, and he will be watched over by Ken Cowley, one of Rupert Murdoch's most trusted lieutenants. Which of the three will stay the course, let alone win the race to inherit their families' growing media empires, is anybody's guess. But it will be fun to watch.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Berisford Pounds 5.8m in red after provision Berisford International, the former commodities and property group which paid Pounds 56m for the Magnet kitchen and joinery business in March, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.8m for the half year to March 31 compared with profits of Pounds 400,000. The result was after a Pounds 9.7m provision covering the write-off of Bristar Trading, Berisford's cocoa trading associate. If any cash is recouped from this business it will come back through the profit and loss account. At the operating level Berisford achieved profits of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 1.5m losses). Magnet contributed Pounds 1.4m of the profit, but Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, stressed that March was traditionally Magnet's best month as January sales turned into profits. Even so, Mr John Sclater, chairman, remained confident of predicting the payment of a final dividend. Turnover rose to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 47.3m) with Magnet contributing Pounds 16.9m. Losses per share were 4.4p (0.2p earnings). Since the half-year end, Mr Bowkett said, Magnet had remained profitable in spite of a repositioning programme in April and May when advertising was stopped. Branches now served both trade and retail customers and ranges had been rationalised. Magnet's workforce had been cut from 2,600 to 2,000, with 400 jobs going in the shops and 130 in the factories. More than Pounds 4m had been invested in new kitchen manufacturing equipment. One new outlet has been opened while Berisford has identified 50 places where it could open branches. The group is also continuing to realise some 'old Berisford' assets, including properties with a book value of Pounds 16m. It aims to retain its US agribusinesses, although these are expected to incur losses in the second half, in order to protect its US tax losses which total Pounds 434m. A senior executive is being posted to New York to search out an acquisition in the US. Following the rights issue, which funded the Magnet purchase, net cash was Pounds 53.8m at March 31, which has since risen to Pounds 54.7m, and net assets were Pounds 214.7m. Mr Robert Pritzker, has resigned as a non-executive director, although his brother Jay is remaining on the board. The two are large shareholders in the group.</p>

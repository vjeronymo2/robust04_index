The source said that Chu went back to his country ostensibly  to attend celebrations for the 52nd birthday of Kim Chong-il,  son and heir-apparent of President Kim Il-song, on Feb. 16. But  in fact, Chu was recalled by his home government to discuss  problems related to the nuclear issue and the planned visit to  China by South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, the source said,  asking for anonymity.    "Judging by past experience, Chu will hold a press  conference  as soon as he returns to Beijing and discuss North Korea's  position on pending issues," the source said.    If the ambassador does so, part of North Korea's nuclear  strategy may be revealed, he added.    During Chu's absence, Pae Yong-chae, a councilor for  political affairs at the North Korean embassy, attended a  commemorative event for the 35th annniversary of the North  Korea-China Cultural Cooperation Treaty held in Beijing Tuesday.</p>

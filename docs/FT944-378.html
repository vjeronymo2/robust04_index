			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: ITT in focus ITT, the company that was once the arch conglomerate, now preaches the virtues of focus. Indeed, after the disposal of its non-insurance financial services activities, it will be more focused than at any time in its recent history. It has taken Mr Rand Araskog 15 years as chairman to get to this point, but shareholders should be pleased. In the past month ITT's stock has climbed by more than 10 per cent, or 8 per cent against the market, as investors have taken in the implications of the withdrawal from financial services. The move brings in net cash of Dollars 3bn to Dollars 3.5bn and leaves the group with three well-defined legs: manufacturing, insurance and leisure. In spite of the new focus ITT concedes that there is no special synergy between these businesses, and the group's rating suffers a 'conglomerate discount'. Analysts suggest the value of the individual parts could be as much as Dollars 130 a share, compared with Dollars 87 now. Earlier this year, ITT itself raised the tantalising prospect of a break-up. A self-sponsored dismemberment would undoubtedly be in shareholders' interests. There is a risk, though, that ITT's break with the past is less pronounced than recent transactions suggest. The Dollars 1.7bn purchase of the Caesars World gaming group, announced just before Christmas, makes eminent sense since the fit with ITT's Sheraton hotels is excellent. Less logical is the proposed acquisition of the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment company, a move which provoked an 8 per cent fall in ITT's share price in the week it was announced. At least the group decided not to diversify into the risky broadcast television sector. That would have represented an unwelcome return to old-style ITT behaviour, where expansion took precedence over the pursuit of shareholder value.</p>

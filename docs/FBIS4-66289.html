			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Charities have staged  a comeback in China after a lapse of two decades.    Recently, the official PEOPLE'S DAILY carried an article to  say that charity is no longer a forbidden word, indicating an  immediate development of charities in the country.    Shanghai, the country's biggest metropolis, established its  charity foundation earlier this week, following the first  non-governmental charity organization, which was set up in  northeast China's Liaoning Province.    The focus of attention even in its preparatory period, the  foundation received six million yuan in donations through  various channels in a week prior to its founding.    Two brothers from east China's Anhui Province have  contributed 3,700 yuan to the foundation, which they were  awarded for responding courageously to save drowning people.    Charity campaigns have swung through the country since last  year.    When a helping-the-orphans event was initiated in Hangzhou  City in east China's Zhejiang Province, over 7,000 people swung  into action, donating a million yuan and adopting more than 50  homeless children.    In the capital Beijing, hospitals sponsored a "love and  health" activity, giving free treatment and operations to 24  orphans.    This year, Shanghai has launched several projects to extend  a  warm hand to the disabled, residents in poverty and homeless  children. Now, there are about 32,000 such people under social  care.    Many people consider charities to be noble endeavors which  mark civilized society, especially in China, a country with the  largest population of 1.2 billion and one of the fastest growing  economies in the world.</p>

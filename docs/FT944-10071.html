			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Funny old game, football: Nick Hornby argues that match rigging allegations strike at the heart of soccer On the night of May 26 1989, Arsenal, my team, played Liverpool at Anfield in the last game of that season's championship programme. Liverpool were top of the English first division, and Arsenal were second. If, however, Arsenal could win by two goals, then the positions would be reversed, and Arsenal would win their first championship title for 18 years. It was a tall order. Arsenal hadn't won at Anfield for nearly two decades, and Liverpool only lost at home once every two or three seasons. They never lost a game that really meant something. Incredibly, however, Arsenal did it. With almost the last kick of the game, a young Arsenal player called Michael Thomas beat Liverpool's goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar to score the second goal that his team so desperately needed, and Arsenal fans and players exploded with a jubilation that none of us could have felt before or since. Ambitions change and disappear as one gets older, but wanting Arsenal to win the championship had remained a constant in my life throughout childhood and adolescence and adulthood. Only in sport can ambitions be realised in a split second, when all hope appears to have gone. That is one of sport's glories. Five years later, I still get goose pimples when I think about Michael Thomas's goal, and I know that I am not the only one. 'You couldn't have scripted a moment like that,' journalists and commentators said over and over again, with disbelieving shakes of the head. 'Nobody would believe it.' But what if it had been scripted? What if at least one of the players on the pitch knew the outcome of the game even before it had begun? There has been no suggestion that this was one of the games Grobbelaar is alleged to have 'thrown', and it is unlikely that anyone would choose to influence the result of such a high-profile game, if only because the legitimate rewards on offer would outweigh any illegal inducements. But how many football fans, on hearing this week's news, found themselves thinking back to a night of glory or an afternoon of misery, and wondering whether the subsequent depression or jubilation had been provoked, not by the mystery and beauty of the game, but by the contents of a brown paper bag in a hotel room? A pundit suggested on TV one night this week that the accusations against Grobbelaar were in a sense immaterial. Whatever the outcome, Grobbelaar, he argued, was obviously an individual, isolated case, and football fans were far more concerned about football's endemic corruption, the rake-offs and tax fiddles and falsification of receipts. That is nonsense. We know that football is a dirty sport; a big, almost ungovernable business in which players that most people have never heard of are sold for millions of pounds which we never see again. We know that dodgy agents take huge cuts from huge salaries; that managers are offered inducements to sell their best players; that serious money changes hands in motorway service stations. We know all this, and we don't care, really; we kid ourselves that much of it is done for the good of the team. If a club promises an interest-free loan to a player, and then conveniently forgets to reclaim the money, it is only because the player will help shore up a leaky defence, or end that chronic goal-scoring problem; we care only about what happens on the pitch, about strikers and results and cups. But once we begin to doubt that what we are seeing is real, then we will cease to care - and without the caring, it is all over. If Bruce Grobbelaar is guilty, it is difficult to see how the game will ever fully recover. Already people are making other allegations, about other players. It matters not at all whether these claims are true or false. It only takes the proving of one allegation to leave us doubting what we see. I was at last Sunday's Arsenal game, at which they drew 0-0 with Sheffield Wednesday. I had a thoroughly miserable afternoon watching two poor teams fail to produce so much as a shot on goal for long stretches of the match. I came home frustrated and gloomy. Arsenal quite regularly draws nil-all, so I was not suspicious in any way. In fact, it is hard to believe that anyone with any kind of business sense would have paid my team not to score, since they usually need no inducement of any kind to do this - one might as well slip a cat a few quid to make it sleep in front of a fire. But there was at least one small boy, the eight-year-old nephew of a friend, who was visiting the Highbury ground for the first time last Sunday, and it is unlikely that his interest would survive if he thought that players could be paid not to play. I stuck with football throughout the 1970s and early 1980s when large numbers of people stopped attending games because they were afraid that they might get beaten up. I was not deterred by the tragedy at the Heysel stadium, nor by the subsequent ban on English clubs in European football, nor by the Taylor Report, which has introduced all-seater stadiums and changed the atmosphere beyond recognition. I have never previously been able to imagine the circumstances in which I would give up my season ticket and stay at home on Saturday afternoons, but I can now. If it turns out that players who earn between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 500,000 a year just from their on-field activities have been taking bribes, then we might as well all watch wrestling instead, because at least we know that wrestling is pure theatre. Only the very, very stupid would get goose-pimples from Hulk Hogan's performances; at the moment, it is every football fan's fear that we have been doing exactly that.

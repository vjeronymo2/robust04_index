			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Jakarta's push for growth is postponed: Emerging problems for Indonesia's economy TWO YEARS ago, Indonesians referred to 'the take-off era' as being a matter of fact and only months away. But a rapid push towards a developed economy has become a more distant ambition as the country tackles reality. After tremendous growth and economic liberalisation, Indonesia faces long-term problems that are products of its size, diversity and ethnic composition and other short-term ones derived largely from the speed of its economic success. It is also entering an uncertain time as it awaits a decision from President Suharto, who is 70 years old and has been in office for 25 years, on whether he will stand for a further five-year term next year. There is every indication that he will. Whether he stays or goes, the government, with one eye on developments in eastern Europe, knows that pressures for change to the rigid and authoritarian political system are likely to grow. The military, which has been the president's principal power base and has had a guaranteed role in political decision making, the government administration and the economy, is having to face the fact that it is not ideally equipped to hold such a position in the modern, industrialised nation that Indonesia is striving to become. Mr Jusuf Wanandi, who heads the Jakarta based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, says: 'In a modern society the armed forces' role has to change. You can't be the best artillery man in town and the best politician.' Political certainty has been important to Indonesia in its drive for foreign investment and aid since the late 1960s. General elections in June, though billed locally as 'the feast of democracy', are unlikely to provide any upset. Golkar, the part political party-part bureaucratic organisation which is in effect a government election machine, will win, though possibly not with quite as much as the 73 per cent of the vote it received five years ago. Questions about Indonesia's political future are mounting just as its leaders are beginning to confront economic realities. The remarkable success in diversifying the Indonesian economy after oil prices crashed in the mid-1980s has prepared the ground for a modern export-led economy, but it has also created new pressures and drawn attention to obstacles. After big increases in foreign investment and imports just as non-oil exports growth was slowing, the World Bank said in its annual report on Indonesia last year, 'developments during 1990 demonstrate how aggregate demand pressures could build up and generate balance of payments difficulties and inflationary pressures.' Inflation in 1991 was nearly 10 per cent and the current account deficit rose to over Dollars 5bn, almost double the previous year's figure. A tight money policy sent interest rates soaring, contributing to a rapid fall of the fledgling stock market. Infrastructure problems, most particularly the lack of electric power on the main industrialised island of Java, have become increasingly acute. Indonesia has Dollars 70bn in foreign debt. The World Bank said sustained growth will require 'continued high levels of financial support from the donor community'. Indonesia's technocrat managers are aware that they have to act to get things under control and some difficult decisions have been made. Last October, about Dollars 80bn worth of planned infrastructural and petrochemical projects were cancelled because of concerns about the amount of foreign borrowing that would be needed to finance them. The 1992-93 budget announced earlier this year also sought to bring the economy into line and contained no pre-election give-aways. On the contrary, taxes and tax collection are to be enhanced in an effort to promote greater self-reliance. Foreign borrowing will be cut by 8 per cent, fuel subsidies will be abolished and the real increase in spending is to be kept to a modest 3 per cent. The more intractable long-term problems, however, are difficult to address. The government has the constant headache of finding jobs for the more than 2m people who enter the workforce every year and, more significantly, of educating and training them in skills needed in an industrial economy. Technical training is poor and good quality managers are hard to find. As a result, Indonesia attracts investors in labour intensive industries such as textiles and footwear where wages are low and where the workforce can contribute little in terms of purchasing power. Indonesia's geography also presents problems. In Jakarta, the growing number of glittering office blocks reflect Indonesia's new economic sophistication. But more than 2,000 miles away in the province of Irian Jaya, naked tribespeople wander the rugged mountains barely ekeing out a living. Bringing those people and others scattered in isolation around the huge archipelago into the development process is a daunting task. Telecommunications, transport and electricity links are poor to non-existent in some provinces. The heavily centralised political system means decision making is slow and regional needs are often misunderstood. Dr Doradjatun Kuntjoro Jakti, an economist at the University of Indonesia, says there is a need to use tax and trade incentives to create special areas for development in places such as Irian. 'We should give them special status to capitalise on the rise of the Pacific era' he says. Disparities in wealth are not only regional. The growing 'social gap' between the new rich and the poor is a cause for concern most particularly because it fuels existing ethnic tensions. Most of Indonesia's big business conglomerates are owned by members of the small ethnic Chinese community and resentment of their wealth among indigenous or pribumi Indonesians runs high. The Chinese are well aware of that and of the fact that when an attempted communist coup triggered a wave of bloody vengeance in 1965 their race was singled out for attack. The temptation to deposit their wealth outside Indonesia is therefore difficult to resist.</p>

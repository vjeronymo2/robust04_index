			<p>CSO     [Summary] On 11 March, the Jinan Railway Transport  Intermediate Court publicly sentenced 21 members of a  drug-smuggling ring to death, life imprisonment, or set terms of  imprisonment. The gang was engaged in the cultivation,  processing, and trafficking of drugs, and over 110 persons were  involved in the case. On 6 October 1991, police at the Xuzhou  railway station arrested Xue Xibin [5641 0823 2430], a factory  worker in Donghai County, carrying 350 g of opium. This led to  a two-year investigation by a special task force set up by the  Jinan Railway Public Security Bureau and the Xuzhou Railway  Public Security Office. The investigation revealed that since  May 1990, Xue, his partners Wang Ping [3769 1627] and Liu Sicang  [0491 1835 0221] (both also from Donghai county), and others had  been engaged in opium trafficking using the rail system, selling  a total of 20,075.5 g in Henan and other areas. With the  approval of the Supreme People's Court, Xue, Wang, and Liu were  sentenced to death. Two gang members received the death penalty  with a suspended sentence, while 16 others received either life  imprisonment or sentences ranging from two to 15 years.</p>

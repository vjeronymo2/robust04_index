			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 15 KYODO -- The leader of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called for Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday [15 March] to present the  Diet with a receipt to verify that he repaid a loan of 100  million yen which he received from a parcel delivery firm.    Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP's Diet Policy Affairs  Committee, told a party panel of directors that Hosokawa had  claimed "he repaid 100 million yen by 10 installments," but the  panel never received any proof. "Hosokawa should present us  with a detailed copy of at least one installment," said Ozato.    He said the LDP has sought verification that Hosokawa repaid  his debts to the scandal-tained Sagawa Kyubin Co. as a condition  of opening deliberations of the House of Representatives budget  committee.    Meanwhile, Hosokawa told his coalition partners on Tuesday  afternoon that he has already released all documents in  connection with the Sagawa Kyubin case.    The LDP has demanded that the prime minister's former  secretary testify to the Diet as a sworn-in witness to verify  that he did not receive a backhand political donation from  Sagawa Kyubin Co.    Hosokawa has indirectly acknowledged that he received 100  million yen from the firm in 1982, when he was governor of  Kumamoto Prefecture.    However, he has claimed that he repaid the loan, which he  said was used to purchase a condominium in central Tokyo, to  repair his home in Kumamoto and to fund a gubernatorial election  campaign in 1983.    Hosokawa served as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture for two  consecutive terms from 1983 until February 1991.    In the meantime, the lower house budget committee remained  idle Tuesday morning due to the LDP's refusal to attend.    In a related development, the governing coalition's  directors  of the lower house Diet affairs committee and their LDP  counterparts held a three-hour meeting in the Diet in an attempt  to break the deadlock and open deliberations.    After the meeting, Koken Nosaka, head of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) Diet administration committee, told  reporters he will ask Hosokawa to submit to the Diet proof that  he did not receive a backhand political donation from Sagawa  Kyubin Co.    Tomiichi Murayama, head of the SDP, the largest party in the  coalition, said it is not necessary for the prime minister's  former secretary to testify in the Diet as a sworn-in witness.    He said the Diet will be able to investigate the matter by  receiving satisfactory answers from Hosokawa himself.</p>

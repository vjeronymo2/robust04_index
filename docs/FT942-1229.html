			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Berlusconi goes into a minefield with aplomb Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's new tycoon premier, took a sure first step on to the European stage yesterday in spite of a modest attempt to trip him. Arriving at his first EU summit for the pre-meeting signings of an EU agreement with Russia and EU membership treaties with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, he faced an immediate snub. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's Socialist European affairs minister, who has played the lead role in his country's six-month presidency of the EU, greeted each of the arriving heads of government with a handshake, but then turned his back on Mr Berlusconi and left it to the Greek head of protocol to bring him in to the meeting. The Greek presidency denied it had withheld the normal greeting and added to the snubs Italian ministers have been getting from some of their colleagues because of Mr Berlusconi's inclusion of neo-fascists in his coalition. In so far as the head of protocol did his duty, the Greeks ate their cake and had it. But Mr Berlusconi was unfazed, appeared to sleep through most of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's speech, and signed each treaty with a great flourish and oversized B. Then, alone among the 12 leaders, he bounded over to Nordic and Alpine newcomers and shook each by the hand - seizing the photo-opportunity of visual endorsement by the squeaky-clean democrats from the north. He had begun his day at a 1 1/4 -hour breakfast with Mr John Major, the British prime minister. The UK, often isolated in EU affairs, is attracted by Rome's new Eurosceptical tone, and anxious to cement an alliance with it. The two agreed to hold an Anglo-Italian summit soon. British officials said Mr Major and Mr Berlusconi voiced 'a fair amount of very similar positions on the way to go' on deregulation, flexible labour markets, and on subsidiarity in EU decision-making. But they refused to comment on whether the Italian premier shared British distaste for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's federalist prime minister, who has been leading his fellow Christian Democrat rival, the outgoing Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, in the shadowy race to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president. Italian officials were more forthcoming, saying that London and Rome agreed the succession had been badly handled, and that it was not right for France and Germany, Mr Dehaene's powerful backers, to impose him on others. But Mr Berlusconi came to Corfu looking to bargain for a settlement of a long-running row over Italy's flouting of EU limits on milk production, and has threatened to hold up the EU budget increase planned for next year unless he gets satisfaction. He also wants EU backing for former Italian trade minister Renato Ruggiero to take over as head of the new World Trade Organisation next year. Some EU officials believe the Italian may have reached an understanding with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on this package at their recent meeting, in exchange for not blocking Mr Dehaene. Yet others predicted that Mr Berlusconi would wait to see who the majority backed, and then join it. But the Italian hand is only as strong as the way Mr Berlusconi plays it. To cash in on support for Mr Dehaene, Mr Berlusconi was going to need a strong feel for bluff, signals and timing. Mr Berlusconi risked raising Mr Lubbers' hopes and incurring blame for a failure to reach agreement. It usually takes a while to grasp the chemistry of the EU's negotiating and hostage-taking. And it would be an unusual man who got it right first time. Anglo-Irish talks, Page 7</p>

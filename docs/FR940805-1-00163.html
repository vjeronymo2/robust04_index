			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In reviewing the CPAA Act the question arises, under what circumstances is a person ``acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman''? The CPAA Act could be interpreted in a number of ways. In developing the interpretation that follows, we are mindful that it is to the advantage of the FAA, the public, and the NTSB for the applicability of the CPAA Act to be easy to understand and use in each case. It is also logical and advantageous for similar cases to be heard in the same forum, to the extent possible. Further, the reviewing forum does not affect whether a respondent is afforded full due process when a civil penalty is assessed: Under both the NTSB and the FAA procedures, the respondent is given an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge, an appeal within the respective agency, a right to petition the court of appeals to review any final adverse agency decision, and other procedural protections. The following interpretation was developed considering these factors, as well as relevant statutory construction principles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interpretation applies only to the applicability of the CPAA Act, and is not intended to affect the application of any other portion of the FAAct or the regulations administered by the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 901(a)(3)(D) of the FAAct provides a different administrative forum for adjudication in civil penalty assessment cases involving violations by a person ``acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman *&blank;*&blank;*.'' We have considered whether a person in this context must actually hold a pilot certificate to be ``acting in the capacity of a pilot.'' This phrase, however, describes the respondent by his or her activities, not by legal status. The dictionary definition of the word ``acting'' includes both ``holding a temporary rank or position'' and ``simulation.'' Webster's Third New International Dictionary 20 (1961). A person can simulate the capacity of a pilot without actually holding a pilot certificate, such as when operating in control of an aircraft without the appropriate airman certificates. The same is true for persons acting as flight engineers, mechanics, and repairmen. In each case a person can function as an airman (although in violation of the FAAct and the regulations), without holding an FAA certificate to do so. The FAA, therefore, interprets the CPAA Act not to require that a person hold a certificate in order to bring a civil penalty action under FAAct section 901(a)(3)(D). It is the nature of the activity that triggers the applicability of section 901(a)(3)(D), not the particular certificates held by the person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has considered the type of activities that may constitute ``acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman.'' The capacity of a pilot is defined in the FAAct and the regulations, most notably in Parts 61 and 91, where the privileges and duties are set forth. The capacity of the other airmen also is defined in the FAAct and the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``acting,'' of necessity, includes the failure to act as legally required. Thus, a pilot who refuses to present his or her pilot certificate for inspection on request by the Administrator under &sect;61.3(h) has acted (although improperly) in the capacity of a pilot. Acting in the capacity of an airman may also include failure to surrender an airman certificate when it is suspended or revoked, and any civil penalty action would be heard under the NTSB review procedures. See, &sect;&sect;61.19(f), 63.15(c), and 65.15(c). Note from these samples that the privileges and duties under the FAR extend beyond actually flying an aircraft or performing maintenance on an aircraft. The NTSB procedures are not limited to cases involving ``operational'' violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new procedures do not apply to an airman who is not acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman. For instance, a person who holds a pilot certificate, but refuses to submit to screening before entering a sterile area of an airport under &sect;107.20, is not acting in the capacity of a pilot. That rule applies to any passenger or other person entering a sterile area, not just pilots or persons operating aircraft. Any civil penalty action would be under the FAA review procedures in FAAct section 901(a)(3)(E). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, we have considered the extent of the respective airman's duties and privileges in conjunction with CPAA Act. For example, a flight instructor certificate is not a pilot certificate. A person must hold a pilot certificate, however, to obtain and to use a flight instructor certificate. See, &sect;&sect;61.183(c)(1) and 61.195(b). For purposes of the CPAA Act, any civil penalty action for violations by a person acting in the capacity of a flight instructor would be heard under the NTSB procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, a person must hold a mechanic certificate to obtain and to use an inspection authorization. See, &sect;&sect;65.91(c)(1) and 65.92(a). Any civil penalty action for violations by persons acting in the capacity of an authorized inspector would be heard under the NTSB review procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medical certificates are required for pilots and flight engineers, but also are required for flight navigators and air traffic control tower operators. Civil penalties for violations relating to medical certification by persons who are otherwise acting in the capacity of pilots or flight engineers would be heard under the NTSB review procedures; violations by other persons would be heard under the FAA procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sanction examples in this interpretation are only for purposes of explaining the interpretation, and do not necessarily reflect agency sanction policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA would welcome comments on this interpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

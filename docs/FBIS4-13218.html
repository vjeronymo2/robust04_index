			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Mourad Benachnou, the minister of industrial  restructuring and participation [former economy minister],  yesterday described his new duty as important. He said it will  be within the framework of reorganizing the economy on the basis  of the stability program, which was negotiated with the IMF.    Meanwhile, Benachnou affirmed the commitment of the new  Prime  Minister Mokdad Sifi to honor Algeria's international pledges.  He added that without restructuring the economy -- which is the  second stage of the government's policy after balancing finances  -- the stability program could never succeed. He said that  options that accommodate Algeria's social reality should be  found.    The prime minister, who installed Benachnou in his new duty,  said that the aim of creating this new ministry was to create a  new nucleus in order to restructure the economy along the path  of industrial restructuring and crossing into the market  economy.

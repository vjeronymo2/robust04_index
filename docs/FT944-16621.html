			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Chip operations break even a year early Siemens has reached the break-even level in its semi- conductor operations a year ahead of schedule as a result of the improved economic situation in Europe and its own cost-cutting programme, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. These activities have previously involved the group in heavy losses and restructuring costs. Mr Jurgen Knorr, director of the semiconductor division, called this 'a very good result' with new orders exceeding DM3bn (Dollars 1.9bn) in the year to September 30 1994, after DM2.6bn the previous year. He said the outlook for 1994-95 was very positive. Siemens expected to match growth in the semiconductor market, likely to be between 13 and 15 per cent. In south-east Asia and the US, the computer chip market should grow at twice this rate, he added. Investments in both areas would be increased, with a wafer plant in south-east Asia a possibility; Siemens currently makes wafers (used in semiconductor production) in Germany, France and Austria. Mr Knorr said the world semiconductor market should total about Dollars 77bn this year and nearly Dollars 100bn next year. He said memory chips were the biggest part of Siemens' semiconductor business, with application specific chips close behind; each accounted for about DM1bn of turnover.</p>

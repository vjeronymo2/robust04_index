			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Loved ones to exit the American way: US funeral operators are targeting the UK for growth The US company which laid to rest Elvis Presley, President J F Kennedy and Howard Hughes could soon be transforming Britain's sombre, dark-curtained parlours into brighter, breezier, money-spinning outlets. The UK funeral industry may not seem an obvious site for takeover battles: the death rate is falling steadily, and the depth of the recession has forced the conservative British funeral purveyor to offer competitive services. But this gloomy picture of the UK sector has not deterred the two largest funeral operators in North America from fighting for the UK's third-largest funeral business, Great Southern Group. Last week, the victor, Service Corporation International (SCI), also bought 3 per cent of the second-largest UK funeral company, Plantsbrook. Clearly the US operators see potential value in the businesses, which inevitably spells change for the traditionally low-profile world of British undertaking. 'I think the UK funeral business will change, because we will be there,' says Mr Robert Waltrip, SCI's chairman who transformed the company from a single family funeral parlour into the world's largest burier with 873 funeral homes. SCI's aggressive strategy of acquiring some 700 US competitors over a period of 30 years and applying economies of scale, has, in spite of declining numbers of US customers, provided strong profits growth. Between 1989 and 1993, SCI's net profit doubled to Dollars 103m. Mr Waltrip argues: 'Different nations have different religions, customs and languages, but most civilised nations bury the dead with some kind of ceremony. There is a place for a company like SCI worldwide.' He claims SCI's experiences in the US, where it handles burials for a diverse ethnic population from the Hispanic to the Jewish communities, equips it to spread its services overseas. But will he be able to translate the practices which Nancy Mitford satirised so mercilessly in The American Way of Death into the less showy and extravagant UK Way of Death? What may look to an outsider like an industry which has lain moribund for centuries, has, in fact, been undergoing something of a life-giving revolution over the past 10 years. Until the 1980s, the UK funeral business was seen as a profession rather than a business, a family concern passed down from father to son. But during that decade a handful of operators became aware of the potential for economies of scale in the industry. A funeral home has to carry large fixed costs such as hearses, embalming facilities and attendants. All of them are only periodically busy. UK companies recognised that they could reap enormous benefits from building up so-called 'clusters' - central facilities for hearses and attendants - to service a large group of funeral homes. At the same time, given the goodwill attached to small family businesses, their names and shop frontages could be retained. Soon, the frock-coats gave way to the pinstripes as businessmen such as Mr Howard Hodgson and Mr Michael Kenyon, two of the foremost UK funeral operators, pursued aggressive strategies to shake up the ranks of Britain's independent funeral concerns. Hodgson Holdings, a Birmingham-based listed company, bought several hundred independent funeral homes between mid-1986 and mid-1989, spending close to Pounds 40m on acquisitions. Mr Hodgson's buying spree was typical of the transformation taking place in the industry. As a result of the upheaval, almost 40 per cent of the UK's funeral business is today owned by three operators: Great Southern (5 per cent), Plantsbrook (9 per cent), and the Co-operative movement (25 per cent). By comparison, the three big players in the US, which also include Loewen Group and Stewart Enterprises, share 16 per cent of the far larger North American market; and the share is rising. SCI spent Dollars 175m on US acquisitions in the first half of this year alone, and now controls 9 per cent of the market. SCI and other US funeral companies benefit from a US regulatory regime which creates barriers to entry to any potential competitor, including foreign operators, by laying down tough licensing requirements. In the UK, by contrast, there are no barriers to entry in what is a 'people business': overseas corporate raiders face the threat of top employees from target companies setting up rival businesses overnight. But this has not deterred SCI, which wants to take an ever-bigger slice of the UK trade through its new UK arm, Great Southern. 'If I was in the private sector, I would be delighted at this (move by SCI),' said Mr Hodgson. 'Independent operators will either win funerals by saying to customers, 'Do you want your mother to be buried by a Texas cowboy?' or they will be offered more money (by US rivals) for their companies.' During the 1980s, Hodgson Holdings' aggressive takeover actions substantially drove up the prices of funeral homes. Mr Hodgson argues that SCI could be forced to pay similarly inflated prices for small, independent funeral homes as it builds up its UK presence. American funeral operators justify the high prices paid for UK rivals by pointing out that they will achieve greater operating efficiencies. SCI, for instance, says its principle of 'clusters' could easily be applied to inefficient UK family-run funeral operators. Besides exaggerated prices for parlours, operators face the broader problem of a falling UK death rate. For the past two decades the rate has fluctuated at 650,000 deaths a year, but is expected to continue its recent decline, falling by 3,000 to 626,000 in the year to June 1995. The Government Actuary, which projects births and deaths, is forecasting further declines to about 600,000 in 2010 when the deaths of the first of the so-called 'baby boomers' should provide a turnaround in the trend. By 2052, the death rate is forecast to peak at about 829,000 a year. For those in the funeral business, it is a long wait. But operators can use the intervening years to convince traditionally conservative British consumers to change their habits. First, they could persuade customers to choose more expensive caskets, rather than the plain coffins which, even at the top of the range, cost about Pounds 800. Americans routinely pay about Dollars 4,000 for a normal burial. In addition, 70 per cent of the UK population chooses cremation over burial - which is even cheaper. UK operators remain sceptical about SCI's hopes of narrowing the gap in spending between the two countries. But the US group points to its experiences in Australia, where it invested USDollars 102m in the acquisition of Pine Grove Funeral Group in July 1993. Since then it has maintained prices for merchandise while doubling the range of coffins. The result has been a 40 per cent increase at some homes in the average spend per funeral in the past year. 'We will never attempt to Americanise any country's customs,' says Mr Waltrip. 'We will just apply the same business concepts as we use in America such as 'clustering'. We would be crazy to change several hundred years of custom.' But he would like to sell more Dollars 95,000 caskets - like the one in which Elvis was buried.</p>

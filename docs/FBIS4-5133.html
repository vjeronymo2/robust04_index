			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta (JP) -- Golkar [Functional Group] must  be able to retain its independence from the government without  ever becoming an opposition force, Minister of Home Affairs Yogi  S. Memet says.    "Golkar cannot force itself to stand diametrically opposed  to  the government under the pretext of defending the public  interest, because that is essentially the role of the  government," Yogi said at a working conference of the ruling  political group.    "Yet, on the other hand, Golkar must not ever become the  government's mouthpiece in mobilizing support for its programs.    "Golkar as a socio-political organization has a different  function and mission than the government," he added.    "Golkar must play out its role as the force that develops  both the `bottom-up' and `top-down' approach to development,"  Yogi told the conference that is scheduled to wind up today.    Golkar must have the courage to take a leadership role in  many issues, he said.    Golkar has been criticized by its opponents for its lack of  independence from the government and the Armed Forces (ABRI).  [passage omitted]    In October, the group broke tradition by electing Harmoko, a  civilian, rather than a military man, as chairman.    Harmoko, better known a the information minister, has faced  dissension from some regional Golkar leaders in recent months  and this week's conference seeks to synchronize Golkar's  programs in central and regional boards.    Officials in Jakarta blamed this dissension on the lack of  discipline of its members, a theme that was also hammered home  by ABRI Chief General Feisal Tanjung in his address to the  conference yesterday.    Discipline is an essential criteria to measure the dynamics  of an organization, Feisal said. "It must not be viewed as  something which curbs freedom, creativity and human rights, but  rather it is a measure of a mature behavior which keeps the  organization solid and modern," he said.    All Golkar members must obey the rulings and procedures  underlined in Golkar's statutes, and they must remain loyal to  any decisions which have been reached through consensus.    This will prevent unnecessary dissension within Golkar in  the  future, he said.    Harmoko himself has warned that the central executive board  will not tolerate disciplinary problems and will punish members  who step out of line. [passage omitted]</p>

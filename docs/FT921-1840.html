			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Gould moves focus to poll-tax record LABOUR opened up a new campaign battleground yesterday when it turned its fire on the Conservatives' record on the poll tax. At the same time Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, unveiled the party's 'fair rates' plans. He claimed that the average household in England would pay Pounds 114 less under Labour than under the government's proposed council tax. Using the party's morning news conference to highlight the poll tax rates for 1992-93, now being announced by local councils, Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, described the Tory party as 'the poll tax party.' He went on to charge that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had claimed that he had been 'bounced' into backing the tax while arguing as recently as last Wednesday that the principle behind it had been correct. The Labour leader's attack was countered by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, who said that Mr Kinnock's alternative 'fair rates' plan conflicted with his claim in the 1980s that rates were the 'most unjust of all taxes'. Mr Heseltine added that residents in Labour boroughs paid on average Pounds 54 more than those living in Tory-controlled boroughs. Mr Gould said that on Labour's calculations, the council tax, due to replace the poll tax next year if the Conservatives are re-elected, would have resulted in a bill of Pounds 504 for the average property in England had it been in place for the 1992-93 financial year. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, argued that the Pounds 114 saving - taking the average bill to Pounds 390 - would come mainly from scrapping the single-person discounts payable under the Conservatives' plans. He estimated a saving of Pounds 53 from ending the discounts, plus an extra Pounds 32 from savings in administering and collecting Labour's less complex tax. The other Pounds 29 would come from discarding the government's proposed transitional relief scheme for those losing heavily from the change of tax. 'Poor widows will look on with amazement as single millionaires receive most help under the Conservatives' proposed discounts,' said Mr Blunkett. Labour's 'fair ates' require no system either for banding or for discounts. The savings claimed by Labour depend on three assumptions: that the council tax will require a register, that Labour would introduce 'fair rates' without transitional relief, and that there would be no discounts for at least the poorer single-person households. Mr Heseltine has denied that the discounts would require a register. It is also unlikely that Labour would introduce rates with no transitional relief or rebates for single-person households. The real saving might, therefore, be considerably less than Pounds 114. However, Labour claims that its rebate system would be more generous for the same cost as the government's.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LABOUR'S PROPOSALS FOR NEW RATING SCHEME Calculations based on two-adult household  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Labour     Saving from    Saving from                          proposal    council tax      poll tax                          (pounds)      (pounds)       (pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING GAINERS COMPARED TO COUNCIL TAX City of London              211          2,157           149 Kensington/Chelsea          302            685           156 Hammersmith/Fulham          407            648            93 Leicester                   326            618           376 Greenwich                   355            585            62  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING LOSERS COMPARED TO COUNCIL TAX Rochester                   287           (252)          (92) Broadland                   415           (126)          104 Castle Point                513           (108)           33 Huntingdonshire             377            (95)           49 Chelmsford                  488            (80)           36  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Labour     Saving from    Saving from                          proposal      poll tax     council tax                          (pounds)      (pounds)       (pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING GAINERS COMPARED TO POLL TAX Liverpool                   343            457           215 Blackburn                   358            405           446 Lambeth                     440            403           527 Tameside                    306            386           113 Rochdale                    300            376           217  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LOSERS COMPARED TO POLL TAX  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wandsworth                  255           (255)           68 Westminster                 205           (133)          316 Rochester                   287            (92)         (252)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Labour party  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

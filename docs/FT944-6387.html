			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Beating the slump and the yen: A Japanese company's export route to survival In Katsuta city, just north of Tokyo, the head office of Suzuki Manufacturing, a medium-sized maker of printed circuit boards, is buzzing with activity. The brisk pace of business Suzuki has seen over the past two years contrasts with many of its fellow manufacturers in the industrial heartland of Ibaraki Prefecture. The region is dominated by subcontractors that have long depended on jobs created by Hitachi, Japan's largest electric machinery maker, and its group companies. As Japan's economic slump and the 24 per cent appreciation of the yen against the dollar have squeezed profits at Hitachi, many of the region's smaller companies are finding themselves having to look elsewhere for work. Unlike the majority of suppliers in the region which have suffered from tying their fortunes too closely to a Japanese parent company, which in turn has been hurt by the high yen, Suzuki is riding a wave of success by exporting most of its output. Indeed, over the past several years Suzuki (no relation of Suzuki Motor) has reduced its dependence on Japanese customers and in spite of the high yen environment has been able to sell 99 per cent of what it makes to overseas customers. 'In the home market business began to drop off about two years ago,' says Ms Man Ling Chang, manager of the overseas sales section. 'There is no business in Japan,' she says. While demand in Japan has dried up, Suzuki has been able to take advantage of strong demand overseas, specifically for the printed circuit boards for cellular phones that the company specialises in. Its main customers include world-famous names in the cellular phones market such as Motorola of the US and Sweden's Ericsson. The company's success in supplying overseas customers has been such that at a time when the majority of internationally active Japanese companies have embarked on wide-ranging rationalisation measures and have shifted production to lower-cost countries, Suzuki has not had to cut its workforce nor move production overseas. 'We manufacture everything in Japan,' proclaims Mr Yoshihiro Koyama, director of Suzuki's Sawa plant. Suzuki has found strong overseas demand even in the high-yen environment because it had a product and technology that few others in the world can provide. The specialised printed circuit board it makes through a demanding process 'is something that can be made in no other Asian country yet', says Ms Chang. Four years ago, the company had a very different structure. Then, Suzuki made hard disk drives and printed circuit boards for computers and 50 per cent of its business came from domestic customers. These products, however, have low value added and are price competitive. Prices in the hard disk drive market, for example, are negotiated four times a year, Mr Koyama says. With the yen's appreciation Japanese makers of hard disk drives and PCBs for computers have been devastated by competitors in Taiwan and Korea, where labour costs are one-third those in Japan. Suzuki Manufacturing avoided the fate of many in the industry by shifting quickly to higher value-added PCBs for the cellular phone market. The speed with which it acted on that decision has given it a lead in a market that is surging on the back of growing demand for cellular phones in industrialised markets. Suzuki's management also had the foresight to look outside Japan for growth at an early stage, rather than follow the common Japanese practice of targetting the home market first. It helped that Mr Katsuzo Suzuki, president, began building business ties in the US, where he had studied, long before the yen rose above Y100 to the dollar. The latest corporate results from Japanese companies indicate that many Japanese companies much larger than Suzuki Manufacturing have likewise benefited from the strength of demand overseas. In the electronics industry, for instance, manufacturers from NEC to Sharp, have been able to report improved profits thanks in large part to strong demand for semiconductors and liquid crystal display panels triggered by the buoyant US and south-east Asian economies. Japanese motor companies have also been helped by the strength of the US economy. The shift to a higher value-added product is not enough to beat the impact of the yen's appreciation, Mr Koyama says. To remain competitive against Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers it is necessary to make higher value-added products in volume, he says. With the yen's rise forcing many companies to move production overseas, 'Japan's manufacturing industry is in chaos', Mr Koyama says. But if the example of Suzuki Manufacturing is anything to go by, the challenge presented by the yen's appreciation is forcing many Japanese manufacturers to become even more competitive than ever.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> WITH ANOTHER 64, SIMPSON'S GAME SURE ISN'T MICKEY MOUSE  </P> <P> Tim Simpson continued to blister par in the Disney Golf Classic on Thursday,  adding a second-round 64 to an identical opening score for a 36-hole total that  was 16 strokes under par and four in front of Paul Azinger.  </P> <P> "I'm playing pretty darn good," said Simpson, who made seven birdies, an eagle  and a bogey on the 7,190-yard Magnolia Course.  </P> <P> He credited a change in his putting style Tuesday for much of his success.  </P> <P> The low round of the day was a 63 by Tom Byrum.  </P> <P> Simpson's 128 total ties similar low 36-hole scores by Jose Maria Olazabal and  Peter Persons earlier this year on the PGA Tour.  </P> <P> Azinger had a 65 Thursday to go with his first-round 67 and is four shots  behind the leader.  </P> <P> Also turning in 65s were Bob Gilder, Kenny Perry, Davis Love III, Gene Sauers  and Bob Lohr.  </P> <P> Gilder, Perry, Sauers and Love were five shots behind Simpson, along with Byrum  and John Mahaffey (66). Lohr was one shot farther back at 134.  </P> <P> "I remained patient today," Simpson said. "It took nine holes to get  comfortable. But when you get it going, you feel like Rocky."  </P> <P> His eagle came on the par-five 10th hole, where he hit a three-wood 243 yards  into the wind for his second shot and then holed out with a sand wedge from 35  yards.  </P> <P> Fellow pro and friend Morris Hatalsky worked with Simpson to change to a more  upright putting stance and a slower stroke.  </P> <P> Azinger, who had seven birdies in his 65, said: "I was very solid tee to green.  I was really close all the way. I felt I could have birdied every hole except  seven and nine."  </P></p>

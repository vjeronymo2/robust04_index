			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Jianxiong (2621 0256 7160)] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- Chen Jian,  China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations,  said here today: The UN Security Council [UNSC] must bear  responsibility to all member nations when performing its duties,  and reflect the member nations' collective and common wishes.    Chen Jian made the statement at the UN General Assembly's  [UNGA] working group meeting on "The Issue of Fair Distribution  of UNSC Seats and Increase of the Number of Members." The  working group is currently discussing issues concerning  relations of the UNSC with the UNGA and the vast number of  member nations, as well as ways for improving the UNSC's work.    Chen Jian said: The "UN Charter" stipulates that the UNSC is  representing member nations in performing its duty of  safeguarding international peace and security. This is the  power entrusted by member nations to the UNSC as well as the  UNSC's commitment to them.    He said: The objective to be reached during the working  group's discussion on the UNSC's work should be one that urges  the UNSC to faithfully implement the stipulations of the "UN  Charter." He felt efforts should be put on these four aspects:    1. The UNSC must strictly abide by the aim and principle of  the "UN Charter," particularly the principle of respecting state  sovereignty, not interfering in domestic affairs, and solving  international disputes with peaceful means.    2. Principal UN organizations such as the UNSC and UNGA  should first perform their respective duties. Meanwhile, they  should strengthen cooperation and coordination among themselves  as well as properly handle relations between various  organizations so as to jointly fulfill the aim of the Charter.    3. The UNSC should increase the transparency of its work,  realistically strengthen contacts between the vast number of  member nations, as well as further upgrade the authoritativeness  of its decisions. The UNSC should listen widely to opinions  from all sides, particularly opinions of concerned parties,  countries, and organizations in regions to ensure that its  decisions are solidly based.    4. The UNSC should improve its work methods and efficiency.  While maintaining efficiency, it is essential for the UNSC to  adopt realistic and feasible approaches to improve its work  methods.    Chen Jian added: The Chinese delegation hopes the UNSC will,  based on current discussions, absorb rational and useful  suggestions forwarded by the vast number of member nations as  well as further improve its work methods and style, so as to  bring into play a more constructive and active role in  safeguarding international peace and security.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Barings 'pleased' to have kept profit flat at Pounds 42.5m BARINGS, the owner of Baring Brothers, the City of London merchant bank, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 42.5m in 1991, barely changed from the Pounds 42.4m it made in 1990. 'We are pleased with the result,' said Mr Peter Baring, chairman. 'The operating environment was not universally friendly.' Profits from two of the firm's core activities - advising companies and trading in Far Eastern shares - were lower than in the previous year. But this fall was offset by strong performances from its funds management subsidiary and from the capital markets and treasury operations. Mr Baring also pointed out that the company's losses from its loans and leases were small, almost the same as in 1990. Provisions to cover the risk of bad debts were 'in the low few millions (of pounds)'. Barings' loans - together with leases, acceptances and securities held as banking assets - total more than Pounds 1bn. At the end of last year, Barings bought a 40 per cent interest in Dillon Read, the US investment bank. Mr Baring said this deal was completed too late in the year to have a material effect on the results. The non-voting equity capital in Barings is held exclusively by the Baring Foundation, a charity. Profits distribution to the foundation - in the form of a dividend and a donation - increased from Pounds 4.9m in 1990 to Pounds 5.6m in 1991.</p>

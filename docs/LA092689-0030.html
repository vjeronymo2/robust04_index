			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Employees of the Greek state-run television corporation in Athens went on  strike Monday to protest a proposed bill establishing private television. The  strike, which was to last until 1 a.m. today, was the longest in a series of  work stoppages that began Sept. 7 to protest the legislation breaking the state  monopoly on television. The government rejected a series of employee demands at  a meeting on Monday. Those demands included requiring private television  stations to present Greek programs and also the formation of a special council  overseeing state and private television and radio.

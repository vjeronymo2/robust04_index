			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Unit trusts faced with hedging restrictions BRITISH unit trusts, which manage some Pounds 57bn, have been effectively barred from hedging their investment portfolios following guidance from a City regulator. The unofficial guidance caught fund managers unawares and has led to a review of their use of derivatives markets. The guidance, issued at a private conference for trustees recently by a staff member of Imro, the investment regulator, means managers of unit trusts are not allowed to use derivative instruments except in rare circumstances. Mr Graham Dunnachie of Imro told trustees of unit trusts that their fund managers should only buy derivatives based on particular market indices if there is at least a 95 per cent correlation between that index and their own investment portfolio. That means the manager of a portfolio of UK shares could not use the FT-SE 100 futures contract traded on Liffe unless his own portfolio matched the FT-SE 100 index almost exactly. Such a correlation is only followed by specialised indexed funds. The ruling, aimed at preventing fund managers using derivatives for speculation rather than hedging, creates particular problems for international fund managers, who generally have investments spread across a number of markets. 'I don't think people at Imro have any idea of what derivatives are about,' one unit trust fund manager said last week.</p>

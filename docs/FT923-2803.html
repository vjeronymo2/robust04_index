			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / L&amp;G plans rolling venture funds LEGAL &amp; General Ventures, the venture capital arm of the life assurance group, is to set up an innovative system of rolling one-year venture funds. L&amp;G Ventures plans to raise two parallel Pounds 50m venture funds each year  -half from its parent company and half from outside investors. Any funds not invested by the end of any year will be returned to investors and a new fund will be raised. The aim is to allow investors to decide each year whether to commit funds to venture capital, said Mr Charles Peal, managing director of L&amp;G Ventures, which has Pounds 200m under management. At present institutions put money into venture capital funds which may take up to five years to invest the money, by which time economic conditions and their own investment plans may have changed. L&amp;G Ventures plans to set up two funds each year - one conventional equity fund and an unquoted equity underwriting pool. The pool will underwrite deals arranged by the equity fund but, if investors do not want to take up their allotment, it will offer stakes in the deal to other outside investors. The two funds will be raised between September and December each year. L&amp;G Ventures also plans to reduce the fees it charges investors to 1 per cent from the usual 2 to 2 1/2 per cent in the first year. It will also take a share of only 10 per cent cent in any profits above the return on the FT All-Share Index instead of the normal 20 per cent.</p>

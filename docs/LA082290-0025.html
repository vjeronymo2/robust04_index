			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING REPORT: SILVERWOOD TROUT PLANTS FATTEN CATCH  </P> <P> Excessive trout plants have led to vastly improved fishing at Silverwood Lake,  one of the Southland's primary striped bass fisheries.  </P> <P> The Mojave River State Fish Hatchery, scheduled to close in October, has been  "over-stocking" various reservoirs in order to remove the facility's 200,000  pounds of catchable and sub-catchable trout.  </P> <P> Jeane Bryant said the San Bernardino County reservoir is being "overrun" with  trout as a result. The stripers are feeding on the trout and the fishermen are  in turn catching the frenzied stripers.  </P> <P> Jerry Beck of Glendora took a 19-pound striper from the channel. Irene Simpson  of Downey caught a 19-pounder at Outhouse Cove and Dave Daval of Hesperia  landed a 17-pound fish in the spillway.  </P></p>

Today, we offer the reader  a more detailed interview with the minister of defense of a  House of Soviets that was riddled with gunfire.    [Turchenko] Vladislav Alekseyevich, let us begin from the  moment that you were appointed minister of defense. Many of our  readers ask in their letters: Why did you not take any kind of  steps for real execution of the duties that were entrusted to  you by the Congress of People's Deputies?    [Achalov] When the Congress of People's Deputies appointed  me, Barannikov, and Dunayev force ministers, individual people,  even from among the people's deputies demanded: Go to the  ministries, take up your positions, and start to manage. But the  real situation and common sense suggested another path for  resolving the question. Since the three force ministries were  appointed, this meant that a government should be formed as  well. Without this, for us to go to the ministries and there  establish parallel managerial structures would mean the direct  involvement of the Army, the MB [Ministry of Security], and the  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in opposition inside these  very structures themselves, which would lead to a full-scale  civil war. I told both Khasbulatov and Rutskoy: If a new  government is to be formed, and this is their prerogative, then  questions of the Ministry of Defense can be resolved within its  framework. But this, as is well-known, was not done.    [Turchenko] Some analysts think that it was a tactical error  to appoint new force ministers outside the framework of a  government, for this would seem to doom Grachev, Yerin, and  Golushko to opposition with respect to the congress.    [Achalov] Grachev, Yerin, and Golushko were invited to a  meeting of the congress as full-fledged ministers, but they did  not appear. And this was their deliberate choice: To take the  side of the president immediately. They undeviatingly took the  path of unconstitutionality. When this became obvious, the  congress appointed new force ministers. For me personally this  was a surprise, but nothing remained to be done except to  fulfill the will of congress.    [Turchenko] What does to fulfill mean? What could the  minister of defense do sitting inside the blockaded House of  Soviets?    [Achalov] We knew, and now it is obvious to many, that in  September the MVD planned and prepared an operation to eliminate  the Congress of People's Deputies. Besides the forces and  resources of Moscow Oblast, OMON [Special Missions Militia  Detachments] Personnel and Internal Affairs subunits from many  regions were drawn up at the House of Soviets. In addition, in  September, all of the army units closest to Moscow were  dispatched to harvest potatoes, and all of the militia subunits  were pulled out of the potato fields. The fact is that people  from Yeltsin's circle knew what kind of an attitude the army  showed to the regime in the referendum, and they did not count  on it. They put into operation specifically cultivated OMON and  Spetsnaz [Special Purpose Forces] forces. In this connection, I  had the task of organizing antiprovocation measures and the  security of the House of Soviets. That is, all of my work was  directed at ensuring the safety of the deputies and more or less  the peaceful work of the congress. Such tasks as going to the  troops, inspiring them, and leading them in a breakthrough were  not assigned.    The biggest misfortune was that neither Yeltsin, nor his  circle, wanted to accept a compromise and to resolve the dispute  at the top. They brought the situation to a point where the  people themselves undertook the task. And when they saw that on  3 October the people came to the defense of the House of Soviets  and the legal authority, they incited bloodshed.    [Turchenko] Let us look at 4 October through the eyes of a  military professional. What was the sense of the tank shelling  of the House of Soviets?    [Achalov] On the evening of 3 October, authority was  paralyzed. The most resolute figures from Yeltsin's circle  understood that only a harsh bloody battle would be capable of  bringing their supporters out of shock. These tank firings were  necessary to them at any price and for any money. The Army, MVD,  and the MB ended up drawn into a monstrous bloody game. No  matter how much the finger is pointed at us now, declaring us to  be the culprits of this tragedy, it is apparent to any sensible  person: Being completely isolated, behind barbed wire, without  communications means, theoretically we could not even create any  kind of a dangerous situation. There was no military necessity  to fire into the parliament building. This was a purely  political act with the unjustified employment of heavy weapons.    [Turchenko] What do you remember particularly from this  nightmare?    [Achalov] For two hours before the assault, our people in  the  MO [Ministry of Defense], MVD, and MB reported that an  irreversible decision for its execution was already made.  Military people came to me and tried to persuade me for a long  time so that I would leave with them. I answered firmly that I  would remain with the deputies to the end. I recall, as a  minimum, two moments when Khasbulatov tried to get to Yeltsin in  order to avoid bloodshed, but the president's circle did not  permit such negotiations. And a savage reprisal started. I had  occasion to participate in different conflicts in the border  areas of our country. But there was nothing comparable to this  barbarous brutality. After all, it was not without reason that  workers of the Procuracy afterwards were not permitted in the  House of Soviets for three days. All this time, the MVD and the  OMON were clearing the building of blood and corpses.    When the shelling reached the fiercest stage, Khasbulatov  and  Rutskoy telephoned Zorkin, and they tried to reach Chernomyrdin  so that they could promote a ceasefire. In the end--it was  already the evening of 4 October--some Alpha officer arrived and  said that he was authorized to take me, Barannikov, and Dunayev  to negotiations with representatives of Chernomyrdin. We came  out of the 20th entry way and got into an armored personnel  carrier that took us to Krasnaya Presnya. Buses were parked  there. Near one of them I spotted Barsukov, whose eyes were  restless. I understood immediately that we had been tricked.  When the bus started to move and I saw what route it was taking,  no doubts were left: We were being taken to Lefortovo, and not  to negotiations.    The first interrogation was held at 2300 hours on 4 October.  I declared immediately that I was detained through deceit and,  in addition, that my diplomatic immunity was violated. But no  one paid any attention to this, as happens in our country. At  first an attempt was made to steer me into the Terekhov affair.  It did not work. Then they brought the standard accusation of  massive disorders. But nothing here also could be linked to the  law. If it were not for the amnesty, I do not know how the  Procuracy would have extricated itself from the situation into  which it had cornered itself.    [Turchenko] A judicial process could have shed light on the  truth about September-October 1993. Perhaps you should have  refused amnesty and attempted to go to court?    [Achalov] I do not believe in an objective court trial in  the  present state where the highest law--the constitution--is  crushed with tank tracks.    [Turchenko] Do you consider yourself vanquished?    [Achalov] No. But I also do not see any victors. The present  authority conducted a provocation against itself as well. As a  matter of fact, it signed its own sentence. The elections showed  that the people turned away from it and that it will not accept  such authority.    [Turchenko] Now everything is being done in a clumsy way by  the president's team, and an economic catastrophe is imminent in  the country. Did you not give some thought to the fact that  perhaps you were released from the dungeons in order that there  would be live material for drawing a picture of an internal  enemy?    [Achalov] Really, parliament cannot be shot up a second  time.  But the authorities are in urgent need of an internal enemy in  order to divert the attention of the people from hunger and cold  and from the true culprits of the impending catastrophe. And so  the "democratic" mass media has pounced on us. They are a priori  shouting about some kind of extremist plans. I do not doubt that  there will be attempts to involve some of the released prisoners  in a new escapade. Objectively, a period of spontaneous protest  demonstrations are drawing near. Undoubtedly, they will always  be linked to us, even if we do not begin to participate in them.  After all, this is so easy: Put signs with our portraits in  the hands of "plants" and then have them shout: They will say,  the October prisoners are stirring up the people, and they are  trying to take power. Is this not a pretext for the introduction  of a dictatorship, without which the present authorities are not  capable of lasting?    [Turchenko] Does this mean that you are distancing yourself  from any kind of a spontaneous or organized struggle whatsoever  of the people against the current tyranny?    [Achalov] I am against forceful variants of this struggle,  because this will be a catastrophe. A civil war is already going  on in outlying areas. Different groups are fighting for spheres  of influence and sales markets. It will already be impossible to  extinguish the next skirmish in the center. And in no case is it  possible to allow it to happen.    [Turchenko] The present authority is moving toward an  economic catastrophe. An attempt to replace it is fraught with  military catastrophe. How is it possible to avoid these two  catastrophes?    [Achalov] The solution is the common sense of the people. I  read a lot in Lefortovo and I became convinced: The Russian  people always found the medicine against leaders who were  unacceptable to it. Undoubtedly, it will find it now as well.  Time will put everything in its place.    [Turchenko] What are your near-term forecasts?    [Achalov] Far from optimistic. If assistance is not provided  immediately to agriculture, an inevitable famine awaits us. No  one will start to feed us for nothing. We have already eaten up  all of NATO's spoiled products. We have to give our peasant an  opportunity to sow...    [Turchenko] And what are your personal near-term plans?    [Achalov] After coming out of Lefortovo, it is necessary to  look into my own situation to the end; after all, my status is  still unknown, and then I have to find my place in contemporary  life. There already are proposals for work. Not only in our  country, but abroad as well. But I do not plan to depart for  anywhere. I have one thought--to be of use to the people. I have  not decided yet in what capacity.</p>

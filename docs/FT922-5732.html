			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What now for Docklands? - A body blow to plans for east London CANARY WHARF'S failure and increased uncertainty over the Jubilee Line extension may deal a blow to plans to develop east London. Private-sector investment and improved transport play a critical part in the government's ambitious plans to develop the east Thames corridor, an area stretching from the London Docks through Essex and north Kent. Although it is the only area capable of substantial growth in the overcrowded south-east, its development will involve reversing decades of decline created by its physical isolation, the run-down of its maritime-based industries and the age-old gravitation of wealth to the west of the City. Hillier Parker, a firm of chartered surveyors, believes that extending the London Underground's Jubilee Line would greatly enhance the development opportunities of at least 17 sites covering a total of 1,000 acres. The firm estimates that the value of the land would exceed Pounds 10bn if it were developed. Prospects of developing those sites, which have already been set back by the commercial property decline, might be pushed back indefinitely by delays in the improvement of transport links. 'Transport links are crucial in terms of development land,' says Mr Paul Woods, a planner at Hillier Parker. The largest sites that would benefit from the Jubilee Line extension are Canary Wharf itself; a 263-acre development on land belonging to British Gas on the Greenwich Peninsula, for which a mixed retail, commercial and residential (5,850 homes) scheme is planned; a 180-acre site at Victoria Dock; and a 240-acre site at Stratford railyard. There appears to be no immediate threat to the last three of those. British Gas - which is to contribute about Pounds 25m to the Jubilee Line - described the threat to the Underground extension as 'a bit of a hiccough', but it still intends to proceed with its planning application, which envisages an Underground link at North Greenwich for the development's last phase in 1997. More concerned are the local councils immediately affected - Southwark, Greenwich, Tower Hamlets and Newham - which fear for the prospects of future development. The difficulties encountered by Dockland's developers, coupled with the overall slump in the commercial property industry, is likely to deter future investors. Attempts to attract developers to the Royal Docks, the huge expanse of land to the east of the Isle of Dogs have met little interest. The London Docklands Development Corporation, the government-funded body set up to oversee the area's regeneration, remains hopeful that the Jubilee Line extension will go ahead. Mr Eric Sorensen, chief executive, emphasised the importance of the line in creating additional river crossings and opening up Rotherhithe and Deptford. But even without the extension, the area's road and light railway transport was improving sharply, he said. 'We hope by the final completion of the road network plus a reliable railway, we will maintain the momentum of the area.'</p>

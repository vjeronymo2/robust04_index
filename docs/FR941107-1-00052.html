			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS published notification of the proposed moratorium on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33947), which advised fishermen that, if Amendment 5 is approved and implemented, any Federal numbers/color codes issued between July 1, 1994, and the effective date of the implementing regulations would no longer be valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 4-year moratorium period, it is reasonably expected that the Council will propose further management measures that would revise the provisions for the issuance of Federal numbers/color codes. Accordingly, NMFS proposes to remove the current provisions regarding Federal issuance of numbers/color codes at this time rather than suspend their effectiveness for the 4-year period. If needed, any such provisions will be implemented by a subsequent rulemaking to be effective when the moratorium actually expires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Measures in Amendment 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment 5 proposes a procedure whereby the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission (FMFC) may request the Regional Director to implement in the EEZ by regulatory amendment, with the Council's review and concurrence, modification to certain gear and harvest limitations applicable to State waters that were proposed by the FMFC and approved by the Florida Governor and Cabinet. The regulatory amendment process requires publication of a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a public comment period, and, if the rule is approved, publication of a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The specific steps of the regulatory amendment procedure under the enhanced cooperative management system proposed in Amendment 5 are contained on pages 8&hyph;10 of the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Amendment 5, the Council, FMFC, and NMFS would adopt a protocol that describes the roles and positions of the Federal and State governments in the management of the stone crab fishery. The provisions of the protocol would be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Council and NMFS acknowledge that the fishery is a State fishery (which extends into the EEZ) in terms of current participants in the directed fishery, major nursery, fishing, and landing areas, and historical regulation; and it is a fishery requiring cooperative State/Federal efforts for effective management through an FMP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Council and NMFS acknowledge that the State is managing and will continue to manage the resource to protect and increase the long-term yields and prevent depletion of the stone crab stocks and that the State Administrative Procedure Act and rule implementation procedures, including final approval of the rules by Governor and Cabinet, provide ample and fair opportunity for all persons to participate in the rulemaking procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The FMFC acknowledges that rules proposed for implementation under this amendment must be consistent with the management objectives of the FMP, the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable Federal law. Federal rules will be implemented in accordance with regulatory amendment procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Council and NMFS agree that, for any of the rules defined within this amendment, the State may propose the rule directly to NMFS, concurrently informing the Council of the nature of the rule, and that NMFS will implement the rule within the EEZ, provided it is consistent under protocol number 3. If the Council informs NMFS of its concern that the rule may be inconsistent with the FMP and Federal law (protocol number 3), NMFS will not implement the rule until the Council, FMFC, and NMFS, or their representatives, meet and resolve the issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The State will have the responsibility for collecting and developing the information upon which to base the fishing rules, with assistance by NMFS, as needed, and will cooperatively share the responsibility for enforcement with the Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The FMFC will provide NMFS and the Council written explanations of its decisions related to each of the rules (including a statement of the problem that the rulemaking addresses, how the rule will solve the problem, and how interested parties were involved in the rulemaking), summaries of public comments, biological, economic and social analyses of the impacts of the proposed rule and alternatives, and such other information that is relevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

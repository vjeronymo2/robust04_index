			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Top Civil servants court industry Senior company executives are to be told next week that they may be able to boost their business prospects - by employing a civil servant. The message will be delivered by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, at a private lunch in London on Tuesday for directors of 17 big companies. The gathering is aimed at helping Whitehall officials expand their view of the world by giving more of them a taste of life in industry through part-time advisory jobs. To overcome any scepticism about the commercial acumen of civil servants, Sir Robin will also stress the role of Whitehall officials in giving a fresh view of business problems and in helping companies to build up sales and profits. The lunch has been arranged by the Whitehall and Industry Group, a charity funded by the government and 64 big companies including Midland Bank, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds and British Telecommunications. An official on the initiative said: 'Companies do not generally come knocking on our doors asking to employ civil servants. You have to do some persuading to tell them what the potential benefits can be.' Mr John Sacher, a director of Marks and Spencer who is chairman of the Whitehall and Industry Group, said that many civil servants who had worked part-time in companies had proved 'extremely constructive'. He added: 'We are talking about high-flyers who have a lot to contribute to strategic issues.' The lunch fits in with efforts by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to promote a more sympathetic view of wealth creation by officials across Whitehall. The main aim of the lunch is to increase the number of civil servants working part-time as non-executive members of subsidiary boards from about 50 to possibly 100.</p>

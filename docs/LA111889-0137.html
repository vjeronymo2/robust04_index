			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> CONFESSION FORCED, RAPE SUSPECT SAYS  </P> <P> A teen-age suspect in the gang rape last spring of a jogger in Central Park  said that police officers brought him back to the crime scene and tried to  force him to smear himself with the woman's blood. In a pretrial hearing on the  admissibility of confessions at the state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Kharey  Wise, 17, also testified that a detective, in order to force him to confess,  slapped him so hard he temporarily lost the hearing in his right ear. Wise said  that police officers brought him to the crime scene two days after the April 19  attack. Wise and five other youths were indicted for rape and attempted murder.  In a videotaped confession, Wise admitted holding the jogger while others raped  her.  </P></p>

Section 3833.1&hyph;3 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3833.1&hyph;3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Service charges, rental fees, maintenance fees, and location fees; form of remittance and acceptance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Payment and acceptance policy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All service charges, maintenance fees, and location fees shall be payable by United States currency, postal money order, or negotiable instrument payable in United States currency, and shall be made payable to the Department of the Interior_Bureau of Land Management, or by a valid credit card acceptable to the Bureau of Land Management. A check or negotiable instrument, including credit cards submitted for payment of charges and/or fees, for which payment is not honored by the issuing authority, and such refusal is not an error of the issuing authority, will be deemed to be a nonpayment of the charges or fees for which the check or negotiable instrument, including a credit card order, was tendered. See &sect;3833.1&hyph;4 (f) and (g) for payments made by credit cards or from Declining Deposit Accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recordation of new mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites with the Bureau of Land Management. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) New location notices or certificates submitted for recording pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 that are not accompanied by full payment of the maintenance and location fees required by &sect;3833.1&hyph;4 or 3833.1&hyph;5 will not be accepted, and the submittal will be returned without further action by the authorized officer. The claimant may resubmit the filings with the proper payment of service charges and fees within the same 90-day filing period referred to in &sect;3833.1&hyph;2(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Failure to provide full payment of service charges set forth in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4 will be curable for new location notices or certificates submitted for recording pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 when the proper maintenance and location fees have been submitted. Such documents will be noted as being recorded on the date received provided that the claimant submits the proper service charge either within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice sent by the authorized officer, or on or before the 90th day of the filing period referred to in 3833.1&hyph;2(a), whichever date is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the proper service charges have not been tendered pursuant to paragraph (b)(2), and if the claimant has not provided written instructions regarding the application of the funds received with the original filing, the authorized officer will apply such funds and serialize the claims in the order received. All notices or certificates for which there are insufficient funds to cover all service charges and maintenance and location fees will be returned to the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites recorded and serialized by the Bureau of Land Management. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Failure to provide full payment of service charges set forth in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4 will be curable for documents and filings made pursuant to &sect;&sect;3833.2 and 3833.3 and amended locations filed under &sect;3833.1. Such documents and filings will be noted as being recorded on the date initially received, provided that the claimant submits the proper service charge within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer. Failure to submit the proper service charge as required by this paragraph will cause filings made pursuant to &sect;&sect;3833.2 and 3833.3 and amended locations filed under &sect;3833.1 to be rejected and returned to the claimant/owner. If a payment is received that partially covers the claims submitted, the payment shall be applied to mining claims and sites in ascending numerical order of serialization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If a claimant fails to submit the proper maintenance fees on or before each August 31, the authorized officer will apply the fees received to existing recorded and serialized mining claims and sites in ascending numerical order of serialization, unless otherwise directed by the claimant. The authorized officer will note the deficient fees as being paid on the original date received, provided that the claimant submits the proper fees within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer, if that much time remains before August 31. If there are less than 30 days before August 31, the correct fees shall be filed (see &sect;3833.0&hyph;5(m)) by such claimant on or before the August 31 deadline. Failure to submit the proper fees will cause the forfeiture of remaining claims or sites by the claimant/owner. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 27.

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (6): The aim is to be a household name - Competition between charities means that image is more important than ever THERE is a growing fashion for charities to change their images and, in some cases, their names. Image is more important than ever in the climate facing the voluntary sector. Charities are competing for donations, public-sector contracts, top-quality managers and the services of voluntary workers. In fund-raising terms, a household name is a precious advantage for a charity. Changing it is one of the most risky decisions it is possible to take, and is guaranteed to split active supporters. Some organisations are nonetheless taking this ultimate step as part of re-launch programmes. All charities have to be sensitive to the views of the groups they represent and support. The acceptability of the language in which disability and disadvantage are described changes over time, and some of the recent name changes reflect this. But another factor behind the spate of re-launches is the perceived need on the part of charity managers to adopt sharp, modern images for their organisations as the voluntary sector competes for contracts to deliver public services. Both these elements were illustrated in the re-launch of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf earlier this year. The name change was a modest one - it is now the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. This enabled the institute to satisfy the growing concern of people with disabilities that they should be represented as human beings rather than a detached, abstract group while avoiding the problems of having to market an entirely new name. The institute accompanied the change with a clear bid for contracts under next year's community care reforms, saying that it intended to concentrate in future on providing services as well as campaigning. A specialist organisation like the institute, it said, was the 'best channel through which local authorities and health authorities can meet demands for their deaf and hard-of-hearing clients.' In October the Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults - better known as Mencap - became the next big charity to stage a re-launch. The most striking visible evidence of this is the disappearance of Little Tommy - the sketch of a sad-looking child that has been the society's logo since the 1960s - and its replacement by a series of confident, successful images of people with learning disabilities. 'One of the particular difficulties of re-launching a charity is that you have to sell the new image inside the organisation as well as outside, and it is not easy to please everybody,' says Steve Billington, Mencap's director of marketing and appeals. Some of the parents who founded Mencap in 1946 remain active in its ranks today; a number are unhappy about the modern new image the charity is aiming to project. An even bigger controversy than the removal of Little Tommy may be yet to come - there is division within the ranks of Mencap over whether its name should be changed. In today's climate some people feel that the term mental handicap is inappropriate. A similar argument last month led to another of Britain's best-known charities - the Spastics Society - agreeing to change its name. The term spastic is considered by many to be offensive to people with cerebral palsy, and one that presents a negative image of their potential. A decision to change the name and re-launch the society was agreed by a 4-1 majority at the society's annual meeting. The Spastics Society is one of Britain's 30 biggest charities, and most of the opposition to the change came from speakers who, while not regarding the name with any particular affection, were worried about the possible fund-raising implications of dropping its familiar title and image. A short-list of possible new names will be voted on next year. Suggestions so far have ranged from the straightforward Cerebral Palsy Association to names like Scope and Capability which incorporate the initials CP. Some name changes can be relatively gradual or subtle. The Church of England Children's Society - originally the Waifs and Strays - now promotes itself simply as the Children's Society. Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for the Disabled, following the pattern of the RNID, has become Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People. On other occasions, a more radical approach is adopted. Four years ago, the National Marriage Guidance Council re-launched itself as Relate. The decision did not win universal approval within the organisation, and the internal debate over the new name has still not entirely died down. Advocates of change were concerned that the former title gave the impression that the council's services were available only to people who were legally married - which was not the case - and that potential clients were being discouraged from seeking counselling. Opponents argued that the name change might suggest that the council no longer regarded marriage as a serious institution - which it does - and that the organisation would lose its national credibility and identify. Four advertising agencies were invited to put forward proposals for a new name. More conservative alternatives, like the Marriage and Family Counselling Service, were considered before the final choice went to Relate. Shortage of funds has prevented Relate commissioning market research into the effects of the name change. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of people seeking its services over the past five years, but no-one knows to what extent this arises from Relate's new image and how much from social factors. Relate went into the name change with the advantages that much of its funding comes from central and local government, and that it tends to concentrate in its public fund-raising on one-off events such as charity film premieres. The financial risk of a name change is greater for charities that rely on widespread general fund-raising. Many people can name only a handful of charities; a lot of money collected in workplace raffles this Christmas will be donated to chosen causes simply because they have names that everyone knows. For this reason the Spastics Society has decided that, whatever new name is chosen next year, it will initially be used in tandem with the existing one.</p>

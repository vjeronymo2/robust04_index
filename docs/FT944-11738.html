			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Boots warns of Christmas challenge Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 66 per cent increase in first-half profits following buoyant demand for branded drugs and a Pounds 47.8m gain on the sale of Farleys baby foods. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 174.6m to Pounds 289.7m in the six months to September 30, although last year's figures were distorted by a Pounds 35m write off on Manoplax, the group's failed heart drug. Underlying profits rose 20.4 per cent to Pounds 241.8m as the group enjoyed increased sales of Synthroid, its thyroid deficiency treatment. Shares in the company, however, fell 10p to 519p after it warned that US demand for the drug was likely to fall in the second half, while adding that UK consumer confidence remained fragile. 'Consumers are still being cautious, and seeking value. Christmas is going to be a tough challenge for most retailers,' said Sir James Blyth, chief executive. Sluggish sales at DIY subsidiaries Do It All, the joint venture with WH Smith, and AG Stanley contributed to a modest 2.8 per cent increase in turnover from Pounds 1.99bn to Pounds 2.04bn. Losses by these businesses undermined strong growth at Boots The Chemist, the group's largest division, where profits increase 9 per cent to Pounds 144.6m on sales ahead 5.1 per cent at Pounds 1.37bn. Sir James predicted the loss-making divisions would be profitable by the end of the decade, but the group's caution persuaded analysts to downgrade full-year profit forecasts by Pounds 10m to Pounds 545m. They were also unsettled by uncertainty over the future of the pharmaceutical division, which contributed sharply increased profits of Pounds 49.8m. Although the company said its review of the division - prompted by the withdrawal of Manoplax last year - was closer to a solution, it refused to confirm expectations of an outright sale. Among the options for the division, which employs 5,800, are joint ventures and restructuring. If Boots sold the business, Sir James said it 'would examine ways of giving cash back to the shareholders'. The interim dividend was increased from 4.9p to 5.35p. Earnings per share grew from 11.5p to 20.2p, while underlying earnings rose 16.4 per cent from 13.4p to 15.6p. Lex, Page 16; Background, Page 18</p>

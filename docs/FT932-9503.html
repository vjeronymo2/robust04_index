			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: EC reforms hurt agrochemicals - Schering's mooted deal with Hoechst THIS week's announcement that Schering, the German bioscience group, is negotiating a possible merger of its agrochemicals business with Hoechst, the German chemicals giant, raised more than a few eyebrows. It was the choice of partner rather than the merger itself that caused the surprise. A deal would create a new number two in the world agrochemicals league after Ciba of Switzerland: but the geographical synergies between the two companies is minimal. Rationalisation is clearly necessary in this Dollars 27bn industry, involving fungicides pesticides and insecticides, though not fertilisers. The sector has been severely battered in recent years, enduring an unhappy combination of rising costs and falling demand. Costs are on the increase because of rising development overheads - a direct consequence of increasing government demands for safer and more environmentally friendly products. Demand is tumbling almost wholly because of the reforms last year of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy that involved setting aside 15 per cent of farmers' land. Estimates of the impact of the reforms vary. Allan Woodburn Associates, the Edinburgh-based agrochemical market research specialists, estimates that the EC market last year fell between 10 per cent and 12 per cent. Wood Mackenzie, the agrochemicals analysts, estimates that it dropped 13 per cent. 'About half the fall in west Europe was due to the reforms and about half due to the weather,' says Mr Allan Woodburn. He expects the market to fall a further 8 per cent to 10 per cent over the next two to three years. The US market is also struggling. BASF at one point cut the price of products for soyabeans by 30 per cent in America last year. Monsanto has been cutting the prices of Roundup, its best-selling herbicide, after its US patents expired last year. Zeneca, ICI's bioscience division, estimates the world market declined between 2 per cent and 3 per cent last year because of the reforms and price competition in the US. 'The agrochemicals market is clearly stagnating,' admits Professor Klaus Pohle, Schering's chief financial officer and deputy chairman. 'The CAP reforms have really changed the conditions of life. The lower subsidies mean farmers are unwilling to increase purchases of agrochemicals. At the same time, demands for increasing environmental performance mean higher R&amp;D costs. We have to adapt to a smaller market,' says Professor Pohle. Schering has been particularly hit by the EC reforms. The group has 60 per cent of its sales in the region, according to Mr Woodburn. Sales fell 16 per cent last year. During the first quarter of this year, its agrochemicals division's turnover collapsed 22 per cent, a fall that Professor Pohle partly attributed to changing buying patterns. The division is no longer offering discounts at the beginning of the year to encourage wholesalers to take early stock, and aims to cut staff by 20 per cent by 1994. The impact of the reforms has been exacerbated by Schering's product mix. Cereal herbicides can be used on some set-aside land, but no fungicides, and it is this product area that had been hit harder than any other. Schering's strength is in cereal fungicides and sugar beat herbicides which have not been affected. If it comes off, the merger between Schering and Hoechst would link the world's 12th and eighth largest agrochemicals businesses and put the new group ahead of the operations at Bayer of Germany and Zeneca, according to Mr Woodburn. Last year, Schering's business had a turnover of about Dollars 820m; Hoechst agrochemicals sales were Dollars 1.29bn. Rhone-Poulenc of France has already linked its agrochemicals business to that of Sumitomo, while Shell and American Cyanamid are understood to be negotiating a potential combined venture. Schering almost merged its business with that of Sandoz until the Swiss company also mooted a merger of its pharmaceuticals operations. However, although there is some synergy between the products of Hoechst and Schering - the former is strong in cereal herbicides and insecticides and has only limited exposure to fungicides - the geographical arguments for a link are not overwhelming. Both are strong in the European market. Mr Woodburn estimates 48.5 per cent of the new combined group would be in west Europe, 16.5 per cent in North America, 13 per cent in Latin America, 12 per cent in eastern Asia, and 10 per cent elsewhere. 'This deal will do almost nothing to reduce the two companies dependence on the rapidly weakening European market,' says Mr John McDougall at Wood Mackenzie.  ------------------------------------------------------- AGROCHEMICAL SALES  ------------------------------------------------------- Company                          Dollars bn  ------------------------------------------------------- Ciba-Geigy                             2.94 Zeneca                                 1.99 Du Pont                                1.96 Bayer                                  1.94 Rhone-Poulenc                          1.93 Monsanto                               1.65 Dow Elanco                             1.58 Hoechst                                1.39 BASF                                   1.19 American Cyanamid                      1.00 Sandoz                                 0.88 Schering                               0.82  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Wood Mackenzie  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

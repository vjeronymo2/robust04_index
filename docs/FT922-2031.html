			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Thai phone group looks overseas for equipment THE STATE-OWNED Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT) yesterday awarded a contract to install and operate 1m provincial telephone lines to a Thai consortium planning to buy equipment from Canadian, French and Japanese companies. The deal is the second part of a controversial expansion plan designed to ease Thailand's badly-congested communications system. Talks on the first part were concluded last year when a contract was awarded for 2m new numbers in Bangkok to the Charoen Pokphand Group, whose associates include British Telecom. The government hopes investors' confidence will recover, now that a big infrastructure deal has been struck so soon after last month's political violence. A number of other infrastructure projects are under way or could be started soon, making up for investors' hesitancy after the recent political troubles. The TOT board meeting was held in extraordinary circumstances. The chairman is Gen Issarapong Noonpakdee, army commander, who has not been seen in public since the army suppressed the anti-military demonstrations last month. The board met at the closely-guarded Army Operations Command headquarters. The winning consortium is led by Loxley Bangkok, a Thai trading company. Its main suppliers will be Northern Telecom Canada and Alcatel, of France, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, of Japan. The original project was a single package for all 3m new numbers. The civilian government of Mr Anand Panyarachun, installed by the military after last year's coup, then fell into conflict with the general by ruling that the deal, originally awarded to the CP Group, was too monopolistic. The convolutions of Thai politics have brought the Anand government back to power following the protests and the resignation of the pro-military government set up after the March general election. The generals still dominate state enterprise boards, but pressure is growing for them to be replaced by appropriate professionals.</p>

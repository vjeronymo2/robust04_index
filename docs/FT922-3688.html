			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Efficiency drive bolsters Unigate UNIGATE, the food and transport group, showed some early benefits from its efficiency drive in the underlying 6 per cent rise in profits contained in the results for the year to end March. The shares, however, have already risen this year and met some profit-taking, falling 8p to 344p. The reported pre-tax profit of Pounds 92.2m was 22 per cent up on the Pounds 75.5m achieved the year before, but there were distortions in the earlier figure which was struck after losses of Pounds 16.3m from businesses which have since been sold or are being run down. Losses in the latest financial year from these activities have been set against provisions, set up in a Pounds 117.4m extraordinary charge the previous year. In addition, property profits of Pounds 5.4m in 1990-91 fell to Pounds 200,000 in 1991-92. Mr Ross Buckland, the chief executive who joined in October 1990, said that good progress had been made but the recession had been unhelpful. He hoped for faster progress in the current financial year. Group turnover was 11.6 per cent lower at Pounds 1.89bn and trading profits rose 4.6 per cent to Pounds 91.3m. Associates, mainly the Nutricia baby food business, contributed Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 11.1m). Earnings per share rose 22 per cent to 27.3p and an unchanged 9.6p final dividend is proposed to give a maintained total of 15.3p. Dividend cover is 1.8. The dairy business increased trading profits by 7.9 per cent to Pounds 28.7m as the benefit of capital investment began to come through. Fresh food profits fell from Pounds 21m to Pounds 19.9m because of costs of rationalisation and new product launches. Farm foods profits nearly halved to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 12.3m). This division used to include the disastrous JP Wood chicken business sold early this year. COMMENT There is some encouragement in these figures for those minded to be bullish about Unigate's recovery. There is little point now in arguing about the accounting treatment of the withdrawals, it is enough that those problems have been dealt with once and for all. No doubt Mr Buckland has further disposals in mind, but he is keeping quiet about what until the market for businesses improves. There is still much to be done to get Unigate's margins up to scratch, but work put into fresh foods, bacon, and the US shows the management's intentions. Longer term strategy may still be rather foggy, but a pre-tax figure of over Pounds 100m for the current year puts the shares, on 11.5 times earnings, at a discount to the market. With the prospect of a small dividend increase this year as well, they have some attractions.</p>

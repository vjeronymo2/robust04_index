			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Overdraft moves hit banks The banks sector of the market was given a thorough shaking by news that Abbey National, formerly a building society and now classified as a bank, had reduced its authorised overdraft rates to below 10 per cent from 18.4 per cent in a move seen by bank analysts as chasing a much bigger share of the loans market. The Halifax Building Society also moved to reduce rates on overdrafts. The moves were viewed by specialists as the first steps in what could be an increasingly competitive market for the banks, and which could produce a significant squeeze on profits in the sector. Abbey National fell 13 to 393p on 2.8m traded, while TSB dipped 7 to 203p on 7.4m, Barclays lost 16 at 519p and Lloyds Bank slid 14 to 525p. The worst individual performance, however, came from National Westminster, which registered a drop of 24 1/2 at 431 1/2 p, after 428p, with the market additionally unsettled by news that NatWest is buying Central Jersey Bancorp, of the US. Turnover of 12m in NatWest was the highest single day's activity for three months.</p>

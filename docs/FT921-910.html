			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Observer: Right then 'Oh dear,' sighed Observer as readers' replies came rolling in to Monday's numeracy-style quiz. One of the first arrivals began by rasping: 'You should have realised that a large number of actuaries read your column'. Then (poetic justice be praised]) he proceeded to fluff one of his answers. The response is nevertheless impressive. As some entries mailed overseas before the Monday-night deadline may not yet have arrived, the solutions to the seven questions won't be given until next Monday morning. But of the 151 received so far, no fewer than 62 are all-correct. At the same time, therefore, a tie-breaker will be printed to find the winner of the bottle of malt whisky. Since you're all so clever, it'll be a stinker.</p>

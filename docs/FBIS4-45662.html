			<p>BFN     [Text] Wherever extractive reclamation methods come up  against technical and economic limits, immobilization processes  nevertheless make it possible to put polluted areas to new uses.  This is especially true in cases of multiple contamination with  hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy  metals on land rich in coarse clay, and of widespread pollution  in industrial areas. Immobilization using a binding agent will  also make it possible to recycle large expanses of the heavily  polluted Bitterfeld industrial area, where an on-site hazardous  waste incineration plant is to be built once safeguards are in  place.    In May last year, work began on digging out soil, backfill,  and rubble containing heavy metals and dioxins on the  10.5-hectare [26- acre] Chemicals AG site. By the end of  December 1993, the Nuernberg-based reclamation company, PBS, had  dug out about 50,000 cubic meters of material and immobilized  32,000 cubic meters. The material is first homogenized then  immobilized in a charge mixer. The soil and binding agent are  weighed out electronically and precisely proportioned for this  purpose. A mixing throughput of up to 1,000 cubic meters a day  can be handled.    The immobilized soil is reincorporated into a controllable  system that is separated from the unpolluted soil by a dividing  layer. Samples of both the untreated and the reincorporated soil  are taken and analyzed during the reclamation work.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Criteria for Assessing Amenability to Immobilization                       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Contamination     |Soil Type         |Intended Use      |Extension         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |volatile halogena-|gravel            |playing field     |local accident    |  |ted hydrocarbons, |                  |                  |                  |  |hydrocarbons      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |phenols, benzene, |sand              |residential area  |small area        |  |toluene, xylene   |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |polynuclear aroma-|coarse clay       |road, parking lot |limited residenti-|  |tic hydrocarbons  |                  |                  |al area           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |heavy metals      |clay              |industrial estate |large industrial  |  |                  |                  |                  |areas             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |multiple contamin-|In increasing order of amenability                      |  |ation, e.g., hydr-|                                                        |  |ocarbons, benzene,|                                                        |  | toluene, xylene, |                                                        |  |heavy metals      |                                                        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

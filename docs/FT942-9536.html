			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Books: Banishment and resurrection - JDF Jones on the life of a brave and talented Victorian woman who flourished in exile LUCIE DUFF GORDON: A PASSAGE TO EGYPT by Katherine Frank Hamish Hamilton Pounds 17.99, 399 pages Lucie Duff Gordon was an unconventional, brave, talented and cosmopolitan woman who lived in mid-Victorian Britain, contracted consumption and, in 1862, left her family to go off to Egypt to die. There was no denying the meaning of her exile, no hope of recovery, yet from her new home in Luxor she survived for seven years - far longer than the doctors had imagined - and in the course of that suspension of sentence she wrote a classic book and achieved a sort of happiness. Lucie is not unknown to previous biographers. Apart from her own Letters from Egypt (which is kept in print by Virago), she is familiar through the unhappy lives of her parents, John and Sarah Austin, who have been commemorated quite recently by Lotte and Joseph Hamburger; in two studies in Victorian social history under the appropriate titles Troubled Lives and Contemplating Adultery. The father was a neurotic and hopeless professor of jurisprudence, the mother a successful and respected translator who spent her middle years engaged in an unconsummated affair by post with a Polish prince. Lucie was brought up in the heart of the intellectual society of the age. John Stuart Mill was one of the family, Jeremy Bentham an uncle-figure, Carlyle, Heine and Sydney Smith were intimates, Tennyson, Dickens, Thackeray and Meredith passed through her drawing room. It was an unusual childhood, which included a period of Jane Eyre-style misery at boarding school, but at 18, beautiful and accomplished, she made a romantic marriage to Sir Alexander Duff Gordon, an exemplary young Treasury Official whose only fault was that he had no money. Katherine Frank, her new biographer, does not attempt to exaggerate their importance: 'Lucie and Alexander do appear to be 'lesser lives'; they hover on the fringes of the lives of more famous, powerful, wealthy people.' But she then quotes their friend Meredith to the effect that 'a lesser life does not seem lesser to the person who leads one.' This is justification enough for a biography. Then she fell ill and was banished from the English climate and from her three children. But she fell in love with Egypt, or rather with Upper Egypt where her house on top of Luxor Temple had previously been occupied by Champollion and Flaubert, and she particularly identified with the Temple of Isis at Philae, 'the most beautiful object my eyes ever saw'. There are echoes here, of course, of The Wilder Shores of Love, except that Lucie was no Lady Jane Digby, who married the Sheikh of Palmyra, but a sensitive and gifted woman whose exile was not just to heal her, temporarily, but also to transform her. Katherine Frank has written A Passage to Egypt out of her own personal tragedy of the death of her husband in Cairo. She therefore discovers significance in the island of Philae, for Lucie and, it is admitted, for herself. The myth of Isis tells how, on the murder of her beloved Osiris, she re-membered the parts of his body and conceived a new life, a son, Horus. Frank sees in Lucie's resurrected years in Luxor a 're-membering' of her life, and describes this book as 'the record of my quest for her, the life I wrote while I struggled to re-member my own'. This is done with restraint, and is not unmoving, though I do not doubt that the biographer is projecting, as psychologists say, onto the life of her subject. For the rest, it is a conventionally chronological, agreeable, always interesting tale, collected, we are told, largely from unpublished letters and documents. There lies a weakness; Frank seems reluctant to rely more heavily on Lucie's own words. Letters from Egypt may have been reprinted frequently - they caused a great stir in 1860s England - but we do not get enough of their content or flavour. In contrast, the time Lucie spent in South Africa in 1861 blazes into life because we are shown it entirely through Lucie's own letters. 'It was impossible to be lonely or unhappy in Egypt,' trills Ms Franks in a rare lapse. Let us just say the dying Lucie was less unhappy than she might have been. It is a world long gone. These days she would probably have been shot by the Fundamentalists.</p>

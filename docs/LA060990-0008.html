			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> CLUB DONATES $9,500 TO HELP FIGHT DRUGS  </P> <P> A rap song and a skit showing "eight ways to say no" were presented by  fifth-graders in Ventura as part of a graduation ceremony Friday for the Drug  Abuse Resistance Education program.  </P> <P> At the ceremony, the Ventura Newcomers Club gave DARE $9,500, the largest  single donation the drug education program has received in its three years in  the county.  </P> <P> Under the program, three Ventura police officers meet with fifth-graders at  Mound Elementary School once a week and also hold discussions with students in  other grades, said Lt. Pat Rooney of the Ventura Police Department.  </P> <P> The DARE program "deals with how to say no," Rooney said. "It deals with peer  pressure. The whole program focuses on self-esteem."  </P> <P> Among the ways to say "no" portrayed in the skit were "Walk away" and "Change  the subject."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) addressed the 116 fifth-grade  students' ceremony, which lasted an hour and a half, Mound Principal Paul  Pierce said.  </P> <P> Students received T-shirts and certificates at the ceremony, and four were  awarded as winners of a DARE essay contest. The winners were Rebecca Baker,  Jesse Jacobs, Trisha Kirk and Heather Goss.  </P> <P> The Newcomers Club held a fund-raising auction in March for the DARE program,  with participants bidding on "a trip to Cancun, a trip to Las Vegas, a piece of  art, $1,000 security system," said Sandy Ohlsen, a Newcomers spokesman. "This  stuff was all donated from the people in Ventura. It was wonderful."  </P> <P> Ohlsen said the club has donated money to DARE since the drug education program  began. KIM KASH  </P></p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Havas jumps 40% in first half Havas, the French media and leisure group, yesterday announced first-half net profits of FFr589m (Dollars 111.3m), an increase of almost 40 per cent over the same period in 1993. The company forecast a strong increase in full-year results on the back of rationalisation measures implemented in 1992 and 1993 and recovery in its principal markets. Last year, the company recorded net profits of FFr708m. The net figure for the first half was boosted by increased stakes in some subsidiaries. Havas raised its holding in ODA, the advertising arm of France Telecom's directories, to 100 per cent and its stake in CEP communications to 45.3 per cent. Stripping out this factor, first-half net profits rose 30 per cent. Half-year turnover was 26 per cent up at FFr18.9bn. On a pro-forma basis, the gain was 8.1 per cent compared with the 1993 first half. Just over one-third of turnover came from markets outside France. Consolidated investments during the period amounted to FFr2.35bn, about half of which represented the acquisition of 50 per cent of the shares of ODA. Cashflow rose to FFr771m, a rise of 26 per cent over the comparable period.</p>

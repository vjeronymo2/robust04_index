			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef </F> Moravcik by Yves-Michel Riols and Martin Plichta in Bratislava;  date not given: "Slovak Prime Minister Thinks `Balladur Plan  Should Not Be Limited to Minorities Questions'"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--Jozef Moravcik, Bratislava  government chief, is expected in Paris 16-17 May for his first  visit to a European Union [EU] country since his investiture in  March. In an interview with LE MONDE, he supports the idea of a  Pact of Stability for Europe proposed by [French Prime Minister]  Balladur but hopes that it will also become a springboard for  the expansion of the EU to the former Socialist countries.  [passage omitted]    Not enjoying the prestige of its Czech neighbor, easily  identified with its charismatic President Vaclav Havel, Slovakia  nonetheless demonstrated a reassuring responsibility during the  political crisis at the beginning of the year that brought down  Vladimir Meciar. Just two days after his departure, a broad  coalition ranging from Catholic conservatives to former  communists was formed under the leadership of Mr. Moravcik to  lead the country to the parliamentary elections, which have been  brought forward to September. "We have succeeded in calming the  political debate," he said, "and we hope that the extremist  factions will be gradually marginalized."  <H5>  Man of Compromise </H5>   One of the main issues in this easing of tension desired by  Bratislava relates to the normalization of relations with  neighboring Hungary. Since the fall of the communist regimes in  these two countries, relations have deteriorated, especially  through the controversy over the large Hungarian minority in  Slovakia (600,000 people, 11 percent of the population). This  controversy is at the heart of the concerns of the Stability  Pact proposed by Mr. Balladur. And, in the run-up to the  conference on this project in Paris on 26 and 27 May, Mr.  Moravcik will come to explain to the French officials that he  does not have either the Hungarians' sustained interest nor the  Czechs' strong reservations toward this diplomatic initiative.    Faithful to his image as a man of compromise, the Slovak  prime minister welcomes an initiative that "could provide a  framework for the problem of minorities. And the solutions  proposed could then be included in bilateral treaties." But  this project, drawn up in the wake of the trauma created by the  Yugoslav war, could not, in Jozef Moravcik's view, "be limited  to just the question of minorities." He stressed that "the  stability of the postcommunist countries also depends on their  economic development and the future integration into the EU."  In saying this, he was echoing a criticism that is increasingly  heard among the Central European countries, which are irritated  by the uncertainties surrounding the process of integration into  the EU and by the Twelve's protectionism. This bitterness is  particularly strong because East-West trade has been very  imbalanced in favor of the EU since the end of communism.    Mr. Moravcik is therefore suggesting that the Stability Pact  should go further than its initial framework and become "a  positive contribution to the definition of a timetable and  criteria making it possible for our countries to prepare for  their integration into Europe." In other words, he is stressing  that the states of Central Europe are perfectly aware that their  rapprochement with the EU depends on a settlement of their  historical disputes but that, by limiting itself to this one  objective, the Balladur plan loses much of its justification.  This is an argument that is also put forward by the Poles, who  think they are no longer concerned by the Stability Pact because  they have already concluded treaties of friendship with their  neighbors, especially the Ukrainians and the Lithuanians.    With regard to the Hungarian-Slovak dispute, Mr. Moravcik  hinted that Bratislava and Budapest can solve this problem  themselves without the arbitration of a multilateral body. As a  sign of this new desire for compromise, the Slovak Parliament  adopted one of the Council of Europe's two recommendations  relating to the use of Hungarian names in Slovakia at the end of  April. And, on Tuesday, 10 May, Moravcik's government gave the  go-ahead to the other recommendation on bilingual signs in the  communes in which large numbers of Hungarians live.    In addition, the Socialists and the Liberals, who were in  the  lead after the first round of parliamentary elections in  Hungary, have several times expressed their desire to reach a  "historic reconciliation" with the neighboring countries. "The  improvement in our relations with Hungary is one of our  priorities," the head of the Slovak Government stressed. "We  want to conclude a bilateral treaty as quickly as possible."    The atmosphere is now clearly more favorable to easing  tension. But the main obstacle still has to be overcome:  recognition of the inviolability of borders. This is a clause  that Hungary has so far always refused to include in a treaty  with Slovakia and Romania, arguing that such a pledge had  already been given in the framework of the 1947 Paris Treaty and  the 1975 Helsinki Agreements. Before envisaging such a  declaration on borders, Budapest wants to secure guarantees on  the rights of the Hungarian minorities in these two countries.  Even though the rapid conclusion of this dispute seems  difficult, there is nonetheless a concern to create a new  climate of confidence.    Jozef Moravcik therefore wants to initiate an "impetus for  peace" that is sufficiently strong to withstand electoral  changes. Indeed, there is nothing to say that his government  will still be at the helm after the September parliamentary  elections. The opinion polls are still giving the lead to  Vladimir Meciar.</p>

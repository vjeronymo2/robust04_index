			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Election-ZEIT" poll conducted by Infratest Burke Berlin </F> for DIE ZEIT: "The Camps Are Taking Shape"]    [Text]The election campaign has not really started yet and  the electorate has not reached any unequivocal and stable  decisions at all. The voters can still be swayed.    These findings have had a particular impact on Rudolf  Scharping in the intervening weeks between our first poll (on  which we reported in the 11 March 1994 issue of DIE ZEIT) and  this second "Election-ZEIT" poll. Scharping, the chairman of the  Social Democratic Party (SPD), is still ahead of Helmut Kohl  when it comes to the response to the hypothetical question of  which candidate people would vote for "if a direct election for  chancellor could be held." But Scharping slipped from 42 to 39  percent while Kohl climbed from 28 to 33 percent. The total  shift of 8 percentage points is larger than Scharping's  remaining 6-percent lead. Our poll, conducted during the week of  14 March to 22 March, also reflects the somewhat unprofessional  way in which Scharping presented his proposal for a tax hike. Is  his drop in the poll merely indicative of a momentary reaction  or a loss of some significance?    Detailed analysis of the figures shows that both Scharping  and Kohl made gains only among the voters of eastern Germany.  Scharping gained 11 percentage points and Kohl gained 3 percent.  The percentage of those who failed to decide on either candidate  dropped from 33 percent to 18 percent in eastern Germany, which  is 4 percentage points less than in western Germany.    We are thus experiencing the very beginnings of distinct  polarization, albeit with apparently paradoxical consequences,  i.e. the more the voters drop their reticence and decide on one  camp or another, the smaller the differences between the  individual candidates and the political parties become.    The number of those who remain unconvinced by any party  declined from 31 percent to 26 percent and the number of those  who responded "I don't know" dropped from 9 percent to 7  percent. At the same time the gap between the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the SPD  shrunk from 9 percentage points to 6 percentage points. The  respondents who opted for the CDU/CSU was up from 18 percent to  23 percent while those opting for the SPD only climbed from 27  percent to 29 percent. At a generally low level the differences  even out, i.e. 29 percent for the SPD, 23 percent for the  CDU/CSU and 26 percent expressing no party preference. The  campaign thus focuses on the one-third of the electorate who  opted for none of the political parties or whose response was "I  don't know."    What are the main campaign themes? While it is by no means  surprising that 65 percent of the voters view unemployment as  the most serious problem, it is surprising how clearly this  issue outranks all others in importance. Even the "internal  security" issue which virtually everyone had assumed could be  exploited along populist lines ranked behind the environment,  i.e. seven percent as against 10 percent. Oddly enough, the  "internal unity" problem came in at just about 5 percent. Even  among east Germans only 13 percent of the sample considered the  issue important enough. Could it be that joblessness is the one  issue which really unites us Germans?    The question elicits well-known contradictory responses,  e.g.  I am pretty well off but the situation is pretty bad. Of those  polled 23 percent believe that unemployment will decline over  the next one or two years, and 45 percent think it will increase  even more, but east Germans, interestingly enough, are a little  less pessimistic than west Germans. Nonetheless, 45 percent and  37 percent respectively believe that their jobs are secure or  even very secure. On the other hand, 15 percent of the  jobholding voters think their jobs are "fairly" or "very"  insecure--and that represents a substantial potential for  crisis. All in all, however, the voters are much farther ahead  politically than the parties and organizations think they are. A  large and in some cases overwhelming majority of the voters  would be prepared to make sacrifices, if unemployment could be  brought under control. Seventy-two percent would agree to wage  cuts; 86 percent would even work on Saturdays; 68 percent would  work fewer hours for less pay. Low-income voters would be  prepared to work more while higher earners would agree to less  income.    Maybe this underestimation of the voters is part of the  reason why they do not think the political parties generally are  particularly well equipped to bring about a solution to economic  problems. 31 percent of the respondents expressed "no party  preference" and as many as 10 percent said "I don't know."  Against this somber background, with neither party holding a  real lead any longer, the 28 percent in favor of the CDU/CSU and  the 26 percent favoring the SPD do not look impressive. What is  truly sensational and downright alarming for the Free Democrats  is that a mere 1 percent of the voters feel that this supposedly  traditional "economics party" has what it takes to deal with the  economy--which is equal to the percentage obtained by the  Greens, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), or the  Republicans.    As part of a study commissioned by DIE ZEIT, Infratest  Burke Berlin took a poll of 1,001 eligible voters. The  respondents were selected at random. The poll was conducted  between 14 and 22 March 1994.</p>

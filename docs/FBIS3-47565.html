Yeltsin pledged to press on with democratic reforms in  Russia  while Clinton reconfirmed continued support for the Russian  efforts, Hata told a news conference.    Japan will also continue to back Russian reform efforts in  cooperation with other Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized  nations, Hata said.    He also gave high marks to the scheduled signing of an  agreement among the U.S., Russia and Ukraine which is expected  to pave the way for Kiev to scrap nuclear missiles, saying the  accord would contribute to the world's security and that Japan  will continue to cooperate in it.

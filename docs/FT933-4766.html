			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Norwegian ferry group plans to raise NKr150m VARD, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday announced plans to raise NKr150m through a placing of 3m shares with institutional investors, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. The issue is aimed at strengthening Vard's equity base and providing greater financial flexibility. Vard's shares closed NKr1.50 higher at NKr53.50 yesterday on the news. The issue is being arranged by Oslo-based Elcon Securities and DnB Fonds, a unit of Den norske Bank. The shares are to be issued at NKr50 each. Vard, which has total borrowings of around Dollars 220m, said the issue will allow the group to meet debt maturities of Dollars 35m - Dollars 40m due this autumn. The company said that the fresh capital would allow a fruitful and constructive discussion with creditors on how to go forward with the refinancing. News of the share issue follows the announcement last week that Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian investor, had built up a 7 per cent stake in Vard.</p>

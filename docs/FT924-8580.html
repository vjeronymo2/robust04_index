			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.7 per cent on fears of delay in budget CONCERN OVER a possible delay in the approval of the supplementary budget added to the effect of a spate of negative interim reports, and the Nikkei average lost 2.7 per cent on arbitrage unwinding and small-lot profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 452.76 down at 16,417.05, near the day's low of 16,416.45 recorded just before the close. It opened at the day's high of 16,825.48 and was taken lower by index-linked selling and foreigners' liquidation of holdings. Volume dipped to 180m shares from 198m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 864 to 71, with 127 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 26.50 to 1,249.46. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.63 to 999.47. Worries that opposition parties will delay the debate over the supplementary budget, including the emergency economic package in the current extraordinary Diet session, depressed sentiment. The opposition has been calling for testimony by Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of the LDP, and Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister, to explain the the party's links with Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery company, as well as with gangsters and right-wing activists. Public pension funds did not support the falling market. 'Public funds are not in a rush. A lot of fund man-agers seem to be saving their firepower for March, the fiscal year-end,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. Electronic issues were sold by investment trusts and tokkin funds, or specified money trusts. NEC and Fujitsu weakened Y8 and Y25 to year's lows of Y648 and Y510 respectively. Domestic fund managers said that while electronic stocks looked cheap, hopes of a recovery seemed thin due to slowing demand. Aids-related shares plunged, with dealers and investors discouraged by last week's announcement by TSD, a computer company on the over-the-counter market, that it had previously made false announcements over clinical tests of its HIV vaccine. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, fell Y60 to Y1,290 and Meiji Milk Products shed Y36 to Y875. Securities companies lost ground on prospects of poor earnings because of disappointing market volume. Traders said most brokers could have overestimated their annual profit forecasts, based on projected average daily volume for the second half of between 300m to 400m shares. The figure for October has only been 218m shares. Nomura Securities receded Y50 to Y1,320 and Daiwa Securities Y29 to Y781. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 369.99 to 17,927.94 in volume of 10.2m shares. Roundup TURNOVER put on a better showing than share prices in parts of the region, but South Korea starred in both departments. SEOUL registered its fifth consecutive gain in a record turnover, on buying by aggressive individual investors. The composite index rose 22.46, or 3.4 per cent, to 686.46 as 71.05m shares worth Won1.06 trillion changed hands, against a previous turnover record of Won972.87bn on July 30, 1991. SINGAPORE achieved record volume of 348.8m shares, against an earlier peak of 269.2m on March 6, 1991, but the Straits Times Industrial index closed only 2.76 higher at 1,415.88. Dealers said investors were not showing much enthusiasm for Singaporean shares, and that Malaysian stocks were still receiving most of the attention. KUALA LUMPUR fell as volume soared to a new high of 471.6m shares, against 371.8m on Friday. Losses in some major component stocks pushed the composite index down 5.67 to 648.93. HONG KONG subsided after its recent gains. The Hang Seng index relinquished 47.10 at 6,267.91 in turnover of HKDollars 2.75bn. BANGKOK dropped 2.1 per cent, led down by a substantial correction in the banking and finance and securities sectors. The SET index closed 19.72 off at 939.36 in Bt13.8bn turnover. MANILA stocks were depressed by the crime situation and prospects of prolonged power cuts. The composite index declined 5.02 to 1,345.66. AUSTRALIA was pushed down by continued uncertainty about Westpac, and a general lack of positive news. The All Ordinaries index closed 3.8 easier at 1,419.5. BOMBAY fell a further 2.6 per cent on rumours that at least 12 Calcutta brokers were on the brink of a payment default. Sentiment in Bombay was also hit by double-digit inflation and the BSE index lost 70.80 to 2,685.39.</p>

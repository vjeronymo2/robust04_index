			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 14 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation is insisting that heavy weapons of the Bosnian  Serbs besieging Sarajevo be placed under full and effective  United Nations control, a NATO spokesman said here Monday [14  February].    Both the U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry and his French  counterpart Francois Leotard have warned there will be no  extension to the 10-day deadline set by the alliance for the  withdrawal of heavy guns.    The NATO spokesman was reacting to reports from the Bosnian  capital that the United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) was  bending to conditions put by the Bosnian Serb military on how to  place their artillery under UN control.    "For us, control means that these weapons are sequestered  (by  UNPROFOR) so they cannot be used," the NATO spokesman said.    Last Wednesday NATO issued a 10-day ultimatum for the  Bosnian  Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons at least 20 kilometres  (12.5 miles) from the outskirts of the Bosnian capital, or place  them under UN control.    The ultimatum expires at 2400 GMT on Sunday night. If it is  not met, NATO has said it will launch air strikes against the  heavy weapons emplacements. The NATO spokesman said there would  be no extension of the deadline.    But the Bosnian Serb chief of staff, Manojlo Milovanovic,  said at the weekend that Bosnian Moslem troops would have to be  placed under UN control as a condition for handing over control  of the Serb heavy weaponry.    In apparent defiance of the NATO ultimatum, he said his  forces intended to keep their weapons in place, but under UN  surveillance and only if the Moslem infantry was also put under  UN control.    On Sunday, the British deputy commander of UNPROFOR forces  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lieutenant-Colonel Simon Shadbolt, said the  concept of "control" did not mean the Bosnian Serbs would have  to move their weapons.    "There are different ways of controlling things than to  physically put them inside barbed wire," he said.    But the NATO spokesman said Shadbolt's interpretation was  too  loose and that simple monitoring of the weapons was not good  enough "because this has never stopped the weapons being used."    He added that NATO had its own air surveillance intelligence  about the artillery emplacements. "We have our own means of  checking up," the spokesman said.    A British official said there were cautious grounds for  optimism despite the slow pace of the weapons hand-over, because  the ceasefire around Sarajevo was holding. "So far so good, but  we haven't got very far yet," he said.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon Corp.: The Toronto-based film distributor reported a  second-quarter loss of $39 million, contrasted with a profit of $7 million a  year ago. Revenue totaled $149 million, up 2%. The results were hurt by a  since-resolved dispute with "a major distributor," a writeoff of $7 million  after a decision to abandon a U.S. limited partnership deal and $1 million in  fees associated with the creation of a special directors committee to review  any proposals to acquire the corporation.  </P></p>

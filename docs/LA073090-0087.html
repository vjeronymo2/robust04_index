			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> DEFENDING THE AVANT-GARDE FROM THE HYSTERICAL HOUNDS OF CONSERVATISM;  </P> <P> WORKS THAT USED TO BE OF INTEREST ONLY TO A SMALL COTERIE ARE NOW BEING  ASSESSED FOR THEIR MORAL FITNESS BY THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER BOTHER TO  SEE THEM.  </P> <P> This is a cautionary tale, but I still haven't figured out what the moral is.  </P> <P> Last month, I got a call from an associate of Holly Hughes, a New York  performance artist whose work I reviewed last year when she appeared in Santa  Monica. The woman on the phone told me that Hughes' National Endowment for the  Arts grant proposal had been recommended for funding by the NEA's Theater Arts  program.  </P> <P> However, a story that had just appeared in the right-wing Washington Times said  that NEA chairman John Frohnmayer was about to deny funding to Hughes and three  other artists -- Tim Miller and John Fleck of Los Angeles and Karen Finley of  New York -- because he wanted to mollify political opponents of the Endowment.  Work by all four artists frequently involves imagery frankly intended to  provoke middle-of-the-road viewers.  </P> <P> Hughes' associate said she was calling various critics to ask them to write  brief statements testifying to the artistic validity of Hughes' work, to be  submitted to Frohnmayer. I had enjoyed the sly sexual humor of the text of  Hughes' "World Without End" -- a piece she reprised this past weekend at  Highways in Santa Monica -- and I found Hughes to be a witty and able  performer.  </P> <P> Before I composed my statement, I read the Washington Times story. It called  Hughes "a solo performer and writer of theater skits." Apparently quoting from  a review (whose author was uncredited), the story said that in Hughes' work,  "World Without End," she "demonstrates how her mother imparted the 'secret  meaning of life' by displaying her body and . . . placing her hand up her  vagina."  </P> <P> Her works "are less concerned with male-female relationships," the story  continued, than "with lesbian desire" -- the latter words taken out of context  from another uncredited review of Hughes' "Dress Suits to Hire."  </P> <P> Faced with such descriptions -- sure to raise the hackles of many readers,  including conservative members of Congress -- it seemed that I ought to  describe Hughes' work in such a way that even someone who (let's say) secretly  despised Lesbians might view it as eminently palatable and broadly humanistic.  </P> <P> So my statement, which I faxed to Hughes in New York, said: "Holly Hughes' work  involves a poetic transformation of the everyday activities of women into  gestures that reveal the elemental sexual nature shared by all of humanity. She  strips away social veneer to uncover the primal essence of her characters. This  is art that treats the human condition in a metaphorical way, with lyricism,  warmth and humor."  </P> <P> Well, as you probably know, nothing anybody wrote in Hughes' defense seems to  have made much difference. Without explanation, the NEA decided to withhold  awards to the four artists.  </P> <P> Last week, a story in the Los Angeles Times reported that the NEA's advisory  council is considering awarding Hughes and another member of the "NEA four"  grants from an Inter-Arts program called Artists Projects: New Forms. But  subsequently it was revealed that two members of the "peer review" panel which  initially awarded the Theater Arts grants were also collaborators on Hughes'  and Finley's proposed projects.  </P> <P> Everyone involved apparently made a full declaration of potential conflict of  interest at the appropriate time, and this situation is common in the tiny  world of progressive art forms. (There simply are not that many "peers" to draw  from at any given time.) But to the outside world -- and to some members of the  independent commission appointed by President Bush to scrutinize the NEA's  performance -- the situation smacked of impropriety. It hardly could have come  at a worse moment in the life of risk-taking art forms.  </P> <P> In the meantime, during the past few months of right-wing hysteria over  non-mainstream art, I've become increasingly concerned about the problems  involved in writing for "polite society" about visual and performance art that  exists primarily to unsettle this society.  </P> <P> One problem is that, while all good art is complex and takes time to fully  explore, journalism -- as well as the hectic pace of contemporary life --  favors information that comes across with a minimum of elaborate and involved  explanations.  </P> <P> It is much easier to condemn a work by brandishing loaded words and phrases  such as "lesbian desire" than to praise it by evoking the dense web of imagery  -- achieved through words, movements, sounds and facial expressions -- that a  performer can muster in her art.  </P> <P> But even in attempting to write supportive commentary, reviewers are obliged to  pick and choose the images we wish to discuss. And here's where we are  increasingly in a bind. Do we tactfully ignore the aspects of a work that are  deliberately disgusting or sexually frank in order to plead for the "universal"  appeal of the work as a whole?  </P> <P> The problem is that radical art is not about reaffirming the comfortable truths  we already hold.  </P> <P> Such work does make us uncomfortable from time to time. If we are heterosexual,  we may be embarrassed at the degree of empathy we feel for homosexual feelings  or experiences. Rooted in our self-defined notion of sexuality, whatever it may  be, we may shy away from acknowledging "the other" in ourselves. We may laugh  nervously at evocations of extreme states of human behavior, embarrassed to be  eavesdropping so intently at such intimate or repellent scenes.  </P> <P> But the works that make viewers uncomfortable or angry or both are provoking  them to ask themselves, What do we really believe and why? Why do we act the  way we do? Are we so imprisoned within the self-righteous paths we lay out for  ourselves that we cannot for a moment consider a radically different point of  view?  </P> <P> Of course, there are works that are "on the edge" but also (we reviewers may  think) bad art. Nowhere is it written that the further out you go, the better  you get. But in condemning such work, we may worry that we are being  misunderstood, that readers feel relieved to be spared "such filth" rather than  simply a half-baked work of art.  </P> <P>  It seems to me that the more the arts have become enshrined as culturally  mainstream activities, the more layers of misunderstanding have embalmed them.  In decades past, avant-garde works of art, in particular, were seen and debated  by tiny coteries. The rest of the world generally ignored them.  </P> <P> But in our time, a Pageant of the Masters-style notion of the pleasantly  "uplifting" role of art has been trumpeted by the media as well as well-meaning  publicists at purse-weighing arts institutions throughout the land. In a way,  it seems sadly unremarkable that people with no art background whatsoever are  now complaining about the moral fitness of obscure work they normally would  never see -- or even hear about -- if self-appointed right-wing crusaders had  not spread the word.  </P> <P> To be sure, the nay-sayers are said to be incensed about awarding of tax money  (via the NEA) to art deemed objectionable. But many infinitely more far-ranging  and expensive activities supported by our tax dollars have been objectionable  to portions of the populace, from the development of the MX missile to the  bailout of savings and loan institutions. It is utterly bizarre that people can  be so distressed by the deliberately marginal activities of an artist with  whose work they and their children probably will never come in contact.  </P> <P> As I said, I don't have an answer to all this. I'm just brooding and waiting  for better days.  </P></p>

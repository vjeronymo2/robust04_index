			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / US air industry attacks BA over new routes BRITISH AIRWAYS is to start services between the US and both Birmingham and Manchester. The move yesterday provoked a sharp attack from the US airline industry, which said the move highlighted the unfair advantages BA had over its US rivals. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of US carrier United Airlines, last night met Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, to renew pressure on the government to ease restrictions on the operations of American carriers in the UK. Yesterday Mr Wolf said that BA's announcement 'underscores the discriminatory nature of air services between our two countries'. Mr Wolf pressed Mr MacGregor to allow United Airlines to fly twice daily between the US and Manchester and Birmingham. More than 200 BA cabin crew staff in Manchester and Birmingham yesterday agreed to accept new working practices and end their dispute. The Civil Aviation Authority has recommended to the government that a fund to protect scheduled airline passengers should be raised by a levy on UK airlines, not customers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Another massacre of Vietnamese nationals in  Cambodia has been carried out by the Khmer Rouge. The incident  occurred in Hamlet 8, Troeuy Sla village, S'ang District of  Kandal Province on 9 April. This act has caused strong  indignation within the Vietnamese Government and population. It  is not the first massacre. The Khmer Rouge have never given up  their intention to kill Vietnamese nationals who are now living  in Cambodia. Hundreds of Vietnamese nationals, especially  fishermen in Battambang and Siem Reap Provinces have been killed  or wounded by armed attacks from the Khmer Rouge. The attacks  were very barbarous.    This time, 13 people were killed and 27 others wounded; nine  were children and one woman with a 23-day-old child. The mother  was killed and the child wounded.    In its statement on Monday [11 April], the Vietnamese  Government held that following a series of previous cruel acts  of terrorism against Vietnamese nationals, this massacre once  again was an open challenge to mankind's conscience and brazenly  violated human rights recognized in international conventions.    The statement said that this savage act was clearly aimed at  arousing national hatred and destroying the traditional  friendship between the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples.    The Vietnamese Government strongly condemns the latest mass  killing and earnestly asks Prince Sihanouk and the Government of  Cambodia to take urgent and effective measures to ensure safety  of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. They have the right to a  peaceful life as do other foreign residents in Cambodia in  conformity with the spirit and words of the joint communique of  4 April 1994.    The Vietnamese Government also called on the United Nations,  other signatories of the Paris agreement on Cambodia, and the  world public to voice their protest and to take resolute  measures to prevent such terrorism against Vietnamese nationals.    A representative of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry had a  meeting with the Cambodian Charge d'Affaires in Hanoi Mr. Chhong  Toeng, telling him of the anger of the Government and people of  Vietnam over the mass killing. The Cambodian official was asked  to convey immediately to the Cambodian Government Vietnam's  demand for urgent, effective measures to put a stop to the  killing of Vietnamese nationals.    Earlier, the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia sent note to  Cambodians, diplomatic corps, and international organizations in  Cambodia denouncing this cruel act of the Khmer Rouge.</p>

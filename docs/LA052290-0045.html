			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS: OLSON INDUSTRIES POSTS FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT  </P> <P> Olson Industries Inc., continuing a financial rebound, reported a first-quarter  profit of $595,658 compared with a year-earlier loss of $663,025.  </P> <P> Olson's only operating unit is Dolco Packaging, a maker of plastic packaging  products now reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. In  the past two quarters, the Sherman Oaks-based company has reported profits  after suffering heavy losses earlier.  </P> <P> The profit in the latest quarter, which ended March 31, came despite a slight  drop in sales, to $18.9 million from $19.1 million. Olson attributed the  earnings to a 16% decline in its average price for resin, the key raw material  used in its packaging products.  </P></p>

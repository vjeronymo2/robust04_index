When coal is burned to generate  electric power, CO[.sub]2[/] released accounts for 60 percent  of the total greenhouse gases. According to the article on  "Global Climate Change and Development of China's Energy  Resources" published by Zhu Bin [2612 2430] in ENERGY OF CHINA  (No 5, 1993) [See JPRS-CEN-93-010, 5 Nov 93, pp 23-27], although  China ranks third in total CO[.sub]2[/] discharge -- behind  the United States and the former Soviet Union -- China's total  CO[.sub]2[/] released by coal-burning ranks top among the  three countries. By using Zhu Bin's method, a bar chart  demonstrating China's future CO[.sub]2[/] emission is shown  in Figure 2 below. Shadowed areas are CO[.sub]2[/] released  by power-generating plants, which accounts for 35 percent of  total CO[.sub]2[/] emission.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-008-33A>      Figure 2. Future CO[.sub]2[/] Emission in China </FIG>     According to information provided in the article on  "Transaction on Energy Conversion" published in IEEE  [1992.7(2)], which stated that if, for the power plants,  Superconducting Magnetism Energy Storage (SMES) is used to  replace oil-fired or gas-burning units of 1 percent of total  installed capacity, CO[.sub]2[/] emission will be reduced by  1.6 percent. If SMES is used to replace 1 percent of the  coal-fired units in China, then CO[.sub]2[/] emissions could  be further reduced by 2.4 percent or more. Table 1 shows  predicted data of gradual decrease of CO[.sub]2[/] emission  resulting from gradual replacement of oil-fired and gas-burning  units by SMES in China.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

If China fails to  do so, it will again lag behind other nations in the area of  electric power construction.</p>

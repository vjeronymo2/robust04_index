			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: Rigoletto and Ariadne - English National Opera LAST week's curtain-up on the 1992-93 English National Opera season filled the Coliseum with the sombre chords of Rigoletto, and then with the chrome-shiny decor and hip-thrusting body-language of Jonathan Miller's celebrated Fifties New York updating. This production was supposed to have been retired from service a few years back; but in hard times its crowd-pulling tendencies amounted to an offer ENO could not refuse, and it has been hoist into harness once more. I have no quarrel with that. Miller's time-travelling correspondences have never made true Verdian sense under the vividly detailed surface (for if the Duke is a minor villain, not a real political force in the land, his abuse of power for private ends is hardly a shocking matter). But at its best, when tautly delivered, the show has allowed the company to re-create the opera's emotional relationships with a raw dramatic urgency that is its own best justification. Unfortunately, that all-important tautness seemed woefully absent on Thursday, and, without the staging, declined into just another operatic costume-drama, a bit tatty round the edges. It had an under-rehearsed look and - as a result of Michael Lloyd's expansive but too often slack-muscled conducting - sound. No concern for all-embracing word-clarity was evident; no effort had apparently been directed toward basing the drama on the discipline of the singing line. This particularly affected Cathryn Pope's first attempt at Gilda. The jury is still out on whether her problem is miscasting - as the quantity of strained high phrases might seem to indicate - or inadequate schooling (for Miss Pope's considerable experience has been built up on types of soprano-writing very different from Verdi). I lean to the second opinion, and suspect that she will find eventually her own way into the music, and thence into a character that on this occasion proved so elusive. As 'Duke' and Rigoletto we had the original 1982 cast-members, Arthur Davies and John Rawnsley. Time has coarsened the tone of the former and taken much of the house-filling vocal spin out of the latter. But both still know how to hold the stage, and in this context the gift proves precious. As a small bonus there were also Terry Jenkins's Borsa, always freshly inventive, the dusky alto richness of Patricia Bardon's Maddalena, and the genuine dramatic imagination shown by Michael Druiett's lumbering, sweaty Sparafucile. On the whole, though, a disappointment. Next evening, another ENO revival, but this time a much more cheering one: an Ariadne on Naxos that made a big-house success of this marvellous but infinitely tricky small-house, chamber-orchestral opera. In 1983 Graham Vick's production had consistently botched the difficult points; now, as mounted by Lynn Binstock, the routines of the Prologue have been tidied up a good deal (if not completely) and the plainness of the Opera becomes a vehicle for some powerfully effective principal performances. To the new conductor, Alexander Sander from Vienna, must go main credit for the feeling of apt scale, plausible balance and forward movement that underpins the whole reading. Two large-voiced dramatic sopranos return to their roles: Rita Cullis, a Composer lacking vulnerability and charm but filling the theatre with brightly focused sound, and Janice Cairns, an Ariadne of noble personality and heart-warmingly bold, risk-taking approach to the exposed vocal lines. The great event of the evening was, however, the first London Zerbinetta of the American Cyndia Sieden - astonishingly sweet, true, and free of coyness. In company with a trim quartet of zanies led by Paul Napier-Burrows, she turned the Strauss-Hofmannsthal re-invention of the commedia dell'arte into one of opera's most savoury pleasures.

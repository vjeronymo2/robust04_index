			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on its review of the evidence gathered during its investigation, as well as the information obtained during the enforcement conference, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks did not send the radiographer's assistant's TLD in for processing; that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to conduct an evaluation of this individual's radiation exposure from the incident; and that Mr. Wicks deliberately provided false information regarding the incident to the NRC and false information regarding the individual's radiation exposure history to another licensee of the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, with regard to the NRC's requirement that all radiography personnel be equipped with alarm ratemeters that have been calibrated at periods not to exceed one year, the NRC's investigations found that Mr. Wicks repeatedly failed to ensure that this requirement was met. This violation was first discovered and discussed with Mr. Wicks following an inspection and investigation in April 1993. When the NRC conducted its investigation beginning in January 1994, this same violation was found to have occurred in July 1993, two months after it was first discussed with Mr. Wicks, and again in January 1994 when Mr. Wicks could not produce current calibration records for alarm ratemeters worn by either of two radiography personnel on January 18, 1994. When questioned by NRC investigators, Mr. Wicks provided conflicting statements as to whether he had even supplied ratemeters to his radiographers but he said he understood it was his responsibility to ensure that alarm ratemeters were calibrated. Given the repetitive nature of this violation and Mr. Wicks' knowledge of this requirement, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks deliberately caused licensee to violate this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above, the NRC staff concludes that Larry D. Wicks, President and Radiation Safety Office for WIX, has engaged in deliberate misconduct that has caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 34.33(d), 34.33(f)(4), and 20.201. It further appears that Mr. Wicks has deliberately provided to NRC personnel and to another licensee of the NRC information that he knew to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC, in violation of 10 CFR 30.10. The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information that is complete and accurate in all material respects. Mr. Wicks' actions in causing the Licensee to be in deliberate violation of radiation safety requirements and his misrepresentations to the NRC have raised serious doubts as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC. NRC confidence in Mr. Wicks' conducting NRC-licensed activities safely and in compliance with NRC requirements is further eroded by the fact that he was the President of the company and the Radiation Safety Officer when he engaged in deliberate misconduct. In both of these positions, particularly in his role as the Radiation Safety Officer, Mr. Wicks is relied upon by the NRC to ensure that all radiation safety requirements are met. Conduct of this nature cannot and will not be tolerated by the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected, if Mr. Wicks were permitted at this time to engage in NRC-licensed activities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that Larry D. Wicks be prohibited from engaging in NRC-licensed activities (including any supervising, training, or auditing) for either an NRC licensee or an Agreement State licensee performing licensed activities in areas of NRC jurisdiction in accordance with 10 CFR 150.20 for a period of five (5) years from the date of this Order. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the violations and conduct described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 30.10, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THAT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Larry Dale Wicks is prohibited for five years from the date of this Order from engaging in NRC-licensed activities, except as provided in item 3, below. NRC-licensed activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licensees conducted pursuant to the authority by 10 CFR 150.20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

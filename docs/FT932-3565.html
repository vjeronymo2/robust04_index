			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Nadir seeks to revoke power given to trustee MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, has attempted to revoke the power of attorney which he gave to his trustee in bankruptcy in renewed efforts formally to regain control of his assets. Mr Neil Cooper, the trustee from accountants Robson Rhodes, confirmed yesterday that he had received a letter in Turkish and English signed by Mr Nadir on Friday. The letter withdrew Mr Cooper's right to act on behalf of Mr Nadir. If Mr Nadir's revocation is accepted, it will further threaten attempts by the trustee to keep control of assets in Turkey on behalf of creditors. It could also prove politically embarrassing for the Turkish government, which has been in talks with the Serious Fraud Office and the British authorities about the former head of Polly Peck International. The action comes just in advance of Tuesday's preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey on Mr Nadir's case, at which lawyers representing Mr Cooper will claim rights to Pounds 2m of Mr Nadir's Pounds 3.5m bail money which he forfeited by fleeing to Northern Cyprus last month. Mr Cooper said documents he had obtained after raids on Mr Nadir's London home just before and after the businessman fled from the UK showed that he had provided Pounds 2m towards his own bail. Previously it had been believed that the money was put up by friends, but according to Mr Cooper the documents suggest a 'back-to-back' arrangement by which Mr Nadir had his own money filtered through two banks to conceal its origin before it was passed to his solicitors as cash security for bail. One of the banks was Impexbank, a Turkish bank once owned by Mr Nadir. Mr Cooper said he was taking legal advice on whether Mr Nadir's letter attempting to revoke power of attorney would be accepted. 'This is incompatible with the noises he was making that he was about to do the decent thing by Polly Peck shareholders,' he said. Mr Cooper also revealed that he was considering action against Aysegul, Mr Nadir's former wife, in connection with 'hundreds of thousands of pounds' of his assets, including works of art, which had reached her in the past five years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]  presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon said 3 May  "appears to me to be a very good date" to hold a debate with PAN  [National Action Party] presidential candidate Diego Fernandez  de Cevallos.    Meanwhile, PRI leader Fernando Ortiz Arana reported the date  had been accepted. Zedillo also said "it is a very astute  proposal" for the debate to take place at the National Chamber  of Radio and Television Industry (CNIRT), indicating he was  "waiting for additional details." Former PRI candidate Luis  Donaldo Colosio had said the appropriate location for this type  of event should be the Federal Electoral Institute to distance  the event from special interests.    In the evening, the PRI candidate sent a letter to  Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas [presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic  Revolution, PRD], in which he requests "a prompt reply" on the  date and conditions for the debate, while he indicated that  other candidates should not be disqualified from the debate.  Zedillo said he does not agree "with efforts to discount other  parties that represent ideological plurality and diversity in  the nation's political life."    In his first reference to the issue, the PRI candidate  replied as follows from his party's headquarters: I am waiting  for the candidates' reply. I will respectfully and attentively  consider everything they have to say. Today, I read in the  press that Fernandez de Cevallos had made two specific proposals  to establish the date (3 May). In my opinion, this is very good.    He added: "Another proposal is for the CNIRT to coordinate  and organize the debate. This also is a very astute proposal.  I will be waiting for additional details."    Zedillo did not refer to any contact with Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas, but Fernando Ortiz Arana said he had accepted. Ortiz  Arana said: "There was a reply from the PAN and PRD candidates  accepting our candidate Erneswto Zedillo's invitation to hold a  debate. The important issue is that soon we will be presenting  our proposals, program, and actions in a public debate, thereby  keeping our commitment to the community."    He added: "The two parties have accepted the proposals, and  PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has proposed the date  of 3 May for the debate. Our candidate and the party have  accepted this, and all PRI members will be with Ernesto Zedillo  at the debate he has convened."    Ortiz Arana insisted that Zedillo "acknowledges the  principle  of equality among all candidates and hopes there will be an  opportunity to debate our positions with the other candidates  from all of the political parties throughout the campaign."    The following is the text of a letter sent to the PRD  candidate:    "Engineer Cardenas:    "I appreciate your reply to the invitation sent to you  yesterday by Diego Fernandez de Ceballos, PAN presidential  candidate, to hold as soon as possible a debate to be broadcast  by radio and television.    ``I am pleased to read that you have been willing to debate  since November. Nevertheless, it is good to remember that it  was Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI presidential candidate, who for  the first time openly and directly proposed a debate.    ``Allow me to stress that the terms of my invitation are  perfectly clear. I have proposed a debate between Fernandez de  Ceballos, you, and me on our ideas and our political platforms.  I have proposed a live and uninterrupted debate to be broadcast  on radio and television within a framework of unquestionable  impartiality, transparency, and equality.    ``I propose we use only one single broadcast that can be  received and transmitted by all television and radio stations  that want to carry the debate, without favoring any specific  company. In addition, conditions should be provided to allow  representatives of the print media to cover the debate to their  complete satisfaction.    ``I believe that for the debate to be a fair political  exercise that will benefit the people, the participants should  be given equal time to express their ideas. Likewise, we should  be given the opportunity to comment on the other candidates'  responses and to issue opening and final statements. A  moderator of the utmost integrity and impartiality would also  help the candidates adjust to the time allotted.    ``The specific terms of my invitation should correspond to a  definite response. Instead, I read in your letter the following:    ``It would be important, because of this type of event's  widespread dissemination and because of the public's undeniable  interest in such things, to consider holding several other  debates. One or two of these debates could even be between just  you and me because, objectively speaking, it is our proposals  and what we represent that comprise the major points of  contention in this campaign, and the citizens will have to  decide between these two sides when casting their votes.    ``In this regard, I believe it will be the citizens, by way  of the free exercise of their rights, who will decide whether  "objectively speaking, our proposals and what we represent is  what truly is being contested in this campaign and from which  the citizens will have to decide when casting their votes.    ``I do not agree with your attempts to disqualify other  legally registered candidates and I cannot agree with your  attempts to discount other political parties that represent the  ideological plurality and diversity of the nation's political  life. Therefore, I reiterate that in my invitation I indicated  my trust that there will opportunities to debate issues with all  candidates from all parties throughout the campaign.    ``In another turn of events, the above-mentioned paragraph  of  your letter does not indicate whether you have accepted my  invitation, as, by the way, Fernandez Cevallos already has.  Moreover, he proposed that the debate take place on 3 May and  that it be organized by the CNIRT. In turn, I have accepted  both proposals."    ``Hoping to receive a prompt reply from you to my invitation  made yesterday, I remain, very truly yours,''    [Signed] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon</p>

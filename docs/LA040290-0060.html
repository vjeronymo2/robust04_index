			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL USE PLANNED FOR DEVICES, IRAQIS SAY;  </P> <P> NUCLEAR ARMS: ANY USE OF ATOMIC WEAPONS 'WOULD BE MUTUAL SUICIDE' IN THE  MIDEAST, AMBASSADOR SAYS.  </P> <P> Iraqi officials denied Sunday that the electronic devices seized in a  U.S.-British sting operation last week were to be used in nuclear weapons,  saying they were instead purchased for unspecified industrial uses.  </P> <P> "Iraq has neither the capability nor the wish to produce nuclear weapons,"  Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's deputy foreign minister, said Sunday.  </P> <P> He suggested that Iraq sought the U.S.-made capacitors, which can be used to  trigger a nuclear explosion, for research on lasers or other commercial  projects.  </P> <P> Hamdoon and Abdul Amir Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations,  acknowledged in U.S. television interviews that Baghdad possesses chemical  weapons and the rockets to deliver them but insisted that the arms are purely  defensive.  </P> <P> Any use of atomic weapons in the densely populated Middle East "would be mutual  suicide," Anbari said. "It would kill more Arabs, more Palestinians and  Jordanians than any other adversary."  </P> <P> Despite the Iraqi denials, U.S. officials continue to believe that Iraq bought  the electronic triggers as part of a large-scale covert effort to develop  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> A U.S. grand jury in San Diego last week indicted five people and two British  companies on charges that they conspired to smuggle secret nuclear technology  from the United States to Iraq.  </P> <P> Court papers unsealed Thursday described an 18-month sting operation resulting  Wednesday in the arrests of four Iraqi men and one French woman. Authorities  said a San Diego firm tipped off U.S. Customs Service agents in September,  1988, to an Iraqi effort to buy specialized high-speed capacitors capable of  setting off a nuclear explosion.  </P> <P> A shipment of 40 triggers, under close U.S.-British surveillance, was flown to  London early in March, where authorities switched dummy devices for the  triggers. The suspects were picked up on Wednesday as crates containing the  devices, labeled as air-conditioning units, were loaded aboard an Iraqi Airways  jetliner bound for Baghdad.  </P> <P> The Iraqi officials said Sunday that the capacitors, ordered by Iraq's Ministry  of Industry and Military Industrialization, have numerous non-military  applications and were not part of an effort to develop atomic bombs.  </P> <P> "The device which Iraq ordered, as you know, has mostly purposes, usages, in  commercial, scientific and medical as well as military and nuclear devices, and  there are thousands of products like that," Anbari said on ABC's "This Week  with David Brinkley."  </P> <P> And he noted pointedly that Iraq has no reactor to process fuel for nuclear  weapons. Israeli warplanes destroyed Iraq's Osirak research reactor in 1981  because of fears that it was being built to produce enriched uranium for  nuclear warheads.  </P> <P> All of Iraq's arms are defensive, Anbari said, "to deter any aggressor, whether  Israeli, Iranian or anyone else. That is why we have developed long-range  missiles, medium-range missiles, short-range missiles. . . . We have no  capability to manufacture a nuclear device. Period. This should . . . put an  end to all the speculations."  </P> <P> Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) scoffed at the Iraqis' protestations of innocence.  </P> <P> "If (the) remarks were not so disturbing it would be almost amusing because the  facts are the Iraqis have for over a decade been attempting to acquire nuclear  capability," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation."  </P> <P> The purchase of the weapons components is "in keeping with the messianic  mission of (Iraqi leader) Saddam Hussein to become the dominant force in the  Mideast through the use of force and acquisition of weapons of mass  destruction," McCain said.  </P> <P> The United States should make clear that it will "exercise all options,  including military if necessary," to prevent Iraq from developing nuclear  weapons, the senator said.  </P> <P> Hamdoon said Iraq used chemical weapons during the 10-year war with Iran and  acknowledged that the poison gas attacks "in some instances had some effect on  civilians."  </P> <P> Western analysts and human rights groups have accused Baghdad of slaughtering  thousands of ethnic Kurds as well as Iranian civilians in attacks with  chemically armed rockets, bombs and shells.  </P> <P> Hamdoon said his government is prepared to discuss a regional ban on nuclear,  chemical and biological weapons but would not accept sanctions aimed at Iraq  alone.  </P> <P> Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) said Sunday on ABC that the U.S. government and  private industry have contributed to the Mideast arms race by selling weapons  of all descriptions to virtually every nation in the volatile region.  </P></p>

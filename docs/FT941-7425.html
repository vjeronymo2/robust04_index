			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Yeltsin signals a return to strong state traditions President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signalled a shift back to the 'strong state' traditions of Russia and the Soviet Union in a speech to parliamentary deputies. The speech may have stolen some ideological clothes from the nationalist opposition but also claimed fidelity to radical economic reform. He spoke amid uncertainty over whether the amnesty declared on Wednesday by the Russian parliament would release those - including former vice president Alexander Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, former Supreme Soviet chairman  -held awaiting trial for their part in last October's parliamentary revolt against the presidency. Mr Yuri Baturin, Mr Yeltsin's legal aide, was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying that the decision could be annulled on legal grounds, because parliament had in effect pardoned the alleged plotters, a right which belongs only to the president. However, Mr Alexander Yakovlev, a constitutional expert who is Mr Yeltsin's emissary to parliament, said the decision was legal and had to be carried out. The issue overshadowed the long-awaited speech. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former first deputy prime minister, speaking in Germany said the decision was 'a potential cause of civil war'. Mr Yeltsin's toughest remarks in the 50-minute state of the nation speech were in passages on foreign policy. In his most unambiguous vein, he warned that any further expansion of Nato would be a 'path towards new threats for Europe and the world'. In a similarly stark passage on the 25m Russians living beyond Russia's borders in the former Soviet states, he said that Russia would use 'not words, but deeds' to stop discrimination against them, and to guard their civil rights. A strengthened state, which was said to be necessary to address everything from instability in the neighbouring countries caused by rising crime to the need for economic regulation of the market process, was a theme which ran throughout the address. Mr Yeltsin spoke steadily but without obvious emotion, and seemed to have recovered from a recent illness. Passages on the economy included 'the crisis cannot be overcome as long as inflation remains high' and 'enterprises must stop producing products which no one needs'. The remarks signify a continued commitment to radical reforms in spite of signs that the government is bowing to demands from the industrial and agricultural lobbies for increased credits. The president also told his cabinet that improving living standards was a key task of the year. In remarks which briefly echoed the programme of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party, Mr Yeltsin called for the mobilisation of all resources in the fight against crime and for a greater concentration on the sale of arms abroad to fund social and other programmes at home. The strengthening of the state would, he said, draw together the federation and would unite the government and the parliament in a common political effort.

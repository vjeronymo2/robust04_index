			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer, reports first-quarter results on Thursday in the crucial run-up to floating Zeneca, its bioscience subsidiary. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 180m compared with about Pounds 211m for the same period last year. They will be looking at the extent of the impact of the slowdown in continental Europe, particularly in fibres, as well as the upturn in films, polyurethanes and acrylics in the US. The extent of benefits from cost-cutting will also be watched carefully. Tarmac is expected to announce 1992 pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 355m on Tuesday. The company also is expected to adopt the FRS 3 accounting standard, which means that provisions of more than Pounds 300m will be taken above the line. The final dividend of 5.5p is expected to be maintained. The market will want to know what progress the company's disposal programme is making, particularly the planned sale of its waste disposal business. With discount food retailers threatening the supermarket chains, investors will take a keen interest in results of Kwik Save on Thursday. Interim pre-tax profits could be up as much as 20 per cent to about Pounds 60m as more price-conscious consumers turn to it.</p>

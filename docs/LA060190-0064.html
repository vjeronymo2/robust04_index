			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGAN BUYS BAKKER'S TV NETWORK  </P> <P> A bankruptcy judge Thursday approved the sale of the PTL cable television  network to San Diego evangelist Morris Cerullo for $7 million.  </P> <P> Cerullo, a 58-year-old faith healer whose Worldwide Evangelism ministry outbid  fellow evangelist Oral Roberts' $6.3-million offer for the network and  production facility, also signed a contract to buy the other portion of Jim  Bakker's scandal-plagued and bankrupt empire, the 2,200-acre Heritage USA  religious theme park, for $45 million.  </P> <P> PTL trustee Dennis W. Shedd said Cerullo plans to keep the network  headquartered at the Heritage USA park near Ft. Mill, S.C., and to reopen the  theme park, which closed in September.  </P> <P> In a statement, Cerullo's Worldwide Evangelism said it planned to develop a  "five-star seminar and conference center as well as a recreational vehicle  resort and various housing projects" on the Heritage USA site.  </P> <P> Cerullo was unavailable for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> Worldwide Evangelism, which was founded by Cerullo in 1961, produces a daily TV  program called "Victory with Morris Cerullo" that is carried by 40 stations  throughout the country.  </P> <P> PTL has been under control of the bankruptcy court since June, 1987, two months  after Jim Bakker resigned the ministry after a sex-and-hush-money scandal  involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn.  </P></p>

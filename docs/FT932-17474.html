			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / House arrest for Fiat executive MR Francesco Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, was yesterday allowed to swap prison for house arrest after being held in Milan's San Vittore jail since February 22 on charges of corruption and illicit financing of political parties. The charges against Mr Mattioli, one of the three most senior executives of the Turin motor group, refer to illegal payments of L1.8bn (Pounds 750,000) made during the construction of the Milan metro in which Fiat's construction arm, Cogefar-Impresit, was involved. Last week, a civil liberties tribunal refused to release Mr Mattioli from prison on the grounds he could prejudice investigations by Milan magistrates. The court also disclosed allegations of illicit use of overseas accounts by Fiat subsidiaries, including Cogefar Camerun, in Cameroon. This decision provoked a furious reaction from Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, who claimed the courts had no idea how a multinational operated. But at least one newspaper speculated yesterday that Mr Mattioli had helped the magistrates with their inquiries after an unexpected three-hour meeting in San Vittore with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, one of the leading Milan investigative magistrates. Milan magistrates are understood to have presented Mr Mattioli with evidence of funds being passed in 1992 through Banco Unione Commercio of Lugano, 100 per cent owned by Fiat, to accounts held in Switzerland respectively by the chief treasurers of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. Mr Severino Citaristi, who has resigned from his position in the Christian Democrat party, has received over 20 notices of being under investigation on various counts of illicit party funding. Mr Vincenzo Balzamo, his Socialist opposite number, died last autummn of a heart atack after being told he was under investigation. Magistrates yesterday questioned Mr Roberto Araldi, a Milan accountant, over alleged payments by Fiat Avio, the group's aerospace turbines subsidiary, to board members of Enel, the state electricity authority, for a L400bn gas turbine contract.</p>

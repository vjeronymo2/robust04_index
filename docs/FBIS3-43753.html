Unlike the National Party [NP] and the African National  Congress [ANC], the DP met all the criteria needed to make the  country and its citizens prosperous, Mr de Beer said.    These included the fact that the DP was democratic,  supported  peace and stability, favoured free enterprise, trade and  business and believed in small government, low public  expenditure, low taxes and privatisation where appropriate. The  DP also had no links with socialism and communism.    Mr de Beer said that if the ANC and NP purported to be  democrats it would be of the "instant" variety. It had become  convenient for these two parties to change their tunes.</p>

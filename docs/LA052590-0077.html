			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DENIES MONTOYA REQUEST TO STAY FREE DURING APPEAL  </P> <P> A federal district court judge refused Thursday to allow former state Sen.  Joseph B. Montoya to stay out of prison while appealing his conviction on  political corruption charges.  </P> <P> But Judge Milton L. Schwartz said he would consider delaying the Whittier  Democrat's scheduled June 29 prison reporting date to give an appeals court  time to decide whether Montoya should remain free pending appeal.  </P> <P> Faced with challenges to rulings he made while presiding over Montoya's trial  four months ago, Schwartz declared: "I would rule the same way on those  questions today. . . ."  </P> <P> He said he saw "no justification" for allowing the ex-lawmaker to remain free  while a higher court reviews Montoya's appeal, but he acknowledged that the  appeals court itself might decide otherwise.  </P> <P> Montoya did not appear in court. His attorney, Michael S. Sands, said that  neither he nor another Montoya defense attorney, Bruce Kelton, would be  representing Montoya in his appeal. "We don't do appeals," Sands said later.  </P> <P> Montoya was found guilty of seven counts of extortion, racketeering and  money-laundering to become the first state legislator convicted of felony  corruption in 35 years. Facing likely expulsion from the Senate, Montoya  resigned.  </P> <P> Last month, Schwartz sentenced Montoya to 6 1/2 years in prison. The judge said  he would recommend that Montoya serve his time at the minimum-security Lompoc  Federal Penitentiary. Prosecutors have estimated that, under federal sentencing  laws, Montoya will serve at least 5 1/2 years.  </P> <P> In arguing for a delay in Montoya's imprisonment, Sands said that a number of  Schwartz's rulings during the trial could be overturned on appeal, resulting in  a reversal of the conviction. For example, Schwartz -- over the objections of  Montoya's attorneys -- allowed the jury to hear a tape in which Sen. Alan  Robbins (D-Tarzana) told an FBI informant that he would "need to make some  arrangements with Joe" to assure Montoya's support for a special-interest bill.  Asked by the informant what was required for Montoya, Robbins says on the tape,  ". . . a little envelope" and later "I would say about three ($3,000) would be  sufficient."  </P> <P> Prosecutors said that even if Schwartz erred in admitting the tape, the  conviction would stand.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTS ON THE TIMES' NEW FORMAT  </P> <P> Congratulations on the new format. The little boxed background are especially  helpful in recalling material once digested but since misplaced. This comes  close to fulfilling an old dream of mine -- a newspaper so presented that the  reader can see the relationship among stories printed from all parts of the  world, including home. And while I usually "study" my morning newspaper, those  days do come along when one has to glance and run.  </P> <P> One problem (isn't there always?) the bright orange flier announcing the "Good  News" was slicker than a banana peel.  </P> <P> Thanks for all the good thought that went into these changes.  </P> <P> WILLA SIBBS  </P> <P> Palm Desert  </P></p>

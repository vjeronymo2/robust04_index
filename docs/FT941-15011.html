			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Insider dealers fined Pounds 1,500 Two chartered accountants were each fined Pounds 1,500 at Inner London crown court yesterday after being convicted of insider dealing by using confidential knowledge of a planned hostile takeover bid. Mr Ian Morrisey, who works for Hope, Agar and Staines, and Ms Lorelie Staines, formerly with accountants Kidsons Impey, both persuaded others to deal in the shares of building products supplier Aaronson Brothers after learning of a planned takeover bid to be launched by Glunz AG, a German wood company, the court heard. Ms Staines's father bought 12,000 shares which were later sold for Pounds 3,000 profit. Mr Morrisey passed the information on to a contact who bought 5,000 shares. Mr Morrisey bought the shares back before the takeover was announced and later sold them for a Pounds 1,500 profit. Aaronson shares rose from 50p to 80p after the bid announcement in August 1990. The pair gained the information about the bid from a friend, Mr Martin Priddle, an accountant with KPMG Peat Marwick who was later sacked. He 'let the cat out of the bag' two weeks before the announcement of the bid when he met Mr Morrisey and Ms Staines at a garden party, prosecuting counsel said. The prosecution was brought by the Department of Trade and Industry after an investigation in November 1990.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Northern recovery held back by south THE north-west of England and north Wales are experiencing tentative improvements in economic activity but the depressed south-east is holding back recovery. Those are the findings of regional surveys by chambers of commerce in Manchester and Liverpool, and the latest Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin. Prospects in the service sector in the north of England have been improving for five successive quarters. Manchester chamber for the first time in two years reported more service companies taking on labour than shedding it. Low levels of spending in the still relative wealthy south-east, though, are preventing a national recovery and restraining the investment plans of northern companies. In the Manchester chamber's region, manufacturers' investment intentions moved into positive balance - more planning to increase investment than decrease - but were still in negative balance and declining in Merseyside's catchment area. Mr Ian Berry, chief executive of Liverpool chamber, warned: 'Nearly half our firms are still reducing investment in new plant and machinery. This will be disastrous for future prosperity unless the trend is reversed.' The north of England has suffered less than the south in the recession, correcting much of the growth of inequality in income levels between the regions. Incomes per head in the south-east have fallen relative to the national average to levels not seen for 10 years, said Mr Patrick Foley, Lloyds Bank's chief economic adviser. He said, however, that south-east incomes remain 15 per cent higher than the national average, and the region is still best placed to lead Britain out of recession. 'The south-east has the most confident consumers and has also seen the largest adjustment in the overheated housing market. The region seems set to lead the recovery when it happens.' The northern surveys suggest that confidence is rising in all sectors except the building industry. Manufacturers are struggling with a flat UK market, but more are reporting rising export sales than a decline. The chambers cover an area with more than 7m people from the Lake District to mid Wales, accounting for more than 10 per cent of UK gross domestic product. The surveys, of second-quarter trends, involved 930 companies employing more than 150,000 people.</p>

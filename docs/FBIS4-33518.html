			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazilian Workers </F> Party presidential candidate; "special for CLARIN from COMUNICA  PRESS"]    [Text] Brasilia, 4 May -- We are once again on the eve of  an Ibero-American meeting of chiefs of state, which will be held  in Cartagena de las Indias, and are awaiting the December  meeting of American chiefs of state to be held in Miami.    These two events will take place before and after 100  million  Brazilians are to elect, in October, their new president, the  entire Chamber of Deputies, and two-thirds of the Senate.    The Workers Party [PT], of which I was president until a few  days ago and which is the party that is supporting my  presidential bid, considers these two forums to be very  important, especially at a time when the world is experiencing  important transformations and needs to redefine the economic and  political order that emerged at the end of World War II.    This is why we value the Cartagenas meeting, if only it can  help implement concrete measures to face the serious social  problems that Latin America is experiencing, especially the high  degree of poverty. The summit must also contribute toward the  democratization of Haiti, which presupposes an end to the  military dictatorship and the return of Jean Bertrand Aristide  to the presidency.    Regarding the Miami meeting, we are concerned about Cuba's  absence due to the veto of the U.S. Government, which is hosting  the meeting. Such a decision is not compatible with the efforts  of rapprochement that are being made in many parts of the world,  and it maintains an atmosphere on our continent that is  completely out of time and place with the Cold War that has now  been overcome.    In any case, this is an excellent occasion for Brazil's main  opposition force, the PT -- which has a real possibility of  gaining control of government on 1 January 1995 -- to explain  how it views our position in the world. The main problem that  is being experienced today in Brazilian foreign policy is the  absence -- for more than 15 years -- of a national development  project.    In addition to the fact that profound internal changes have  occurred in that period of time, we have also had  transformations in the international situation. The end of the  Soviet Union and the collapse of the Socialist countries,  symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall, have altered, with  the end of the Cold War, the relations between international  forces. But the world economy has also suffered very important  transformations with the emergence of three [as published] great  focal points: megamarkets and very large productive systems, and  this has accelerated what many have called the "globalization"  of the economy.    The social and economic problems that these blocs are facing  within themselves (unemployment, racism, and the advance of the  extreme right); the economic situation in many areas of the  "southern" part of the world; and the serious crises that the  former Socialist countries and many areas of Africa are  experiencing, permit us to talk about a new international  (dis)order that is under way. The world is experiencing a  period of transition and it is not known how it will end. It  will be very important to take this into account when a new  foreign policy is formulated for Brazil.    Our country must seek the implementation of a new economic  order that will eliminate the trade and financial blackmail that  the developed countries impose on a large part of the world, and  this must be done directly or through international  organizations. We need to democratize international relations  by reforming the United Nations, especially its Security  Council, which was created 50 years ago when the world's  problems were of another type and quite different from the  current ones.    Brazil's opening up to the world does not mean that we do  not  have priorities for the next few years. Latin America,  especially South America, is the top priority. To strengthen,  correct, and expand Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is an  important goal that can accelerate an integration process that  will include all of South America through the creation of a free  trade zone in the subcontinent. This process is of fundamental  importance in achieving more balanced relations with the United  States and the EU.    Brazil must seek to establish more open-minded relations  with  such countries as China, India, Russia, and South Africa, and  especially with the latter country, which is now entering a new  era. They are countries that cannot be absorbed, as is the case  with Brazil, by the current blocs; and they also have economic  potential and an international dimension and bearing that are  sufficiently important for the implementation of common actions  in the economic sphere, in specific or more extensive political  interventions, and in scientific-technical cooperation, etc.    Within the next 10 years, Brazil will finally have to  participate in international initiatives or take them itself, in  the fields of human rights, preservation of the environment, and  in the achievement of a more just economic order, especially in  the case of a new confrontation pertaining to social and labor  matters at the international level.    Strengthening national sovereignty and the implementation of  national development projects in our continent are not  incompatible with a policy of continental integration. On the  contrary, the national projects can and must be made possible  through a courageous and decided integration policy that will  make the never-forgotten dream of Simon Bolivar come true on the  eve of the 21st century.</p>

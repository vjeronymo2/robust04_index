			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Charter/Esab It is some comfort that the Swedish institutions holding out against Charter's offer for Esab object to the price rather than the principle. There is no parallel with the Renault/Volvo affair. Assuming that the level of acceptances due to be announced today falls short of its 90 per cent target, Charter must simply decide whether to increase its SKr345 a share offer. While anything over two-thirds ownership would give Charter full control under Swedish law, mopping up any sizeable minority could be less trouble in the long run. Last week's tumble in the Stockholm market should put paid to the more outlandish assessments of Esab's worth. But the company's half-year figures were undeniably impressive. If Esab's revised full-year profits forecast is right, Charter would have to raise its bid by 20 per cent to pay the same exit multiple envisaged when the bid was announced. A deal on these terms would still enhance earnings. Yet it is not clear that Esab is intrinsically more profitable than previously thought. If economic recovery is simply coming sooner than expected, a lower exit multiple should apply. Besides, trade union statements during the bid suggest that Esab could be more difficult to manage than Charter expected. A modest increase in the offer to acknowledge Esab's improved performance and try to satisfy the recalcitrant institutions could therefore be the best way forward. Since Charter's shares are 12 per cent higher than before the bid was announced, the cost to its own shareholders of walking away would be high.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Shake-up of electricity pool backed The biggest companies in England and Wales are hoping for a cut in electricity prices after senior power-industry executives agreed to back a campaign to allow electricity to be bought and sold outside the wholesale trading pool. Companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries have long complained that by being forced to trade through the pool, rather than conclude simpler bilateral agreements with electricity generators, they have paid higher prices for power than are justified. The power industry, including the generators, has been sceptical of moves to allow pool bypass arrangements, arguing that it might lead to companies trading outside the pool to avoid paying a share of costs needed to run the electricity system. However, pressure for a change of stance has grown in recent months after Offer, the industry's regulator, asked the industry to give the matter urgent consideration. It is partly in response to this that the majority of a pool strategy group, made up of senior executives representing all parts of the industry, is recommending that arrangements be developed for non-pool trading. Representatives of the large generating companies, which previously were among the most sceptical about change, now support themove. However, about a third of the strategy group, mainly representatives of regional electricity companies, oppose it. They argue that hedging instruments, known as contracts for differences, already in effect allow for non-pool trading. Opponents fear that setting up bypass arrangements might be expensive but would produce little benefit for either the industry or its customers. It might also make the system less transparent. Mr Ken Green, utilities buyer at ICI, yesterday welcomed the view of the group majority. Yet he warned that any bypass arrangements would have to include incentives to encourage generators to make non-pool deals. 'If they do, then there is a real chance that prices can drop for large users,' he said. The pool strategy group in its report commissioned by the pool executive on reform has also rejected wholesale changes to the way in which prices are determined. Offer last year asked the pool to consider a system through which generators would be paid the price they offered for each generating unit, rather than the 'marginal price', which is determined by the most expensive generated unit needed to run the system. Some large users considered this to be a fairer, more logical system. But several have changed their minds after considering the issue; one fear is that it would lead to even more complication in a highly complex trading system. It is understood Offer has received a hostile response to the bidding changes and is unlikely to push for reform. In another recommendation, the pool strategy group has said permanent arrangements should be set up to transfer responsibility for some of the 'uplift', or administration costs, of running the pool to the National Grid company. The committee suggests a more refined system than the temporary one put in place earlier this year. Under this, various cost elements would be separated and National Grid would only be given control of those parts where its management could make a difference. The rest would stay with the pool. The pool intends to reach conclusions by September.</p>

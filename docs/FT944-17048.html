			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Austria given rude awakening: The rise of the far-right Freedom party will enliven political life Austria faces a more robust, unpredictable political life following Sunday's national election result than it has known in the post-war period. For the first time since 1945, the Social Democratic party (SPO) and conservative Austrian People's party (OVP) together won less than 80 per cent of the vote. With slightly less than two-thirds of the seats in the new parliament, they can and will continue to govern, but no longer in the complacent, self-serving way they have in recent years. There is inevitably a frisson of fear in the fact that the biggest winner from the ruling parties' losses is the extreme right-wing leader, Mr Jorg Haider, whose Freedom party now has almost as much support as the OVP. But Austrian commentators of many persuasions yesterday agreed that the result was good for democracy. Many suspected also that it reflected not just a transitory disenchantment among voters with the traditional parties, but rather an irreversible generational change in voter behaviour. Older Austrians, who learned their politics during the post-war occupation period, have felt obliged to stick to the traditional parties through thick and thin. In the early days, when virtually every economic activity was state controlled, it was only through the parties that people got jobs and vital services, and they have understandably remained loyal. But a younger generation of voters that grew up during the prosperous 1960s and 1970s does not understand, let alone feel, this 'laager' mentality. The side by side existence of socialist and conservative health clubs and motor clubs and of compulsory employee and employer representative institutions is alien to them. The careful balancing of socialist and conservative sympathisers in the boards of nationalised industries and banks seems bizarre, not to say inefficient. 'We have finally succeeded in putting post-war Austria behind us,' Mr Haider exulted on Sunday night, and no one argued with him. Mr Haider, a lawyer and a former provincial governor of Carinthia, was the first politician to see and exploit the opportunity presented by this change. Since taking control of the Freedom party in the mid-1980s, he has hammered relentlessly at every instance of outrageous patronage perpetrated by the socialists and conservatives and exposed cases of politicised bureaucrats receiving excessive salaries. A rebel by nature, he has also in an opportunist way championed every popular grievance, especially the swelling of immigration since the collapse of the Soviet empire. Mr Haider's popularity has risen fairly steadily, but opponents assumed that it would reach a limit at around 20 per cent. At times, it has looked as if they were right, especially when he suffered embarrassments. He has never quite lived down his outburst in a heated debate in the Carinthian legislature in June 1991 when he was goaded into praising the employment policies of Hitler's third reich. He failed to win much support for a petition drive in January 1992 to outlaw immigration and, after many changes of view on joining the European Union, he campaigned fruitlessly in last June's referendum campaign against it. But he has always bounced back. His appeal comes from his willingness to say what many people think, with a boyish charm and convincing eloquence. Even moderate Austrians believe that his demands for reforming patronage-ridden corporatist institutions, for expelling immigrants caught committing serious crimes, and for limiting the number of non-German-speaking children in primary school classrooms are sensible. Whether he can continue to build his power base with his raucous approach is questionable. It is hard to imagine how he can reach his long-stated goal of heading the government after the next election if he remains a purely opportunistic rebel. Still, his strong position, plus the advance of two other opposition parties, the left leaning Greens and Liberal Forum, ensures that Austrian politics will be lively. It will be more difficult for the coalition partners to agree on policies between themselves and to impose their will in parliament. Unpopular public spending cuts, urgently needed to offset the costs of entering the European Union next year, will be difficult to achieve. The OVP, hitherto a nearly powerless junior partner in the coalition, can now threaten to join forces with Mr Haider. The coalition parties will face rising calls for the demolition or radical reform of many of their self-serving structures, but in doing so, they would risk offending their supporters. Some observers are predicting that the coalition will not last its full four-year term, but it is difficult to see how prospects for the SPO or the OVP will look any better in one or two years' time than in four.

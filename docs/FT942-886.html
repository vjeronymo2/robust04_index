			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Economics Notebook: Shortage of capital? In economics, as in other walks of life, new ideas are rare. So it is not surprising that faced with the conundrum of sharply rising bond yields in the world's capital markets, some analysts and commentators have revived the notion of a global capital shortage. The last time the idea did the rounds was after the Gulf War of 1991, when extravagant estimates of the costs of rebuilding Kuwait were thrown together with back-of-the-envelope calculations of the bill for modernising the former communist countries of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Talk of a global capital shortage was quickly forgotten as the recession of the early 1990s stifled investment and the problems of turning former communist countries into market-based economies became apparent. Last year's speculative bond market boom also seemed to indicate that funds for investment were not in short supply. But as economists and analysts seek to explain the upwards spike in long-term interest rates over the past six months, some are re-examining the idea that capital might be scarce. One such economist is Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming Securities. He believes the world experienced a bond market bubble in 1992-93 that obscured a secular fall in private and public sector savings in the industrialised countries. 'It is not that we have a capital shortage that has happened suddenly', he says. There is plenty of evidence suggesting strong demand for capital. Only last week, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the total net resource flow from industrialised to developing and former communist countries was a record Dollars 159.5bn last year, up from Dollars 153.2bn in 1992 and higher than the 1991 level of Dollars 124bn. Global claims on capital seem set to grow further. In the industrialised world, economic recovery is spreading from the Anglo-Saxon countries to Germany, the rest of the European continent and Japan. Industrial country governments are still running large budget deficits. In its recent World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund complained: 'Most if not all industrial countries failed to consolidate their fiscal positions adequately in the 1980s and entered the 1990s with high actual and structural budget deficits, high public debt to GDP ratios and considerable unfunded pension liabilities.' The IMF has forecast that the industrial countries' budget deficits will fall to 3.5 per cent of their gross domestic product next year against 4.2 per cent. Although an improvement, this would still leave the overall budget shortfall well above the 3 per cent of GDP deemed prudent for European Union countries by the authors of the Maastricht Treaty and substantially higher than the recent low of 1.3 per cent of GDP in 1989. The dynamic newly-industrialising economies of Asia continue to grow robustly while other developing nations, including China, India, Vietnam, Argentina and Chile, are expanding rapidly. When populous giants such as China, India and Indonesia stir, the effects in terms of demand on financial resources can be great indeed. In his recent Hayek memorial lecture to the Institute of Economic Affairs in London, Mr Peter Sutherland, the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) pointed out that the world's population is set to increase by nearly 2bn in the next 20 years. Of these, 95 per cent would be born in countries other than the industrialised member states of the OECD. 'One consequence is that between now and the year 2015, the number of new jobs required to keep unemployment rates unchanged in the developing world will exceed the current populations of western Europe and North America combined', Mr Sutherland said. 'The economic implications are manifold, including competition for capital.' This increase in activity comes as savings rates are falling around the globe. By contrast, savings in the developing world, and in Asia in particular, have been strong. According to the BIS in Basle, the developing nations share of the world's Dollars 5,000bn pool of savings was 20 per cent in 1992, up from 12.5 per cent in the early 1970s, and higher than the US share. But savings as a percentage of GDP have started to decline in the developing as well as the industrial countries. But how will our lives be affected if there really is a world capital shortage? One distinct possibility is that the low bond yields at the end of 1993 and the start of 1994 will turn out to have been no more than a passing phenomenon. Even though some of the near 3 percentage point increase in 10 year UK gilt yields from low to recent high and the roughly 2 percentage point jump in comparable US rates may unwind, capital scarcity would be certain to leave real interest rates higher than 6 months ago. With globalisation, that means the required real rates of return on investment would increase throughout the world. Given their higher costs, the industrialised countries would find it even more difficult than today to compete with the fast-growing developing nations of Asia in labour intensive production of low-tech tradable goods. In the industrialised world, the need for higher skills and more high value-added occupations would grow ever more intense.</p>

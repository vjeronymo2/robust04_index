			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Heseltine gives pledge on environmental targets MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday told a Commons committee that the UK would meet international environmental targets, but declined to explain how they would be met because of the imminent publication of the white paper on the coal industry. Mr Heseltine added that he could not promise the environment committee that emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants would not increase because of the review, which is examining whether any of the 31 coal mines listed for closure in October can be saved. The UK is committed as part of EC policy and treaties signed at last July's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000, and to curbing discharges of sulphur dioxide and of nitrogen oxides.

In answer to an accusation by Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich, that if the government reprieved some pits it would be 'virtually impossible' for it to keep to the targets, Mr Heseltine said that the white paper would address the issues and that they were also the responsibility of the environment and transport departments. He said the government targets were to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 15 per cent of 1980 levels by 1993 and by 30 per cent by 1998. But he said the government was not convinced that the technology to reduce these discharges now mandatory in Continental countries was the best available. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, added that the UK had spent Pounds 500m in the past five years on clean-coal technology. Asked why his statement in October on the British Coal cuts did not mention environmental issues, Mr Heseltine replied: 'One was concerned . . . with the coal industry and the local communities.'</p>

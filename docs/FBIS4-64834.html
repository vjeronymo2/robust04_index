			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bosnian Serbs have decided to extend by one  month the preventive detention of 11 French people from the aid  organization Premiere Urgence, French Ambassador to Bosnia Henri  Jacolin has just said. According to the diplomat, three Serb  judges took the decision in order to prolong the investigation  which is not yet over. The date of the trial has not yet been  set, Henri Jacolin added.    Alain Juppe was the guest on Radio France Culture this  morning. He came out in favor of a withdrawal of French UN  troops within a reasonable time limit, should there be no real  progress toward peace. Alain Juppe:    [Begin Juppe recording] Today we have to make peace.  France's aim is to act in such a way as to arrive at a peace  settlement, a settlement that has to be based on a compromise.  We have defined this compromise in a plan known as the European  Union plan of action, which amounts to saying that we have to  keep Bosnia as a state, that, within this Bosnia, each of the  three communities must be able to administer itself as freely as  possible, setting up a confederal or federal system of  institutions, and designating territories.    The sides have given their agreement to this outline, and  that is what we are trying to do. We are not managing it at the  moment, and I am very worried about the deterioration of the  situation on the ground, and the way the diplomatic process is  getting bogged down.    We have to know that if we don't get there within a  reasonable time, if this peace process cannot really get off the  ground, if the great powers are not really ready to say to the  belligerents -- Now you have to stop the war, and here are the  conditions we propose in order to stop it -- I think France will  change its attitude. It won't be able to keep UN troops on the  ground indefinitely under the current circumstances, if there  are no prospects for peace. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Congress nearer to ratifying Uruguay Round The US Congress moved closer to passing legislation implementing the Uruguay Round yesterday when the Clinton administration and congressional negotiators agreed on most of the outstanding issues. The administration has pushed hard for passage of the legislation making US trade laws and regulations compatible with the 120-nation Marrakesh accord signed last March. The EU, Japan and other main trading nations have yet to ratify the agreement but the administration has argued that the US must pass the legislation this year to maintain its leadership on trade. Under the fast-track procedure agreed by Congress, the legislation now goes to the White House, which will tackle the few issues before sending it back to Congress, presumably next week, for a Yes or No vote by the end of the term. The legislation has been written jointly by US trade officials and by members of the Senate finance and House ways and means committee. To win passage, the administration has been forced to agree to provisions not envisaged by US trading partners, such as anti-dumping procedures which would make the imposition of high dumping duties more likely. Business lobbyists believe they have garnered enough votes for passage, but the vote it will be close in the Senate where 60 of 100 senators must approve the bill. Lobbyists have been alarmed by the 'capricious' antics of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, who last Sunday warned that the deal would not pass if US troops invaded Haiti. Senator Bob Packwood, a leading Republican on trade matters, said at least 30 of the 100 senators would vote against the round and others might fall on the No side because passage would require a waiver of budget rules. Others might vote against it unless the administration adds a restrictive rule of origin provision to satisfy textile and apparel manufacturers.</p>

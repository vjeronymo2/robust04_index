			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ONE-HOUR PROJECT: MAKING A NO-FUSS FIX FOR A DRIP-FREE FAUCET;  </P> <P> THE SINGLE-HANDLE ROLLING BALL TYPE IS A SNAP FOR HOMEOWNERS TO REPAIR.  </P> <P> Homeowners who have repaired leaking stem-type faucets -- the kind that have  washers -- will find the single-handle rolling ball faucet easier to repair.  </P> <P> Don't be intimidated by the sleek look of your Delta or other brand faucet:  Once you've taken it apart, it's simply a matter of replacing the worn parts  with new ones from a kit. There are no seats to resurface or replace, as in a  stem-type setup.  </P> <P> It's important to keep the old parts in a plastic bag or other container. The  kits have parts for various models, so there will be extra pieces in each kit.  Just use the ones you need, referring to the old parts in that separate  container.  </P> <P> Faucet repair kits are available in hardware stores and home centers. It's  probably best to take along the old parts, unless you know for certain what  model faucet you have.  </P> <P> Follow these steps for a painless, leak-less repair job:  </P> <P>  -- Shut off the water supply lines, both hot and cold. You'll find the  shut-off valves under the sink.  </P> <P>  -- With the proper size Allen (hex key) wrench, loosen the setscrew that holds  the lever handle in place. Remove the handle by lifting it straight up. You'll  always have an Allen wrench handy if you buy a convenient tool that has several  sizes of wrenches hinged to fold like a pocket knife.  </P> <P>  -- Unscrew the knurled cap and remove it. This cap shouldn't be too tight and  should never be reassembled with a wrench: Finger pressure is enough. If it is  necessary to use pliers to remove the cap, wrap the jaws of the tool with  electrical tape to prevent marring the cap.  </P> <P>  -- Pull up on the ball stem to remove the cam (a circular plastic ring with a  rounded triangular hole in the center), the cam seal and the ball assembly.  </P> <P>  -- Lift the rubber inlet seals and springs out of the faucet.  </P> <P>  -- If there are water leaks around the rotating spout, lift off the spout by  jiggling it back and forth, at the same time lifting it. The leaks are caused  by worn or broken O-rings, which are supplied in the repair kit. If the spout  isn't leaking, you might want to leave it alone.  </P> <P>  -- Begin the repair, once you have the proper kit, by replacing the O-rings,  if necessary, on the spout assembly and replacing the spout.  </P> <P>  -- Next, insert the springs, according to the directions supplied with the  repair kit. Usually the large end goes into the hole if the springs are  tapered.  </P> <P>  -- Install the rubber inlet seals over the springs. There's only one way to  put them on.  </P> <P>  -- Reinstall the ball assembly, or a new one if you decided to buy a separate  ball kit. It probably is a good idea to replace the ball when you replace the  springs and seals. Make sure the rectangular groove in the ball mates with the  alignment pin on the faucet body. Check to see that the ball moves freely in  all directions.  </P> <P>  -- Replace the old cam assembly in place, making sure to install it so that a  projection or lug in the cam mates with a notch in the faucet body.  </P> <P>  -- Screw down the knurled retaining cap and tighten the adjusting ring with  the tool supplied in the repair kit. The tool has two prongs that mate with  notches in the adjusting ring. Don't tighten the ring too much; the ball should  move freely.  </P> <P>  -- Insert the lever handle over the ball assembly shaft and tighten the  setscrew with the Allen wrench.  </P> <P>  -- Turn on both water lines and test for leaks. The repair should give you a  drip-free faucet for two or more years.  </P></p>

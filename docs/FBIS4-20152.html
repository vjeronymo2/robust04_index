			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F> Daniel Vigneron; place and date not given: "Alphandery:  `Europe Must Not Fear Asia'"]    [Text] [Vigneron] French economic influence is waning in  Africa and the Maghreb, limited in Asia, and marginal in  America. Is this decline unavoidable, or does the current  government have the will to react? Do we have the capacity to  change this situation?    [Alphandery] I do not agree with this view of a decline. I  think it is quite the opposite. Look at Africa: France helped  mobilize the Bretton Woods institutions when the countries of  the CFA [African Financial Community] area broke down  completely, and it allocated considerable resources to cancel  the debt of 25-billion francs [Fr]. We are making a major  effort in Asia, as you will see at the next annual meeting of  the Asian Development Bank, of which France holds the  presidency. For example, we played a decisive role in bringing  Vietnam back onto the international stage. In addition, France  has maintained the high level of aid it provides to developing  countries. On the American continent, French companies are  making inroads through direct investments, and we are set to  double our share in the capital of the Interamerican Development  Bank. We have major investments in East Europe and Russia, a  point which I will return to. Thus, our foreign policy under  [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur and [Foreign Minister] Alain  Juppe, and especially our foreign economic policy, is very  active, much more so than in recent years. The situation is not  like before World War I, but our country still holds some sway  and we certainly have not collapsed, since we are the world's  fourth largest exporter.    [Vigneron] How do you see Europe's economic future compared  with that of our major American and Asian competitors? Is there  a way for European industry to increase its competitiveness  other than through relocation?    [Alphandery] We must be careful not to base our view of  Europe's future on the depressed situation from which we are  just emerging. Structurally speaking, our continent has major  advantages. For decades now, Europe has accumulated a  formidable stock of physical and financial capital. Moreover,  it has unrivaled human resources. Who, apart from the  Americans, can pride themselves on such a dense network of  high-performance universities, educational establishments, and  research bodies? Of course, Europe has its problems, but we are  trying to resolve them. This is presently the case with our  attempts to find a more flexible labor structure, which lies at  the heart of European thinking, irrespective of the different  ideas some countries may have. It is also true that our  secondary education is perhaps not as suited as it should be to  the requirements of the modern world. Another problem is the  ponderousness of our administrative structures. However, I  believe our structural strengths outweigh our weaknesses. Europe  must not fear the dynamism of Asia, quite the contrary. All the  better if Asia is developing, as there are major markets there  for our industry.    [Vigneron] In these conditions, why do you defend the idea  of  a social clause, which will not solve the situation of extreme  social poverty in the Third World and whose possible  effectiveness looks very limited? Is this not rather a  hypocritical way of protecting ourselves from competition from  poor nations?    [Alphandery] We got our message across very clearly at the  G-7 summit on employment in Detroit. The way in which I argued  for the clause proved that there is no underlying protectionism,  so much so that the Americans adopted it. It is in no way an  attempt to prevent developing countries from benefiting from a  comparative advantage, that is certainly not the aim. What we  are saying is that there are situations that are morally  unacceptable -- I am thinking of child labor or forced labor --  and which concern human rights. We wanted to obtain the  possibility of discussing this issue of social standards as soon  as possible in the framework of the future World Trade  Organization (WTO). The Marrakesh plan clearly lays the ground  for this.    [Vigneron] Do you think, like the Americans, that the OECD  should play a more active role in managing major international  problems?    [Alphandery] First, I would like to say that the OECD has  done its job well. The G-7 summit has moreover assigned it  important studies, such as that on the labor situation, which  was very much appreciated, and, more recently, a study on  obstacles to growth. The OECD is therefore performing its role  well. In addition, it receives little criticism. The  organization is well-managed and I can see no reason to change a  winning team. That is why I would like Jean-Claude Paye to  continue in his job. In any event, he has the support of France  and many other countries.    [Vigneron] How far along are we with the studies on  employment that are to be presented at the next G-7 summit in  Naples?    [Alphandery] The Detroit summit on employment was something  of a first, since traditionally the G-7 meetings have been  devoted to financial and monetary issues. This initiative by  the United States concluded with a very interesting result. Of  course, there is no single answer to the unemployment problem,  but there were points of agreement. For example, everyone  agreed that unemployment is as much a structural as an economic  problem, and that small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] are  a valuable source of jobs. Similarly, everyone agreed on the  need for flexibility in the labor market. The policy of vainly  forging ahead by increasing budget deficits was unanimously  rejected. In short, the discussion was considered sufficiently  in-depth to justify a follow-up at the Naples summit.    [Vigneron] Is there a good level of coordination within the  G-7?    [Alphandery] Yes, rather good. The G-7 managed to put out  some important messages. The proof of this is that Japan  announced a number of recovery plans, and Europe continued to  cut interest rates. This proves that the voice of the G-7 was  listened to and that this forum of coordination is far from  being useless. I stress the word "forum," because the G-7 is  not an institution and France refuses any moves toward making it  one.    [Vigneron] Let us move on to consider Europe. Has Franco  German rapprochement made any progress and, after the latest  German interest rate cuts, do you feel completely in step with  Bundesbank monetary policy?    [Alphandery] The important thing, and I would like to  emphasize this, is that Europe is continuing to cut short rates  despite the rise in Americans interest rates. Yesterday, the  [Bank of France's] Monetary Policy Committee cut its key rates.  The two cuts in German interest rates in the space of a single  week are also welcome. Naturally, this creates a favorable  climate across Europe. Why? Because the basic economic  conditions are favorable for monetary relaxation. We are  therefore on the right tracks, despite the recent rise in U.S.  long-term interest rates. Looking beyond that, the central  problem is medium-term cooperation, and especially French-German  cooperation. The fact that we decided last summer to present  all our convergence programs and develop them on the basis of  similar inflation and budget deficit hypotheses was a major  factor for the stability of Europe and the European Monetary  System in particular. If ever a signal was clearly perceived by  the international community, this was it. It is based on the  extremely simple idea that economic convergence is a  precondition for monetary convergence.    [Vigneron] What are the concrete signs of this convergence?    [Alphandery] First and foremost, both the French and German  economies are recovering at quite similar rates: German growth  should be around 1 to 1.5 percent this year, while we are  forecasting 1.4 percent for France. We have similar aims in  terms of budget deficit. There is also another point that is  very positive, particularly for the smooth introduction of the  second phase of Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]: Germany and  France will consecutively assume the presidency of the European  Union [EU]. Moreover, within the scope of the Franco-German  Economic and Financial Council, I intend to propose to my German  counterpart, Theo Waigel, a continuous and joint program to  ensure that the action taken by the German presidency will be  continued by the French presidency. This is a very beneficial  coincidence for European construction.    [Vigneron] With the entry, next year, of four new members  and  the prospect of further EU enlargement to include East European  countries by the year 2000, how do you see Europe's  institutional and monetary future? Is the nature of the EU not  going to change, and is a multispeed Europe not unavoidable?    [Alphandery] I am convinced that enlargement through four  new  members will enrich the EU. These are high-income countries and  they will be net creditors. The enrichment will be both literal  and figurative! Of course, this enlargement must go  hand-in-hand with a deepening of the EU. I will see to this  personally since, in the first quarter of 1995, I will be the  first president of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers  for the new, 16-strong Europe. As for what you call the  two-speed Europe, it would be impossible to have different  speeds because Europe is based on the principle of equality  between states. However, for technical reasons, the Maastricht  Treaty itself provides for a variable calendar for Europe.  Depending on the degree to which the convergence criteria are  met, some countries will be ready for EMU before others. It is  wise to ask everyone to meet the convergence criteria and to let  everyone do so at their own rate.    [Vigneron] Do you not think that the five or six states  that will be capable of forming a monetary union will adopt  economic measures that will further distance them from the other  states?    [Alphandery] I do not think so. It would, on the contrary,  be a major factor of attraction. When the other countries see  that the states that have already achieved monetary union are  greatly benefiting from this, they will make even more of an  effort to speed up their integration. They will be stimulated  by this.    [Vigneron] Compared with the measures taken since 1989 by  previous governments, does France now have a new policy with  regard to the East European countries in transition? In a way,  do you not have the feeling that France has missed out on an  historic, political, and above all economic opportunity to renew  ties, given its past influence in this region of the world?    [Alphandery] I will say, first, that foreign policy does not  fluctuate according to the whim of governments. Diplomacy is  often marked by continuity. However, there have been a number of  notable shifts in our policy with regard to Central and East  Europe. In particular, there is our will to implement concrete  projects that are more immediately noticeable to the people and  more directly profitable to the emergence of an economic fabric  of private SMEs that will create future employment in these  countries. On this last point, I do not agree with your  analysis: Many of the officials with whom I have contacts in  these countries have expressed their satisfaction at what we are  doing.    For example, at the beginning of last week, in St.  Petersburg, I met with the Russian prime minister and the town's  mayor and I saw for myself how much they appreciate France's  involvement, both on its own initiative and in association with  the international community, as part of the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] and the G-7, to ensure  development in Russia and other countries. France has mobilized  considerable resources and is one of the largest contributors to  development in East Europe. The figures prove it: From 1990 to  1993 inclusive, France contributed Fr63.6 billion to help  finance East European countries, in the form of direct,  bilateral, or EU aid (Fr16.6 billion); export credits (Fr11  billion); and debt restructuring (Fr36 billion for the French  share). This considerable effort has made France the fourth  largest contributor of aid to Russia (behind Germany, the United  States, and Japan) and the second for aid to Central and East  Europe (behind Germany but ahead of the United States and  Japan). We are also the fourth largest investor in the whole  area (behind Germany, the United States, and Italy, but ahead of  Japan). As you can see, we are firmly established among the  leaders. We are also very well represented by French companies.  Look at St. Petersburg: Credit Lyonnais has offices there, and  the Banque Nationale de Paris.    [Vigneron] France is the second largest foreign investor in  St. Petersburg, behind Spain.    [Alphandery] I suggested to Mr. Sobchak (Anatoliy Sobtchak,  the mayor of St. Petersburg) that the St. Petersburg region  should benefit as a priority from the EBRD venture capital fund  that we have backed to the tune of Fr120 million. France is  present, and this presence is appreciated. My Hungarian  counterpart told me that recently, as did the Romanian president  during his recent visit to Paris. Do not forget that France  also has obligations toward other areas of the world, like  Africa.    [Vigneron] You recently attended the meeting of the CFA area  ministers. Do you expect a favorable context to develop that  would give an economic impetus to Africa?    [Alphandery] Let us remain prudent. The devaluation of the  CFA franc was a very delicate operation. For the time being,  everything is going well: Inflation remains under control, most  of the countries have signed an agreement with the IMF, and  there has been no social explosion. However, the battle has not  yet been won. We must remain vigilant. In particular, we must  maintain wage levels, broaden the tax base, and generally ensure  that there are no divergent policies within the zone. If the  operation succeeds, it will create the conditions for renewed  competitiveness and, as a result, the well-being of the African  people--whose purchasing power has been severely dented by the  national deficits and financial asphyxiation--has been improved.  The countries of the CFA area must now return to growth so that  they can find the room for maneuver enabling them to implement  the structural reforms that are so vital for development.    [Vigneron] Over the last 30 years, France has been closely  involved in the economic policy of the countries of black  Africa. Is not their failure to adjust--which resulted in the  devaluation--first and foremost France's failure?    [Alphandery] No, not at all. The real problem was the  deterioration in the terms of trade during the second half of  the eighties. The sudden drop in market prices for certain  types of raw material almost ruined a number of African  countries. It is true that this situation could have been  resolved by devaluing the CFA franc at an earlier stage.  However, the African countries hesitated for a long time before  they made this difficult decision.    [Vigneron] France at last appears to have taken an interest  in the Asian markets. Do you think that the COFACE [French  Insurance Company for External Trade] guarantees will make it  possible for us to increase our economic presence, which is  currently judged insufficient in this area of strong growth?    [Alphandery] Asia is a very diverse area with many  opportunities for our companies, but it is also an area of high  risk and intense competition. I therefore think that it is a  good sign that 40 percent of COFACE's 1993 pledges and 25  percent of its actual guarantees cover Asia. Our presence in  Asia can never be high enough, but the results are there: For  example, our exports to Asia are growing rapidly and were up 15  percent in 1993. That means that jobs are being created or  saved in France.    [Vigneron] But what about relocations?    [Alphandery] Relocation works both ways. You also have  capital from all over the world investing in France. I cannot  repeat enough that, in 1992, France was on a par with Britain  and outperformed any other country in attracting direct foreign  investments. That just shows how attractive France is and  proves that we are an open country.    [Vigneron] Are you developing a specific policy with regard  to the four Asian tigers [Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and  Taiwan]?    [Alphandery] You know, our trade deficit with those four  countries as a whole is positive. The only one with which we  have a trade deficit is Taiwan. The success we had in Korea  with the high-speed train proves how well we are performing. In  these countries, our aim is also to increase sales of financial  services. Our financial system is very competitive and is one  of our main strengths. We make the best use of our strengths.  During the GATT negotiations, along with my U.S. counterpart  Lloyd Bentsen, I laid much emphasis on the liberalization of the  financial markets, especially in Asia. We will continue to push  this point because negotiations are to resume in this area.    [Vigneron] You are president of the Board of Governors of  the  Asian Development Bank [ADB]. France will host the bank's  annual meeting in Nice in early May. What are your expectations?    [Alphandery] We expect 2,500 delegates, 1,000 of whom are  bankers. The ADB is a development bank that is working very  well, to such an extent that it is to double its capital from  $24 billion to $48 billion. In Nice, the extraordinary economic  development in this region of the world will be confirmed.  However, it will also be a forum for making new contacts. In  this respect, I believe that the fact we are welcoming a large  number of Asian business leaders to France will be an  unprecedented opportunity for French companies to lay the ground  for future relations.</p>

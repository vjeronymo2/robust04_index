This rule implements section 302(e)(2) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT). This rule is necessary to ensure full public awareness of the October 1, 1993 deadline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This interim rule is effective January 5, 1994.

A priority date cannot be established unless the Service approves a petition under section 203(b) of the Act based on a labor certification approved by the Department of Labor. Subsequent to the promulgation of this regulation, the President signed into law the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, (MTINA) Public Law 102&hyph;232, dated December 12, 1991. Section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 102&hyph;649, dated November 29, 1990, was enacted in order to address the transition of labor certifications filed before October 1, 1991 into the new employment-based immigrant visa categories created by IMMACT. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA provides that, in order to maintain the priority date of a labor certification filed in connection with an employment-based petition which was submitted to a state employment office before October 1, 1991, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA further provides that if the Department of Labor approves a pre-October 1, 1991 labor certification application subsequent to October 1, 1993, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act within 60 days of the date of certification. Although not specifically provided for in section 302(e)(2) of MTINA, the Service has interpreted that section to require that, in the case of labor certifications which have been certified by the Department of Labor between August 2, 1993 and October 1, 1993, a petition under section 203(b) must be filed within 60 days after the date of certification to preserve the earlier priority date. This reading of section 302(e)(2) of MTINA furthers congressional intent by allowing at least 60 days from the date of certification to file the petition under section 203(b) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of the above, 8 CFR 204.5(d) will be amended to reflect these MTINA amendments. The regulation will be further amended to provide that if the petitioner fails to maintain the priority date by filing a timely petition, the new priority date shall be the date a new petition is properly filed with the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 5.5m awards for Ashby ASHBY &amp; HORNER JOINERY has received orders totalling Pounds 5.5m. The two largest contracts are very different. One is for the joinery work required in the restoration of the 17th century Uppark House, a National Trust property near Petersfield, West Sussex. The other major contract, a little more unusual, although not unique for this P&amp;O company, is the fitting out of the 1929 luxury motor yacht Jezebel: Work on the 248 ft yacht is being carried out for DML(Devonport Management Ltd) to the designs of yacht designer Jon Bannenberg. All the main items will be made at Ashby &amp; Horner Joinery's works at Thurrock and then installed in the yacht at the Devonport Royal Dockyard in Plymouth over the next 18 months. The work includes all the interiors to the owner's and guests' main accommodation. This includes the saloon, dining room, library and staterooms with bathrooms. The lift interiors and the common areas in the owner and guest accommodation are also part of the contract. Ceilings will have veneered perimeters and lacquereed cof fered centres. Covered fabric panels with special features will adorn the walls. High quality carpets, timber parquet and marble will be used for the flooring, either separately or in a combination of all three. Jezabel is currently in dry dock and has been stripped down to the bare hull for survey and any repairs needed before the reconstruction starts. Although she will be fully equipped with modern systems, the vessel's original style and character will be carefully recreated.</p>

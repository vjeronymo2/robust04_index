			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.P."-signed interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur, </F> chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum; place and date not  given: "The Party Is Not in Danger of Falling Apart"]    [Text] The left wing thinks in terms of internationalism  and ignores national values. Therefore, in the event there is a  left-wing turn, the cause of the survival of Hungarians could be  endangered, Lajos Fur, elected new chairman of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] on 19 February, told MAGYAR HIRLAP. He  said that he represents the MDF as chairman while he continues  to tour the country. He added that, in the event of an  unexpected election defeat, it will not be him who will have to  draw the conclusions regarding himself. However, the MDF is not  expecting this, Fur confirmed.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It was almost a year ago when, with dramatic  words, you resigned from your position as the MDF's  administrative chairman and from party politics. What made your  relatively quick and spectacular return possible?    [Fur] In October 1993, I began to visit the MDF's local  organizations throughout the country because I had realized that  there was no time to waste. I realized we would have to fight a  very hard battle at the next elections if we wanted to achieve  good results. In the meantime, the emotions that had been upset  in the MDF settled down. We need to be very active because the  stakes are very high.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As the offices of party chairman and  managing director are going to coexist, who is it who actually  leads the MDF?    [Fur] Sandor Lezsak and I do it together. We do not have  very different personalities. Lezsak will run the party's  affairs, he is the organizing and operational person, and I will  represent the party. I will carry on doing what I have already  been doing, namely touring the country and talking.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is the MDF threatened by the same factor  that is typical of collective parties? The various tendencies  are also represented by other parties that attract the  supporters of these ideas with clearer appearance: This can  lead to segmentation.    [Fur] At the moment in Hungary, all parties are threatened  by this, as far as I can judge the parliamentary political  forces. However, after the past, very painful and damaging  conflicts, now, in these months, the MDF is not threatened by  segmentation.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In a recent interview you mentioned that, in  the second round of the 1990 elections, the MDF's success was  partly due to the votes gained from the Hungarian Socialist  Party's [MSZP] supporters. Do you see any chance that, during  the campaign, you will regain the support of some of the  socialist sympathizers whose number has significantly increased?    [Fur] In the current situation, I doubt that the MDF will be  able to do this. In my view, there is no chance of this just  now. This base was not actually so big in 1990. Instead, the  large mass of people who have not decided whether to vote at all  are worth more attention. The MDF will have to win over this  group of people.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Much was said about the left wing at your  National Meeting. During the MDF's campaign, what arguments  will you use to convince the public about the reality of the  left-wing danger?    [Fur] Three major issues have to be decided and the left-  wing's victory would threaten these: The continuation of "clean  democracy" might be halted and diverted sideways. It is also  possible to create dictatorship from democracy, and not only  through a coup. The bourgeois type social order and economic  structure could be seriously endangered. I would like to remind  people that MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn and Socialist International  Chairman Pierre Mauroy clearly said so in their joint statement:  They want democratic socialism. I do not at all care what this  socialism is described as, whether flourishing, democratic, or  existing, it is still the same thing. There are only slight  differences but, as far as the essence is concerned, differences  do not exist in left-wing thinking. However, in this case, the  bourgeois transformation would be diverted. The third and most  critical viewpoint is that the left wing, because it makes the  social issues absolute, thinks in terms of internationalism, and  therefore it disregards national issues, ignores them, and does  not see them as important. Consequently, the issue of the  survival of Hungarians is at stake.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you see any possibility of a coalition or  any kind of cooperation with the Hungarian Justice and Life  Party [MIEP]?    [Fur] At the moment, there is no chance of this at all. In  MAGYAR FORUM, we seem to be the main enemy, the MDF is attacked  week after week by the MIEP. This being the case, how could we  even begin to think about a coalition?    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In the event of an election defeat, what  conclusions would you draw in connection with yourself and your  office as party chairman?    [Fur] Nothing regarding myself, other people will do that  for me. From the MDF's point of view, it would mean that it  would have to prepare for the next elections and would have to  draw conclusions from the work that had negative results.  However, I am almost certain that we will not have to face  problems like this.</p>

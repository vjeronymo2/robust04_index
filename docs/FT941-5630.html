			<p>940305 FT  05 MAR 94 / 'Unique' enterprise scheme launched The first enterprise zone trust for industrial property development is expected to bring enhanced financial benefits to the Scottish economy, according to Scottish Enterprise, the economic development body. It says the scheme - in the Lanarkshire enterprise zone - is unique in the UK. Akeler Developments of Leeds, which is to raise Pounds 20m from private investors through an enterprise zone trust, will pass most of the financial surplus it makes on an 250,000 sq ft industrial development at Blantyre to Scottish Enterprise. That will be used on economic regeneration in Lanarkshire and elsewhere. In return Scottish Enterprise and Akeler will form a partnership which could lead to Akeler's involvement in other industrial developments.</p>

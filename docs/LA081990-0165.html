			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORMAN, NICKLAUS FAIL TO SURVIVE FINAL CUT  </P> <P> There were either two or 24 co-leaders Saturday after the third round of the  International golf tournament at Castle Rock, Colo.  </P> <P> None of them, however, were named Greg Norman or Jack Nicklaus.  </P> <P> Instead, the scoreboard at the Castle Pines Golf Club showed Eduardo Romero of  Argentina and Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain tied for the top spot, each with 26  points.  </P> <P> Under the format for the event, however, they were -- in effect -- tied with 22  others, some of whom were 10 points behind them.  </P> <P> The top 24 point-makers from the first three days' play qualified for today's  final round.  </P> <P> At that point, all scores revert to zero, so the 54-hole lead was meaningless.  </P> <P> Scoring in the event is a modified Stableford system in which points are  awarded for the players' performance on each hole: 5 for eagle, 2 for birdie, 0  for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or higher.  </P> <P> It took a score of 16 points or better for three rounds to make it to the final  round.  </P> <P> Norman, the defending champion, made a pair of double-bogeys -- he picked up on  one of them, but a double-bogey is the highest score possible under this format  -- and finished with a minus-1 score for the day and a total of two points.  Nicklaus gained only two points in a round that required 73 strokes and  finished with a total of five.  </P> <P> Olazabal, 24, one of the brightest young stars on the European tour with a pair  of victories this year, advanced to a share of the lead with a four-iron second  shot that set up a 12-foot eagle putt on the 17th. He had a medal score of 69.  </P> <P> Romero, 35, also plays most of his golf on the European circuit. He had the  lead alone until he missed the green and bogeyed the final hole, finishing with  a medal score of 70.  </P> <P> Betsy King had six birdies on the back nine to shoot a course-record 63 at the  JAL Big Apple Classic at New Rochelle, N.Y.  </P> <P> King, who before the round said "maybe I can bring this course to its knees,"  moved to a three-round total of 11-under 205 at the Wykagyl Country Club and  took a three-shot lead over Beth Daniel.  </P> <P> A two-time U.S. Open champion, King bettered the mark of 65 set by Nancy Lopez  in 1978.  </P> <P> King the LPGA's player of the year in 1989, tied her single-round best,  established two years ago at the Rail Charity Classic in Springfield, Ill.  </P> <P> Tammie Green, atop the leader board for the first two rounds, shot a 75 for  212, and is tied for fourth with Dawn Coe.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel, after two consecutive 70s, had a 68 and moved into second at 208.  Rosie Jones was third with a 71 for 209.  </P> <P> Don Bies shot his second consecutive 66 at Jeremy Ranch Golf Course for a  36-hole total of 12-under-par 132 and a two-stroke lead in the Senior Showdown  Classic at Park City, Utah.  </P> <P> Mike Hill, with a 68, moved into a tie for second with Rives McBee, who had a  70. They are each at 134.  </P> <P> Lee Trevino and George Archer each shot 68 and share fourth place at 135.  </P></p>

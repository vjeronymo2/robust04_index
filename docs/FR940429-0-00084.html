			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations reflect the Secretary's view, based on consideration of past appeals of cohort default rate determinations that, for purposes of a cohort default rate appeal, a loan is considered to have been serviced or collected improperly only if, under applicable rules, the Department would decline to pay reinsurance on the principal of the loan by reason of the improper servicing or collection. The HEA does not define the term ``improper servicing or collection'' used in section 435(m). Therefore, to determine what constitutes improper loan servicing and collection, the Secretary looks to its due diligence regulations, its published policies such as Appendix D to 34 CFR part 682 and other applicable policies and practices. There is no indication that the 1993 amendments to section 435(m) were intended to establish new concepts regarding what does and does not constitute improper loan servicing and collection. For that reason, the Secretary construes section 435(m) by reference to concepts developed over a period of years in the administration of the FFEL Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 435(m) of the HEA also specifies that a loan which has been subject to improper servicing or collection is excluded from calculation of the cohort default rate only if the default on the loan was ``due to'' improper servicing or collection and results in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate. The statute does not explain how improper servicing or collection could cause a cohort default rate to be inaccurate or incomplete. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Atlanta College of Medical and Dental Careers, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Riley,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 987 F.2d 821, 830 (D.C. Cir. 1993), however, the Court of Appeals assumed that a cohort default rate would be inaccurate or incomplete if it contained loans which defaulted due to improper servicing or collection. The Secretary considers that interpretation to be reasonable. The Court of Appeals in <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Atlanta College <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  also concluded that the type of causal link between improper servicing and default on a loan is properly left to the Secretary. The Secretary believes that a stringent showing of default causation is appropriate. Section 435(m) of the HEA does not include any general ``causation'' challenge that would permit an institution to appeal the calculation of its default rates on the basis that its students defaulted for reasons beyond the institution's control. Moreover, Congress set tight constraints on the time periods for challenges to the calculation of the cohort default rates and clearly did not contemplate a time-consuming, heavily burdensome process for determining default causation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these factors, the Secretary has determined that section 435(m) should be interpreted to allow only a limited loan servicing challenge. Accordingly, these regulations reflect the Secretary's determination that, for purposes of the calculation of a cohort default rate, improper servicing or collection is considered to have caused a default only if the improper servicing or collection resulted in a lack of notification to the borrower that he or she must begin repaying the loan. The Secretary believes that once the borrower has been informed of the obligation to repay the loan, the institution cannot show that a resulting default was due to the alleged improper servicing. The position reflected in these regulations has its genesis in certain decisions of the Secretary which resolved appeals of cohort default rate determinations on a case-by-case basis. Case-by-case adjudication is a permissible approach to decision making under applicable law. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NLRB  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bell Aerospace Corp.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974). However, the Secretary's adjudications resolving individual appeals have not established rules of general applicability. As explained in more detail in the comment and response section of this document, the Secretary has considered a variety of proposed standards for adjudication of appeals based on allegations of improper servicing and collection. Some of these approaches would arguably broaden the appeal standard for institutions, while others reflect a more narrow scope than is reflected in the Secretary's adjudications to date. After careful consideration of these alternatives, the Secretary concludes that the general construction of section 435(m) of the HEA reflected in his most recent appeal decisions faithfully implements Congressional intent and fairly balances the rights of all those affected by those decisions. The Secretary particularly invites comments as to whether there are other types of improper servicing that should be considered to have ``caused'' a default for purposes of calculation of a cohort default rate and the rationale for any such suggestion.

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Westland attacks value of hostile bid from GKN Westland, the UK's only helicopter manufacturer, yesterday dismissed a Pounds 496m hostile bid from the engineering group GKN as 'absurdly low'. Westland said the takeover bid, launched last month, undervalued its growth prospects and Pounds 1.4bn order book. Launching the defence document, Mr Alan Jones, chairman, said: 'There is no logic in linking with an engineering conglomerate focusing on automotive and industrial services sectors. The way forward for us is through collaboration with other helicopter manufacturers.' Nevertheless, GKN remains in a strong position, having raised its Westland stake to 45 per cent with the purchase of an 18.7 per cent holding from United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters. GKN, which has pointed to synergies between helicopters and its armoured vehicles division, has offered Westland shareholders 290p cash per share, which compares with yesterday's close of 329 1/2 p. The bid values the whole group at Pounds 496m. Mr Jones claimed GKN's offer document suggested that 44p of the price related to a Pounds 385m payment due to Westland from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation (AOI) for alleged breach of contract. This meant that the GKN offer valued Westland's underlying business at only 246p a share. 'That is equivalent to 21.4 times historic earnings, which undervalues the company. The average price earnings multiple for UK aerospace manufacturers is almost 60 per cent higher at 34,' said Mr Jones. Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said the earnings multiple figures were 'meaningless' and warned there was no guarantee that the AOI would pay. 'There is nothing new in this defence. We expected something about firm orders,' he said. He also questioned Westland's claim that the value of its helicopter deliveries could rise from Pounds 10m this year to Pounds 360m by the year 2000. 'They've admitted some of these potential orders may fall away entirely. There is only one firm order for this year and two for 1995.' Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Treuhand steel initiative: EC approval sought for subsidies in the east THE Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising east German industry, is to seek European Community approval for government subsidies to modernise the giant Ekostahl steelworks at Eisenhuttenstadt, near the Polish border, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. However, Germany's steel producers' association warned that any subsidies for the east's steel sector would risk reopening the debate about subsidising other loss-making mills, particularly in Italy and Spain. Modernising Ekostahl will cost more than DM1.1bn (Dollars 653.2m). The first phase of investments, earmarked for modernising the cold rolling mill, will require subsidies of over DM310m. The second phase, which envisages building a mini-mill, will cost DM750m. Treuhand officials have insisted that government subsidies will not be 'indefinite', adding that it will guarantee about 80 per cent of the first DM310m investment plan, while the remainder of this phase will be financed by public subsidies. They also argue that the mini-mill will consume cheap scrap instead of relying on iron ore and coke, will make a narrow range of competitive products with a much smaller labour force, and will be in a position to attract a foreign partner. Ekostahl's labour force has already been reduced from 11,500 in 1990 to 3,400 by early 1993. 'The EC will have to consider the trade-off between cuts in capacity and aid,' a Treuhand official said. Ekostahl has already sharply reduced its annual capacity from 2.8m tonnes in 1990, to under 1m tonnes by the beginning of this year. The mini-mill would produce an overall annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes. At the same time, the work force would be further reduced to under 1,000. Treuhand and Ekostahl officials, who for political and economic reasons are keen to modernise the plant because the entire region is dependent on it, said west Germany's steel producers are likely to oppose the plan. 'They are challenging not only the high level of subsidies, but they fear more competition from within the steel industry itself.' The rescue package is now being considered by the finance ministry, and is expected to be discussed by EC industry ministers in Brussels on May 4.</p>

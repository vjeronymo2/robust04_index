			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON IRVING BRANCH LIBRARY  </P> <P> Patt Morrison's excellent article on the Los Angeles Central Library (Part A,  April 30) recalls the countless hours I had spent at this fine citadel of  learning since the summer of 1955!  </P> <P> How I cherish the memories of this sedate, academic building where I read and  studied for pleasure and school, with emphasis on The Times on microfilm from  1881 to present day, the stereo music section and the voluminous nonfiction  books. . . . and on occasion I'd even browse through the telephone directories  of the United States and the entire world!  </P> <P> Since grammar school I've always held libraries in high esteem as an  escape/haven from TV and the routine of life, with the Central Library as my  personal favorite. Let's hope that bureaucracy and red tape will not interfere  with its reopening.  </P> <P> EDDIE CRESS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

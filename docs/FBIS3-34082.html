			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Pakistani newspaper THE MUSLIM has referred to  the request made by the United States that various countries  refrain from defense cooperation with the Islamic Republic of  Iran and said: The Clinton administration is preventing the  rebuilding of the Iranian army.    The paper notes the hollow claim made by the United States  that Iran supports terrorism, adding: The United States forced  Iraq to fight against Iran for eight years. Was this not an act  of terrorism? Was this act not motivated by the wish to alter  the balance of forces to the advantage of the regime occupying  Jerusalem? However, now, when Iran is trying to rebuild its  army after eight years of war, the United States has asked  various countries to refrain from defense cooperation with Iran.    THE MUSLIM concludes by saying: The United States'  confrontation with Iran is continuing and this has, in fact,  resulted in Iran being strengthened.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Setback for Latvian coalition Latvia's government coalition partners appear to have been trounced in Sunday's local elections in preliminary results which suggest a mixture of discontent with economic reforms and wariness about attempts to mend relations with Russia. The pro-monetarist Latvian Way and the Latvian Peasants Union coalition government, which wants better protection for farmers from western competition, have together maintained a course of effective but unpopular financial stabilisation policies. The government, which has also been hit by accusations that five cabinet ministers used to work for the Soviet KGB before the republic gained independence, last month concluded an agreement with Russia to withdraw troops from Latvia by August 31. The poll results, which partially benefit more extreme nationalists, may also affect the government's progress in pushing through long-postponed legislation clarifying which non-Latvians (who comprise 48 per cent of the population) qualify for citizenship.</p>

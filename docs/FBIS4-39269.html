			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Olha Len: "The Corner Created by the Power"; </F> from the "Observer" feature]    [Text] The Ukrainian economy looks more and more like a  corpse. Compared with the first quarter of last year,  production dropped 38 percent, and in some industries even 45-59  percent. The production of consumer products shrank 39 percent;  food -- 28.7 percent; nonfood products -- 45.1 percent. The  production of light industry goods and domestic appliances  declined by more than half, resulting in a one-third decrease in  all kinds of transportation.    Against the backdrop of general economic collapse and  chronic  delays in payments of salaries, the 5-percent drop of inflation,  touted by the Zvyahilskyy government as a sign of economic  recovery, looks more like the gradual stiffening of a dead body.  Apparently, the overheated body of the economy was treated to  blood-letting until all the blood drained out. However, ranking  officials insist that since harsh credit policies applied to  state-run enterprises almost stopped the growing prices and  fixed the karbovanets exchange rate, the credits should be kept  back even further.    Ukrainian inflation has one nasty feature -- it is largely  caused by excessive spending by the state, primarily, to keep  afloat state enterprises, most of which have been operating from  one government's credit to another for two years now. Since  they pay salaries and for raw materials with borrowed money, and  not from their profits, they would be paralyzed if left without  regular state support. Step by step, those credits build up to  form a huge state debt. State revenues from taxes, customs  duties, and exports are catastrophically insufficient for  everyone willing to receive cheap credit or subsidy. This is  when the frenetic printing of new money is initiated, which is  nicely called emission. What happens after the emission is  nicely called inflation.    So it does not come as a surprise that after the Ukrainian  Government and National Bank stemmed the outpouring of credits,  inflation actually decreased. But this also stopped state  enterprises and dramatically reduced production. This is why in  spite of the government's decisive "stop," life inevitably  demands "more" -- workers want their salaries, and enterprises  their credits. Many workers were left without means of  subsistence and the hope to earn it somewhere.    The government makes the situation even worse, stepping up  repressions against the private sector. Commercial structures  groan under excessive taxes and the self-will of state  bureaucrats. Finally, they start to work illegally, that is, to  move their operations into the underground economy. Favorable  conditions for the private economic sector would relieve the  burden of inflation even under the present conditions in  Ukraine. Of course, unprofitable state enterprises will be  forced to shut down in any case, but they could be replaced  instead by alternative structures which would create more jobs  and production.    However, the authorities did their best to encourage the  unemployed workers to seek protection from unemployment in  racketeering and petty speculation. After the recent "victory  over inflation," the ranks of the underground economy will  certainly be swollen by a cheap labor force, while people's  standards of living will plummet.</p>

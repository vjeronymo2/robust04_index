			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KNBC, which presents good newscasts in general, is a pleasure to watch.  </P> <P> But may I offer a small suggestion to Kelly Lange? Please, Kelly, update your  makeup and hairdo. The long, bushy hair is so outdated. You are a very  attractive lady, but a shorter, neater, smarter hair style would be an immense  help. And please dump those big, circular, dangling earrings.  </P> <P> This is a personal opinion, of course, but many of my friends have expressed  the same opinions.  </P> <P> Caitlin Adler, Santa Monica  </P></p>

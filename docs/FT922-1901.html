			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Big towns will be forced to privatise buses PUBLIC-SECTOR bus companies in all Britain's largest towns and cities are to be privatised under plans being prepared by the Department of Transport. They include state-owned London Buses; the municipally owned bus companies in the metropolitan areas of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Strathclyde; and bus companies in cities including Nottingham, Cardiff, Southampton, and Hull. Privatisation of the 35 companies will represent the biggest shake-up of Britain's bus industry since privatisation of the National Bus Company's 56 component companies between 1986 and 1988. That coincided with deregulation of the bus industry outside London and paved the way for outbreaks of fierce competition in some parts of the country, followed by a series of mergers and takeovers. The latest plans will be outlined tomorrow by Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, at a private seminar arranged by Capital Strategies, a London-based consultancy specialising in employee buy-outs. Mr Freeman is expected to announce that the government intends to legislate for compulsory privatisation of London Buses and all 34 municipal bus companies as soon as possible. The powers will be sought in the same bill as the one planned for the deregulation of London bus services, for which parliamentary time has not yet been found. The government believes most local authorities can be persuaded to privatise their companies voluntarily. Councils will be told that if they negotiate deals in advance of legislation, they may be allowed to sell companies to management-employee buy-out teams without the need for competitive tendering. Many local authorities, particularly Labour-led ones, are reluctant to part with their bus companies. Faced with a choice between a voluntary sale to the company's employees now or a compulsory sale after legislation, however, many may choose the former. Although it is already open to all local authorities to privatise their bus companies, only nine have chosen to do so. The largest and most recent example was West Midlands Travel, the former West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive. Mr Brian Souter, chief executive of Stagecoach, an acquisitive private bus company, said he welcomed any move to bring more bus companies into the private sector. 'But I would be very disappointed if there was not open market bidding,'he said.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uzbekistan tempted by golden lure - Steve LeVine on a project that looks likely to overcome the cash-hungry, ex-Soviet republic's distrust of foreign investment A US company looks likely to win financing for a Dollars 100m project designed to squeeze six extra tonnes of gold a year from Uzbekistan's rich mines, thus proving something new about the ex-Soviet republic - it isn't always infuriatingly obstructionist. 'This project is super-important to the government,' says Mr Marcel DeGuire, of Newmont Mining Corporation of Denver, Colorado, 'because everybody is watching it to see if it works.' So far, few major foreign partnerships have worked out in the Central Asian nation. But last week Mr Ron Freeman, first vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said the bank would probably provide Dollars 70m for the Newmont project; half the remaining Dollars 30m would come from Newmont and the rest from the Uzbek government. The gold project, at Uzbekistan's Murantau mine - the world's largest single gold mine, which produces 50 tonnes a year at a Kizil Kum desert site 250 miles west of Tashkent - would be one of the largest foreign investments in Uzbekistan since perestroika began. 'I would not recommend this project unless I thought the government was fully behind it,' Mr Freemand said in Tashkent. Foreign interest in Uzbekistan is nothing new. Hundreds of western and regional traders have paraded through, attracted by the republic's production of the world's fourth largest cotton crop and the eighth largest gold output, as well as its large uranium and oil deposits. But little has come of it. The Uzbek government is probably the most centralised of the 15 former Soviet republics. Officials make virtually no decisions without President Islam Karimov's express permission and he has been painfully slow about allowing free enterprise. The visitor finds few of the small-scale entrepreneurs who offer imported goods from kiosks throughout the Baltics, the ex-Soviet Slavic countries and the Caucasus. The government desperately wants foreign investment; it simply has been slower than others in adjusting to the pace of business outside the former Soviet Union and mortally fearful of foreign exploitation. If the Newmont deal goes through, as seems likely, it is probably because it is a cash-cow that the budget-strapped republic can milk immediately for hard currency, while at the same time protecting itself from exploitation. The deal involves extraction of gold from the 150m tonnes of already-mined rock that has been accumulating in a great pile since 1967, not the mining of fresh ore. The government this month did invite foreign bids to develop a new gold deposit that it said contained about 100 tonnes of gold. The announcement represented a shift for Mr Karimov. Since independence a year ago, Uzbekistan has kept its entire 70-tonne annual gold production, instead of sending it to Russia as it was forced to in the past. According to the government, Mr Karimov has deposited all the subsequent output into national reserves, allowing none to be sold. Some observers claim Mr Karimov approved the bid only because his hand was forced - gold production has fallen because of supply shortages and antiquated equipment and he may have decided to cut a deal to help turn round the declining industry. No-one can be sure that the president will actually proceed with such a large gold mining contract, and so it is not at all clear how much, if at all, Uzbekistan's economic atmosphere has changed. The Newmont plan calls for the company to import crushers, special plastics and other equipment for 'heap-leaching' technology, which will extract gold that otherwise probably could not be economically processed. Newmont, the largest gold producer in North America, is building a similar project in Yanacocha, Peru. It is scheduled to come on line later this year and to produce 100,000 ounces of gold annually. The company expects the Murantau, Uzbekistan, project to produce six to seven tonnes of gold the first year, when the richest ore will be exploited, and five to six tonnes a year after that. The profit will be split 50:50 between Newmont and the government. Mr DeGuire, who is a metallurgist, said financing terms were still to be worked out with the European Bank. Mr Freeman said the deal could be completed in two months. On that schedule, the project would be producing gold in the second half of next year, Mr DeGuire said. So how did Newmont pull it off? Mr DeGuire credited personal relationships that Newmont executives formed with Uzbek officials, employing a personal touch. When Uzbekistan became independent, for example, Newmont produced a replica of the nation's new flag, plus a couple of thousand of commemorative lapel-pins, the first set of which went to Mr Karimov and his ministers. 'We did a lot of stuff like that. We're also teaching them about cash-flow, so they know whether it's better to have a dollar now or later,' Mr DeGuire said. 'This joint venture is a model. It's well balanced. It's a pattern they can follow for other projects later.'</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Gulf states see first democracy forum DEMOCRATS from five Arab states have set up the Gulf's first movement to promote democracy and freedom of expression across a region where political parties are banned, Reuter reports from Kuwait. The Gulf National Forum (GNF), created at a meeting in Kuwait this month, groups academics, businessmen and professional people from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It said it would act as a public advocacy group to promote and defend human rights, democracy and basic freedoms in Gulf Co-operation Council states. Five Moroccan opposition parties have joined in a new bloc called the Democratic Front ahead of general elections slated for this year.</p>

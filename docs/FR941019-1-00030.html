			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the Wheat Commission's Report to the Commission, published in 1969, recognized that most investment decisions are based essentially on estimates of future earnings, the Commission determined that the detriments to investors associated with permitting forward-looking disclosure weighed against lifting the ban on disclosure of such information. In the Wheat Commission's view, the heightened litigation exposure, updating requirements and risk of undue investor reliance on this information outweighed any countervailing benefits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Wheat Report stated these findings as follows: From a management standpoint, projections may change rapidly during a given year as changes occur in the factors on which they are based. Inclusion of such changing projections in a prospectus, which might be used long after it became effective would give rise to significant problems. It has been the Commission's long-standing policy not to permit projections and predictions in prospectuses and reports filed with the Commission. Such documents are designed to elicit material facts. Their factual character is widely recognized. Investors and their advisers are at liberty to make their own projections based on the disclosures resulting from the Commission's requirements. A real danger exists, in the Study's judgment, that projections appearing in prospectuses and other documents filed under securities laws and reviewed by the Commission would be accorded a greater measure of validity by the unsophisticated than they would deserve.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Wheat Report, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 5, at 95&hyph;96.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Rulemaking Initiatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission continued to consider these issues and conducted hearings in 1972 to determine whether to lift the ban and, instead, either mandate or permit disclosure of forward-looking information. The 1972 hearings involved fifty-three witnesses and resulted in the submission of over 200 letters of comment. A significant number of those letters were from issuers objecting to any suggestion that they be required to file forward-looking statements with the Commission. Following those hearings, the Commission elected in 1973 not to require disclosure of forward-looking information, but announced in a policy statement its intention to promulgate rules to permit voluntary disclosure of projections and to protect those projections from civil antifraud liability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Act Release No. 5362 (Feb. 2, 1973) (``[t]he Commission has never required a company to publicly disclose its projections and does not intend to do so now''). The Commission stated that its decision not to mandate disclosure of forward-looking statements was based on its desire not to deviate too far from its historical position of prohibiting such disclosure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In 1975, the Commission issued a series of proposals designed to implement the 1973 policy statement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Specifically, the proposals would have:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Act Release No. 5581 (April 28, 1975).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

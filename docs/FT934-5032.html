			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Import and export information reform - Customs The chancellor proposes to reform the powers available to Customs officers for access to information from businesses involved in the import and export of goods. The powers are intended to come into effect on Royal Assent to the Finance Bill. The chancellor's intention is to align Customs powers with those already in force for value added tax and excise. The new powers will therefore already be familiar to most customs traders and will allow them to benefit from an audit-based system of control. Controls exercised at the frontier against smuggling are not affected by the proposals. Until now, controls for Customs purposes have been directed at the goods themselves, involving detailed frontier declarations and checking. In 1991 the Customs and Excise Department began to replace such transaction-checking with an audit-based approach to control. This approach offers considerable benefits to businesses: apart from relaxed frontier checks, businesses receive fewer visits from Customs officers, and compliance costs are reduced. However, new powers are required to give officers access to a different range of information. The proposals will allow the department to make regulations requiring businesses involved in a Customs activity to keep records, and to produce them for inspection within such time and in such form as may be reasonably required. Such records may be copied or removed by officers. There are safeguards to ensure that traders can continue to have access to the documents or be provided with copies.</p>

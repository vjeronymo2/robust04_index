			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Smoker's claim of constructive dismissal fails A NURSING auxiliary yester-day failed at an industrial tribunal in her claim of constructive dismissal over a smoking ban at work. The decision, which is subject to appeal, confirms the right of employers to introduce smoking bans on their premises. Workplace smoking bans are increasingly popular with employers who are fearful of claims against them from workers seeking compensation for the effects of passive smoking. The tribunal decided Mrs May Dryden, 63, was not forced to leave her job at Glasgow's Western Infirmary after Greater Glasgow Health Board introduced a smoking ban. Mrs Dryden, who smokes 25 cigarettes a day, told the tribunal she could not go eight hours without a cigarette and therefore had to leave her job. She said the health board banned smoking on its premises last summer. It did not set aside rooms for smokers or allow them time to smoke outside. The tribunal's decision will affect hundreds of smokers who still work for the health board. Written reasons for the decision will be given later. The health board said it was pleased the tribunal had decided in its favour. It would wait for the written reasons before commenting further. Mrs Dryden said: 'I am disappointed for myself but I am more disappointed for my colleagues that evidently nothing is going to be done about this situation.' Up to one in five employers now operate anti-smoking policies. They include Midland Bank, IBM, Marks and Spencer and the Inland Revenue. Ms Alison Hillhouse, director of Ash, the anti-smoking group, said the ruling was encouraging. The Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest) said the ruling meant British workplaces were moving closer to those in the US, where 'employers are dictating what people do outside their working hours'.</p>

The original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposed an extension of the morning and afternoon time periods when the draw need not open for the passage of vessels without regard to vessel type or river flow condition. This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking proposes an amendment which would provide for relatively uninterrupted vehicular flow during peak traffic times while being less restrictive to commercial navigation during periods of high river flow conditions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before December 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed to Commander (oan), Thirteenth Coast Guard District, 915 Second Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98174&hyph;1067.

These closed periods are necessary to accommodate peak morning and afternoon vehicular commute traffic across the bridges. Both bridges also provide alternate mid-level fixed spans which provide greater vertical clearance than do the drawspans in the closed position. The alternate fixed spans are routinely used by tug and barge traffic except at higher water surface elevations. Because the number of vehicles crossing the interstate bridges has increased dramatically, particularly during commute times, any opening in close proximity, before or after, results in unacceptable vehicular traffic delays. Therefore, Oregon State Department of Transportation (ORDOT) has requested an extension of the weekday closed periods. On November 26, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 62302). In addition, the Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District also published the proposal in a Public Notice dated December 14, 1993. Both notices advised the public that the Coast Guard was considering a proposal to extend the morning and afternoon time periods during which the draw need not open for the passage of vessels. The morning period would be changed to 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and the afternoon period would be changed to 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. The Coast Guard received five comments in response to its public notice and no comments to its Federal Register notice. One commenter, a federal resource agency which routinely responds to our public notices did not take a position in favor or against the proposed amendment. Two commenters representing land transportation interests favored the proposal. Two commenters representing commercial navigation interests stated opposition to the proposal unless it was modified to provide the following: (1) When the vertical clearance under the green center of channel lights of the wide fixed span is less than 52 feet (river gauge 6.0 feet or more), the closed periods remain as existing. (2) When the vertical clearance under the green center of channel lights of the wide fixed span is greater than 52 feet (river gauge 5.9 feet or less), the proposed closed periods would be in effect.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The referenced wide fixed span is the span between the vertical lift span and the designated alternate channel fixed span. Following further investigation by the Coast Guard it was determined that because vertical clearances of less than 52 feet under the center of the wide fixed span occur only during spring run off or other infrequent flood conditions, the requested change was reasonable for commercial navigation. We have incorporated it in this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

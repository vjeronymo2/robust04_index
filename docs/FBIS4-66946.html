			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada has ordered military troops to the streets and  national highways to control public order and guarantee free  transit, in view of possible road blockades by peasants.    The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) has urged peasants to  block roads, highways, and railroad tracks as of today to  increase pressure on the government to yield to their salary  demands.    Bolivian main cities were today under military control,  while  several military units were patrolling highways to stop peasants  from complying with the COB appeal.    Although the government has expressed its willingness to  negotiate with union leaders, it has warned that it is very  difficult to amend the budget law which provides for an 8  percent salary increase because "there is no flexibility in the  allotment of resources."    Military and police officials have reported that all roads  were cleared during the first 12 hours of the day; but they  admitted that several roadblocks were set up at different  locations.    However, Radio Fides in La Paz reported that peasants have  complied with the COB instructions to block roads and railroad  tracks.    Peasant Leader Juan de La Curz Villca asserted that about  30,000 members of the coca leaf farmers union in the El Chapare  region have set up roadblocks on the main highway linking  Cochabamba and Santa Cruz.    Villca warned that the producers of coca leaves, a  traditional product for Bolivian indigenous groups that is also  the basic ingredient for manufacturing cocaine, have reported  "they will not lift the roadblocks, not even under machine gun  fire."    Union leader David Herrada asked the members of the Armed  Forces and the police to join the blockade in Cochabamba. He  said: "If we take another piece out of this neoliberal  government it will also benefit the police and the Armed Forces,  who also have low salaries, like the workers."    The prefect (governor) of Chuquisaca, Omar Montalvo,  confirmed that the military unit patrolling Sucre and the access  roads will break up any demonstration and prevent any road  blockade.    A Sucre radio station reported that about 3,000 peasants  closed roads in five of the 10 districts of Chuquisaca.    In addition some buses going to Potosi had problems in  arriving in that city due to the blockades set up by the  peasants.    Several military units have been deployed to other regions  of  the southern part of the country, where roads and railroad  tracks were closed.    The FIDES news agency reported that in Camargo, in the  southern part of the country, about 500 peasants prevented about  100 cargo and passenger vehicles from passing, and that because  of this a two-year-old girl "died from the very cold weather  early this morning."    Some cargo and bus companies have suspended services while  the strike ordered by the COB continues.    Despite the tense situation created by the presence of  military troops on the streets and the road blockades,  government officials and COB leaders are holding talks behind  closed doors in an effort to find a solution to the crisis.    The appeal made by the COB to the Catholic Church to mediate  in the conflict was rejected by Apostolic Nuncio Giovanni  Tonnucci, who said that the church cannot mediate "among people  who turn a deaf ear to dialogue."</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CHILI;  </P> <P> SESPE CREEK COOK-OFF;  </P> <P> HOT STUFF;  </P> <P> IT'S A TEST OF THE TASTE BUDS AS COOKS FROM SEVEN NATIONS VIE FOR THE CONTEST  CROWN AND A $500 PRIZE.  </P> <P> To some, chili is a bowl of beans and spices. To others it's a way of life.  While the heat-and-eat, canned-chili crowd scans supermarket shelves in search  of something to pour over hot dogs, committed chili cooks from seven nations  hover over the latest in an endless series of practice batches. They taste,  compare and confer. "Too much coriander," one murmurs.  </P> <P> A perfect pot of chili is something to be savored. It is also something that  can win a chef the title of World Champion and a tasty prize of $25,000. Small  wonder that those bitten by the chili cook-off bug plan their schedules around  the numerous competitions that have sprung up around the country since the  first international cook-off was held in Texas in 1967.  </P> <P> Fillmore's "Sespe Creek" Cook-off on July 4 is a step along the way to the top.  Sanctioned by the International Chili Society, the event annually attracts at  least 30 chefs and chili connoisseurs from across the county. The $500 prize is  modest, but the winner also qualifies for a regional cook-off. Regional winners  are eligible for October's World Championship in Rosamond, Calif.  </P> <P> World champions don't fade away; they start their own cook-offs. Fillmore  residents Jim Beaty and Kenton Stafford were champions in '86 and '88  respectively. They founded the Sespe Creek cook-off four years ago to add  flavor to the town's Independence Day celebrations. Both look forward to having  friends from the cook-off circuit come to the town where they grew up. "It's  like a family," Beaty said of the chili-chef network.  </P> <P> Beaty and Stafford serve as co-chairmen of the event and will head a judging  team of five to 15 experts, in accordance with International Chili Society  rules. They usually round out the team with a few volunteers from the crowd.  </P> <P> What makes a good pot of chili? "No beans," said Beaty. "Just beef." Beer may  make it bitter, and according to Beaty, the wrong onions will have the same  effect. Meat must be neither tough or mushy.  </P> <P> "When I'm judging, I look for something that gets my attention," Beaty said. "A  little bite at the front of your mouth. The spices should open up as you start  to chew. It should have a good back heat as it goes down your throat. Then, it  kind of explodes in your mouth." In other words, fireworks for the taste buds.  </P> <P> Most of the cooks who visit Fillmore are already experts, but a few novices are  expected to battle it out with veterans of the seasoning wars.  </P> <P> "I went to my first cook-off on a dare," said the 46-year-old Beaty, who has  been cooking chili since 1982. "I didn't know anything -- I came in something  like 35th out of 25."  </P> <P> Stafford, 41, started in 1986 as Beaty's assistant and had to be talked into  entering a competition on his own. Evidently, his first experience was not too  painful. "I took third," he said, smiling.  </P> <P> Both Fillmore cooks practice cooking up to four times a week and travel to  cook-offs at least twice a month. Neighbors for 14 years, their friendly  rivalry doesn't stop them from occasionally critiquing each other's chili.  </P> <P> Entrants to Fillmore's cook-off must provide two gallons of "People's Choice"  chili, which the public tastes while competition pots simmer on propane stoves  beneath colorful canopies that are provided by the cooks. Contestants start  arriving at 6:30 a.m. By 11 a.m., booths are open, and live music adds a  festive note.  </P> <P> What explains the cooks' dedication, and the public's fascination for chili  cook-offs? "It's a happening," Jim West, executive director of the  International Chili Society, said from his Newport Beach office. "There's a  mystique to it -- like wine tasting. Chili is a creative food. People wouldn't  turn out like this to cook meat loaf or tuna casserole."  </P> <P> Originally developed on cattle drives in the old West as a way of rendering  tough meat edible, chili is truly an American food. Nonetheless, in addition to  events across the United States, the society sanctions cook-offs in France,  England, New Zealand and Australia, as well as Canada and Mexico.  </P> <P> All cook-offs approved by the society must donate proceeds to charity. "Since  the ICS moved to California from Texas in 1975, it has raised $25 million for  charity," West said.  </P> <P> While observers need only an appetite for food and fun, there are a few basics  that an aspiring chili chef needs to take to the cook-off: a propane stove and  a sun shade, a stainless-steel pot and a spice bag containing carefully  selected individual herbs and spices.  </P> <P> The Sespe Creek Cook-Off might be a good place to start.  </P> <P> Stafford's first foray into formal competition was in his hometown in 1987. One  year later, he won the world championship.  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: Sespe Creek Fourth Annual Chili Cook-Off -- Fillmore.

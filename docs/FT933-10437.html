			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Capital returns National Westminster has long justified its low capital ratio with the argument that bad debt provisions would come down before loan demand began to accelerate. So far, that gamble has paid off. Lower bad debt provisions helped double first-half profits despite a Pounds 159m charge for shedding retail business in France and Australia. Unlike Lloyds, NatWest has gone to the trouble of having its first-half figures reviewed by its auditors. Under new EC rules, that allows retained interim profit to count as tier one capital. With some judicious balance sheet management as well, the tier one ratio has risen to 5.5 per cent from 5.2 at the end of 1992. In a period of weak loan demand when competitors such as Lloyds and Abbey National have too much capital, there may be an argument for economising on capital to boost returns. Even so, NatWest has to draw a fine line between efficiency and safety. Its ratio would still look skimpy if loan demand did revive. Pressure on lending margins while the economy remains weak will slow the flow of retained profits needed to position the bank for recovery. Indeed, its interim figures reinforce the impression that operating profits in banking are hard to come by. At constant exchange rates, income before provisions grew by only 5 per cent. NatWest Markets put in an outstanding performance but its trading profits are not a guaranteed source of growth. It is hard to escape the conclusion that large banks cannot survive just by cutting costs and raising fees. Unfashionable though it sounds, they need interest income too.</p>

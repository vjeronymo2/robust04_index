			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TRUCK FIRMS JOIN SAFETY GROUPS IN PUSH AGAINST RADAR DETECTORS  </P> <P> The nation's truck companies joined with safety groups today to push for a  federal order to stop truckers from using radar detectors.  </P> <P> With new evidence that 37% to 52% of tractor-trailer trucks use the dashboard  devices in some states, heads of eight national organizations signed a petition  to the Federal Highway Administration.  </P> <P> Tom Donohue, president of the American Trucking Assns., which represents 4,500  truck companies, said his group backs police efforts to catch speeding truckers  and opposes radar detectors.  </P> <P> "The only reason you'd want to have one in a truck is to drive faster than you  ought to," he said.  </P> <P> Only Connecticut, Virginia and the District of Columbia outlaw detectors in all  vehicles, and New York has passed a law banning them in larger trucks. They are  legal in all other states, with about 2 million sold each year.  </P></p>

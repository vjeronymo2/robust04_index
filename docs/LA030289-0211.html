			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> EC OKS STRONG OZONE LAYER PACT  </P> <P> European Community environment ministers agreed today on a surprise pact that  would virtually eliminate household gases used in refrigerators and spray cans  that are destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer.  </P> <P> An EC spokesman said the ministers had agreed to eliminate chlorofluorocarbon  production and consumption by the year 2000, and to an 85% cut as soon as  possible.  </P> <P> "This is a quantum leap forward," Britain's Lord Caithness told reporters. The  ministers had originally expected to agree only on an 85% cut by the end of the  century.  </P> <P> About 40 countries agreed in a treaty signed in Montreal in 1987 to halve CFC  production by 1998. Diplomats said the 12-nation community wants to take the  lead in pushing the world toward total cuts.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RALLY URGES TENURE FOR UCLA PROFESSOR  </P> <P> About 350 supporters of UCLA professor Don Nakanishi assembled at the Westwood  campus Thursday, calling for immediate tenure for the education instructor.  Representatives of a broad range of mainly minority student groups voiced  support for Nakanishi, who hopes to become the first tenured Asian-American in  the UCLA Graduate School of Education. Nakanishi was first denied tenure in the  fall of 1987, and his supporters have maintained that racism has played a role  in the handling of the case. UCLA Chancellor Charles Young recently returned  the case to the school of education for further study. In a statement Thursday,  Young said the new review of the case is under way and will be resolved "as  soon as possible."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 12 January RAHVA HAAL, POSTIMEES, pp 1,3] </F>   [Excerpt] Wednesday, January 12 -- President Lennart Meri  ended the controversy over the cabinet reshuffle by finally  appointing the four ministers.    The Riigikogu session voted again on some draft laws before  the president's arrival -- the new defence minister Indrek  Kannik is no longer an MP, but he had nevertheless voted twice  on Monday [10 January].    The president held a 14-minute speech, criticising the  government coalition and specifically Prime Minister Mart Laar  for the inopportune time for the replacement of the ministers.  The government's secretive way of acting is alienating the  people from the government, the president warned, stressing that  he is attempting to protect the "Fatherland" against the results  of its own acts. He regretted Laar's "lack of statesmanship" in  not resigning and maintaining the existing secretive system of  decisionmaking. Meri warned against an "infiltration of Russian  state capital into Estonia" and rhetorically asked, "Who really  owns the Republic of Estonia?" The president again stressed the  efficiency of Toomas Sildmae in the Economy Ministry and  expressed his doubts whether the change of ministers will  increase the confidence of the national business circles.  Referring to the NATO summit, Meri claimed that the reshuffle  was conducted at the most unfavourable moment. However, he  signed the document relieving the four ministers and appointing  their successors.    The president declined from answering any questions of the  MP's and left immediately.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 3 KILLED, 1 INJURED WHEN BOATS COLLIDE ON CROWDED RIVER  </P> <P> Two power boats, including one carrying five people from Ventura, collided on  the Kings River near Visalia over the weekend, killing three members of a San  Fernando Valley family and seriously injuring the driver of the Ventura boat.  </P> <P> The Venturan injured in the fiery collision, Mark Anthony Nichols, 33, had been  boating with his wife, Lori, and about 20 friends. The group had met regularly  for boating at the river, which is 3 1/2 hours by car from Ventura.  </P> <P> Nichols' boat apparently was cut off by another one on the crowded river,  Tulare County sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> All three people in the second craft were killed outright. Authorities  identified them as Frederick and Lynn Guillette and their daughter, Nicole, 20  months, of Canoga Park.  </P> <P> Nichols underwent surgery for a ruptured spleen at Valley Medical Center in  Fresno. He was in stable condition Monday. Two others from Ventura, identified  as Brian Wallet and Mike Dietrich, were released after treatment for minor  injuries.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Dave Williams said Monday that the accident was still under  investigation but that it appeared that Lynn Guillette, 30, who was driving her  boat, had strayed onto the side of the river used by southbound boaters. Both  craft in the collision were 12 to 15 feet long with low-profile, fiberglass  hulls. Neither was towing a skier.  </P> <P> "Every indication is that Nichols was operating in compliance with all  regulations," Williams said. "It is unknown what the other driver was doing or  thinking. It looks like they both tried to divert but couldn't."  </P> <P> Williams said it was unknown how fast the boats were going. They have top  speeds of more than 40 m.p.h. Nichols' boat flew over the top of the  Guillettes', which burst into flames.  </P> <P> Sherry Maltman, whose husband, Craig, was on the Ventura boat, said she was  riding about 100 yards behind it on an independently powered Jet-Ski when "I  saw this big explosion, and I saw this boat go up in the air and I thought my  husband was dead. It was like Vietnam. I was crying before I got there. . . . I  couldn't believe all our guys survived it.  </P> <P> "The other boat was completely on fire, like a bomb had blown it apart."  </P> <P> A boater who saw the accident put out the fire by using his engine to spray  water onto it.  </P> <P> Craig Maltman said Dietrich and the fifth passenger, Peter Fliss, tried  unsuccessfully to revive the injured family.  </P> <P> Nichols' wife, Lori, said in a telephone interview from her husband's hospital  room that her husband has been boating on the river for several years.  </P> <P> "It's a dangerous river, but he knows it very well," said Lori Nichols, who was  ashore when the accident happened. "Mark did everything he could to avoid it.  He was as far right as he could go. She was supposed to be to the left. He did  everything he could. They would have hit the shore if they hadn't hit him."  </P> <P> The collision startled golfers and workers at the Kings River Golf and Country  Club where the 17th hole runs next to the river. Country club employee Jeff  Avey told the Associated Press that he was watering a green when he heard the  accident.  </P> <P> "I heard one boat gun its engine, like it was turning or taking off real fast,"  Avey said. "Then, within 10 seconds, there was a loud bang and then complete  silence."  </P> <P> Avey said he ran toward the river with his hose, hoping to help put out the  flames that poured from one of the boats. "I was yelling, asking if anyone  needed help," he said. "No one answered."  </P> <P> Frederick Guillette, 31, was a service manager for a Nissan dealership. Lynn  Guillette was a buyer for J. C. Penney.  </P> <P> Frederick's father, Frederick Guillette Sr. said Frederick and his brother  Todd, 27, had both taken their families boating for the week. They were packed  up and ready to head back to Los Angeles when they decided to use up the  remaining gasoline, a safety measure, he said.  </P> <P> "They were all ready to go home, but the baby had been fussing that she wanted  a Popsicle," Guillette Sr. said. "So they decided to take a run to use up the  gas and get Nicole a Popsicle. When they were going, they got broadsided."  </P> <P> Todd Guillette had taken his boat the opposite way on the river, his father  said. When he came back, he saw his brother's boat burning and sinking and the  efforts being made by bystanders to rescue the family.  </P> <P> "He came upon the accident and saw all the smoke and recognized his brother's  boat," Guillette Sr. said. "He and his brother were very close. He has really  taken it hard."  </P> <P> The couple were married four years ago at the Santa Ynez Mission, near where  Lynn Guillette grew up in Santa Barbara. They and Nicole are to be buried  Wednesday in the mission cemetery.  </P></p>

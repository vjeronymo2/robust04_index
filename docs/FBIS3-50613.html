			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The 3 January editorial of the newspaper  TRABAJADORES points out that the currency excess, caused mainly  by the continuous, growing budget deficit, is today the Cuban  family's main worry. The article adds that the sudden weakening  of the Cuban economy from external factors has been reflected in  a drop in individual consumption and the loss of the purchasing  power of salaries which, in many cases, are partially alloted to  buying on the black market, where they are also losing value due  to an increase in prices. Upon the collapse of our import  capability, production dropped in a descending spiral while the  peoples' salaries and state expenses remain more or less stable,  thus weakening financial balance and the motivational aspect of  salaries.    The time has come to begin putting order into domestic  finances and directing the people's efforts toward a harmony  between state expenses and income, while implementing actions to  reduce the excess currency in circulation. As always in our  society, the workers are the ones who can contribute most to  solving these urgent problems because no measure or series of  measures could hope to succeed unless it has the workers'  support. We are convinced that the measures should be taken  slowly, not only because of their technical complexity and the  need to understand the problems more deeply, but also because  they should be the future basis of a true national consensus  without losing track of the Cuban nation's foundation of social  justice.    The TRABAJADORES editorial stresses that while we are  grateful for the serene, democratic speed of the decision-taking  process, we are calling all workers and union movements to  action because much can already be done to promote financial  balance and to fight the causes and consequences of imbalance.  First of all, we have to preserve the value of work. The  editorial adds that as Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has  repeated, Cuban workers are demonstrating the value of honor and  revolutionary and patriotic awareness as they challenge, day to  day, all kinds of difficulties in fulfilling their labor tasks.    It is unquestionable that the immense majority of Cuban  workers have placed their commitment and honor above the  material factors that affect work motivation under the present  circumstances. Let us maintain and improve discipline and the  commitment to do more with the available resources in every work  center. This will be an immense contribution to the solution of  the financial problem, which in the end will be solved through  more production and work. Let us fight everywhere the absurd  habit of spending certain allocations unjustifiably just to  ensure a similar allocation in the next budget cycle. Let us  reject, with renewed energy, inefficient work, particularly  where there is a sure capacity to produce.    In a proletariat society, the state develops and manages the  budget with the same principles that a united family manages its  own budget. The editorial adds that there is no sacrifice that  is not good for everyone when it ensures the wellbeing of all.  It adds: just as a family cannot nor ought to spend more than it  earns, our state is also compelled to follow that strict  economic logic. Presumably, the path to financial order and  discipline will not be short nor easy, but everything being done  will help us during hard times, and will better prepare us to  accept any positive events that will result as the unavoidable  reward of so much effort.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Cadbury plan for monitoring directors may be changed THE TWO most significant proposals in a report aimed at improving the performance of corporate boards in Britain may have to be changed, said Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the committee which drew up the recommendations. The proposals which face alteration would oblige non-executive directors to monitor the activities of executives, and introduce an enforcement mechanism. The draft report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, published in May, suggested a voluntary code of practice for boards of directors. It also urged a new Stock Exchange listing requirement compelling companies to disclose the extent to which they complied with the code, and to explain where they did not. Sir Adrian said more than 200 comments had been received since the draft report was published. Almost all supported its broad principles though several recommendations had been criticised. 'There is a great issue about the weight of the role assigned to non-executives. The question they raise is whether we would be dividing the board,' Sir Adrian said. 'We have used the word 'monitor'. People have questioned that.' He also said some respondents had objected to proposals that the non-executive chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees should answer shareholder questions at annual general meetings. While he stopped short of saying the committee would have to alter its original proposals, he said those sections of the report would have to be reviewed closely. A final version of the report is expected to be released in early November. The Confederation of British Industry, in particular, has objected to the enforcement proposals in the Cadbury report, saying they could lead to unnecessary bureaucracy. Sir Adrian said he believed obtaining the CBI's support for the report would be critical to its success because its members had to carry out its proposals voluntarily. 'We need the support of the CBI,' he said. Cadbury responds to CBI hostility, Page 10</p>

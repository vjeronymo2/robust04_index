			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Full capacity reached after expansion at Bolivian open pit ASSIGNED CAPACITY at Inti Raymi's Kori Khollo gold/silver open pit mine in western Bolivia, which recently underwent a Dollars 163m expansion, has now been reached according to Mr Alvaro Ugalde, the general manager. The expansion of Karl Khollo was concluded in January. Inti Raymi is 85 per cent owned by Battle Mountain Gold Company of Nevada. The remaining 15 per cent is held by Emusa, a Bolivian mining enterprise. The expansion programme will boost production capacity from 45,000 troy ounces of gold a year to 240,000 ounces. Silver capacity will increase from 250,000 ounces a year to lm ounces. Expansion was prompted by the exhaustion of the pit's 6m tonnes of gold/silver oxide deposits. Exploration showed a further 60m tonnes of sulphide deposits below, with a grade of 2.3 grams of gold and 14.5 grams of silver per tonne. Following installation of a new carbon leaching plant, the sulphide deposits are now being exploited. The recovery rate is 64.2 grams of gold and 28.7 grams of silver per tonne. Production of oxide deposit ceased in February. The production figures for that month were 15,400 ounces of gold and 131,000 ounces of silver. Mr Ugalde said overall production in 1992 reached 50,000 ounces of gold and 250,000 ounces of silver. Projected production for 1993 is 212,000 ounces of gold and 900,000 ounces of silver rising in 1994 to 240,000 ounces and lm ounces. Funding for the company's expansion breaks down into Dollars 95m from outside funding agencies, Dollars 55m from Battle Mountain and Dollars 13m from Inti Raymi itself. Mr Ugalde believes a gold price of Dollars 330 an ounce is necessary to cover interest payments.</p>

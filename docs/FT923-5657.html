			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Economy in France slows further THE French economy slowed down in the second quarter of this year, mustering growth of just 0.1 per cent, according to INSEE, the state statistics institute, against 0.9 per cent in the first quarter. INSEE has now revised its growth estimate for the full year from 2.5 per cent to between 2.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent. Originally the institute had been expecting growth of 0.4 per cent in the second quarter. However the new INSEE forecast means that the French government is still on course to reach its own targets for the year, given that its budget is based on projected growth of 2.2 per cent.</p>

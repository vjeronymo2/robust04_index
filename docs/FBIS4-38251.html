			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the  Presidential Council, received U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hughes in  Sanna today. They reviewed the latest developments in Yemen, as  well as the cease-fire initiatives that the political leadership  has announced -- initiatives that were repeatedly violated by  the forces of apostasy and secession. They also exchanged views  on several issues of common interest.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 3 Feb (PANA) -- The Bank of Zaire's  counters have been closed to the public since 31 January due to  a shortage of banknotes in its vaults, PANA learned from sources  close to the issuing bank.    This cash shortage at the central bank is occurring three  months after the monetary reform that was introduced on 22  October by the outgoing government of Faustin Birindwa and that  was aimed resolving liquidity problems. The commercial banks  have been operating with closed counters and have only been  attending to the affairs of business customers, a bank source  disclosed to PANA. The same source also confirmed that there is  an increase in check-cash exchange operations, with the current  exchange rate standing at one zaire for a check of three zaires  -- which was the practice before the introduction of the  monetary reform. Statistics from the Bank of Zaire reveal that  cash issuances amounted to 13,867,437 billion zaires at the end  of December 1993, while deposit money [words indistinct] billion  zaires during the same period -- $1 equals 100 new zaires [NZ].    All the measures announced to support the monetary reforms  have ended up being invalidated, financial sources interviewed  by PANA in Kinshasa say. Yet, on 24 October--two days after the  reform--Bank of Zaire Governor Buhendwa Bwa Mushaba, who was  fired on 1 February, told a news conference that the central  bank should no longer give concessionary facilities to the  government and that the ceiling for covering government  expenditure should not be exceeded. This challenge could not be  met by the central bank, where 98 percent of banknotes issued  went into state expenditure and only 2 percent were used for  investment and economic revival.    According to a central bank expert, the financing of the  state budget deficit through the banking system amounted to  9,203,867 old zaires for the whole of 1993. For the first week  of January 1994, the financing of the budget deficit amounted to  NZ471.4 million and all funds disbursed for government economic  activities were limited to 644,588 billion old zaires.    During the launching of the reform, the central bank  authorities had planned to freeze 98 percent of checking  deposits within the banking system, which should have made it  possible to determine the money supply that is compatible with  the real need of the economy. According to the same expert,  "this important measure was scuttled in favor of hoarding and  financing chance black market activities. Today, while the  bank's coffers are empty, huge quantities of banknotes are  circulating freely in the hands of informal sector speculators,  who apparently do not have any problems." This situation has  not enabled the central bank to mobilize foreign exchange  resources to support the new national currency and meet external  commitments, especially the importation of new currency symbols  and the payment of the country's foreign debt service.    The foreign exchange earnings registered by the national  bank  after the reform are very low, a study published in the NOTE  CONJONCTURE journal indicates. It reveals that they amounted to  $3.6 in October, $2.4 in November, and $4 million in December  1993. However, this institution owes local businesses $20  million, the German currency printing firm Giesecke and Devrient  $45 million, and $21.431 million to an import-export company  that prints, transports, purchases, and conveys molds and  numbering machines to Zaire, bank sources reveal.</p>

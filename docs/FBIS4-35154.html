			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] The minimum wage will be $70 on 1 September.  President Itamar Franco made this decision following a meeting  with the finance, labor, and social security ministers, and the  federal administration secretary.    Labor Minister Marcelo Pimentel later said that by the end  of  October the government will send Congress a draft bill outlining  a new minimum wage policy. President Itamar said military and  public servants will receive a salary adjustment soon after the  implementation of the real. The president said the date for the  wage increase has yet to be established, but it will be  implemented even if he has to fight with his economic ministers.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / South African hopes raised: UN envoy Vance seeks to end deadlock THE United Nations initiative to break the political deadlock in South Africa gets under way today with the arrival of the organisation's special envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance. The combination of Mr Vance's visit, and the prospect that business and unions could reach agreement on a 'social contract', have raised hopes for an end to the impasse which followed the June 15 massacre of 42 residents of Boipatong township. However, the stand-off between the African National Congress and the government deepened yesterday when about 220 people were arrested as the ANC stepped up its campaign of sit-ins at police and government offices. Mr Vance, 75, a former US secretary of state, is due to meet President F W de Klerk tomorrow at the start of a 10-day fact-finding visit which will include meetings with political, religious, business and labour leaders. His visit coincides with efforts to forge what would be an historic alliance between business and labour, based on a charter setting out agreed socio-economic objectives and calling for a democratic constitution. The two sides are close to agreement on a charter, part of a deal which would avert the general strike called for August 3 by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu). Some observers believe such a charter could provide the impetus for what has been called an economic forum, in which government joins business and labour in formulating economic policy. After initial resistance to the idea, mooted last year, the government has indicated cautious support.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish prices soar on devaluation move NEWS that the peseta would be devalued sent the Spanish government bond market rocketing up yesterday in anticipation of interest rate cuts. The actual devaluation figures  - 8 per cent for the peseta and 6.5 per cent for the Portuguese escudo  - came out after the European markets closed. Spanish bonds gained two points or more, with the shorter end feeling the most benefit. Demand came from new investors and some switching out of German bunds. Although the devaluation was in the range of forecasts, it was significantly ahead of the lower estimates of 6 per cent, adding to the feeling that there would be further gains today. At the longer end of the market, political uncertainty ahead of the general election on June 6 was cited as one factor limiting the upside. Another was the rise in inflation  - disappointing figures announced yesterday were not quite drowned out by the peseta furore. While Portuguese government bonds also registered gains, the illiquidity of the market deterred investors. The French government bond market was a little surprised at the swiftness of the Bank of France's latest  1/4 point cuts in key interest rates but the response was muted by continued nervousness ahead of the Danish referendum. In Germany, two factors dampened the bond market after yesterday's rally on the repo rate cut. One was the switching into Spain, the other some head shaking by Bundesbank leaders over the prospect of accelerating rate cuts Mr Helmut Schlesinger, central bank president, stressed the need the maintain D-Mark stability. Hesaid 'a sledgehammer interest rate policy' was inappropriate andearly gains in bunds were lost. The day ended weakly for the UK market, which today expects the Bank of England to make an announcement about the next gilt auction. The 10-15 year area is forecast to be the target and roughly Pounds 3bn is anticipated to keep up the relentless funding programme. The recent faltering of the pound was seen as limiting overseas interest. Reports of the death of Japan's benchmark government bond, the No 145 due 2002, seem to have been exaggerated. A revival of interest brought its yield back below 4.5 per cent. It opened at 4.55 per cent and closed at 4.485 in Tokyo. However, in overseas trading its fortunes waned again as it followed US Treasuriesdownwards. MORE BAD news on inflation sent longer-dated US Treasury securities into a tailspin. The benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 3/16 at 102 7/32 , yielding 6.946 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  5/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 3.874 per cent. The news that sparked the sell-off at the long end was a bigger-than-expected 0.4 per cent jump in the April consumer prices index which, taken with Wednesday's news of an unexpected rise in the producer prices index, reignited investors' fears of inflation. The 'core' measure of consumer price inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was also strong, at up 0.4 per cent. Adding to market woes was news of April retail sales up 1.2 per cent. The decline in the long bond was exacerbated by concerns that the bad inflation numbers would ruin the afternoon auction of Dollars 8.25bn in 30-year bonds. Although the auction subsequently went off smoothly, it was not enough to pull the market off the bottom, which may also have been disturbed by news of another strong set of weekly auto sales.</p>

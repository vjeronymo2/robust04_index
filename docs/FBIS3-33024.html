Thank  you for your warm welcome. I also want to say the Zapatist  National Liberation Army has fulfilled its commitment.    I want to state my opinion on this important moment in  Guadalupe Tepeyac. We are confirming that policies based on  principles are the best road for resolving conflicts and  problems.    This result would not have been achieved through violence.  Reason and the search for peace and reconciliation are stronger.  This is only one step, but it is a firm step on the road for  peace and reconciliation. I think we all here today have  learned much; both sides have. The main significance is we all  want an honorable peace for the men, women, and children of  Chiapas and Mexico. Viva Mexico!</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cuba has rejected the report by a special rapporteur  on the human rights situation in Cuba, because it responds to  U.S. pressures rather than to reality. During a news conference,  Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Commission on Human  Rights, describes as unacceptable the discussion of a draft  anti-Cuban resolution draft sponsored by the U.S. delegation,  which will be voted on next week. Perez Novoa deplored the U.S.  Administration's policy of hostility based on the fact that it  cannot bring itself to accept Cuba's level of development of  social, economic, and political programs despite that hostility.    Cuba has stated and reiterated over the years that it is  ready to discuss its differences with the United States under  conditions of sovereign equality and without preconditions.  Perez Novoa added that the United States avoids and rejects  normal relations and a discussion of differences.</p>

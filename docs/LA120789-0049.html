			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: GOOD NEWS ISN'T PLAYING IN PEORIA  </P> <P> The good news in recent weeks was that millions and millions of people in the  Eastern Bloc were freed from Communist oppression. It was the most significant  story since World War II. The bad news was that the television ratings in the  United States were way down. Freedom may have its moments, but it doesn't sell  Kellogg's Corn Flakes.  </P> <P> With the heat on, the network news divisions began calling their staffs  together.  </P> <P> The president of the Rambo Network, whose assistant kept feeding him Rolaids,  stared out at the group. "OK, who was the wise guy who said that tearing down  the Berlin Wall would make a good news show?"  </P> <P> There was dead silence in the room. Finally the anchorman spoke up. "I thought  it might be interesting. Americans had seen the wall standing for so long, I  imagined that they would enjoy watching it being torn down live."  </P> <P> The president asked: "Do you know what the rating was on that? It was 2.1. We  used to have a six share of the audience. Two-point-one is lower than the polo  game we covered with Prince Charles from Karachi."  </P> <P> The executive producer from evening news tried to smooth things over.  "Everybody makes mistakes. On paper, the end of the wall seemed like a good  idea. It just so happened that more viewers tuned in to 'I Love Lucy.' Does  that make overthrowing communism a bad idea?"  </P> <P> The president said: "It is if you overdo it. What about the liberation of  Czechoslovakia? For four nights we showed Czech citizens dancing in the streets  of Prague, and we wound up in the sewer."  </P> <P> A writer added: "We were covering history. It was television's finest hour."  </P> <P> "Tell that to the guys who own this network, and who also have a light bulb  factory in Schenectady. Look, I'm a newsman and I know a story when I see one,  but I'm not going to put on Bulgaria if nobody is going to watch it. When will  you all learn that a little freedom on television can go a long way?"  </P> <P> Another producer asked, "Do you want us to cut back on Gorbachev too?"  </P> <P> The president replied: "No, his ratings are still OK. I wouldn't want to have  him on every night, but the guy does have charisma. Now, the research staff,  who were immediately alerted after the Nielsen disaster, have come up with some  guidance on what we can do to beef up the audience.  </P> <P> "They are suggesting that we downplay any future stories on countries freeing  themselves from communism. We don't have to accept all of their ideas, although  the light bulb boys like them. They also think that we should go out and find  some shooting wars instead. The TV audiences prefer to watch people being  killed than people being liberated."  </P> <P> "What if Albania declares itself free?"  </P> <P> "I don't think that that's any of our business. Nobody in America knows where  Albania is. I'm not asking you to fudge the news, but you have to remember that  if nobody watches the show, we're all out of business.  </P> <P> "The fall of the Berlin Wall is a perfect example of overplaying a story. After  a while, the only ones who were interested were those who lived near it. John  Q. Viewer in Amarillo couldn't care less -- and that's the guy who is buying  our sponsor's light beer."  </P> <P> The producer said, "So you don't want us to call them like we see them."  </P> <P> The president told him: "Call them any way you want to, but I have to answer to  a higher authority. My bosses want to know why this network is providing upbeat  news from Europe, which is producing lousy ratings, when their light bulb  business needs all the downbeat news it can get."  </P></p>

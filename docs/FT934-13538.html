			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Arts: Family values distorted - Cinema THE CEMENT GARDEN (18) Andrew Birkin MR WONDERFUL (12) Anthony Minghella DRAGON - THE BRUCE LEE STORY (15) Rob Cohen ONCE UPON A FOREST (U) Charles Grosvenor HOMEWARD BOUND (U) Duwayne Dunham MANUFACTURING CONSENT Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar We have heard much about family values recently. Across the land, wild untamed Conservatives have inveighed against single parents and their drain on the nation's money and morals. The media have taken up the theme; clerics have cried 'Yes]' or 'No]'; and civilisation has stood on tiptoe, awaiting the verdict. Now here is a film on the subject. But Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden, based on Ian McEwan's novel, addresses the theme of family values (at least the Tory-hallowed version) much as a wrecking ball might address a cathedral. There is dying Mum (Sinead Cusack), soon to be buried by her children in the cellar. There is Dad (Hans Zischler), taken off by a heart attack while eccentrically cementing over the garden ('It'll be that much tidier'). And there is teenaged son Jack (Andrew Robertson) who grows out of his narcissist pleasure in mirrors to enjoy a fullblooded heterosexual liaison with his sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Did we mention the younger siblings, Sue and cross-dressing Tom? Just as well. Slouching towards Britain to be born, this film has already won a brace of festival prizes including Best Director at Berlin. Birkin comes to it after one stylish, star-crossed previous feature Burning Secret. (The star who crossed it was Faye 'Ready for my fiftieth close-up' Dunaway). Here he has compromised not a jot. The movie is a picture of Hell that keeps shimmering, like those trompe l'oeil double-image postcards, into a glimpse of Heaven. The images range from bilious sunsets to interiors as grey and grungy as last month's cheese. The dialogue has a gnomic, comic gaucherie enhanced by its sense of semi-detachment from some of the foreign players. (This is a German-French-English co-production.) And the film's loopy serenity, against many odds, becomes a joy. Even the in-your-face nepotism of the casting, with Birkin's son and niece (Mlle Gainsbourg) in leading roles, seems right in this tale of cabin fever domesticity spiralling into incest. For the reason the children conceal Mum's corpse in cement is that they hope to stay together and avoid orphanages. But the family that stays together may end up doing a lot of other things together. Like any McEwan story, The Cement Garden has a cinegenic eeriness alive with surreal incidentals. Birkin places the family's house, a concrete box in British Bauhaus style, in a weed-and-rubble wasteland that might have been designed by TS Eliot. Here the characters come and go, talking of emotional vertigo. And the sense of existential cadenza - not so much a programme for revolt, more a slow dive into hedonism as a sweet and least-resitance way of life - is conveyed by the laid-back, perfectly judged performances. Indeed the marvel of The Cement Garden is its poker-faced detachment. Birkin asks no questions, gives no answers, tells no lies. He is a fly on the wall  -one of several - in a household where human nature and human order, deprived of parental censure, is returning to basics. Strip away civilisation as we know it, suggests the movie, and boys will be boys, girls will be girls and each, more than likely, will end up trying to be the other. Anthony Minghella's Mr Wonderful is more upbeat about family values. Like the Tories the movie curses the unmarried state, but as much for money reasons as for moral ones. Alimony-stung blue-collar worker Matt Dillon cannot get out of the financial hole he is in. (Cue symbolic shots of him in a hole in the road working for New York's electricity company Con Edison). He wants to join his mates in a money-making enterprise: rebuilding a derelict bowling alley. But look] His pockets are empty and ex-wife Annabella Sciorra will never let him off the maintenance hook while she remains unmarried. Lightbulb idea] What if Dillon finds a 'Mr Wonderful' for her? Then he can live happily ever after with his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker), plus his bowling alley buddies and lots of money. After Minghella's Truly, Madly, Deeply, this film is truly, maddeningly shallow. Taking over an original script by Amy Schor and Vicki Polon, the British playwright-filmmaker has first endorsed its sentimental excesses and then allowed composer Michael Gore to pour musical syrup over it (warbling, wall-to-wall jazz). Worse still, whenever Dillon, Sciorra and Parker look like establishing a base-camp adequacy with their roles, Minghella brings on supporting star William Hurt, who strides past them with goggles and pitons towards the peak. Hurt is superb as Sciorra's current boyfriend: a sad-sack college professor who knows that his older, married status sentences him to an unspecified hour of doom. Listen to the lifetime of caustic despair in his pronunciation of the word 'Gus]' (Dillon). Watch his face grimace with irony as he comments on Dillon's IQ: 'He's not exactly plagued with ideas, is he?' For of course Sciorra's real Mr Wonderful - we can see it coming from the other side of New York State - is none other than her ex-Mr Wonderful, Mr Dillon. Cue contrived reunion, climactic tears and even more of that warbling jazz music. The first ever professional review I wrote was of a 1969 film called Marlowe. It starred James Garner as Chandler's gumshoe, but neither I nor anyone else back then noticed Garner. The film was stolen in a small role by a yowling, kicking, seemingly stark-mad Oriental called Bruce Lee. Here was a young actor born to defy gravity, smash furniture and imitate the searing cries of an impaled banshee. This debut movie does not figure in Dragon - The Bruce Lee Story. But then neither does much else of interest. Faithful to Lee's wife's official biography, it stomps blandly on from one career crossroads to the next as our hero, played by the unrelated Jason Scott Lee, climbs from Hong Kong poverty to Hollywood glory. The fight scenes are frequent and daft. The romantic scenes are frequent and dull. And when Robert Wagner wanders into the plot wearing an industrial-strength suntan and gold medallion - sign-language for 'bigshot film producer' - one senses the entire movie sinking slowly into oblivion. Lee deserves a good film. His legend is among the weirdest of modern times: even his gift for early mortality (he died at 32) being handed on dynastically to his actor son Brandon, shot dead this year by mysterious accident on a film set. But Dragon is not a biopic, more a large glossy PR brochure punched with sprocket-holes. Once Upon A Forest is about a hedgehog, mole and mouse who trek across a forest poisoned by a chemical spill to find medicinal herbs for a dying badger. It is - you guessed - an animated feature. But 'animated' hardly seems the mot juste for this latest eco-lecture from the industry that brought us FernGully: The Last Rain Forest. Winsomely characterised, dully scored, it relies on two guest voices - Michael Crawford's as old Cornelius Badger and Ben Vereen as a hot-gospelling marsh bird - to kick it into life for two brief song-and-dance numbers. Better is Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Here the guest voices are Don Ameche, Michael J Fox and Sally Fox, dubbing real not cartoon animals. Two dogs and a cat, sundered from their human owners, set out home across hundreds of miles of danger-infested Sierra Nevada. For dumb animals, they deal in a lot of smart dialogue. 'I hate fast food' cracks the Fox dog as a breakfast-earmarked rabbit hightails out of his reach. But then 30 years have gone by since Disney first filmed this story, based on Sheila Burnford's novel. We now have an entire generation of streetwise, short-attention-span brats who if the animals do not talk will probably rush straight from the cinema and back to their Nintendo games. What would Professor Noam Chomsky, prophet of our communications era and America's favourite thorn-in-the-side radical, make of it all? Find out in Manufacturing Consent. I found this 2 3/4 -hour docu-portrait riveting even though I disagree with nearly all Chomsky's views. The film has been seen before on TV, but not at this uncut, unexpurgated and wholly unboring length.</p>

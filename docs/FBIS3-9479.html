			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sead Cusovic report from the Information Service of the 1st </F> Army Corps]    [Text] The day today fully resembles all the previous  days, because the aggressor has continued violating the  cease-fire as he has done since the conclusion of the agreement.  So, at about 1700, one of our fellow citizens was wounded in  Brijesce. She was attacked with a sower of death [M-84 machine  gun] from the direction of Bacici.    Chetnik provocations with infantry weapons were also  registered in the regions of Glavica, Brekin Potok, and Hotonj.  Cumulative mortars were used near Vrbanja Most. Stup was  attacked with portable mortars from the enemy positions.    The so-called cease-fire should therefore not instill too  much certainty to the residents of Sarajevo. They are advised to  continue exercising caution.</p>

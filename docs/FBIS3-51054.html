Will It Bear Fruit?"]    [Text] Hanoi, 3 Jan (PL) -- It began as a rumor in the  media, growing in intensity as Washington officials were cited.  There is a lot of rumbling this time about the eventual lifting  of the economic embargo against Vietnam. But the question  remains: Will it really bear fruit?    Three influential U.S. publications -- TIME, THE WASHINGTON  POST, and THE NEW YORK TIMES -- have revealed that William  Clinton's administration is going to lift the U.S. economic  blockade of Hanoi in effect for almost 20 years.    Here in Vietnam there has been no official reaction. A  Foreign Ministry source consulted by PRENSA LATINA reiterated  today that they are following the matter with attention but  without too many expectations.    A "secret document" might suddenly surface reporting on U.S.  prisoners of war being held in dark, underground cells and then  the screw would be tightened again, added the official, who  preferred to remain anonynmous.    But the truth is that this time there are auspicious  indications in the air. Gary Ackerman, president of the U.S.  House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, has said  that there is no doubt that the embargo is about to end.    Ackerman added that it is only a matter of time and asserted  that in the coming weeks his government will study several  alternatives to further ease economic restrictions or to  eliminate them completely.    Everything revolves around a document submitted by Winston  Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific  affairs, who, after visiting Vietnam last December, recommended  "that something be done urgently to reciprocate for Hanoi's  cooperation in searching for missing soldiers (MIA-POW)."    In the last report issued in Hanoi by the Pentagon group in  charge of the 2,200 MIA-POW (servicemen missing in  action-prisoners of war) [preceding seven words in English]  files, Colonel John Gray highlighted Vietnam's extensive  cooperation and observed that the normalization of bilateral  relations would help expedite these investigations.    Nevertheless, the syndrome of defeat in the Indochina  conflagration and the manipulation of the sensitive MIA-POW  issue has divided U.S. public opinion.    A poll by THE NEW YORK TIMES indicated that only 41 percent  of the U.S. population believes now is an opportune time to end  economic restrictions and renew diplomatic ties.    According to NEWSWEEK, the White House's tenant is facing  another important decision that will be as difficult as the  ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.    Clinton, who promised to revitalize the country's economy,  has set his sights on the flourishing Asia-Pacific region,  precisely because the southeastern area of this region has  exhibited one of the world's most dynamic growth patterns.    Vietnam is on the verge of entering the powerful ASEAN. It  currently enjoys observer status in this organization and has  been strengthening its ties with forum members: Malaysia,  Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and Brunei.    While just the hint of a possible end to the economic  blockade of Hanoi conjured up a storm in Washington, in the  Asian country itself U.S. companies are trying to gain a  foothold in the already complex competition in a market that  which was until recently untouched.    Meanwhile, the lobbying continues at the White House.  Clinton is once again being pressured from all sides. Here in  Hanoi people ask themselves if the old adage -- much ado about  nothing -- will again prevail.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS AND TERRORISM;  </P> <P> DOES SAFETY OR PRINCIPLE COME FIRST?  </P> <P> At Dutton's Books in North Hollywood, owner Davis Dutton had his full-time  workers vote a few days ago to decide whether "The Satanic Verses" should be  swept from the shelves.  </P> <P> Without hesitation, they voted unanimously to thumb their noses at the  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his fundamentalist Islamic followers in Iran  who have threatened to kill author Salman Rushdie and anyone associated with  the publication of the book. The book, when copies were available, would be for  sale at Dutton's.  </P> <P> "They were most adamant in their espousal of free speech and First Amendment  rights," Dutton said. "I was somewhat taken aback by the vehemence of their  reaction."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unprecedented Challenge  </P> <P> Just as the U.S. government has insisted -- with notable deviations -- on a  policy of rejecting the demands of terrorists, Dutton and many independent  booksellers across the country have stood on principle in the wake of the  unprecedented challenge against Rushdie's book.  </P> <P> But for most large companies, the balance between taking a stand and defending  their workers' safety in the modern age of terrorism is far more ambiguous.  </P> <P> In fact, security experts say it actually is the much-criticized reaction of  the large bookstore chains, which cited fears for employee safety and initially  rushed to pull Rushdie's novel from their shelves, that better typifies  American business' response to terrorist threats.  </P> <P> At the root of their wariness is not the fear of huge court verdicts if they  fail to take precautions, experts say; attacks on employees by the world's  growing supply of extremists are covered by, of all things, the workers'  compensation system.  </P> <P> Rather, concern for a firm's public image and its employees' morale has  prompted employers to put security first and principle second when compromise  can preserve the safety of the work force, even if that invites more threats.  </P> <P> Not incidentally, most want to be seen as taking a morally responsible stance.  </P> <P> "The safety of the individual is paramount," said Robert R. Kierce, a  London-based security official for Trans World Airlines who is chairman of the  terrorism committee of the American Society for Industrial Security, a national  group of corporate security and safety officials.  </P> <P> Some threats are shrugged off, usually without consequence. One study, Kierce  said, found that of 50,000 threats against airliners, none was genuine.  </P> <P> But if a threat materializes and those hurt or endangered can argue that all  possible precautions were not taken, the impact on a business can be huge.  </P> <P> Witness the debate over whether employees and passengers on Pan American World  Airways Flight 103, blown up Dec. 21 over Scotland, should have been notified  of threats aimed at flights from Frankfurt, West Germany, to the United States.  </P> <P> Survivors of some of the 270 people killed after the plane exploded have argued  that the airline or the U.S. government should have let all passengers -- not  just workers in one or two American embassies -- know of the potential risks of  taking such flights. Government and airline officials responded that the threat  was too vague to justify broad notice.  </P> <P> Similarly, no company would want to find itself in the position of Hipercor, a  store in downtown Barcelona, Spain. More than 30 people were hurt when a bomb  exploded one afternoon in June, 1987. Employees said a warning had been called  to the store two hours earlier, but managers decided to ignore it because many  previous threats had gone unrealized.  </P> <P> So most large firms, aided by costly consultants and armed with expansive  contingency plans, adopt a policy of proceeding with an abundance of caution in  the face of threatened bombings, kidnapings, assassinations or sabotage,  specialists say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Responsible to Employees  </P> <P> "We have responsibilities to our employees," said Alan M. Nutes, a Wall Street  stock brokerage security chief who heads the industrial security society's  disaster management committee.  </P> <P> Nutes said he would prefer to shut down his firm's trading floor and "take the  hit of a client not being able to do some buys and trades, rather than having  one of my employees killed by something going off."  </P> <P> Legally, the company's exposure is not so great, attorneys say. If an employee  is blown up on the job by a terrorist bomb, his survivors' only recourse is to  the relatively limited pay outs of the workers' compensation system, just as if  he'd lost his hand to a drill press or died in a ditch cave-in.  </P> <P> Thus, passengers on an airplane subjected to attack can pursue civil lawsuits  against an air carrier that may not have taken every step to prevent a  hijacking, but the pilots and flight attendants cannot, said Matthew Finucane,  director of air safety for the Assn. of Flight Attendants.  </P> <P> "In terms of an employer failing to take the proper precautions during the  course of a flight, whether you're dealing with the weather or with a  terrorist, you would be hard-pressed to get around workers' comp," Finucane  said.  </P> <P> But many other considerations beyond the potential for huge lawsuits must be  weighed as a company considers its response to a fanatic or criminal threat.  </P> <P> Will ignoring a threat from Islamic extremists spur boycotts of the firm's  products in Arab markets? Will shareholders back home rebel if a giant ransom  is paid to free a captive executive? Will an employee ever again accept a  foreign posting if the ransom isn't paid? What is the company's civic  responsibility in the face of a threat? And what will the consuming public  think, whichever course is taken?  </P> <P> "There's always a balancing act," said Richard T. Guilmette, director of  corporate security and safety for Prime Computer Inc. in Natick, Mass.  </P> <P> Many large companies have sought to minimize their chances of facing an  extremist challenge by quietly developing plans to protect top executives.  </P> <P> David L. Berger, a Los Angeles security consultant, said it is not unusual for  executives based in the United States to be driven to work in bulletproof cars  by chauffeurs trained in escape techniques. Their children may be escorted to  and from school. Their homes may include a steel-lined "safe area" filled with  food and communications gear that can serve as a haven against attack.  </P> <P> "Every day in the lives of these executives is somehow pre-planned by these  protective services," Berger said. "It's like having your own Secret Service.  Then, when they go overseas, it gets worse."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, access to large companies' facilities has been tightened. High-tech  devices check employees' fingerprints, shoot light beams into their eyes or  listen to their voice patterns to keep intruders out.  </P> <P> Smaller firms may not have considered the risks as carefully, experts note. At  his North Hollywood bookstore, for instance, Dutton has only begun thinking  about whether security needs to be tightened in the wake of his workers'  decision to sell "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> "I guess we should be prepared for some kind of an incident," he sighed. "I'm  just hoping nothing will happen."  </P> <P> (The B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble chains reversed themselves Wednesday and  said they will restock the novel, but Waldenbooks said it would sell it to  customers only on request.)  </P> <P> When all the precautions have proven inadequate, however, one of the toughest  decisions a company must make is deciding whether to invite further threats by  responding to a terrorist demand, experts say.  </P> <P> Government policy is clear (if not always followed, as the Iran-Contra affair  underscored): No negotiations with terrorists, because to do so simply  encourages more threats.  </P> <P> "Governments say, 'We have to protect our sovereignty and we can't be pushed  around by gunmen waving Kalashnikovs," said Peter Cheney, vice president for  North American operations of Control Risks Ltd., a London-based security  consulting firm.  </P> <P> Private industry, however, tends to place the safe resolution of an immediate  threat first, leaving the longer-term ramifications to be dealt with later,  Cheney and other experts agreed.  </P> <P> Thus, many large multinational companies keep funds on hand to ransom overseas  executives. Airlines try to talk hijackers off planes. Employers evacuate  buildings in response to even vague bomb threats. And consumer product firms  recall huge batches of goods at the hint of tampering.  </P> <P> The decision is never easy. "If you evacuate every time you have a bomb threat,  the chances are you will have more bomb threats," said John D. Case, a security  consultant in San Diego. "If you don't evacuate, you always have the problem of  somebody actually doing something, and you have to live with that threat  hanging over your head."  </P> <P> Nutes knows well the pitfalls. When he was in the military, one of the  installations at which he was responsible for security fell victim to 152 bomb  threats in a single month. Over and over he ordered evacuations. But no bomb  ever exploded.  </P> <P> "It turned out it was a 9-year-old girl who didn't want to go to school," Nutes  recalled. "By reacting the way the person wanted us to, it just enhanced their  will to do it more."  </P></p>

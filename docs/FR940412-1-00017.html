			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Supported scaffolds and scaffold components shall be inspected for visible defects periodically and after any occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity. Suspension scaffolds and scaffold components shall be inspected for visible defects immediately after installation prior to their first use; periodically thereafter (preferably before each use); and after any occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This language does not specify who is to perform the inspection or what qualifications that person must possess, nor does it specify how frequently inspections must occur. The Agency sought public comment in these matters for both supported and suspension scaffolds in Issue 13 of the proposal. In that issue the Agency stated incorrectly that the proposed rule required supported scaffolds and scaffold components to be inspected for visible defects prior to each workshift and after any occurrence which could affect the scaffold's structural integrity. The Agency intended all scaffolds and scaffold components to be inspected for visible defects prior to each workshift. However, proposed paragraph &sect;1915.252(d)(3) simply expresses a preference for inspection before each use. The Agency also sought public comment on whether the scaffold inspector should be an engineer, a qualified person, or a capable person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received three comments (Exs. 6&hyph;1, 6&hyph;3, and 6&hyph;7) in response to Issue 13. Two of these commenters (Exs. 6&hyph;1 and 6&hyph;3) stated that the proposed rule uses specification-oriented language and is unnecessarily restrictive, and that a thorough inspection before each workshift would be impossible and expensive. These two commenters added that existing rule &sect;1915.71(b)(5), which requires that scaffolds be maintained in a safe and secure condition and that defective components be replaced, is performance-oriented and has caused the industry to implement effective programs to ensure safe scaffolds. They recommended the retention of existing &sect;1915.71(b)(5), and that proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3) not be included in the final rule. The other commenter (Ex. 6&hyph;7) stated that ``[s]caffolds should be inspected by a capable person during and immediately after the system is anchored. Thereafter, the system should be inspected daily by the employees using the system.'' This commenter added that the proposed frequency of inspections adequately reflects current shipyard practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA does not believe that proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3) is unnecessarily restrictive. To the contrary, OSHA is concerned that proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3) and existing &sect;1915.71(b)(5) might not adequately address the hazards associated with the use of unsafe scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency seeks public comment on the adequacy of proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3), and on the appropriateness of replacing proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3) with the following language, which is the same as the corresponding proposed requirement for scaffolds used in the construction industry (51 FR 42706, November 25, 1986) except that ``competent person'' has been changed to ``qualified person'' (see discussion of Item B, above): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Scaffolds and scaffold components shall be inspected for visible defects by a qualified person prior to each work shift, and after any occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Correction to Proposed &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The word ``not'' was inadvertently dropped from paragraph &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) when proposed subpart N was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (53 FR 48207, November 29, 1988). Due to a typographic error, proposed &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) Counterweights shall be removed from a scaffold until the scaffold is disassembled. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble discussion for proposed &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) (53 FR 48188) clearly states that OSHA intended to prohibit the removal of counterweights until the scaffold is disassembled. In addition, the Agency notes that the corresponding provision in proposed part 1926, subpart L (&sect;1926.451(b)(18)(iv)) states that ``counterweights shall not be removed&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' Proposed paragraph &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) should have read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) Counterweights shall  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  be removed from a scaffold until the scaffold is disassembled (emphasis added). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA seeks public comment on the appropriateness of the proposed provision as corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Performance of Electric Welding Operations From Suspension Scaffolds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA raised the issue of the regulation of electric welding on suspension scaffolds in Issue 2 of the NPRM (53 FR 46197). The Agency asked for input on six precautions that might reduce the possibility of the welding current arcing through the wire rope when welding is performed by employees on suspension scaffolds. OSHA received only one response to Issue 2. That commenter (Ex. 6&hyph;7) stated that the use of welding equipment on suspended platforms has not caused any safety hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the issue of welding work performed while on scaffolds, OSHA seeks public comment on the following provisions that are being considered for inclusion in the final rule. These requirements are the same as those found in section 6.2.9 of ANSI A10.8&hyph;1988 except that in paragraph (b) the term ``unit'' has been changed to ``scaffold'' so that the language clearly indicates the Agency's intent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To reduce the possibility of the welding current arcing through the suspension wire rope during the course of welding from suspension scaffolds, the following precautions shall be taken:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) An insulated thimble shall be used to attach each suspension wire rope to its hanging support (such as cornice hook or outrigger). Excess suspension wire rope and any additional independent lines from grounding shall be insulated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The suspension wire rope shall be covered with insulating materials at least 4 feet (1.22 m) above the hoist. In the event a tail line exists below the hoist, it shall be insulated to prevent contact with the platform. The portion of the tail line that hangs free below the scaffold shall be guided or retained, or both, so that it does not become grounded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Each hoist shall be covered with protective cover made from insulating materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In addition to a work lead attachment required by the welding process, a grounding conductor shall be connected from the scaffold to the structure. The size of this conductor shall be equal to or greater than the size of the welding process work lead and shall not be in series with the welding process or the work piece.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If the scaffold grounding lead is disconnected at any time, the welding machine shall be shut off.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

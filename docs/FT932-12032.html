			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Brazilian bank fury on rates BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco is facing a central bank rebellion over his plan to reduce interest rates, the main feature of his economic package announced last weekend. Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, the bank's governor, is said by associates to be considering resigning in protest at Mr Franco's announcement, made with no prior consultation, of an interest rate cut to stimulate growth. Cancelling a planned visit to Washington where he was due to participate in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, Mr Ximenes and his team have spent all week fending off presidential pressure for a cut in interest rates, up till now the government's principal weapon against inflation. Central bank officials argue that real interest rates have already fallen from last year's average 35 per cent to 27 per cent this year. Mr Franco has sought to cast the financial sector as the main villains in the fight against inflation and is accusing the central bank of collaborating with the traders. The uncertainty caused by the conflicting statements emerging from different parts of the government is provoking enormous volatility on financial markets, with interest rates fluctuating wildly and a flight to gold and dollars.

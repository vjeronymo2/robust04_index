			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: A serious cooker, for serious cooks - A kitchen range that is popular with enthusiastic home chefs ALL THOSE doomsters who predicted that the family meal was endangered, that the great warming roasts and casseroles of yesteryear would be nothing more than a nostalgic memory, might like to know that they were wrong - the market for serious cookers grows bigger every year. How do I know? I know because ever since La Cornue, the cult cooker for serious cooks, was introduced into this country in 1989, other manufacturers have been rushing to copy them. After La Cornue, we got Rosieres, with its Bocuse oven; the Viking range from America; Morice from France with its enamelled ovens; Gaggenau with its large hobs and double ovens; and New World started offering double ovens and extra cooking units. All were aiming to fulfil the longing for what marketing men now call 'hobby cookers.' Hobby cookers, are what young professionals and family-minded keen cooks, are looking for. They are no-nonsense, fine-looking, machines. Although they were way beyond the price most ordinary families would dream of paying, keen cooks, it seems, were prepared to pay for something that they saw as central to their domestic lives. Hobby cooks are attracted by the almost industrial look, robust styling, beautiful workmanship, and fine finishes coupled with large capacity, high power and fine precision. When La Cornue first came out, few could afford it. Each cooker was made to individual specification and at anything up to Pounds 8,000 or Pounds 10,000 a time the cooker was clearly beyond the reach of all but the most fanatical or affluent. Which is why Eddie Cottrell of importers Fourneaux de France, approached a manufacturer in Burgundy to come up with Ambassade, a range of what he calls 'semi-professional stoves' at much more accessible prices. They have much of the same charm as La Cornue - generous lines, the expansive air of being a source of carefully-tended gregarious meals as well as the technical capacity to produce them. There are two ovens, both large enough to take the most well-fed of turkeys; one is a convection electric one, the other a static electric oven with grill. The hob has five high-powered gas burners (which can bring a 5-litre pan of cold water to the oil in under 10 minutes) and it comes with pan stands which enables the cook to cook across the whole surface. There are removable cast-iron simmering plates which keep sauces at precisely the right temperature, as well as griddle plates (so you can char-grill your vegetables as well as any sassy restaurant) saute pans and steamers which fit across the burners. There is also a mijotage pan which sits over the large burner and fits in the oven - ideal for braising when you need first to brown on top of the cooker and then to finish off slow-cooking in the oven. The basic two oven, five-burner model sells for around Pounds 2,087 - it is photographed above with two add-on modular units (which include a built-in bain marie, a deep fryer and warming ovens) which are around Pounds 700 each. For those who like the sturdy, industrial look but do not need two ovens, there is a single oven (but capacious with two fans and two sets of elements) version which sells for Pounds 1,873. Anyone interested in the cooker can telephone the Fourneaux de France showroom at 62 Westbourne Grove, London W2 5SH on 071-792-0991 and arrange a demonstration. So much for the technicalities, what about something a little more personal? Sophie Mirman and Richard Ross (once of Sock Shop fame, now happily running the children's mini-stores Trotters in London's King's Road and Kensington High Street) have been the contented owners of an Ambassade for three months. 'We love it dearly,' says Richard. 'We both cook and we were looking for something for a country kitchen, something a little bit special. We like its rugged looks, we think it is very beautiful and very luxurious and at the same time it is wonderful to cook on. It's quite hard to keep it clean but we find it's worth it.'</p>

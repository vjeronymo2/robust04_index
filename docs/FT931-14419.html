			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Delay for equality in senior jobs forecast WOMEN will need at least 25 years to achieve equality in British management according to Lady Howe, who chairs Opportunity 2000, the private-sector initiative to promote the position of women in industry. Lady Howe, speaking at the launch of an initiative to promote flexible working among managers, was responding to critics of Opportunity 2000 who say it has been insufficiently forceful in changing attitudes. She said attitudes were gradually changing and 'macho' management was becoming rarer - but she added that it would still take 25 years for women to achieve equality with men. A survey on flexible work for managers found 76 per cent of respondents cited childcare responsibilities as their reason for seeking part-time or flexible work. The survey was sponsored by National Westminster Bank. Mr Martin Gray, chief executive of the bank's branch business, said new ways of working need not damage performance and that companies benefit from retaining qualified staff. He said 1,200 staff and managers at NatWest either work part-time, share a job or work from home, and that 120 people had applied for the last management job that involved working from home. Ms Helen Dawson of the Local Government Management Board warned that momentum towards more flexible working in local government had been lost because of pressures associated with contracting-out.</p>

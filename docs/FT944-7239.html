			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Direct Line soars amid price war fears Fears about the impact of an insurance premium price war hit Direct Line, the UK's largest private motor insurer, yesterday in spite of a doubling in its pre-tax profits. Shares in the company's parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland, fell 17 1/2 p to 425p after Direct Line admitted fierce competition had led to a slight fall in its operating efficiency. Mr Peter Wood, the chief executive who founded Direct Line in 1985, emphasised the company's progress in building on customer base by selling personal loans and mortgages. City analysts were disappointed at lower-than-expected growth in the number of motor and household policies sold by Direct Line and suggested competitive pressures affecting all insurance companies meant its profits growth would slow. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 110.1m in the year to September - up from Pounds 50.2m last time. The latest figure includes the Pounds 21.4m payment last January to Mr Wood after he was bought out by the Royal Bank of Scotland and placed on a salary. Several leading City securities houses cut profit forecasts for next year to about Pounds 130m-Pounds 140m. 'In a competitive, cyclical market, companies like this must eventually have cyclical earnings,' said Mr Trevor May, insurance analyst at BZW. Direct Line said competitive pressures, marketing expenses and investment in improving accidental damage management, had led to a 'marginal' increase in its expenses-to-premiums ratio. Total premiums written rose to Pounds 608.2m from Pounds 409.5m. Direct Line also announced plans for its first expansion outside the UK  - a joint venture with Bankinter, the Spanish bank. Mr Wood described Spain's motor insurance sector as similar to the UK's a decade ago and he expected a 'substantial' market share within a few years. But he acknowledged Direct Line's new venture would not make profits for some time. The company's mortgage and personal loans operations were not included in this year's results. Its life insurance operations start trading early next year. Direct Line will begin pilot sales of a range of retail savings products next February or March and plans a launch three months later. The Bank of England plans to authorise it as a deposit-taker. A certain lack of drive, Page 18; Lex, Page 20</p>

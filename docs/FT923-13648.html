			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Germans may raise discount rate in tightening of monetary policy A FEVERISH debate is under way among members of the Bundesbank's central council about whether and how to tighten monetary policy when they meet next Thursday. Some tightening, which would upset Germany's European trading partners so soon after the Munich summit, is almost certain because of deep concern in the Bundesbank at the rapid increase in money supply, fuelled by credit growth. However, an increase in the internationally-sensitive Lombard rate, which at 9.75 per cent has set the effective floor for official interest rates in the European Monetary System since December, is not at present being considered. Instead the debate centres on a possible increase in the discount rate, which since December has been 8 per cent - its highest level since the 1930s - or a limitation of the amount of money banks can borrow from the Bundesbank against collateral at the Lombard rate. The former option has been canvassed by some of the powerful anti-inflation hawks among Germany's regional central bankers, including Mr Lothar Muller, president of the state central bank of Bavaria. It is thought that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, favours limiting banks' access to Lombard credit. The Bundesbank is being driven to further action because there are no signs that the present high level of German interest rates is damping down money supply growth and because of its deep disquiet at the way government-subsidised credits for rebuilding eastern Germany are seemingly being diverted to fuel consumption. Under a long-standing arrangement, next Thursday's council meeting is due to carry out the Bundesbank's traditional mid-year review of money supply trends. With the latest month's statistics showing annual growth of about 9 per cent in M3, the Bundesbank's chosen aggregate, against an annual target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent, members feel that the occasion cannot pass without a determined signal to the government and the German people that the Bundesbank is serious about wanting to cut inflation. Mr Muller has suggested the council should send a stiff warning to the government about its failure to cut subsidised credits and other subsidies and publicise this decision after the meeting. He is deeply sceptical whether the Bonn government's recently-announced plans to curb public sector borrowing and spending are tough enough. It is impossible to predict exactly what the Bundesbank council will do. Council members will still be making final assessments of the latest monetary trends next week while the D-Mark's recent strength could persuade some that only modest monetary tightening is needed. An increase in the discount rate could be portrayed in this light. The rate is less important internationally than the Lombard rate and yet it influences some domestic consumer and business borrowing costs. However, a discount rate increase would also have a psychological impact and could therefore spill over into the foreign exchange market giving the D-Mark a further boost. Any such development would create tensions in the EMS and cause dismay among Germany's partners where impatience with high German interest rates is growing.</p>

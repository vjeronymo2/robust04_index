			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (5): Legislation may end easy life - Regulation The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) have lived a fairly sheltered first decade. Hived off from AT&amp;T upon the divestiture of 'Ma Bell' in 1984, they retained their local monopolies while AT&amp;T slogged it out in the long-distance market with MCI, Sprint and others. Benefiting from generous access payments from the long- distance carriers on the one hand, and guaranteed minimum rates of return by state regulators on the other, they have had an easy and affluent decade. Some have had it better than others, depending largely on the relationship with their local state regulators. But none has faced competitive challenges on a par with AT&amp;T in the long-distance market. That looks set to change. Legislation now before Congress, which appears likely to pass into law, would repeal the cable-telephone cross-ownership rules, allow the RBOCs to compete in the long-distance market, pre-empt state laws that prohibit entry into local telephone networks (so that local phone competition becomes federal policy), and compel the RBOCs and other local operators - of which there are more than 1,000, most of them tiny - to provide newcomers with equal access to, and inter-connection with, their networks. For the RBOCs the key legislation is the Markey-Fields Bill covering local access, which would enforce local competition, allow RBOCs to buy cable cable systems outside their areas and upgrade them for telephony, while banning them from buying cable systems within their service areas. They would, however, be allowed to upgrade their existing networks to offer broadband services - very likely in competition with another broadband local operator. Assuming that the legislation passes, the RBOCs are more or less obliged to pursue three policies. First, to upgrade their existing networks to offer broadband services. Second, to enter into partnerships with cable companies to offer broadband services elsewhere. And third, to cut costs as fast as possible, since however friendly their existing state regulators may be, they will need to be lean and fit for the competition around the corner. Accordingly, in the past few months virtually all the RBOCs have announced large investment programmes, swingeing job cuts (70,000 jobs have gone in the last year), and deals - accomplished or prospective - with cable and/or entertainment companies to develop broadband. Even as it announced the breakdown of its TCI venture, Bell Atlantic stressed its continued commitment to cable alliances working to the same end. It is not enough to build alliances. A complex process of cable franchise dealing will also be necessary because of the patchwork nature of existing cable operations. Los Angeles alone has 40 cable companies while Chicago has 115 franchises. Says Mr Tim Brian, a planning director at Jones Cable, a cable operator covering 2m homes: 'Almost our entire strategy is to expand, to exchange franchises and to achieve rationality and critical mass by clustering our networks.' Take US West, the Denver-based RBOC covering 14 western states. Last month the company announced plans to build a fibre and coaxial network at the rate of 500,000 customers a year from next year. Company strategists insist the investment is not just about broadband. It would be needed in any case to increase network flexibility and the services offered to traditional phone customers. Last year US West bought 25 per cent of Time Warner Entertainment for Dollars 2.5bn in a complex deal that will enable Time Warner, the second largest cable operator after TCI, to upgrade its existing systems and give US West the opening to export its telecoms know-how to sizeable networks in 15 cities (against the six in which US West currently operates). Significantly, it is Time Warner's cable networks, not its entertainment wares, that US West wanted most urgently. The RBOCs' first priority is to go for each other's core business and that of the cable companies not allied to them, although in the process they will be building networks able to carry a new range of services. Says Mr Chuck Lillis, US West's chief planning officer: 'The Time Warner deal is essentially about giving us more networks. Of course, they've also got the best studios in the country, and the longer you go out in time, the more it is about having access to their programming and products.' However, the regulatory changes are as much evolutionary as revolutionary. For all the RBOCs, competition is already a fact of life in the business market because of the activities, permitted in most states, of 'competitive access providers' (Caps) who offer direct fibre links to the long-distance carriers for larger businesses in cities. Ameritech, for one, insists that nearly half of its revenue is already subject to competition. MFS, the most aggressive and successful of the Caps, provides a local fibre service to businesses in 14 cities and has plans to move into another nine soon. Its ambitions do not stop there. It has just started a switched local exchange service in New York, which it expects to extend it to all of its US networks later this year. 'We're not content with being a Cap,' says Mr Royce Holland, MFS president. 'We want to be co-carriers with the RBOCs, serving all businesses - and we intend to be in 60 to 65 cities in the US within three years.' MFS competes on price and quality, with the second often the more important. 'In our most successful markets - New York, Chicago and Washington - high capacity private circuits are often being sold below cost at the moment,' claims Mr Holland. 'But our reliability makes us attractive to businesses that can't afford delays and failures.' The RBOCs have not been slow to take up the Cap challenge. Mr Richard Jalkut, chief executive of Nynex's New York operations, estimates that the Caps have taken about 60 per cent of his New York private-line business. 'They have turned us upside down,' he concedes. 'We are doing things now which we had convinced ourselves three or four years ago were impossible.' These include the provision of 1.5 MBit circuits within 24 hours, which a few years ago used to take Nynex six months. 'It has cost us a lot of revenue, because we have had to bypass ourselves in the dial-tone (public switched service) business, but the market is growing at an incredible rate and we are holding our own with new products.' Nynex has been a notably innovative operator in terms of products. In 1992, the New York business launched a proprietary software product - Enterprise - giving businesses direct control over their own network construction. Mr Jalkut claims it has started to reverse the loss of market share to the CAPs. It is taking the same approach to the residential market, ahead of competition. Last year it was the first RBOC to launch a voice-dialling service, and has a host of new services up its sleeve. As for costs, back in 1973 New York Telephone had 125,000 employees. Now it has 39,000 and there will be 30,000 in five years. 'It's no longer a question of what the regulator will let you get away with on your cost base,' says Mr Jalkut. 'It's what your competitors' costs are. Unless you can beat them, you're sunk.' Another element must be added to the equation - the entry of the long-distance carriers to the local business, from which they were excluded a decade ago. MCI, the second largest has already jumped in with an announcement of a Dollars 20bn investment over six years to build local networks. AT&amp;T is also there already, through its purchase last year of McCaw Cellular, one of the largest mobile operators, which it is rapidly integrating into its mainstream service offerings.</p>

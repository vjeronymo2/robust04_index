			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: The frontiers we are left to explore - Four books which find new areas of discovery TRAVELS IN THE PURSUIT OF MONEY by Douglas Kennedy Harper Collins Pounds 14.99, 207 pages FORGOTTEN FATHERLAND: THE SEARCH FOR ELIZABETH NIETZSCHE by Ben Macintyre Macmillan Pounds 17.50, 256 pages WALL TO WALL: FROM BEIJING TO BERLIN BY RAIL by Mary Morris Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 259 pages THE DUKE OF PUDDLE DOCK by Nigel Barley Viking Pounds 16.99, 276 pages IN VERY different but equally successful ways these four books disprove the notion that there is nowhere fresh to travel for exploration and adventure. Simply travelling up the Orinoco by dugout canoe is no longer enough - there must be a point beyond casual adventurism. What is left to discover is a sense of history, and an understanding of the self. Douglas Kennedy prefers to explore a metaphorical rather than literal jungle, tracking down the semi-wild beasts who inhabit the trading floors of the London, New York, Budapest, Sydney, Casablanca and Singapore bourses. As a man who admits to being regularly short of the readies, Kennedy is fascinated by those who spend the bulk of their lives making fortunes through the high-stress, high-fallout business of trading bonds, futures and other securities. He discovers that the majority of his encounters are with sad people who vaguely sense that they are missing out, though what it is they are missing neither they nor Kennedy quite pins down. Perhaps they would have been even more unhappy without their fabulous wealth? In any case, although Kennedy chases mammon with vigour, the god's secret mysteries entirely evade both him - and the reader. The traveller who craves discomfort, difficulty and oddness is faced with an ever-shrinking world. But in desperate times one can always head towards Asuncion, Paraguay's steamy capital. Ben Macintyre tracks down the squalid remains of the anti-semitic colony established by Elisabeth Nietzsche (sister to Friedrich) and her suicidal husband, Bernhard Forster in 1886, hundreds of kilometres north of Asuncion. There, at a spot they called New Germany, the pathetic handful of social misfit would-be colonists tried to eke out a living in a jungle which seemed to permit only one crop - yerba, the leaves of which are infused to create a mildly intoxicant tea. But an uncomfortable trip up the Paraguay river to find the crumbs of a 100-year-old settlement of crazies would be thin stuff; what gives the book the extra frisson is the Nazi claim that the philosopher Nietzsche inspired the national socialist movement. Friedrich Nietzsche's hatred of anti-semitism is well-documented by earlier writers and Macintyre has no really new light to throw on that issue. But he carefully tracks the steps of Elisabeth Nietzsche, a thoroughly sycophantic charlatan and fraudster, and he writes with grace and humour. When he finally arrives in New Germany he discovers a profound irony; despite once having provided sanctuary for Hitler's eugenics expert, Josef Mengele, the colony's determined in-breeding has produced drooling half-wits, hastening its extinction. In the course of travelling across the Soviet Union by train from Beijing in 1986 Mary Morris hears of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Intent on tracking down the spot near Kiev where her grandparents lived, Morris abandons that when she realises she is pregnant. She then continues her train journey through Poland and into a pre-united Berlin. Suspicious readers might, from that sketch, imagine we are into the special preserve of personal psychotherapy via Rough Guides to former socialism. But that is unfair to what proves to be a memorably touching documentary of a woman's brave decision to travel alone in very difficult places. Morris has some ghosts to exorcise, and she does so with remarkably clean, polished prose. Along the way there is a collection of useful reminders of the infuriating bureaucratic pains - as well as rare pleasures - involved in travelling off the beaten track. Besides being assistant keeper for north and west Africa at London's Museum of Mankind, Nigel Barley is clearly a humorist manque. His excuse for a romp through Indonesia and Malaysia is to track the steps of Sir Stamford Raffles, who added to his explorations of Java and Singapore the founding of London Zoo - all before he died, aged 45, in 1826. But like Morris, Barley is as concerned to explore current society and his reactions to it as to delve into the past. His putative subject - Raffles - is not something to be fixed in place like a dead moth, but wriggles and twists beneath the probing pin, changing according to circumstances and viewpoint. The pleasure of all four books is that they do not just record history; they capture it moving beneath our feet.</p>

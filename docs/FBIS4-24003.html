			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Tome Igreje in Beira] </F>   [Excerpts] Thousands of Beira residents received Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] leader Afonso Dhlakama at the Beira  Airport today. In a meeting with local journalists shortly  after his arrival coming from Maringue, Afonso Dhlakama said the  aim of his visit to Sofala Province was to familiarize himself  with the main problems facing the people as well as to determine  what they would want to see done after the October elections.    [Begin Dhlakama recording] Well, I am here to visit Sofala  Province, because I have already visited other provinces. I am  here to familiarize myself with the political situation. I am  here to greet the people, to guarantee the introduction of the  democratization process. I am here to determine what the people  want after elections. [end recording]    We also asked Afonso Dhlakama to comment on delays observed  in the voter registration process in areas under his control  here in Sofala Province.    [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I think the process has begun  to  take off. As you are aware, it was only a few weeks ago that  State Administration Minister Aguiar Mazula visited Maringue,  Inhaminga, Muanza, and other areas to swear in our  administrators. I think the voter registration process will now  move forward. People in those areas must register as voters,  because only those in possession of voter registration cards can  vote.    [Unidentified correspondent] Any comment on the manner you  were received at the Beira Airport?    [Dhlakama] [Words indistinct] you gentlemen of the press  will  remember that when President Chissano arrived here, factories  and schools had to close down to allow thousands of people to  receive the president at the airport. We did not do that.  People came here freely, and this clearly shows that they truly  want to see the Renamo leader, the man who went to the bush and  brought peace, democracy, and hope. These people's future is my  hands. [end recording]    Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama arrived at the Beira Airport  at  about 1200, and he was received by Manuel Pereira, Renamo  political representative in Sofala, and representatives of other  political parties. Also present were dozens of traditional  chiefs. [passage omitted]    During his stay in this province, Afonso Dhlakama is  expected  to visit a number of districts and hold meetings with  businessmen and traditional chiefs. He will also visit the port  of Beira, Munhava Ward, and the Beira Central Hospital.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: MoD boosts army manpower ceiling The Ministry of Defence yesterday bowed to political and military pressure by again raising its ceiling for future army manpower, and announcing plans to buy up to 259 Challenger 2 tanks. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, also committed the government to purchasing new helicopters for the RAF, including the UK-Italian EH101 in which Westland is a partner, and announced that tenders were being invited for up to seven new minehunters. Mr Rifkind told the cross-party Commons defence committee he was setting up a 'defence cost study' to look at ways of reducing the forces' spending on back-up services to meet heavy cuts in the defence budget from 1996. His statement to the committee was aimed at fending off criticism that the financial cuts will damage the forces' fighting capability. Combined cuts over the next three years are estimated at almost Pounds 1.8bn which, compared with previous plans, is significantly larger than forecast. Previous plans had only been made public for the first two of these years, now reduced by Pounds 260m and Pounds 520m respectively. The Pounds 22.79bn provision for 1996/97 is reckoned to be Pounds 1bn less than the MoD had planned. Plans for army strength have changed for the second time this year. In February, Mr Rifkind agreed to increase the mid-1990s target total by 3,000 to 119,000. He said yesterday that front-line units would be strengthened by a further 3,000 personnel. In what he called 'an adjustment of priorities', allowance would be made for an increase in overall manpower if these numbers could not be fully offset by reductions in back-up jobs. Regimental mergers will not be affected. A contract for additional Challenger 2 tanks is to be negotiated with Vickers in preference to earlier plans for updating existing numbers of Challenger 1. About Pounds 800m is thought to be budgeted for the order, which is expected to be concluded next year. Mr Rifkind said the army had opted for a 'smaller but unmixed' tank fleet and hoped the decision would assist Vickers' exports. Some 300 Challenger 1 tanks in service since 1983 will become redundant. Mr Rifkind also announced that contracts would be negotiated to provide the RAF with a mixed support helicopter fleet of EH101s and Boeing Chinooks. The EH101 has so far been ordered only for the navy. Tendering for additional Sandown class minehunters will be restricted to UK yards including Vosper Thornycroft which built the first five of the class. Mr Rifkind said lower expectations for inflation and pay increases would account for Pounds 570m of the planned budgetary savings while the transfer of 69,000 service married quarters to a private-sector housing trust would yield several hundred million pounds. He said he was confident the budget targets for the next two years could be reached without damaging front-line strength.</p>

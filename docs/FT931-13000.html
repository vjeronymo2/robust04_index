			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Legal championof civil rights: Obituary of Thurgood Marshall ONE week ago non-commercial television in the US, commemorating the Martin Luther King national holiday, aired an absorbing dramatisation of one of the Supreme Court's landmark rulings of this century: the 1954 case known as Brown v Board of Education which, in effect, rendered segregation illegal in the nation's public schools. The case had three heroes: Earl Warren, the new chief justice who broke down the deep divisions inside the court and brought about a unanimous verdict: Felix Frankfurter, the legendary justice who for so long agonised which way to vote: and Thurgood Marshall, the black lawyer who argued the case for fundamental change in the law. Mr Marshall, who died on Sunday at the age of 84, was then director of the legal department of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was the architect of its strategy of wringing from the courts the sort of civil rights changes that the political system was still reluctant to grant and the Brown ruling was undoubtedly his finest hour. There were more fine hours to come. In 1961 President Kennedy made him a federal appeals court judge. In 1965 President Johnson appointed him solicitor general, the government's chief advocate before the Supreme Court. Two years later he was accorded the ultimate accolade of nomination to the Supreme Court, the first African-American ever to reach this pinnacle. President Johnson noted that he was one of the most successful advocates ever to appear before the court, winning 29 of 32 cases - 14 as a private lawyer and 18 as solicitor general. Mr Marshall served 24 years on the court, a staunch opponent of the death penalty and limitations on abortion, and believer in affirmative action to improve opportunity for all. He formed with now retired Justice William Brennan a trenchant and intellectually powerful liberal wing, the quality of whose written opinions was widely admired. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush the court acquired a more conservative slant and Mr Marshall became known as 'the great dissenter'. Though increasingly ill, he postponed retirement until 1991 to ensure that the great civil rights legislation in which he had participated was not rolled back. The volume of tributes to Mr Marshall, from President Clinton to Mr William Rehnquist, the current chief justice with whom he so often disagreed, attest to the extraordinary regard in which he was held. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, now a pivotal swing vote on the court, called him 'a true American hero' who had left behind 'a legacy of hope for racial equality'. Thurgood Marshall was born in Baltimore in 1908. Denied admission to the University of Maryland law school because of his race, he graduated top of his class from Howard University, the predominantly black college in Washington. He was to have administered the oath of office to Vice-President Al Gore at last Wednesday's inaugural, but ill health prevented him from attending.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: A bedroom farce turns tragic / Review of Cocteau's 'Les Parents terribles' Jean Cocteau's play Les Parents terribles, as staged by Sean Mathias at the Lyttelton Theatre, represents an unusual genre: the farce with recriminations. Just as the play seems merrily set up as bedroom knockabout, with the requisite sexual confusions and infidelities, its humour is apt to freeze at the source, and a terrible reckoning of the human consequences be forced upon us. Never till the - actually tragic  - end is one sure how far this process is going to go. The balance of misery and witticism, truthfulness and fun, is too fine for comfort. Cocteau wrote the work (apparently in a mere eight days when under the influence of opium) in 1938, and it is not to be confused with his 1929 novel, Les Enfants terribles. Both works were made into films, the latter by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1950, the former by Cocteau himself two years before. The premiere and subsequent revival of the play of Les Parents in Paris were banned as immoral, and it is not hard to see how Cocteau's unsparingly frank analysis of hypocritical and emotionally sterile upper bourgeois life must have genuinely hit its target. The play is built round a central, gallically precise opposition of disorder and order, the mock-gypsy squalor of George and Yvonne's apartment (for Acts 1 and 3) and the clinical austerity of the young woman Madeleine's (for Act 2). The long marriage of the first two has become loveless and suffocating. Yvonne is a semi-invalid who spends all her time in a darkened room and lives only for her son Michael; George a failed inventor whose emotional deprivation has led him into what proves a desperately tangled affair with Madeleine, with whom Michael fall in love passionately. For the ultimate benefit of everyone - a spinster aunt Leonie, who has sacrificed her life for George and Yvonne, completes the tight little cast of five - Michael needs to escape the messy gloom symbolised above all by his incestuously possessive mother, and break into space and light. The contrast between Stephen Brimson Lewis's two sets - a crepuscular tumble of clothes and shoes and bits and pieces versus a modernist realm of sanitary whiteness with its giant spiral staircase - defines the dilemma perfectly. But there proves no way into a shining brave new world in this Pelleas et Melisande of the boulevards. Jeremy Sams has translated the play into a fluent modern English that does not court the dangers of topicality. Its slang ('peachy') is wisely already dated, its manipulation of cliche ('strike while the iron is hot') carefully knowing. There is a useful snippet of Yeats ('rag and bone shop of the heart'); and true to Cocteau, everything that happens is 'unbelievable'. The cast is strong. Sheila Gish as Yvonne is as blanched and consumptive - actually diabetic - as any moribund operatic heroine (the problem for the other characters is that she insists on being one). Her instant overreaction to the sweet reasonableness of Michael's confession of love for Madeleine is gloriously funny. Frances de la Tour as Leonie brings off the tricky feat of having to seem both embittered and kindly; and Alan Howard's muttering George is a brilliant study of frazzled and hopeless but nonetheless Machiavellian middle-aged discontent. The role of Madeleine does not really allow Lynsey Baxter to offer much more than a sketch; but Jude Law's Michael is a full-blooded (and in the bathroom scene full frontal), romping, almost flatteningly extrovert portrayal. When the whole box set is recessed on its Lyttelton tracks at the end, however, messiness of a purely theatrical kind wins out.</p>

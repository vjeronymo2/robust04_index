This is the wrong  approach, the elected representative of Saint-Marc claims.  Deputy Picault explains that "Operation Iron Cuts Iron"  [Operasyon Fe Koupe Fe], launched by the president of the  Republic [in his message to the people on the Voice of America  on 1 January], will only exacerbate passions.    [Begin Picault recording, in Creole] Given the approach  President Aristide has taken in saying that the conference  should be held in Miami, in speaking of an international  conference, with all due respect for him as president I can say  I think the route he has taken is a demagogic one. I think the  way he has taken is a demagogic way. President Aristide wants to  play a stalling game just as the international community is  doing, because he knows very well that it does not want to take  any real measures to bring him back. I cannot support such an  initiative because it offers no solution to the country's crisis.    Secondly: President Aristide said in a speech, "Iron cuts  iron." I think these are gratuitous, rash statements and that  when he makes such statements, he just gets on people's nerves,  driving those who are supposed to carry heavy weapons to commit  even more repression against the people who are supposed to side  with him.

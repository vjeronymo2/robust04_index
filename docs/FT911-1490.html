			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Reminiscing over raki - Crete: The Battle and the Resistance by Anthony Beevor John Murray Pounds 19.95, 383 pages FIFTY YEARS ago on May 20 the German parachute attack on Crete started one of the most bizarre - and moving - dramas of the Second World War, the short and disastrous Battle of Crete followed by the long, successful Resistance which tied down many German troops who could have been in Italy in 1943. Its high point is legend, filmed as Ill Met By Moonlight, when Patrick Leigh-Fermor's band captured General Kreipe, the commander of Heraklion, near Knossos, led him across snow-covered Mount Ida, and sent him off to Egypt in a submarine. The Germans set off thinking the Cretans would welcome them. But the Cretans had got rid of the Turks only 40 years before, after deeds of bravado and self-sacrifice such as when the Abbot of Arkadi in 1866 set fire to the monastery's powder magazine rather than surrender. Now it was the Nazis. The choice was the same: Freedom or Death. There was really no choice, even if the Cretan Division was stuck on the Albanian border. (Many times have I heard, over raki in the cafe, 'if only they had been here . . .') The old men, and women, and children, took up their farm tools and shotguns. The prisoners were let out. And the Germans thought it was unfair because the locals were not in uniform so they started reprisals, which strengthened the feeling against them. For the survivors of the motley group of British, Australian and New Zealand defenders of Crete, the memory of the courage, generosity and serious drinking of the Cretans does not fade. Ask those taken prisoner. On the long road to camp Cretans gave them food and drink constantly, even if it meant none for themselves. But British senior officers had been eager to get out and leave troops behind, as Evelyn Waugh showed in Officers and Gentlemen - partly in self-disgust, Antony Beevor explains. To Waugh, some of the British in Crete epitomised the collapse of behaviour and society during the war. When the first German fell from the sky, the Resistance began. And if the alliance was short of wirelesses and weapons, it was not lacking in spirit. They very nearly held Crete. German losses of crack troops were so high on the first day that they did not see how they could win. And they never again attempted a parachute attack, though the Allies continued till Arnhem. Unimaginative command, staying back and doing too little too late, lost the Allies Crete. The one moment of supreme advantage was when the invaders arrived. Yet there was no decision to hold Maleme airfield near Chania at any cost, and Hill 107 above it was abandoned on the first night when the Germans though they were lost. The First World War hero General Freyberg was so convinced that the main attack would be by sea that he misread accurate information from Ultra intercepts and held his reserves back in a campaign hardly longer than the land phase of the Gulf war. Crete was a major minor disaster, which Beevor analyses judiciously in this lucid, readable book which is set to become the standard work. Having tried its predecessors, I now at last understand what happened in the battle. It is also the first comprehensive account of the disruptive exploits of the dashing young men of the Resistance - Leigh-Fermor, Xan Fielding, archaeologists such as Tom Dunbabin and Terence Bruce-Mitford, Mikis Akoumianos (the son of Sir Arthur Evans' foreman) and Constantinos Mitsotakis, the present Greek PM. Beevor includes most of the stories but leaves out the strange moment of communion on Mount Ida when Kreipe started and Leigh-Fermor finished Horace's poem about Monte Soratte in snow. I also wanted more of the whiff of Crete, 'blood and slaughter and garlic' as Nicholas Hammond wrote later. Has Beevor sat in the sun on Mount Ida and heard an elder of Anoyia tell how, in court after the war, he killed the collaborator who had shot his brother and then walked over to the prosecutor and handed him his knife? Has he heard the cafe-owner's wife shrieking at the men for being sentimental about the Resistance when 'the Germans did not just kill our men, they killed the goats and shot holes in our olive oil tanks. Our village died for 25 years'? More time over the raki hearing the songs and legends which keep the war alive today would have made the book yet stronger. But we hope to find them one day in Patrick Leigh-Fermor's great yet-to-be written work on Crete. An exhibition called 'Touch and Go: the Battle for Crete, 1941' opens at the National Army Museum, Royal Hospital Road, London SW3 on May 17.</p>

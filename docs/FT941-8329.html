			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Moscow 'cannot follow' the west One of Britain's leading political scientists has sharply attacked expectations that the former Soviet Union could become a fully fledged market economy, arguing that it does not have the legal and cultural infrastructure which allowed such a development in the west. In a pamphlet published today, Dr John Gray of Oxford University claims that western governments are mistaken to think that Russia will converge smoothly on a western model of economic development. In particular, he attacks recent attempts by economists such as Dr Jeffrey Sachs to transform the Soviet economy by means of 'shock therapy'. These countries, he says, 'lack almost entirely the legal and institutional infrastructure of the market on which economic take-off was based'. But he also argues that these legal and institutional structures cannot be created quickly by policymakers. He argues that such institutions are 'human practices that always come deeply embedded in matrices of cultural tradition'. They 'are like natural languages in that it is their very nature to be plural and diverse.' Post-communist societies in transition: A social market perspective.

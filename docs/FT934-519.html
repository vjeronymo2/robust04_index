			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cookson pays Pounds 37m for JM's jewellery arm Cookson Group, the industrial materials group, is reinforcing its presence in the European precious metals market with the Pounds 37m purchase of Johnson Matthey's jewellery materials operations. The move follows rumours that the two companies intended to merge their precious metals divisions. Mr Richard Oster, Cookson's chief executive, said speculation had been sparked by negotiations for yesterday's deal. Cookson will pay Pounds 17m in cash for the operation, based in Dublin and Birmingham, which sells semi-finished gold, silver and other precious metals to jewellers, dentists and the electronics and electrical industries. A further Pounds 20m will be paid for the precious metal. The business, which had sales of Pounds 44m in the year to March 31, will be combined with the recently acquired Knight Stern company. Mr Chris Clark of Johnson Matthey said the proceeds would be used to reduce debt, which was about Pounds 120m in September. Jewellery materials did not fit the company's strategy, he said. Nor had it achieved the required 20 per cent return on net assets. Mr Oster said Cookson would increase the return by improving efficiency and bringing technological expertise from its Stern Leach jewellery materials business in the US. Last year, Cookson had achieved returns there of about 35 per cent on assets.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK seeks delay on EU laws Britain yesterday called for a delay in complying with European Union legislation on cleaning up sewage on the grounds that the Pounds 10bn cost was five times higher than originally calculated. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor, told EU finance ministers that his request was part of a British campaign to review - and possibly roll back - existing EU laws on cost grounds. Mr Clarke served notice that the UK intended to identify other environmental and social legislation which he believed was burdening industry unnecessarily. The UK aim is to invoke the principle of 'subsidiarity' in the Maastricht treaty which calls for power to be devolved from Brussels to the lowest appropriate national, regional or municipal level. 'We need to open up the whole area,' Mr Clarke said. The 1991 urban waste water directive sets down a goal for cleaning up sewage in cities by the year 2005. Mr Clarke made clear that the principle of cleaner water was 'perfectly worthwhile', but only within an extended timetable. The Conservative government agreed to the 1991 directive, but Mr Clarke suggested that the environment secretary at the time, Mr Michael Heseltine, had in retrospect made a mistake because the cost of compliance had shot up from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 10bn. The Chancellor said the UK's request for a new timetable was justified in order to avoid the costs of compliance being passed on to the UK consumer. He was also pressing for finance ministers to be more closely involved in monitoring EU legislation which placed new burdens on industry.</p>

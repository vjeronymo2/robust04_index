			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> GOP: THE PARTY OF TWO IDEAS, BOTH DEAD;  </P> <P> IT'S THE REPUBLICANS' TURN TO BE INTELLECTUALLY BANKRUPT. THE DEMOCRATS ARE  STIRRING.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, Daniel Moynihan pro nounced the Democratic Party brain-dead. The  Democrats had "ceased to be a party of ideas" while the Republicans were now  "serious about ideas," wrote Moynihan, a man with enough ideas of his own to  supply several political parties. Moynihan was right. Spent by the success of  the New Deal and having no idea what to do next, by 1980 the Democratic Party  was intellectually bankrupt.  </P> <P> It is 10 years later and another bankruptcy needs to be declared. While  blunders are blamed and fingers pointed, the Republican collapse of 1990 is too  large to be explained simply by the tactical errors of George Bush in the great  budget crunch. Republican malaise goes far deeper than that. The party has run  out of ideas.  </P> <P> To be sure, it did not have many to begin with. Two to be exact. (Though that  was two more than the Democrats had in the 1980s.) One was peace through  strength. The other was growth through low taxes. Reagan and Bush rode these  simple and appealing maxims to three smashing electoral victories. The  Republican problem today is that both ideas are dead. Peace through strength is  now politically obsolete. And painless prosperity through low taxes has proven  false.  </P> <P> Peace through strength has been undone by its own success. Reagan insisted on  strength: increased defense spending, unpopular missile deployments and honest  "evil empire" rhetoric.There are many reasons for the collapse of the Soviet  empire -- but one of them certainly is that the United States did not seek some  phony armistice with the Soviets as urged by the post-Vietnam accommodationists  of the 1970s.  </P> <P> There is only one problem with peace through strength as a unifying and winning  political idea. It is now as obsolete as communism. It still has application,  of course, in places like the Persian Gulf. But this is a harder sell. Soviet  missiles were a threat to the American homeland and Soviet ideology a threat to  the American idea. Iraq is neither. Since Vietnam, the Republican Party has  been the nationalist party. But as shown by the rise of conservative  isolationism, in a post-Cold War world, Republicans are finding it much harder  to articulate a coherent nationalist program.  </P> <P> To be sure, the still-nebulous "new world order" is a glimmer of an idea. On  domestic policy, however, Republican thinking has collapsed completely. Growth  through low taxes, inflated by Bush to no-new-taxes, was by nature a  time-limited proposition. Once the Laffer Curve free lunch was shown to be  nonsense, it became clear that though low taxes could produce growth and jobs  and prosperity, they could not do so forever because they also produced  fantastic debt, now exceeding $3 trillion.  </P> <P> It was only a matter of time before Bush bent to reality and agreed to new  taxes. That may save the economy, but it will sink the Republican Party.  No-new-taxes was, after all, Bush's only domestic idea.  </P> <P> Its beauty was that it was not just an idea, it was an idea stopper. No taxes  meant never having to say which taxes. Republicans were insulated from ever  having to face the real question of governance: choosing who gets taxed and how  much.  </P> <P> Which is why Republican politicians who for a decade prospered politically  behind the tax shield were apoplectic when Bush gave it up. They understood  that it would leave them defenseless to Democratic charges that they were the  party of the rich.  </P> <P> Once Bush came down from the Andrews Air Force Base Summit and presented the  country with a list of service cuts and gas and beer taxes, people realized  that the game was up. Somebody was going to have to pay past and present bills  and Bush had decided which ones. Bushonomics was exposed as nothing more than  classic (i.e., pre-Reagan) Republican trickle-down economics, a known political  loser.  </P> <P> Take away no new taxes and what does the Republican Party stand for? Cutting  the capital-gains tax, Bush insisted for a while. But this is not just a paltry  substitute for no-new-taxes. It is a hopelessly class-biased substitute. It  thus promotes the Democratic claim that the Republicans are now what they  always were before the Reagan mirage, the party of the rich.  </P> <P> In any case, Bush finally caved on capital gains too. Even half an idea is more  than the party is now capable of sustaining.  </P> <P> What does a party do when it runs out of ideas? It can only hope that the other  guy has even fewer ideas. This time, however, the Democrats may not cooperate.  The soak-the-rich, burden-the-allies, pro-choice Democrats are stirring. It is  too soon to say that they are out of their coma. But there is movement beneath  the eyelids.  </P></p>

In the view  of this well-known political scientist, all sides must show  restraint until a thorough and impartial investigation has been  held of all circumstances under which 68 people were killed and  nearly 200 injured in a recent blast in Sarajevo.    Migranian believes that the debate of the possibility of air  strikes against Bosnian Serbs has contributed to "a nervous  atmosphere in which one of the warring parties is tempted into  hurrying things up and the other is continuously on the verge of  failing to restrain itself." He emphasized: "It is an abnormal  situation in which the prey has been determined in advance,  which is a source of tension in itself."    "A strike against Serbians is indeed likely to prove to be a  strike against Russia," Migranian said. He insisted that the  Russian public should not be misled into believing that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader, was the  sole force in the Russian political spectrum that was friendly  towards Serbia. He recalled a State Duma resolution, adopted by  a huge majority, that rejected placing all the blame for the  conflict on one side and called for lifting the sanctions  against Serbia.    "Russian diplomacy's non-resistance in the face of NATO's  improper intentions and of further dangerous escalation of the  Yugoslav crisis can result in a dramatic escalation of the  political strife in Russia and harm President Boris Yeltsin's  image," Migranian emphasized.</p>

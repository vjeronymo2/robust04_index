			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Technology: BMW's city hybrid BMW has just unveiled a potential and partial solution to traffic congestion, calling it 'a blend of the obvious and a little original thought'. The German car and motorcycle maker is putting forward its C1 prototype as a possible way of taking advantage of the road space and journey time-saving merits of the motorcycle, without the rider being excessively exposed to the usual safety hazards. BMW claims that the C1, which has an aluminium space frame with built-in front and rear crumple zones, has the same protection in a head-on collision as a small car. It is fitted with a car-type seat, safety belts and roll-over hoop. Despite suggesting that a helmet could be regarded as superfluous, even Munich-based BMW acknowledges that the C1 is much like any other motorcycle in the event of a side impact. In practical terms, the wind protection and overhead structure, plus the seating arrangement and 50 litres of luggage capacity, are claimed to eliminate vulnerability to most weather conditions. BMW acknowledges there is 'not much chance' of the C1 going into commercial production, but this is not wholly ruled out: BMW's Z1 plastic-bodied sports car began life as a similar off-beat concept but was eventually put into limited production.</p>

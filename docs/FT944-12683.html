			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Nicaragua limps back to life: The first expected growth year since the 1970s Nicaragua is expected to grow this year, a rare occurrence for an economy that has been in almost unremitting decline since the late 1970s, as a semblance of political stability gains a foothold. But the economic expansion remains anaemic and there is little confidence that the economy has taken a decisive turn for the better. Growth is unlikely to exceed 1.5 per cent this year, less than population growth at around 3 per cent. Unemployment is 60 per cent. Relative peace, and measures aimed at developing a market economy after the defeat of the left-wing Sandinistas in 1990 have not, so far at least, brought the economic benefits that the government has periodically promised. Mr Oscar Rene Vargas, an economist, points to a drop in income per head of 48 per cent in the last five years. 'This is the 'Africanisation' of Nicaragua,' he says. 'We won't be able to return to the levels of 1989 for 25 years.' The country's foreign debt - at Dollars 11bn, more than eight times gross national product - is still a heavy burden. The government secured in June an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility with the International Monetary Fund, which gives it access to Dollars 150m a year until 1997, and the possibility to renegotiate debt with Paris Club creditors. But about 80 per cent of liquid foreign loans go towards debt service. Meanwhile, Nicaragua is running a large trade deficit, has negligible reserves, an agricultural sector suffering from drought, and a virtually non-existent industrial sector. Even the machetes, the essential tool of any agricultural labourer, are imported from El Salvador. But observers say there are some signs of encouragement. Although, many rural areas in the north are still plagued with banditry, the last group of organised rebels negotiated an agreement with the government in April. Congress has passed a military code which strengthens civilian authority over the armed forces and gives the president the right to dismiss the defence chief. Higher international coffee prices should push revenue above Dollars 100m in 1995 and total exports to more than Dollars 300m. Some foreign investment has begun to flow towards the energy sector, tourism, and gold mining. The national telephone company, Telcor, which has markedly improved its service, is expected to be privatised by the end of the year. The sea-food industry grew by 60 per cent last year. 'We believe there are significant opportunities here,' says Mr Eduardo Montealegre, general manager of Bancentro, one of nine private banks to open since 1991. 'We have changed the direction of things and the direction we are going in is the right one,' he says. Some analysts, however, still see fundamental change needed in other areas: in the unreformed public sector - a loan to cover this is being negotiated with the World Bank - and in the financial sector, where the state banks are in desperate condition. Furthermore, though the country's political divisions are less marked than they appeared a couple of years ago, there is concern that presidential elections in November 1995 are already beginning to sour the political climate. A split has emerged among leading members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front between a modernising wing of the party and the authoritarian leadership of Mr Daniel Ortega - a probable presidential candidate - and other hardliners who have maintained left-wing rhetoric. One manifestation of this is a division within the party over a proposed constitutional reform intended to make the executive more accountable to the legislature. The reform would among other things prohibit the immediate re-election of the president, shorten the term from six to five years, and ban close relatives from standing for election. Observers say Mr Ortega wishes to negotiate a property law which would legalise Sandinista ownership of some properties confiscated during its administration in the 1980s. In return, they say, he would be willing to support the removal of the proposed bar on presidential relatives seeking re-election. This would allow the man described as Nicaragua's de facto prime minister, Mr Antonio Lacayo - the minister of the presidency and President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law - to run for office too.</p>

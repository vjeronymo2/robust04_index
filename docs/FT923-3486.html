			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Increase in turnover helps Fortis climb to Ecu196m FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian insurance and banking group, posted a 10.3 per cent rise in first-half net profit to Ecu195.8m (Dollars 279.9m) on turnover up 25.2 per cent at Ecu4.5bn. The strong increase in turnover partly reflects acquisitions such as the purchase of the group insurance division of Mutual Benefit Life in the US. After adjusting for acquisitions and divestments, the turnover increase is equivalent to 15.2 per cent. Fortis, which is jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, said the steep decline in the value of the dollar would influence second-half results, but it repeated earlier predictions that 1992 net profit would be slightly higher than in 1991. Operating profit rose by 18 per cent to Ecu180.2m, with both the insurance and the banking operations contributing to the gain. Realised capital gains on investments were up Ecu6.8m at Ecu71.4m. Higher gains on property and bond investments outweighed lower results on share sales. In life insurance, the group's biggest business, operating results were largely unchanged at Ecu63.1m compared with Ecu62.4m a year earlier. Operating results in accident and health insurance rose 40 per cent to Ecu32.8m, reflecting the US acquisition as well as an improvement in results in Belgium.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACT WOULD GIVE HOSPITALS MUCH OF TOBACCO TAX HIKE  </P> <P> Senate and Assembly negotiators reached general agreement Monday on a complex  plan to give county hospitals the largest share of the roughly $600 million a  year raised from the voter-approved tobacco tax increase.  </P> <P> The six members of a Senate-Assembly conference committee did not take a formal  vote on the plan but indicated they were in basic agreement on most elements of  the proposal. Gov. George Deukmejian must still sign off on the deal.  </P> <P> Should the basic agreement hold up, it would represent a financial bonanza for  Los Angeles County and other financially strapped counties that have been  hard-pressed to deal with the closing of hospital emergency rooms and for  growing numbers of Californians who cannot afford to pay for their own health  care.  </P> <P> At this point, counties are in line for more than half the money that is  earmarked for health services under the 1988 ballot measure, Proposition 99,  which increased cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack and required comparable  hikes in other tobacco taxes.  </P> <P> Between $323 million and $338 million would be set aside to defray county  hospitals' costs in providing health care for the working poor -- those with an  income too high for welfare but too low to buy health insurance.  </P> <P> "We're delighted. We think the Legislature has been listening to us and is in  the mood to help," said Karen M. Coker, a lobbyist for the County Supervisors  Assn. of California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issues Undecided  </P> <P> Despite the consensus that is forming, a number of important issues remain to  be decided. Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), who is carrying the  legislation to parcel out the tobacco tax revenue, said after a morning session  that "we have decided generally how to spend 90% of the dollars, but we have a  lot of remaining tough issues."  </P> <P> Although counties are in line to receive the money, lawmakers still must decide  what kind of formula will be used to distribute the funds and how counties will  deal with declining Proposition 99 funds in future years. Since the beginning  of the year, tobacco tax revenues have declined 10%, a drop attributed to the  higher cost of cigarettes because of the tax increase. Counties are concerned  about legal problems that may arise in the future if they are forced to cut  their budgets because of declining tobacco tax revenues.  </P> <P> Another open issue is how much money -- if any -- will be put into an  anti-smoking media advertising campaign.  </P> <P> Lawmakers say they hope to reach a final agreement in time to enact the  legislation before the Legislature adjourns for the year Sept. 15.  </P> <P> Actually, conference committee members are making decisions on about $900  million -- $294 million from the last six months of the 1988-89 fiscal year,  which ended June 30, and $603 million expected during the current fiscal year.  </P> <P> Proposition 99 mandated that the money be used to subsidize the costs of  medical treatment for those unable to pay for their own treatment, pump dollars  into research programs, fund an anti-smoking campaign and finance natural  resource programs.  </P> <P> The measure required that 20% of all money raised through Proposition 99 go to  health education programs, 35% to hospital programs, 10% to doctors, 5% to  research and 5% to natural resources, with the remaining 25% to be free to be  divided up any way the Legislature chooses.  </P> <P> Although the initiative spelled out in general terms how the money was to be  divided, it was vague on a number of key points. For example, it did not spell  out whether public or private hospitals were to get the money and did not make  clear which government entity should be responsible for administering the  funds.  </P> <P> The Isenberg bill is considered the most important of numerous measures  introduced to implement various elements of Proposition 99. Other bills are  more narrowly focused, dealing with issues such as setting up anti-smoking  education and research programs and parceling out the money for parks and  natural resource projects.  </P></p>

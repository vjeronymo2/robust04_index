			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN WOMEN WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF TOP  </P> <P> In the past three NCAA Division II national championships, the Cal State  Northridge women's swim team never completed a day anywhere but atop the  standings.  </P> <P> That streak was broken on the first day of this year's meet and the trend  continued Thursday at the State University of New York at Buffalo natatorium.  </P> <P> In fact, the Lady Matadors, who started the day in second place, dropped a  notch.  </P> <P> Northridge has 170 points, trailing front-runner Navy (175) and North Dakota  (171).  </P> <P> And, considering the circumstances, Coach Pete Accardy could not be more  pleased.  </P> <P> "We wanted to be within 20 points today and we're within four (actually five),"  Accardy said. "Psychologically, that's a big lift. This was supposed to be by  far our worst day and we're actually closer to the lead than we were  yesterday."  </P> <P> A victory in the 800-yard freestyle relay, Northridge's first win of the meet,  pulled the Lady Matadors into the thick of title contention.  </P> <P> The top six teams are separated by 18 points. Eight points behind CSUN is Cal  Poly San Luis Obispo. Oakland (Mich.) (158) and Northern Michigan (157) follow.  </P> <P> Michelle Sulak opened the 800 relay in 1 minute 52.16 seconds to leave the  competition in Northridge's wake. The Lady Matadors, who won in 7:33.56, also  received strong segments from Toady Kimble (1:52.56), Lisa Dial (1:54.48) and  Mara Morgan (1:54.36).  </P> <P> Morgan was CSUN's only individual championship finalist during the evening's  other three events. She placed seventh in the 200-yard butterfly with a  personal-best 2:07.06. Sulak won the consolation title in the same event in  2:06.85.  </P> <P> Northern Michigan picked up wins from Kirsten Silverster in the butterfly  (2:04.37) and Jennifer Kleemann in the 100-yard backstroke (58.59).  </P> <P> Marion Warner of North Dakota took the 100-yard breaststroke championship in  1:05.56.  </P> <P> In the men's competition, a strong second-place showing in the 800-yard  freestyle relay kept Northridge in third place with 161.5 points.  </P> <P> Cal State Bakersfield, which won the relay in a Division II-record 6:37.87, led  in the team race with with 359 points. Oakland is second with 342 1/2.  </P> <P> For the second night in a row, CSUN's top individual performance was turned in  by John Kunishima, who placed second in the 100-yard backstroke.  </P> <P> Kunishima set a Division II record in the 200-yard individual medley in the  meet's opening night. On Thursday, it took a similar effort to defeat him.  </P> <P> Brady Stauffer, a junior from Shippensburg (Pa.), set a Division II standard of  50.43 to win the race. Kunishima came in at 51.37, a personal best.  </P> <P> Kunishima later turned in a 200-yard split of 1:37.33, the fastest of the  night, during the 800 relay.  </P> <P> Only a week ago, the sophomore from Hacienda Heights wasn't even sure he would  compete in the nationals. Kunishima pulled a back muscle and it bothered him  for several days.  </P> <P> In addition, he lost valuable training time during the winter because of  tendinitis in the area of his right biceps.  </P> <P> "Genuinely, I'm just happy to be here," Kunishima said. "And to do as well as  I'm doing, I'm just elated. This is a lot of fun."  </P> <P> Jack Pentlarge, a junior from Westlake Village, was CSUN's only other finalist  Thursday. He was sixth in the 200-yard butterfly in 1:51.54.  </P> <P> Andrew Bures of Bakersfield won the race in 1:48.40, breaking the previous  national record by more than a second.  </P></p>

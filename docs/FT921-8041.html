			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Plant hire behind fall at Ashtead ASHTEAD GROUP, the equipment rental combine, saw pre-tax profit slide by Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.5m in the half year to October 31, the whole reduction being attributable to the UK plant hire side. However, the group finished the period with a strong balance sheet. Gearing was halved to 42 per cent. Net cash flow, excluding the rights issue, was Pounds 2.6m. Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said operating profit in UK plant hire fell from Pounds 2.93m to Pounds 1.53m, but despite the harsh UK environment the board had not adopted a 'siege mentality'. More than Pounds 2m had been spent on plant additions and replacements and Pounds 1.8m on parts and spares, which will enable the group to take advantage of opportunities when the recession ends. Operating profit in US plant rental rose to Pounds 164,000 (Pounds 149,000), in UK survey and inspection rental to Pounds 391,000 (Pounds 361,000), and in Middle and Far East survey and inspection rental to Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 42,000). Turnover fell to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 17.3m). Earnings per share were 4.6p (8.3p) and the interim dividend is again 1.1p on increased capital.</p>

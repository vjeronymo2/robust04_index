			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Speech by Premier Li Peng at a </F> Meeting Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Promulgation  of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence"]    [Text] Beijing, 27 Jun (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li  Peng today delivered a speech at a meeting commemorating the  40th anniversary of the promulgation of the five principles of  peaceful coexistence. Full text of the speech follows:    Distinguished guests, foreign envoys, ladies and gentlemen:    Four decades ago the Chinese Government, along with the  Indian and Burmese Governments, issued joint statements,  deciding to make mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial  integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's  internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful  coexistence the basic principles for guiding mutual relations,  thereby proclaiming the creation of the five principles of  peaceful coexistence. It is of great significance today that we  hold the meeting to commemorate this major historical event, to  evaluate the role played by the five principles of peaceful  coexistence in the past and in the present, and to look into the  future development of the world.    The five principles of peaceful coexistence were a product  created by the demand of the times. Following the end of World  War II, newly independent and liberated nations anxiously wanted  to establish a new type of international relations based on an  equal footing, and they yearned for a peaceful international  environment for developing their national economies. Meanwhile,  a few countries in the world adopted an attitude of rejecting  and opposing these newly independent national states, and even  implemented a policy of aggression and war against them. These  norms for international relations, which were aimed at  consolidating national independence, safeguarding national  sovereignty, and seeking justice and equality, reflected the  common aspirations of the large number of independent national  states at that time. It is precisely because of this that the  five principles of peaceful coexistence received broad  endorsement from the international community. The 10 principles  adopted by the Bandung Conference in 1955 specifically  epitomized the spirit of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence. The "Declaration Concerning the Establishment by  Countries of the Principles for International Law Characterized  by Friendly Relations and Cooperation in Accordance with the UN  Charter," adopted by the 25th UN General Assembly in 1970, and  the "Declaration Concerning the Establishment of a New  International Economic Order," adopted by the Sixth Special UN  General Assembly in 1974, both affirmed the five principles of  peaceful coexistence, which have also been cited by many  international organizations and in the documents of  international conferences. In fact, the five principles of  peaceful coexistence have become an important component of the  norms for international relations.    Over the past four decades, the five principles of peaceful  coexistence have withstood the tests of a changeable  international situation, demonstrated a powerful vitality, and  played a tremendous role in promoting world peace and  international friendship and cooperation. History has born  witness that the five principles of peaceful coexistence are  universally applicable norms for international relations. If  countries with different ideologies, social systems, and  economic development levels can observe the five principles of  peaceful coexistence, it is entirely possible for them to  establish relations of mutual trust and friendly cooperation; if  the five principles of peaceful coexistence are violated,  confrontation and armed conflicts may take place even between  countries with identical ideologies and social systems.  Therefore, it is an irrefutable truth that the five principles  of peaceful coexistence are the cornerstone for establishing and  developing relations between countries.    As one of the initiating countries of the five principles  of peaceful coexistence, China has always adhered to and  practised those principles. Guided by the five principles of  peaceful coexistence, China has established diplomatic relations  with 158 countries; engaged in economic, trading, scientific,  technological, cultural exchanges and cooperation with more than  200 countries and regions; established good-neighborly and  friendly relations with all neighboring countries; and settled  border issues left by history with a great majority of  neighboring countries. In international affairs, China abides  by the five principles of peaceful coexistence, stands for  fairness, does not seek selfish gain, and makes proper  contributions to the peaceful solution of international  disputes, promoting international cooperation, and maintaining  regional and world peace. China has contributed its share of  efforts to help maintain the independence and sovereignty of  Afghanistan and has also played a constructive role to bring  about a political solution to the Cambodian issue. China has  always supported the Korean people in a peaceful settlement of  reunification problem through dialogue. China always stands for  a fair and rational solution to the Middle East issue,  restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,  and calls on the Arab and Jewish people to live in harmony.  During the Gulf crisis, China supported the restoration of  Kuwait's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.  Since the outbreak of the conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina, China  has repeatedly called on the parties concerned to cease conflict  and hostile actions and to seek a political solution to the  conflict through peace talks. At the United Nations and other  international organizations, and at a number of important  international conferences, China has adhered to a just position  and played a major role in bringing about the solution of major  international issues.    The world has undergone major changes over the past 40  years.  The bipolar world structure has ceased to exist. The world is  rapidly moving toward a multi-polar structure. International  relations are now undergoing far-reaching changes. Seen from an  overall perspective, the international situation is relaxing.  Over the long term, the outbreak of a new world war may be  avoided. However, the end of the Cold War does not mean that the  world is in great peace. Ethnic contradictions have intensified  in some countries and regions, resulting in frequent armed  conflicts, in unending wars, in turning hundreds and thousands  of people into refugees, and in a great loss of life and  property. Some developing countries have sunk deeper into  poverty. The North-South contradictions have become more acute.  Hegemonism and power politics still thrive in the world. Cases  of interference in other countries' internal affairs have been  frequently reported. Peace and development that are much sought  after by the people of the world are far from being realized.    How, then, to build a new world with stability, security,  and  prosperity? For many years, the international community,  including the United Nations and regional organizations, have  indeed done a lot and achieved certain results in maintaining  world peace and promoting common development. However, people  have more and more come to realize that only by establishing a  set of basic principles for international relations and for  international political and economic life which everyone sticks  to can we expect to generally and effectively guide and  standardize the international community's activities. We  believe that the five principles of peaceful coexistence embody  the most fundamental rules for international relations. They  are in line with the purpose and principles set down in the  United Nations Charter. They reflect the essence of  international relations. They can serve countries of different  social systems, countries with different levels of economic  development, and neighboring countries. Therefore, we stand for  the establishment of a new order in international politics and  economics based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence  and by adapting to the changing international situation.    Mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs is  the core of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and of  the new international order. The world is diversified and  colorful. Not only the social systems, values, and ideologies  differ between countries, but also large differences exist  between their historical traditions, religious beliefs, and  cultural backgrounds. Only by recognizing these differences and  showing respect to each other can we broaden the scope of  cooperation, promote exchange, and get along amicably. It is  necessary for all countries to learn from each other and to make  use of each other's experience; however, this is possible only  if it is based on each country's independence. Imposing one's  values and social models on other countries inevitably  encourages tension and confrontation between countries. Each  country's affairs should be taken care of by its own people. The  people of each country absolutely have the right to choose a  social system and development path suitable for their national  conditions, and other countries should not interfere in the  country's affairs under any pretext in any way. We hold that  all countries, big or small, poor or rich, strong or weak, are  equal members of the international community, and, while seeking  their own development, can make due contributions to world peace  and development.    Having some differences between countries is inevitable.  China has always advocated promoting mutual understanding and  reducing differences through conducting dialogue, and has  opposed exerting pressure on other countries and interfering in  other countries' internal affairs. On the human rights issue,  all countries should conduct dialogue on the basis of equality  and mutual respect to seek common ground while reserving  differences, so as to make contributions to protecting human  rights and to improving the world's human rights conditions.  Imposing one kind of standard of human rights on others and  interfering in other countries' internal affairs under certain  pretexts and ignoring other countries' national conditions and  law, as a matter of course, will be opposed by a large number of  developing countries, including China.    Mutual respect of each other's sovereignty and territorial  integrity, mutual nonaggression, and peaceful coexistence among  all countries -- these are the basis of the five principles and  the new international order. It is unacceptable to use any  pretext to infringe on other countries' sovereignty, to deprive  them of their sovereignty, or to encroach on or devour other  countries' territory, or to use force or to threaten to use  force as a means to implement one's policy. We should not  resort to using force to settle disputes between countries;  achieving a fair and reasonable solution through peaceful talks  is the only correct way.    Here I like to point out in particular that Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, by summing up domestic and international practice, has  offered many penetrating expositions on the five principles of  peaceful coexistence. He put forward the great idea of "one  country, two systems" for solving the Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan issues. He said: "Our putting forward the 'one country,  two systems' idea to solve China's reunification problem also is  a kind of peaceful coexistence." He also pointed out: "On some  international territorial disputes, we may set sovereignty aside  for the time being and make joint efforts to develop the  territory in question first." It is just under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's advocating "shelving disputes and making  common efforts to develop" that China and concerned countries  have actively sought ways to join efforts to develop regions  under dispute, in order to preserve peace and stability in this  region and to prevent tensions from emerging.    Equality and mutual benefit are the embodiment of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence in the handling of economic  relations. In economics, all countries should benefit each  other by learning from each other's strong points to offset  their own weaknesses, helping supply each other's needs, and  cooperating with one another on an equal footing. Protectionism  of various forms and exchanges of unequal values are  undesirable. The world economy is an inter-related and  mutually-dependent whole. Various regions and countries promote  and supplement each other in economics. At present, some  developing countries are having economic difficulties of which  many are caused by an irrational international economic order  and by exchanges of unequal values. Developed countries have  the responsibility to help developing nations shake off poverty.  The worsening of the absolute poverty in some underdeveloped  countries is an important cause for turmoils, civil wars, and  even regional conflicts. This is a fact to which the  international community should attach sufficient importance.  South-North dialogue and cooperation should be promoted.  Developed countries should open their markets to developing  nations, provide development funds, transfer technologies, and  increase aid to the latter, help the latter reduce its debt  burden, and thus contribute to the latter's economic development  and social stability and to narrowing the South-North gap.  Their doing so will be conducive to their own economic  development.    Distinguished guests;    China is going all-out with its modernization program. It  needs a peaceful international environment and needs to develop  friendly cooperation with other countries. Comrade Jiang Zemin  pointed out in his report to the 14th CPC National Congress:  China has consistently pursued an independent foreign policy of  peace. The basic objectives of that policy are to safeguard our  independence and sovereignty and to promote world peace and  development. China will always stand firm as a strong defender  of world peace. China will never seek hegemony and expansion;  it is opposed to hegemonism, power politics, aggression and  expansion in any form. Under the new international situation,  we will abide by the five principles of peaceful coexistence and  continue to actively develop our relations with other countries.  China will always be a good neighbor to surrounding countries,  as well as an equal, cooperative partner to other countries.    To open up on every side and actively develop economic  relations with other countries is an important component part of  China's foreign policy. China will constantly expand and  strengthen exchanges and cooperation with other countries in the  economic, scientific, technological, and cultural fields in  accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit;  and will actively assimilate the achievements of civilization of  all mankind, including the advanced business operations and  management expertise of developed western countries. Over the  last 15 years, China has opened itself wider and wider to the  outside world and has now created a pattern of being open on  every side, with both coastal and interior regions open to the  outside. The policy of opening up has promoted economic  development and the improvement of the people's living  standards, and won wholehearted support from people across the  country. China's policy of opening up will not change, no  matter how the international situation changes.    Distinguished guests:    The 50th anniversary of the United Nations will be ushered  in  next year, and mankind will enter the 21st century several years  later. To sum up the historical experience of human society  over the last half of the century and make the 21st century one  of peace, stability, development and prosperity has more and  more become a common aspiration of the peoples of all countries;  and it is also a rigorous challenge of history to the  governments and peoples of all countries. The Chinese  Government and people will hold aloft the banner of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence and join other countries in  the world in working hard to build a new international political  and economic order and create a glorious future of the mankind.    Thank you!</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Indonesians discuss US trade privilege threats INDONESIAN economic and trade ministers met yesterday to discuss threats to trading privileges with the US following criticism of Jakarta's treatment of workers, Reuter reports from Jakarta. 'This is an old issue in bilateral trade with the US. We faced this issue in the previous cabinet and so far we have been able to settle it well,' Mr Saleh Ariff, co-ordinating minister for economics, told reporters before the meeting. 'However, it (the criticism) is indeed getting sharper.' Washington has threatened to cut imports at preferential tax rates under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) if Indonesia does not improve labour practices. The GSP was a concept developed within the Geneva-based UN Conference on Trade and Development - whereby temporary and non-reciprocal grants of preferences were awarded by developing countries to non-developed countries  -to encourage the expansion of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods from developing countries by making goods more competitive through tariff preferences. The US has given Indonesia until February to improve labour rights, including the right to organise freely. Fourteen per cent of Indonesian exports to the US, worth Dollars 600m (Pounds 402.6m), qualified for tax concessions last year. Mr Tungky Ariwibowo, the industry minister quoted by the official Antara news agency, said on Tuesday that Indonesia would strive to maintain the system. 'We should solve the GSP facility problems as soon as possible.' Washington criticised Indonesia for barring the country's largest independent trade union, the Indonesia Welfare Labour Union (SBSI), from holding its first congress late last month. An Indonesian official said the government did not recognise the SBSI as a trade union because it did not represent workers and sought to divide the labour movement. Indonesia has also come under increased US criticism on human rights. The US State Department cited human rights concerns last week when it blocked the sale to Indonesia of four ageing American-built F-5E fighter jets from Jordan. Indonesian State Secretary Murdiono said on Tuesday the government would explain its position on human rights to Washington. 'I hope the problem can be solved,' he said.</p>

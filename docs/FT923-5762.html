			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / People: Charitable theory . . . Adrian Randall (left) finance director of the Cancer Research Campaign, has been named the first visiting professor in charity finance at South Bank University, where a new postgraduate diploma (MSc) in charity finance - the only one of its kind in the UK - begins next month. The idea for the course grew out of the Charity Finance Directors Group, of which Randall, new to the sector and struck by the lack of self-help groups, was a co-founder. Another member was Paul Palmer, who is now the course director and Moores Rowland reader in charity finance at South Bank, the former polytechnic turned university. 'The idea is to create the future finance directors of the charity world' says Palmer, who, with Randall and others, has been formulating the course for the last three years. Charitable income in Britain is estimated to account for around 4 per cent of GDP, but there is very little information as to what is 'best practice' and how to attain it. While the LSE and Open University run general charity management courses, this is the first dedicated specifically to finance. There will be 20 students, most already employed in charities, for the first year. Randall, a qualified chartered accountant who subsequently used a legacy to read economics at Hull University, is a self-taught expert on charity taxation. He says he got into the field not because of he was 'one of these crusading people who decide to leave the business world' but because he lost his job. He had spent 12 years with Tate &amp; Lyle, ending up as finance director of a small chemical distributor which was sold off in 1985 to Hays, where he was made redundant two years later. He heard of the Cancer Research vacancy - and is relieved he took it, rather than accept one of the other posts on offer at the time, a job at BCCI.</p>

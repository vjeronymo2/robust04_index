			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS, JOYNER EXCHANGE THEIR ARBITRATION FIGURES  </P> <P> The Angels and Wally Joyner exchanged arbitration figures Friday, but not  pleasantries.  </P> <P> The Angels filed at $750,000. Joyner, who earned $340,000 last season, came in  at $965,000. If it goes to a February hearing, an arbitrator will choose one of  the two figures as Joyner's 1989 salary.  </P> <P> Joyner and the Angels can continue negotiating until the arbitrator makes a  decision, but attorney Barry Axelrod, who represents Joyner, said the $215,000  difference seems too large to produce a compromise.  </P> <P> He said the $750,000 offer was another example of the Angels' refusal to  negotiate in good faith with Joyner, who held out last spring, when he was not  eligible for arbitration, before accepting the $340,000 proposal.  </P> <P> "In a word, I was amused, as was Wally, who was also somewhat hurt -- again,"  Axelrod said.  </P> <P> Axelrod said that Joyner's $965,000 figure was carefully arrived at and took  into consideration his accomplishments compared to other players of his  experience.  </P> <P> Axelrod listed Kirby Puckett, Jose Canseco, Will Clark, Eric Davis, Joe Carter  and Danny Tartabull, all of whom are now in the $1-million range or will be  when they sign 1989 contracts.  </P> <P> Axelrod conceded that Joyner's home run production fell off significantly last  year, from 34 to 13, but said that he still had another outstanding year,  batting .295 with 85 runs batted in.  </P> <P> "He had more RBIs than Mike Marshall, who led the Dodgers," Axelrod said.  </P> <P> Marshall drove in 82 runs and signed a multiyear contract that raised his  salary from $760,000 to $1 million in 1989.  </P> <P> Angel General Manager Mike Port disagreed with Axelrod, saying the exchange of  arbitration figures defined the floor and ceiling and left "a lot of room in  between for (compromise) possibilities." He said he was hopeful of conducting  serious discussions leading to an amicable settlement.  </P> <P> If it goes to arbitration, the Angels' case will be argued by Tal Smith, former  general manager of the Houston Astros  </P></p>

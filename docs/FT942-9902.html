			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Local traders criticise charities The Federation of Small Busi-nesses called yesterday for an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into 'exploitative practices' by hospitals, charities, schools and churches, Richard Gourlay writes. The federation, which represents 50,000 small businesses, says established enterprises are 'trading in a jungle of unfair competition'. It adds that charity shops sell new goods while enjoying lower rates than commercial businesses; churches have rate-exempt premises that they can let to commercial businesses which then profit from subsidised rentals; and schools compete directly with private-sector suppliers of accom-modation, hotels and caterers. The report also attacks the 'increasing abuse' of car boot sales and itinerant markets. 'Legitimate local traders and licensed market traders are being undercut and undermined,' the federation says.</p>

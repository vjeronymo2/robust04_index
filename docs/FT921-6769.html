			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Commission to fine Aer Lingus A FINE on Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier, for refusing to grant reciprocal ticketing rights to British Midland, the UK airline, is to be announced by the European Commission today. The Brussels competition directorate believes Aer Lingus's move to scrap a long-standing 'inter-lining' agreement with British Midland in 1989 - just when the latter started flying to Dublin - constituted an illegal abuse of the Irish carrier's dominant position on the London-Dublin route. Inter-lining agreements allow travel agents to issue passengers with a single ticket permitting them to change airlines on different legs of their journeys. Brussels favours such agreements because they give customers more flexibility and because they make it easier for airlines to pick up passengers on new routes, encouraging entry into the market. Last year's withdrawal by British Airways from the London-Dublin route has helped both Aer Lingus and British Midland since. Inter-lining agreements are common between EC airlines, but not obligatory. However, according to the EC competition directorate, in reacting to direct route competition from British Midland by scrapping the ticketing agreement it had had with the UK airline since 1964, the Irish carrier was abusing its dominant position in flights to and from the Irish capital.</p>

He evidently referred to the extremist statement of former  legislature to declare the major Black Sea Fleet base in the  Crimea, the port of Sevastopol, as Russian territory.    However, Russia should increase its political activity in  the  peninsula and be a guarantor of the stability in this autonomous  republic of Ukraine, Igrunov stressed.    He welcomed the idea of establishing a Russian consulate or  a  permanent mission of the Russian parliament in Simferopol, the  Crimean administrative centre. The parliamentarian also spoke  in favour of the exchange of lawmakers' delegations between  Russia and the Crimea.    Kiev should only praise such cooperation, as Moscow is not  interested in the Crimean separatism, he stressed. Igrunov  believes Ukraine should prefer the civilized cooperation with  Russia to "an endless tug-of-war".    The parliamentarian said that he had just returned from the  Crimea and Kiev after the on-spot examination of the situation.  According to him, the first popularly elected president of the  autonomy, Yuriy Meshkov should avoid hasty steps and rely on the  renowned local politicians and parliament leaders.</p>

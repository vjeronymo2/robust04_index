			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Nikonov, </F> State Duma deputy, by Sergey Lomakin; from the "Utro" program --  live]    [Text] [Lomakin] Now we have another guest on our program  and I think that since this is the last program for the year we  will talk a little about forecasts. He is Vyacheslav  Alekseyevich Nikonov, doctor of historic sciences, adviser of  the International Reform Fund, and deputy of the new State Duma.  I would like to congratulate you and ask you: How do you see  the coming year?    [Nikonov] First of all, good morning and greetings on the  coming new year, as well as the new political year. What will  happen in terms of political stability? It seems to me that the  political stars will not be too kind to Russia next year,  although I am sure that things will not go as far as the acute  conflicts we had in October of the past year.    [Lomakin] You mean this year?    [Nikonov] Yes, October of this year. We can see that a new  constitutional order has been created, new representative organs  of power have been elected, yet nevertheless the composition of  these representative organs and the very content of the  constitution are not something that inspires too much optimism.  As you know, the content of the State Duma is such that  opposition forces will predominate in it. The constitution also  includes a whole series of hitches and careless points which  could be used by the opposition in order to destabilize the  situation.    Naturally the question arises: How fruitful will the future  Federal Assembly be, and how effectively and quickly will it be  able to adopt laws? I would not harbor too many illusions in  this regard. We are, after all, entering into a completely new  constitutional system. A fundamentally new state organ of  legislative power is being created which must organize itself,  and this too will require some time. A lot of time will be  taken up by questions relating to the location of this organ.  Obviously it will not agree with the proposals made by the  president about putting it in the CEMA Building or the Russian  Press House, about which there has been talk.    I am sure that the question of assessing various political  events of the past year will arise. Unfortunately, the new  constitution gives the State Duma a fairly serious opportunity  to move a vote of no confidence in the government and to force  it to resign. According to the new constitution, it turns out  that if the State Duma passes a vote of no confidence in the  government twice, consecutively, the President must either  disband the Duma or ask the government to resign, but it  includes a rule according to which the President cannot disband  anything on these grounds during the first year of the Duma's  work. So the president would have to ask the government to  resign.    This would create a situation of fairly serious political  instability, even though the president has some counter options.  The fact is that after the resignation of one government, he can  nominate a premier unacceptable to the Duma. He can do this  three times, after which he can disband the Duma. So the  constitution includes a whole series of points which will  promote confrontation in the relations between the two branches  of power.    [Lomakin] Tell me please, Vyacheslav Alekseyevich, I think  this concerns many people: How will Zhirinovskiy act, taking  into consideration his victory at the elections?    [Nikonov] First of all, I do not consider that Zhirinovskiy  won at the elections. Obviously he made a very strong showing,  but we know that Zhirinovskiy got his representatives only into  that half of the lower house, the State Duma, which was elected  according to party lists. As far as the second half of the  State Duma -- which was elected from electoral districts -- is  concerned, there are not too many Zhirinovskiy supporters in it,  while in the Upper House, the Federation Council, there are  practically none.    I think that Zhirinovskiy will undoubtedly play a fairly  active role through the coming year. I imagine that his tactics  will be to demonstrate the utmost constructivism. He will try  to show himself to be a loyal supporter of President Yeltsin's  course, a course of reforms. Essentially he will be telling  people: I, together with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, will do  everything possible to establish order in this country.    [Lomakin] Will this be some kind of smokescreen?    [Nikonov] It will be a serious smokescreen, since it is  quite obvious that as soon as there is any whiff of the next  elections, his tactics may change 180 degrees and he will say:  We tried, we did everything to achieve order in the country  together with the president, but it turns out that the president  has insufficient strength in order to fulfill this task.    I attach fairly great hopes to the elections that we will  have next year. As you know, we will have elections in all the  subjects of the federation -- in republics, krays, and oblasts  -- and they will be held in accordance with legislative norms  that will be developed within the subjects of the federation  themselves. Local elections will also be held. In essence, the  entire system of power, from bottom to top, will take shape next  year. Unfortunately, it was in disarray in recent times.    [Lomakin] Thank God, Vyacheslav Alekseyevich, that we have  arrived at an optimistic end. There is nothing more thankless  than making forecasts; however, we tried to do this today and  Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Nikonov played first-chair violin in our  orchestra today. He is one of the newly elected members of the  State Duma, a doctor of historical sciences, and an adviser of  the International Reform Fund. Thank you.    [Nikonov] Thank you and once again, a happy new year.</p>

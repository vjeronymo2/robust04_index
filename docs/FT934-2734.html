			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Books: Wilde about Ada - Antony Curtis reviews a biography of the woman who rescued Oscar WONDERFUL SPHINX: THE BIOGRAPHY OF ADA LEVERSON by Julie Speedie Virago Pounds 17.99, 219 pages When Oscar Wilde was released on bail before his trial for homosexual offences in 1895, one woman, at least was waiting for him outside the courtroom, ready to risk her reputation in society on his behalf. Wilde then needed help of the most practical kind, because the vindictive 8th Marquess of Queensberry made a point of ensuring that no hotel would take him in. The lady who rescued him was Ada Leverson, a writer whom Wilde had nicknamed his 'wonderful Sphinx' on account of her enigmatic bon mots. From an intellectual liberal Jewish background, Ada Esther Beddington (as she was) had married Ernest Leverson, a prosperous businessman. When Wilde faced criminal proceedings at the Old Bailey in 1895, the Leversons were living in a large London house in Courtfield Gardens with their small daughter Violet. After Mrs Leverson took the courageous decision that he should stay with her, she called her servants together and said that if anyone wished to leave during Wilde's residence in the house they were welcome to do so. No one did. The nursery floor was then made over to Wilde as a refuge. She asked Oscar if he wished the toys, dolls, rocking-horse, to be removed. He said 'No', and then held lengthy conferences with his lawyer surrounded by these reminders of childhood. Ada encouraged him to jump bail, foreseeing what the law's outcome would be. But Wilde refused to do this, just as he had refused to avoid the trial altogether by fleeing across the Channel. When, after serving his two year sentence, he was released, early in the morning to avoid the press, Ada was among the little group of former friends who had risen at dawn to greet him. She later described the scene: 'He came in with the dignity of a king returning from exile. He came in talking, laughing, smoking a cigarette, with waved hair and a flower in his button-hole, and he looked markedly better, slighter and younger than he had two years previously. His first words were, 'Sphinx, how marvellous of you to know exactly the right hat to wear at seven o'clock in the morning to meet a friend who has been away] You can't have got up, you must have sat up.'' The group was a mutual admiration society whose other members included Robert Ross, More Adey, Reginald Turner, the Oscar loyalists who were to quarrel bitterly among themselves and with 'Bosie' Douglas, the son of the Marquess, after Wilde's death. Other friends of Ada's included Robert Hichens, author of the satirical novel The Green Carnation, Aubrey Beardsley, Ronald Firbank, Max Beerbohm, Somerset Maugham. It was a society in which the great, the only, crime was failure to sparkle. Treachery was tolerated, but not dullness. As such there was a great deal of frivolity that seems very unfunny today and a lot of plain silliness. It was the era of the Practical Joke, of hoaxes and disguises; they thought there was great humour in the spectacle of a man dressed up as a woman. The actor Brandon Thomas, who canonised this joke in his play Charley's Aunt, married Marguerite Leverson and became Ada's cousin by marriage and another friend. Caricature and parody, those minor arts perfected by Beerbohm, were widely practised in the 1890s. It was, as this biography of Ada shows, primarily as a parodist in the pages of Punch that Ada first made her mark. She parodied Oscar there to his delight. Before she tried her hand at fiction she was earning a modest income as a literary journalist. Serious newspapers lightened their pages with pieces of gossip and sketches of life in Society. We think of (Sir) Anthony Hope (Hawkins) only as the author of The Prisoner of Zenda, but in his day he was equally well known for 'The Dolly Dialogues' in the Westminster Gazette. They were instalments of a long-running flirtatious exchange between a man who is a bachelor and the nubile Dolly Foster who at the end of it all marries a peer. Ada wondered if it were possible to write whole novels in this kind of nuance dialogue. Across the Channel the Comtesse de Martel de Janville had shown, under the pseudonym of 'Gyp', that it could certainly be done with ease in French. Her novels of Parisian society, written exclusively in dialogue, were like stage-plays in book-form, and were required reading among the English aristocracy of Edwardian England. You can still find complete sets of them in the libraries of some of the grander country houses. Not only Ada but Ronald Firbank and Henry James responded to the challenge of writing dialogue-only novels. James following 'the admirable Gyp' (as he called her) turned out a masterpiece of the genre, The Awkward Age. That was in 1899; it was in the first decade of the 20th century that Ada essayed this form and published six dialogue novels, from 1907 with The Twelfth Hour to 1916 with Love at Second Sight. Intimate conversation between men and women full of sexual innuendo is her game. She included thinly disguised pen-portraits of her friends, but at their core the books represent urgent dispatches from the marital battle-front and news of the walking wounded. Her own experience of marriage had not been happy. Ernest had betrayed her many times with other women and by now had left her. He did, though, make provision for her in his will. By general consent Love at Second Sight is her finest novel. It has been reissued by Virago with the two earlier ones, Love's Shadow and Tenterhooks containing the same central characters. All three are published in one volume as The Little Ottleys with an introduction by Nicola Beauman. Ada the novelist is not to everyone's taste but if you once fall for her understated conversational manner you become completely hooked. Colin MacInnes, one of her most zealous admirers, led the current revival. There is an earlier family biography by her daughter Violet Wyndham, a memoir by her grandson Francis Wyndham, and section on her in Osbert Sitwell's Noble Essences. After the war it was the Sitwells who replaced the Wilde circle as the centre of her social life. Julie Speedie's book is subtitled 'the biography of Ada Leverson'; it might have been more accurate to have described it as 'a biography' because though it is very thoroughly researched and informative, it seems possible there could be another, more at ease with its heroine and less slow-footed.</p>

The  resolution implies a timetable of three weeks by asking the UN  secretary general to proceed with a longer report on the result  of his efforts to finalize the agreement by the end of March.    According to our New York correspondent Apostolis  Zoumbanioti, UN circles expect that by the end of this month the  talks in Nicosia will have made enough progress to make possible  direct meetings between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish  Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas in New York. The same circles  consider 29 March the most probable date for Mr. Kliridhis and  Mr. Denktas to visit New York.    The resolution further welcomes the fact that the intensive  discussions made it possible for the UN secretary general's  representatives to promote ideas which, it is noted, could  facilitate the talks aimed at achieving agreement on the key  issues for implementation of the CBM's.    The resolution, which bears the number 902, stresses that  the  CBM's are neither an end in themselves nor a substitute for the  broader political process. It also notes that the CBM's will  offer significant advantages to both communities and will  facilitate the political process for the achievement of an  overall settlement.    At the same time, the resolution reiterates the Security  Council's position that the status quo in Cyprus is  unacceptable. The resolution also notes that the Security  Council will proceed with an extensive review of the issue on  the basis of a relevant provision of Resolution 789 and on the  basis of the report that the UN Secretary General will submit.</p>

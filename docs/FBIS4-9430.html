			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Dan Hruby and </F> Bohumil Pecinka; place and date not given: "I am No Longer an  Icebreaker"]    [Text] Until quite recently, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus (52) was, for the majority of our citizens, rather like an  icebreaker that assiduously cuts through the ice floes and hauls  society forward. However, in recent months, he has seemed more  like a moderate politician, who customarily prefers constancy to  variety. This is a change. REFLEX asked: Why has it taken  place?    [Klaus] The most important thing of all is the era, which  has changed considerably. Previously, we were faced with  fundamental tasks, whereas now we are dealing with far more  subtle issues. If at one time it was necessary to chop away at  them with an icebreaker, now we are using far more delicate  instruments. This is the objective reality of our era. The  country has moved from the early transformation phase to the  posttransformation period. During the period of cutting through  with an icebreaker, there are also far more people on board with  you. When dealing with more delicate tasks, you notice that the  concurrent viewpoints on a whole host of issues have factually  evaporated. The era of the icebreakers has simply come to an  end.    [REFLEX] Does this mean that the era of systemic changes is  already behind us?    [Klaus] It is impossible to say that the era of systemic  changes came to an end on this or that day. I would use the  present continuous tense--it is coming to an end.    [REFLEX] Then the revolution is also coming to an end?    [Klaus] Is the revolution coming to an end? This seems to  me, in April 1994, to be a somewhat overdue question.    [REFLEX] The Democratic Union was formed recently. It  considers the November revolution to be incomplete and declares  itself to be a party for your disappointed voters....    [Klaus] From the little I know about this party, I would say  that it is an eleventh-hour party of permanent revolutionaries,  a party of people who have not understood the true size of the  rear-view mirror through which we look at what is behind us.  Theirs is bigger than the windshield of the car in which they  are traveling. On the other hand, these are people who have  obvious personal interests, and they are concealing them  partially by means of their strong-arm ideology.    [REFLEX] What do you say to their claim that the  establishment of the Democratic Union was brought about by Civic  Democratic Party [ODS] policy and that you are, in fact, the  father of this party?    [Klaus] By answering these questions, I am already according  this party more importance than it merits. The main driving  force behind this grouping is and will be the publisher of CESKY  DENIK, Mr. Kudlacek. I have to say that his views on our policy  were absolutely the same four years ago as they are today. The  ideological gap between us has not increased by a millimeter  since his first open letters in ANNONCE. Even then, his demands  were absurd, unrealistic, and oversimplified. I would recommend  that everyone read Mr. Kudlacek's articles.    [REFLEX] The fact is, it demoralizes the citizens when many  of the former StB [State Security] and KSC [Communist Party of  Czechoslovakia] top brass are conducting business unimpeded.  The radicals are even talking about a nomenklatura  capitalism...    [Klaus] I do not want to say that the quite unique  privatization of our economy, which, in the space of two or  three years, has gone from nothing to the current level of  two-thirds of the overall generation of the GDP in the private  sector, is a painless and idyllic social activity in which only  the best and most honest have succeeded. Unfortunately.  However, I cannot imagine this process being carried out in a  more rational way. Of course, it was possible to postpone and  slow down privatization. I am convinced, however, that the  price we would have to have paid for this delay would have been  infinitely higher. This is clear to see in many postcommunist  countries, where, as a consequence of hesitation, there has been  so-called spontaneous privatization and the results are now far  worse. There is speculation concerning the social groups in our  country from which successful businessmen recruit. I have to  say, however, that nothing can be done about this at the moment.  These people either have the ability of innovators or not. The  state can do nothing for them. The "Heroes of Our Time" in the  economic sphere are not the state's civil servants, planners, or  ministers. The "Heroes of Our Time" are the entrepreneurs,  managers, and businessmen who come up with the ideas, whether  these concern a new enterprise, product, or technology.    [REFLEX] Many people voted for you because they felt you  have a clear vision of society's further development. Are you  not now concerned, when many people are abandoning the  icebreaker, and mundane problems, including the endless  coalition disputes, are cropping up that this vision is being  lost from sight?    [Klaus] I would not confuse the clear vision of society's  development and the everyday political squabbles within the  coalition. The vision is something infinitely more profound,  and the political level only forms a small part of it.  Therefore, I do not believe that our citizens are losing this  vision. Nothing I see around me bears this out. The period of  more subtle conflict among the ideas about the future is just  beginning. This is natural in a pluralist society. In 1990,  the main conflict was between visions of East and West. The  basic slogan of these elections was "Back to Europe." Now this  slogan is trivial. Everyone, so to speak, can ascribe to it.  People have matured so much that they are able to ask  supplementary questions. We are no longer asking if there  should be a market or planned economy here, but we are dealing  with how interventionist the market economy should be, how it  should be regulated, and how socially encumbered it should be.  That is, I do not view today's disputes as a loss of the  overall vision but as a progression of the pluralist views  within it. These are simply disputes on one side of the  barricade.    [REFLEX] Despite this, however, these "disputes on one side  of the barricade"--for example, among the coalition parties--may  put people off or provoke disillusionment....    [Klaus] I would not be so dramatic. The coalition is here  so that it can debate in a coalition manner. This is logical.  If only one party were in power, there would be "coalition"  disputes among its ranks by way of a change. When I see the  problems within the coalition governments in Germany, France,  and Italy, I do not feel that our coalition is in any way  exceptional.    [REFLEX] Does this mean that the citizens should get used to  the fact that the current situation is quite normal?    [Klaus] The citizens should get used to it, and I think they  have long been used to it. Instead, I would ask reporters to go  for the facts and not whether this or that coalition politician  has said something clever or stupid.    [REFLEX] The modern history of the Czech lands is associated  with left-wing traditions, which culminated so oppressively  after February 1948. You are now coming up with a program for  complete privatization and economic liberalism; however, these  very ideas represent a heterogeneous element in our environment.  Could it turn out that the only political role you and the  entire ODS will play in Czech history will actually be the role  of an icebreaker during the period of transitional changes and  that later you will lose widespread support because society will  return to its traditional views?    [Klaus] The role of a politician must always be far more  dynamic, and his vision must be far more definitive than the  average vision of society and than would correspond to the  actuality of the country in question. If you want to swing the  pendulum in an attempt to reach the point at which it turns  back, you have to strike it with far greater force. At the same  time, it is clear that the pendulum will again fall back a  little. This is a fundamental dispute that will never end.  There will always be a constant clash of ideas here when the  issue involves the side to which the pendulum will swing. So,  the fact that my ideology is more right-wing than would  correspond to the traditions of this country is absolutely in  order. The task of a politician is to hoist and tighten the  sails and follow the course plotted.    [REFLEX] Do you think that this left-wing tradition "in us"  could be altered by the post-November developments, especially  mass privatization?    [Klaus] Here we must, first and foremost, answer the  question on the role of tradition in forming political, social,  and cultural--simply, all--views of the world. Apart from this  historical vertical axis of traditions, there is also a  horizontal factor--that is, to what extent events in the  surrounding world influence us. Let us go a bit further: Is it  possible to extricate ourselves from this vertical axis of  traditions and the horizontal axis of external influences and,  by means of our own shrewd policy, push general views forward?  This is the third factor that determines society's orientation.  I personally believe that the past will not pull us back too  much. The social democratic or pseudosocialist tradition in our  country was considerably overturned by the advent of communism,  and it thus suffered far more breaches than in the countries of  Western Europe. There, this tradition was far from being  suppressed, devastated, and more or less negated by the  experiences of the past 50 years. Therefore, I am not concerned  that our citizens would be too enticed by the socialist ideas of  the first half of the 20th century.    [REFLEX] What, then, are you concerned about?    [Klaus] I am a little concerned about the horizontal axis.  The Western ideological world is positioned a little differently  than I would like. The gravitational pull to the left will come  from Western Europe--that is, from our natural environment  rather than from our own past.    [REFLEX] However, you also mentioned a third factor....    [Klaus] This represents everything that we ourselves are  capable of pushing through, asserting, and emphasizing. I  believe that we are not helpless against the influences from our  past and the surrounding world. I am not a pessimist about  this. We have strength, independence, and reasoning, and so we  also have hopes of preserving a certain Czech specificity into  the future.    [REFLEX] Specificity in what?    [Klaus] Our Republic gravitates more toward the West than  the other postcommunist countries, but, on the other hand, it is  more aware of the danger of collectivist theories than Western  countries. It is in this very area--and I am saying this without  any arrogance--that I see a certain role for us within the  Pan-European context.    [REFLEX] Do you think it is possible in present-day Western  Europe to discern any trend that society there would orient  itself more to the right or to the left?    [Klaus] The period of time between an idea being formulated,  implemented, and, finally, becoming firmly rooted throughout  society is very long. Despite the fact that the 1960's and the  1970's saw a marked ideological swing to the right, left-wing  state interventionism reached its peak during this period.  Then, at the beginning of the 1980's, politicians like Ronald  Reagan and Margaret Thatcher grasped the new ideas and began to  put them into political practice in their countries. However, I  will not speculate about whether the third phase has already  been achieved--that is, when these ideas have definitively  penetrated the citizens' consciousness. Nevertheless, today we  can all see that, in the ideological sphere, which precedes  reality, the pendulum in Western Europe is beginning to swing  back to the left. So, there will still be something to contend  with in the ideological sphere.    [REFLEX] You said that the experience with communism in our  country has discredited socialist ideas. However, in Poland and  Lithuania, for example, they have had the same experience, but  still the postcommunists won the free elections there....    [Klaus] In these countries, compared with the Czech  Republic, the development of the political system is less  evolved. The political forces there are still political  movements that are not ideologically precisely defined. They  are fronts for something or forums against someone. This means  that the structure of political life there is proceeding  otherwise than along a right-left line. In policy, the forces  there are more rational and less rational, more pragmatic or  less pragmatic, more or less organized, and these differences  are more important than right-left polarity. This means that  the forces that won the elections in these countries may be more  rational at a given moment and the governments more capable.    [REFLEX] Does this also apply to Slovakia?    [Klaus] Yes.    [REFLEX] We had originally intended this interview to be a  summary of a specific period. However, it now seems to us that  this is not the right time to take a look at what has happened.  For example, the issues of restitution and the senate have not  been dealt with. When do you think the time will be right to  take a look at these issues?    [Klaus] Any time is right for taking a look around. I do  not understand, however, why you two should consider the issues  of the senate and restitution to be the dominant issues facing  our society. These are absolutely marginal issues that do not  concern the essence of this country. It is only certain  politicians that incessantly and artificially drag them to the  forefront. However, I do not believe that we should write the  history of this state during the past four years according to  them. I do not believe that these are the issues that people  talk about every day over a pint in the pub or around the dinner  table at home.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / No such thing as free lunch for senators The spectre of Mr Ross Perot strode through the halls of Congress this week as the Senate, in a mood of uncomfortable self-flagellation, voted 95-4 to ban its members from accepting presents, meals, free travel and sports and arts tickets from anybody who might remotely resemble a lobbyist. The Senate bill now must be reconciled with one already passed by the House. Congressmen, on average much less wealthy than senators, were also less firmly into self-denial, banning most meals and gifts but permitting paid-for travel and other freebies. Sponsors of the Senate bill, sounding just like the populist billionaire from Texas and 1992 independent presidential candidate, said action was necessary to dispel the popular image of a Congress stuffed with freeloading junketeers and deeply in hock to 'Gucci gulch' lobbyists, including, most darkly, those representing foreign interests. The bill permits gifts only from family members, unquestioned close friends and home state interests, with any present worth more than Dollars 250 (Pounds 170) subject to approval by the ethics committee. In debate last week several senators said the bill was unnecessary and would harm the Washington restaurant trade and charities willing to pay the expenses of politicians involved in fundraising events, such as galas and golf tournaments. But the final vote showed how few senators were willing to go on record as opposing a populist demand. A similar nervousness was shown last month when the Senate only narrowly defeated a bill that would have taken away free parking places at Washington's airports. Almost every senator up for re-election this year voted to remove this 'perk'. Cynics also believe that by focusing on freebies Congress is creating cover for ducking action on campaign finance reform, reasonably seen as the root problem of the relationship between elected representatives and special interests. It emerged this week, for example, that the medical and insurance industries had contributed, perfectly legally, no less than Dollars 600,000 this year to the campaign coffers of the 11 congressmen sitting on the House ways and means subcommittee with jurisdiction over healthcare reform.</p>

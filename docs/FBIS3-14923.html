			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Feb 28, BNS -- The problems in  Russian-Lithuanian relations would cease to exist if Lithuania  would reply to Russia's numerous proposals concerning military  transit through Lithuania's territory as well as defining  economic zone boundaries, Sergey Prikhodko, a high-ranking  official at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said today in an  interview to the Baltic News Service.    Commenting on Lithuanian Foreign Ministry notes on  unsanctioned transit through Lithuanian territory of Russian  armored troops and on Russia's exploitation of an oil field in  the Baltic Sea near the Lithuanian resort Nida, Prikhodko said  the Russian Foreign Ministry deals with them in the course of  everyday work. "We shall go them over and a reply will be  forthcoming," the Russian diplomat stated.    "Naturally collisions may occur," Prikhodko said, "and we  shall provide exhaustive explanations for the concrete  complaints Lithuania has made."    The Russian official maintained, however, that disagreements  might not arise if Moscow received as soon as possible an answer  to its proposals to conclude an agreement on military transit  through Lithuania's territory to and from the Kaliningrad region  that would "clearly and unambiguously fix the rights and  obligations of both parties."    In a comment on the oil field issue, Prikhodko said  Lithuania  received long ago Russian proposals on delimiting economic zone  boundaries, but there has been no reply.    Prikhodko noted that Russia has submitted a total of 24  draft  agreements for consideration by Lithuania.</p>

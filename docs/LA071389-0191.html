			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DUKAKIS' BUDGET CUTS STIR OUTCRIES  </P> <P> Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who campaigned for President last year touting his  so-called "Massachusetts Miracle" and his managerial and budget-balancing  ability, today slashed a half-billion dollars in state spending in a move that  brought outcries from the poor and the infirm.  </P> <P> The decision, after a yearlong feud with a Democratic-controlled Legislature,  is expected to eliminate more than 3,000 state jobs and generate mass layoffs  in local governments dependent on state funds.  </P> <P> "I am today doing the worst thing I have ever had to do in my political life,"  Dukakis said in signing a $12.15-billion budget for the fiscal year that began  July 1. The total represents $491 million less than the budget sent him by the  Legislature on June 30.  </P></p>

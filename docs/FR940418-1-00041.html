			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California tiger salamander was designated as a category 2 candidate for listing in the November 21, 1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 58804). A category 2 candidate is a species for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats is not currently available to support proposals for listing. In a petition dated February 20, 1992, and received on February 26, 1992, Dr. H. Bradley Shaffer of the University of California, Davis, requested the Service list the California tiger salamander as an endangered species. The petition cited numerous threats to the species, including habitat loss and fragmentation, predation by introduced species, and other anthropogenic factors. The Service announced its 90-day petition finding in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54545), which concluded that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the California tiger salamander. Most of the remaining range of the California tiger salamander is imminently threatened by urban development, conversion of natural habitat to agriculture, introduction of exotic predatory animals, and/or other anthropogenic factors (e.g., rodent control programs, vehicular-related mortality). However, several populations inhabiting refuges, parks, and other public lands are threatened only by exotic predators and stochastic events that may, in time, result in local extirpation. Moreover, tiger salamander localities in portions of the Diablo Range, inner Coast Ranges, and Sierra Nevada foothills are not significantly threatened at the present time. Coupled with the species' wide-ranging distribution (i.e., infrequently scattered population localities over 250 miles in 24 California counties) and relatively large number of remaining breeding localities, the species will not face extinction if recovery is temporarily postponed. Therefore, the Service concludes that the threats facing the species are moderate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service concludes as a result of its status review that sufficient information is currently available to support a proposed rule to classify the species as endangered or threatened. According to Service policy announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 12, 1993 (58 FR 28034), such species are placed in category 1 and assigned a listing priority number. Guidelines for assigning proper listing priorities were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 21, 1983 (48 FR 43098). Consequently, given the moderate yet imminent threats facing the California tiger salamander throughout its range, the Service hereby assigns the California tiger salamander a listing priority number of 8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the current fiscal year that began on October 1, 1993, the Service in central and northern California is making expeditious progress to propose and list at least 49 high priority taxa (38 species in eight listing packages with a listing priority of 2, 9 species in four listing packages with a listing priority of 3, and 2 species in a listing package with a listing priority of 6). In light of these ongoing listing efforts involving plants and animals that are imminently and highly threatened, the Service finds the petition to be warranted but precluded by pending listing actions on higher priority species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Author  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary author of this document is Peter C.

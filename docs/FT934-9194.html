			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Estate pre-tax falls MITSUBISHI Estate, the Japanese property developer and agent, reported a 5.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y30.98bn (Dollars 286m). This was despite a 43 per cent increase in first-half sales following the recovery of domestic demand for apartments. Japanese property companies have been forced to discount rents and selling prices on new buildings, as a surge in construction during the past four years has left larger cities with a glut of commercial and luxury residential properties. Mitsubishi is fortunate in having large holdings in the Otemachi business district of Tokyo. However, more recently, it has ventured into new areas, including Yokohama, where prices and rents have fallen sharply. Sales for the period were Y204.3bn, up from Y142.5bn in the first half last year. Apart from an increase in demand for standard apartments, rent income was boosted by the completion of two large complexes, though profits were eroded by the resulting increase in depreciation charges. For the full year to March, Mitsubishi Estate is forecasting sales of Y430bn, against Y349bn last year, and a pre-tax profit of Y50bn, compared with Y70.6bn. Net profit is expected to be unchanged at Y37bn.</p>

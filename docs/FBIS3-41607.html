			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. P. Mozhin, member of the Russian Academy of </F> Agricultural Sciences: ``The Organizing Principle of the  System'']    [Text] The system, that is, of active promotion of  the improvement of the environmental situation in the country  and the provision for the population's environmental safety  through the mobilization of nonbudgetary financial resources and  organization of their rational utilization--that Is How V. P.  Mozhin, member of the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences,  views the Federal Environmental Foundation.    The Law on Protection of the Environment envisages the  establishment of a unified system of nonbudgetary state  environmental foundations--federal, republic, kray, oblast and  local foundations. They are supposed to take part in solving  urgent environmental-protection problems, restoring losses in  the natural environment, compensating for damage that has been  caused, and carrying out other environmental-protection  measures. This system started functioning in practical terms a  year ago.    The foundations' financial resources--ZELENYY MIR's  readers know this--are being created in accordance with  established normative rates, through the payments of enterprises  and organizations that pollute the environment and fines for the  violation of environmental-protection legislation. The law  specifies that 60 percent of the money received by environmental  foundations is to be used for environmental-protection measures  at the city and rayon level 30 percent is to be used for  measures at the kray and oblast level; and 10 percent is to be  allocated to the Federal Environmental Foundation, whose  activities have been of interest to ZELENYY MIR's readers with  increasing frequency.    We believe that the following article by Academician V.  L. Mozhin, chairman of that foundation's board, contains answers  to most of the questions ZELENYY MIR has received about what the  foundation's money will be spent on and what problems its board  envisages tackling.    At present, in connection with the reduction of budgetary  financing, the nonbudgetary environmental foundations are  becoming one of the main investors in environmental-protection  activities.    Over the past year the monies of the Federal Environmental  Foundation were used for a broad spectrum of environmental  measures. The greatest share went for participation in the  financing of research and development on resource-conserving  types of machinery and technology and control systems.  Substantial funds were invested in the development and  outfitting of nature preserves, national parks and nature  reserves. Financial support was provided to organizations  engaged in the environmental enlightenment and education of the  public, and in various environmental publications.    To improve the activities of the whole system of  foundations,  serious work needs to be done on improving the normative rates  of payments for pollution, a number of legal questions need to  be resolved, and correct approaches, criteria and priorities in  choosing specific environmental-protection measures to be  financed out of the environmental foundations' monies need to be  gradually figured out.    It appears that the monies of the Federal Environmental  Foundation should be spent mainly for measures that ar of  statewide significance.    In the system of instruments for the implementation of state  policy in the area of environmental protection, an extremely  important place belongs to interstate, federal and regional  programs for addressing the most urgent environmental problems.  These programs, which so far exist only in the form of drafts,  have been adopted by the Federal Environmental Foundation as its  main guidelines in selecting measures for financing.    The Waste Program. The total amount of all types  of accumulated wastes in the Russian Federation comes to about  50 billion tonnes; and the storage of them occupies about  250,000 hectares of land space. Every year about 75 million  tonnes of hazardous industrial wastes are formed. The purpose of  the program is to meet one condition for the country's  environmentally safe development: the stabilization and eventual  reduction of environmental pollution and saving of natural  resources through the maximum possible use of wastes in the  economy.    The Ozone Program. The goal of the program is to  ensure the step-by-step reduction of the production of  ozone-destroying compounds, and the putting into production and  use of ozone-safe coolants.    The Provision for the Conservation and Rational  Utilization of Lake Baykal's Natural Resources Program. The  program's goal is to ensure the stable development of the Baykal  region and the restoration of Lake Baykal's unique ecosystems.    The Rational Utilization of Water Resources and  Restoration of Water Quality Program, subprogram: The  Saving and Rational Utilization of Water Resources in Moscow and  Improvement of the Reliability of Its Water Supply (in the  period up to 2000). The program's goal is the conservation and  rational utilization of water resources, the development and  implementation of measures to improve the quality of surface and  ground waters, the development and introduction of  environmentally clean water-use technologies, and the  development of methods and equipment for the treatment of  effluent and methods of intensifying the self-cleansing of  bodies of water, including the attainment, in stages, of  drinking-water quality in water-supply sources and bodies of  water.    The Improvement of the Environmental Situation and  Enhancement of the Volga Basin's Resource and Economic Potential  (Revival of the Volga) Program. The need to develop the  program stems from the especially complex environmental  situation in the Volga basin. The program's goal is to improve  the environmental situation in the Volga River basin.    The Ecological Improvement of the Environment and  Protection of the Health of the Population of Tula Oblast in  1993-1994 and in the Long Range up to 2000. The program's  goal is to carry out an experiment in Tula Oblast in working out  economic, organizational and legal methods for the ecological  improvement of its territory and protection of the population's  health.    The program has been approved by the Russian Federation  government.    The Russia's Participation in Improving the  Environmental Situation in the Sea Basins and the Arctic  Program. The program's goal is the stabilization and  improvement of the environmental situation in the basins of  international seas; the provision of required scientific  research for and development of specific measures at industrial  and agricultural enterprises and in municipal services; and the  provision for the protection and rational utilization of the  natural resources of the Russian Arctic.    The Protection and Restoration of the Species Diversity  of Fauna and Flora, and the Preservation of the Biota's Gene  Pool Program. The program's goal is to ensure the  nonexhaustive use of fauna and flora, and the development of new  methods for preserving the gene pool and species diversity of  flora and fauna. The idea here is to finance work to develop and  support a system of especially protected natural territories.    Obviously, the development and implementation of the  aforementioned programs will require many billions in outlays  and fairly long time periods, and the Federal Environmental  Foundation's financial capabilities will make it possible to  take part in this work only within certain limits. But what is  important is that, in selecting environmental-protection  measures for financing, we will proceed on the basis of their  importance to the implementation of the indicated programs,  which are aimed at solving the most urgent problems.    In addition, the foundation is proposing to take part on a  shared basis in the implementation of pilot programs for the  development of certain environmental-protection and  resource-conserving technological processes, units and  production processes.    In accordance with the Statute on the Russian Federation  Federal Environmental Foundation, it is also planned to provide  financing for measures for the environmental upbringing and  education of the population.    Financing of the development and implementation of specific  programs and individual measures will be carried out in  accordance with the Statute on the Russian Federation Federal  Environmental Foundation and on the basis of statements of  requirement and technical and economic feasibility studies  presented by clients of programs or projects.    The results of the activities of the environmental  foundations' system will in large part depend on the success  achieved in organizing the joint work of the federal and  territorial foundations.    The strengthening of the Federal Environmental Foundation's  financial base is also a top priority. So far its financial  capabilities are limited by the fact that some of the  territorial environmental foundations have not been reallocating  it the 10 percent deductions stipulated by law. In 1992 there  were 24 such foundations (the foundations of 12 republics in the  Russian Federation, six national okrugs and six oblasts). This  year the environmental foundations of the following republics  continue to evade the reallocation of monies to the Federal  Environmental Foundation: Bashkortostan, Tatarstan,  Kalmykia-Khalm Tangch and Dagestan; the Kabardino-Balkar,  Karachayevo-Cherkess and Chechen krays; and Krasnodar, Maritime,  Voloda, Sverdlovsk, Irkutsk and Sakhalin oblasts.    In order to expand the financial capabilities of the  nonbudgetary environmental foundations' system, it would be a  good idea to establish an Environmental Bank. The establishment  the foundation projects of a Center for Business Cooperation in  the Area of Environmental Protection would contribute to the  concentration of information on the latest equipment and  technologies, and to the improvement of publishing activities in  the field of environmental protection.</p>

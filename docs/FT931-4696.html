			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Pips . . .but very few great expectations: Savers may find the chancellor has spending on his mind. Philip Coggan reads the signals - Spring Budget SAVERS might not expect the chancellor to offer them many incentives when he unveils his Budget next week. With the economy at best showing tentative signs of recovery the government naturally wants consumers to spend, not save, their money. But there is one area where there might be a tax carrot for savers. The budget deficit is widely expected to reach Pounds 50bn in 1993-94, requiring the government to sell substantial amounts of gilt-edged stock. Encouraging private investors to buy these gilts might take the pressure off the principal buyers, the investment institutions. One much-touted theory is that personal equity plans, which allow investors to accumulate gains and dividends from shares tax-free, might be expanded to include gilts (and be renamed personal investment plans or Pips). With net returns from building societies now about 3 per cent to 4 per cent, private investors might be lured into buying gilts on tax-free yields of 8 per cent. Mr Jeremy Hancock of Price Waterhouse says the creation of Pips would cost the government very little. The pension funds and institutions which would otherwise have bought the securities pay very little tax on their gilt income. But what then of the savings/spending question? Mr Robert Barrie, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, thinks the chancellor is more likely to encourage the corporate sector, than the personal sector, to spend. 'Big tax changes would be received very badly,' says Mr Barrie, 'so the best thing for the chancellor to do is very little.' Some believe, however, that the chancellor will act against personal savers. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young have suggested that the government might abolish Tessas (Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account), which allow savers to accumulate interest on deposits tax-free. But it was Mr John Major who introduced the Tessa in 1990 when he was chancellor (as part of a 'Budget for savers'). According to Mr Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies 'anything as radical as abolishing Tessas would be a major reversal of policy.' His alternative proposal is that Mr Lamont could remove the requirement that money be left in Tessas for five years to qualify for tax-free status. He says this might release a lot of funds into the economy immediately - according to the Inland Revenue about Pounds 11.5bn was in Tessa deposits at the end of June. One loophole that could go is the Business Expansion Scheme. The BES is due to be abolished at the end of the year. Financial groups have been so canny at exploiting the rules that money is flooding into schemes before the deadlines. Some estimate that Pounds 1bn could be raised through the BES this year, costing the Exchequer about Pounds 400m in tax relief. The chancellor could reduce the problem by stopping the so-called loan-backed schemes which allow investors to get tax-free returns of 20 per cent plus within six months. If the chancellor really wants to attack savings habits then he might look at the life assurance and pensions industries which, as the table shows, have taken half of savings inflows in recent years. There are difficulties in penalising existing plan holders. It is a long-standing tradition that tax changes should not apply retrospectively, and encouraging savers to withdraw from long-term commitments might lead them to pay penalties. Nevertheless, there are measures which could be taken. The government could abolish higher-rate tax relief on pension contributions. In the wake of the similar change to mortgage tax relief in 1991 this would be a step towards 'fiscal neutrality' (the removal of tax distortions) which the government has in the past expressed as an aim. Mr Johnson says this move would surprise him, since it would not raise a lot of money. Mr Johnson suggests that instead the chancellor might tax the lump sum which investors receive when they cash in their pension. It could be argued that this is one perk too many since pension fund contributions are already free of tax and the fund accumulates tax-free. The risk for Mr Lamont is that such technical changes might not discourage saving, simply redirect it. It might seem that the easiest way for the chancellor to discourage saving is to cut interest rates again. But the savings ratio (personal savings as a percentage of income, minus income tax, social security contributions and other financial transfers) reached 12.3 per cent in the third quarter of last year - its highest level since 1984. This was in spite of the cuts in the level of interest rates from 15 per cent to 10 per cent between 1990 and 1992. It could be that people are saving to build up a cash cushion in case they become unemployed, or to pay off previous debts. If that is the case it is the macro measures which the chancellor takes to stimulate the economy, not actions against small parts of the financial services industry, which will do most to change savings patterns. The savings industry will be hoping he thinks so.</p>

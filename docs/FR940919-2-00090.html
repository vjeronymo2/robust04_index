			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new process will result in correct decisions at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earliest possible point in the process. A correct disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision is one that appropriately considers whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual does or does not meet the factors of entitlement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability as defined by SSA's statute, regulations, rulings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies. Correct decisions in the new process depend on: a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplified decision methodology that provides a common frame of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference for deciding disability at all levels of the process;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent direction and training to all adjudicators; enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and targeted collection and development of medical evidence; an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automated and integrated claim processing system that will assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudicators in evidence gathering, analysis and decisionmaking;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a single, comprehensive quality review process across all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. The goal of the new process is to guide all adjudicators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at all levels of the process, who will be using the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for decisionmaking, to making correct decisions in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easier, faster, and more cost-effective manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A disability claim manager will handle most aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim at the initial level, thus eliminating many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps caused by numerous employees handling discrete parts of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim (handoffs) and the time lost as the claim waits at each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee's workstation to be handled (queues). This will reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time needed to rework files and redevelop information from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same evidentiary sources. Levels of appeal will be combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and improved, reducing the need to redevelop nonmedical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility factors after a favorable decision because less time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will have elapsed since initial filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new process will enable the current work force to handle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an increased number of claims, freeing the most highly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialized staff (physicians and ALJs) to work on those cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tasks that make the best use of their talents, and targeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures for medical evidence to those areas most useful in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees will perform a wider range of functions, using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their skills to their full potential, enabling them to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of claimants and minimize unnecessary rework. The new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process will facilitate employees' ability to do the total job by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing technology and the training and support to use that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> For ease of reference, references in this plan to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``SSA'' or ``employees'' include both Federal and State employees who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the disability process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Process Entry and Intake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Customized Intake and Entry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The disability claim entry and intake processes will reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SSA commitment to providing world-class service to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public. The hallmarks of the process will be accessible, personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service that ensures timely and accurate decisions. SSA will work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make potential claimants better informed about the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process and fully prepare them to participate in it. Every effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be made to provide services to meet the needs of culturally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverse, non-English speaking claimants. SSA will also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexible in providing modes of access to the claim process that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best meet the needs of claimants and the third parties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives who act on their behalf. SSA will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants with a single point of contact for all disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim-related business. Finally, SSA will ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability decisionmaking process promotes timely and accurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Making Program Information Available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA will make available to the general public comprehensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information packets about the DI and SSI disability programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> For ease of reference, references in this plan to the SSI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disability Program include the Program for those who are blind. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The packets will include information about the purpose of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability programs; the definition of disability; the basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the programs; a description of the adjudication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process; the types of evidence needed to establish disability;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the claimant's role in pursuing a claim. The packets may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customized locally to include referral information about other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and resources for legal representation. The goal is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target the information to likely beneficiaries and to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential claimants and other groups involved in the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process have a better understanding of SSA disability programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their medical and nonmedical requirements, and the nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmaking process. This should result in reduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general inquiries from members of the public unfamiliar with SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability programs and increase the number of claimants who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter the disability process knowledgeable and prepared to assume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for pursuing their claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will make disability information packets commonly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available in the community, both at facilities frequented by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general public (libraries, neighborhood resource centers, post  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices, the Department of Veterans Affairs offices, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal government installations) and at facilities frequented by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential claimants (hospitals, clinics, other health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers, schools, employer personnel offices, State public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance offices, insurance companies, and advocacy groups or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party organizations that assist individuals in pursuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claims). SSA studies have shown that claimants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently rely on advice from their physicians and from State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public assistance personnel in deciding whether to file a claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for disability benefits. Therefore, SSA will make a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to target its public information activities at these and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other known sources of referrals for claims. SSA will also make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability information packets available electronically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

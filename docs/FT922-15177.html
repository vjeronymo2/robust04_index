			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major tries to win the undecided AN APPEAL to the uncommitted to 'come and join us' came yesterday from Mr John Major as he led the Tories' attempt to win over floating voters in the final week of the campaign. The Tories believe that there are some 10m people who have not yet decided how to vote - a larger proportion of the electorate than is usual this close to polling day. Speaking at a party rally near Bath, Mr Major said: 'This is no time to be a 'don't know'. This is a time to fight for a positive future for our country.' He spelt out his aims for a Britain in which people had the incentive to work harder and create resources for better public services, and urged those who shared that vision to talk to people who were still uncertain. 'None of us can afford to stay on the sidelines. What is at stake is the future of Britain,' he said. Beyond presenting the positive Tory vision, however, Mr Major sounded a warning about what a Labour government would mean. He highlighted the choice between the Conservatives and the other parties on devolution, defence and Britain's role in Europe. Earlier on a visit to Bath, the marginal seat where party chairman Mr Chris Patten is under pressure from the Liberal Democrats, Mr Major was hit by an egg thrown from a crowd of demonstrators. Mr Christopher Chope, the roads minister, was struck in the face while campaigning in his Southampton Itchen constituency last night. Police were called as he was taken to a nearby house for first aid.</p>

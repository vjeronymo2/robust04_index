			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Eligibility Record Date, Priority to Depositors Residing in the Bank's Local Community, Priority of Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS Revisions require, among other things, that the record date established by a converting institution to determine which depositors will be afforded a priority in obtaining subscription rights in the conversion stock be set at no less than a year prior to the board of director's approval of the conversion. The Board believes, preliminarily, that, in order for a board of trustees of a State Savings Bank to carry out its fiduciary responsibilities to the bank and its depositors, the board must assure an equitable and lawful conversion process. From numerous comments we have received thus far and from our own review of proposed and completed conversions, it is apparent that so-called professional depositors, who place funds in mutual banks and savings associations throughout the country in order to gain a purchase priority if the institution converts to stock form, have reaped substantial profits on conversions of mutual institutions. A proper exercise of fiduciary responsibilities toward the bank and its longer-term depositors dictates that professional depositors not be allowed to experience windfall gains in conversions. Requiring that the eligibility record date be no less than one year prior to the board's adoption of the plan of conversion would help assure that longer-term depositors are more likely than professional depositors to benefit from the stock purchase priority. Thus, the proposed rule would require that the eligibility record date be no less than one year prior to the date the board of trustees approves the plan of conversion. The FDIC requests specific comment on whether the one-year period is sufficient and on whether the date chosen should be based on the board of trustees' first consideration of whether the bank should be converted to the stock form of ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a further effort to mitigate the exploitation of the mutual-to-stock conversion process by professional depositors, the proposed rule would provide a stock purchase preference to eligible depositors in the bank's ``local community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting bank. The term ``local community'' would be defined as all counties in which the converting bank has its home office or a branch office, each county's standard metropolitan statistical area or the general metropolitan area of each of these counties and such other area(s) as provided for in bank's plan of conversion. The Board believes that it is likely that the double requirement (for a stock purchase priority) of having a depositor relationship with the bank for at least one year prior to the date of the board's adoption of the plan of conversion and of having to reside in the bank's local community would decrease the participation of professional depositors in conversions of State Savings Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board is mindful, however, that there may be depositors, particularly long-term depositors, of a State Savings Banks who are not ``professional depositors,'' but happen to live outside the ``local community'' or the 100-mile area designated by the proposed requirement. Thus, the FDIC requests specific comment on whether and how such depositors can be included within the proposed stock purchase preference for ``local depositors.'' One possible alternative would be to expand the definition of ``local depositor'' to include all depositors who have had a deposit relationship with the bank for, say, three or five years prior to the board of trustees' adoption of the plan of conversion. The Board is interested in comments on all aspects of the proposed priority requirement for local depositors, including views on whether the requirement is necessary, sufficient and/or equitable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

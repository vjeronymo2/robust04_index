			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DRUG CLINIC: ALCOHOLISM AND 'WILLFUL MISCONDUCT' CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Question: Has anything been done about the recent Supreme Court decision that  said that the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism are considered to be the  result of willful misconduct?  </P> <P> Answer: The Supreme Court decision that you are referring to was made in April,  1988, in the case of Traynor and McKelvey vs. the Veterans Administration. It  said, in effect, that these two veterans, who are recovering alcoholics, were  ineligible to get an extension to utilize GI educational benefits. The decision  sparked a lot of indignation -- both pro and con. It also marshaled an  organized effort by the National Council on Alcoholism Inc. to change the  Supreme Court decision.  </P> <P> Congress enacted legislation on Oct. 20, 1988, that said, "The disabling  effects of chronic alcoholism shall not be considered to be the result of  willful misconduct." The President signed this legislation Nov. 18, 1988. Since  then the Veterans Administration has instructed all of its affiliates that the  new legislation is in effect. Anyone who may have regained eligibility for  educational benefits through the change should contact his or her local VA  office.  </P></p>

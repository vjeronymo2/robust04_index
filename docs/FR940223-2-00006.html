On January 24, 1994, respondent Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC) also alleged that the Department made ministerial errors in its final determination. On January 31, 1994, petitioners submitted comments on the ministerial error allegations submitted by CBCC. Also on January 31, 1994, Minasligas submitted comments on the ministerial error allegations submitted by petitioners. All allegations and comments were timely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise subject to this investigation is ferrosilicon (FeSi), a ferroalloy generally containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, more than eight percent but not more than 96 percent silicon, not more than 10 percent chromium, not more than 30 percent manganese, not more than three percent phosphorous, less than 2.75 percent magnesium, and not more than 10 percent calcium of any other element. For a complete description of the merchandise covered by this investigation, see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Brazil (59 FR 732, January 6, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ministerial Error Allegations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 21, 1994, petitioners alleged that the Department made several ministerial errors in its final determination. First, petitioners state that the Department improperly included home market ``credit expenses'' reported by two respondents, Minasligas and CBCC, in the price that was compared to the monthly cost of production (COP) for purposes of the COP test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with petitioners that this constitutes a ministerial error and have recalculated accordingly. In this investigation, we intended to make contemporaneous comparisons by comparing the price at the time of shipment to the replacement cost in the month of shipment. However, our comparisons were not contemporaneous because the COP in one month was compared to a price charged in the same month which included an adjustment for anticipated inflation. We thus determine that this constitutes an unintentional ministerial error as defined at 19 CFR 353.28(d). As a result of our recalculation, U.S. sales for both companies are now being compared to constructed value (CV). For the one U.S. sale made by Minasligas for which Minasligas did not report CV information, we indexed period of investigation (POI) average costs to February 1993 using International Monetary Fund's Brazilian wholesale price index. For two U.S. sales made by CBCC shipped outside the POI, CBCC incorrectly reported direct selling expenses. We calculated the direct selling expenses for these sales as a percentage of cost of manufacture based on CBCC's actual experience for each month of the POI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, petitioners claim the Department erroneously imputed negative U.S. credit expenses for Minasligas by treating the first date on which Minasligas borrowed from U.S. advance exchange contracts as the date of payment by the purchaser (Minasligas received the first draw from the advance exchange contract prior to the date of shipment). In addition, petitioners claim we incorrectly used a cruzeiro-denominated interest rate to calculate Minasligas' negative U.S. credit figures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree with petitioners. We note that we accounted for actual expenses associated with the advance exchange contracts by making a circumstance of sale adjustment to foreign market value (FMV). Regarding the use of the first versus the second advance exchange contract payment date as well as the use of the monthly cruzeiro-denominated interest rate for calculating U.S. credit, these decisions are discussed in the final determination concurrence memorandum. Accordingly, we do not consider these issues to constitute ministerial errors, as defined in 19 CFR 353.28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, petitioners claim the Department inaccurately imputed home market credit expenses by assuming Minasligas had reported 30 day interest rates for each transaction. We agree with petitioners that this is a ministerial error. We recalculated home market imputed credit expenses to accurately reflect the actual interest rate for each transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, petitioners claim we wrongly allowed a monetary correction offset of loans in our calculation of interest expenses for COP. We disagree with petitioners. We followed our normal practice of adjusting financial expenses to compensate for the effects of hyperinflation so that only the actual interest expenses are reflected. Therefore, petitioners' claim does not constitute a ministerial error as defined by 19 CFR 353.28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 21, 1994, respondent Minasligas alleged that the Department made a ministerial error in its final determination. Minasligas claims that, because we used incorrect figures in two instances, we erroneously calculated Minasligas' general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses. We agree with Minasligas that this is a ministerial error and have recalculated Minasligas' G&amp;A expenses accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 24, 1994, respondent CBCC alleged that the Department made several ministerial errors in its final determination. First, CBCC claims that we failed to use the correct interest expense ratio for CV purposes. We agree with CBCC that the incorrect interest expense ratio was used for CV purposes, and have changed our calculation accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, CBCC claims that we double-counted inventory holding gain/loss in our calculation of the CV related to a December U.S. sale. We disagree with CBCC. Inventory holding gain/loss was appropriately accounted for in the calculation of CV. However, we have removed inventory carrying costs from our analysis as it is not our policy to include this element in purchase price calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, CBCC argues that we used an incorrect monthly ``Unidade Fiscal de Referencia'' figure in our depreciation calculation. CBCC claims we did not consider the ``special depreciation'' which was mandated by the Brazilian Government to compensate for the period in which Brazilian companies were prohibited from recognizing depreciation. CBCC claims the result is that we used an incorrect multiplier, thus overstating depreciation expense. We disagree with CBCC that we used an incorrect multiplier and that our depreciation expense calculation was overstated. Thus, we find that the calculation does not contain a ministerial error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

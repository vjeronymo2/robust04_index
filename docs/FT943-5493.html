			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UAPT extends time frame for bids UAPT-Infolink, the credit reference company caught in a bidding war, has altered its articles of association so that offers for the company can proceed. The group is being fought over by Equifax, the US credit data group, which is now offering 650p a share against its original offer of 500p, and Trans Union, Equifax's main US rival, which is offering 550p. UAPT's board had recommended Trans Union's lower offer, which was to have closed on August 31, because Trans Union has no UK operations and so does not risk a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Equifax already owns a credit information business in the UK. However, UAPT's board has now rescinded its recommendation, effectively leaving the outcome of the bidding war to the OFT.</p>

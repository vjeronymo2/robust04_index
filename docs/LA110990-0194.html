			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY CAP TEST SCORES ARE ABOVE STATE AVERAGE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THIRD-, SIXTH- AND EIGHTH-GRADE STUDENTS AND HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS  IMPROVE IN MATH. BUT READING RESULTS DECLINE SLIGHTLY FOR THE ELEMENTARY AND  INTERMEDIATE STUDENTS.  </P> <P> Ventura County students scored above the statewide average on the California  Assessment Program test last spring, gaining ground over previous county scores  in math but losing slightly in reading.  </P> <P> Among the 28,431 students who took the test countywide, third- to eighth-grade  reading scores declined by one to three points over last year, but seniors'  scores rose five points.  </P> <P> Math scores rose in all grades tested, with increases ranging from three to  nine points.  </P> <P> The CAP test, given in the spring to third-, sixth- and eighth-grade students  and in the fall to seniors, covers a variety of subject areas including math,  reading and writing, as well as history, science and social science for  eighth-grade students.  </P> <P> Scores are well above state averages in several districts, including Oak Park  Unified, Conejo Valley Unified, Moorpark Unified and Pleasant Valley Elementary  districts.  </P> <P> The 18,000-student Simi Valley Unified District, already above both state and  countywide averages, showed increases last year in most areas.  </P> <P> "We're following the state framework, which means more reading, writing and  literature across the curriculum, and definitely that helps in the area of  language arts," Associate Supt. Allan Jacobs said.  </P> <P> Some of the county's lowest scores are in Santa Paula's Briggs Elementary  School District, Santa Paula Elementary, Fillmore Unified, Oxnard's Rio  Elementary and Oxnard Elementary, among others.  </P> <P> In the Briggs district, reading scores fell in every grade tested, plunging 54  points in sixth grade.  </P> <P> "I'm not quite sure what happened," Briggs Supt. Carol Vines said. She said  several factors may have contributed to the decline, including misleading  reports on the number of students who speak limited English.  </P> <P> Some students who have achieved a level of competency in English on a state  exam may still not be fluent, she said.  </P> <P> Also, three of 12 teachers in the district were new last year, she said. "I  think mostly it was inexperience in preparing the students. I'm not saying it's  the teachers' fault, but sometimes when you get new staff that happens."  </P> <P> Vines said the district hired a consultant to spend a day with teachers working  on techniques that can be used daily to prepare students for the kinds of  questions asked on the test.  </P> <P> Scores were also lower than the state average in the Rio district, with  declines ranging from 11 to 15 points in reading, and from one to 10 points in  math. Supt. Peter Rogalsky said district officials will do a school-by-school  analysis of the scores when they receive a detailed report later this year.  </P> <P> In addition to ranking districts statewide, the CAP report compares districts  with other districts such as theirs, taking into consideration economic  background and parents' education. The Rio district declined in both rankings.  </P> <P> "We're not satisfied," Rogalsky said. "We should be holding our own with other  districts and schools that are like ours. We didn't do so well."  </P> <P> As in the Briggs district, Rogalsky said the number of Rio students who speak  limited English was "very, very grossly under-reported. . . . It may have been  somewhere where we failed to make the right mark on the transmittal sheet."  </P> <P> The number of limited-English-speakers in third grade last year was reported at  13.7%, for example, but in fact was closer to 30%, Rogalsky said.  </P> <P> Scores can vary widely from year to year in very small districts especially,  administrators said, because a few students in a small school who do either  very well or very poorly can affect a school's overall score.  </P> <P> At the one-school, 30-student Santa Clara Elementary District, for example, the  third-grade reading score skyrocketed 132 points to a near-perfect 395, putting  the school in the top 1% of schools in the state in that category.  </P> <P> However, the entire third-grade class at Santa Clara consisted of only five  students. The previous year, there were six third-grade students, whose reading  scores were 127 points lower than their predecessors.  </P> <P> "When you're dealing with three to five children being tested, it can vary  greatly," said Ruth Metcalf, Santa Clara principal and one of the district's  two teachers. "If one child has a great deal of difficulty, and you only have  four kids, that's 25% who might do very badly."  </P> <P> In the 15,000-student Ventura Unified School District, scores declined in most  subject areas. Sixth-grade reading scores, for example, were 275, down eight  points from 1988-89 and a total of 19 points from 1987-88. Still, this year's  sixth-grade reading scores are 14 points above the state average and the same  as the average score countywide.  </P> <P> District officials are somewhat concerned about the declines, said Michael  Sellwood, director of administrative services.  </P> <P> "That's obviously not the direction for the district to be going," Sellwood  said. "Obviously, we want to look at that trend and try to adjust it."  </P> <P> However, Ventura Unified students' scores remain above statewide averages in  all areas.  </P> <P> Scores in the Oak Park Unified School District ranged from the top 3% to the  top 15% statewide in all subject areas.  </P> <P> However, Oak Park Supt. Susan Hearn criticized the test as outdated when  compared with what teachers are doing in the classroom, which is dictated by  state curriculum frameworks.  </P> <P> The sixth-grade CAP writing test, for example, measures knowledge of  punctuation, capitalization and other language usage, Hearn said. However,  teachers are "emphasizing content, how kids say what it is they're trying to  say."  </P> <P> Likewise, the CAP math test concentrates on computation skills at the  sixth-grade level, but in state guidelines that are followed in the classroom,  computation is one of seven areas of emphasis, including statistics, geometry  and problem-solving, Hearn said.  </P> <P> Also, teachers concentrate "more on why an answer is correct, rather than just  getting to the correct answer," Hearn said.  </P> <P> But Hearn said the CAP test remains valuable in assessing how well students are  learning.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed funds for CAP tests from the 1990-91 state  budget, and it is uncertain whether the funding will be restored by Gov.-elect  Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> If the test is not administered, Hearn said, the "lapse, I think, is going to  be very unfortunate."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW TO READ THE SCORES  </P> <P> These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth  and eighth grades.  </P> <P> State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess  schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores.  </P> <P> Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between  approximately 100 and 400, although a few scores may be higher or lower. A  school's scores may be compared to district and state averages. For example, if  the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state average is  283, children at your school are performing at a higher level than most  third-graders statewide.  </P> <P> In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although  state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon  the size of the school.  </P> <P> Students in grades three and six last spring were given multiple-choice tests  in reading, written language (including grammar and spelling) and mathematics.  Last spring's eighth-graders were tested in reading, math, history-social  sciences and science. Eighth-graders also took an essay test to assess their  writing skills. Results of the essay test are expected next month.  </P> <P> In some cases a specialized or "magnet" school has its campus on the grounds of  a regular school. State officials have combined the scores, so separate results  are not available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STATEWIDE AVERAGES  </P> <P> These statewide averages may be useful in comparing the performance of students  in elementary and junior high or middle schools.  </P> <P> 3rd Grade  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.67IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>

SIXTH-GRADERS  </P> <P>  Illustrative social studies passage:  </P> <P> In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new  plan which would affect our entire country. The company planned a faster mail  service to California -- the Pony Express, which would deliver the mail in 10  days or less.  </P> <P> Strong young men were the riders. Buffalo Bill was one of the famous ones.  These men had to have courage. Every day they faced many kinds of danger. They  had been told, "Remember, you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged.  You may be cold, hungry, wet and tired, but you must go on! The mail must go  through!" And it did go through!  </P> <P> Over the saddle of the Pony Express horses was hung a leather blanket or  "mochila." In the four pockets of it were the tissue-thin letters. Five dollars  was the usual price for sending a letter.  </P> <P> The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento. Each rider rode  nonstop for about 100 miles, and then a new rider took over. The horses used  were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles. Quickly the mail was  thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse, much like a relay race. Horses were  saddled and ready to go at every station. With a leap, the rider was in the  saddle -- and off like the wind!  </P> <P>  Illustrative test questions:  </P> <P> What do you think would usually happen when the rider reached Sacramento?  </P> <P> a. He would go to New York.  </P> <P> b. He would eat and rest.  </P> <P> c. He would brand horses.  </P> <P> d. He would meet Buffalo Bill.  </P> <P> The "mochila" used by the Pony Express rider can best be compared to the  </P> <P> a. sleeping bag used by the camper.  </P> <P> b. sandpaper used by the carpenter.  </P> <P> c. mail pouch used by the mail carrier.  </P> <P> d. pen used to write and letter.  </P> <P> You can conclude from the passage that  </P> <P> a. someone at each station prepared a fresh horse for the rider.  </P> <P> b. Buffalo Bill was bored by the Pony Express.  </P> <P> c. the worst danger was from the cold.  </P> <P> d. few people ever heard about the Pony Express.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1990 CAP SCORES  </P> <P>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Labour retreats on election pledge The Labour party yesterday issued its most unequivocal statement that it has disavowed its 1992 election pledge to increase basic state pensions for all. At a Fabian society conference Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said that raising basic pensions for all was impracticable. 'The problems can't be solved by simply raising the basic state pension,' he said. 'The Labour party believes pension provision should reflect increasing national wealth and make a significant contribution to security in retirement. But we have to recognise the limitations.' Labour party officials have privately acknowledged that the pledge to raise basic pensions for all had limited flexibility on other spending pledges and committed the party to unpopular tax rises. However, Mr Dewar also made clear that Labour was not interested in means-testing the basic state pension, saying it must continue to be universal. He also called for direct statutory regulation of personal pensions. Meanwhile Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons social security committee, unveiled at the same conference a plan for a National Savings Personal Pensions Plan. Investments in the plan would be linked to one or more index-tracking fund and cover a range of bonds and equities. Its management could be contracted out to the private sector and would have very low charges. When pensions become payable, there will be an 'open market option' to enable pensioners to purchase annuities from the most competitive life insurance companies.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION FOES HEAR MAHONY, PLAN PROTEST  </P> <P> The anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, cheered by Catholic Archbishop Roger  Mahony's comparison of them to formerly oppressed Eastern European Christians,  announced plans Friday to protest at a Los Angeles women's clinic today (8/18)  without risking arrest.  </P> <P> Instead of blocking entrances at the Women's Health Clinic on Spring Street,  protesters will stand in prayer at an 8 a.m. vigil, then march to City Hall for  a rally, officials of the group said.  </P> <P> Organizers said they will object to what they consider unjust jail sentences  given hundreds of protesters arrested for attempting to block doors at clinics  in Los Angeles and other cities.  </P> <P> This will be the first time the Southern California branch of Operation Rescue  has planned a protest without attempting to block entrances, but a national  organizer said the action is a tactical maneuver that has been used elsewhere.  </P> <P> Mahony spoke to about 200 Operation Rescue stalwarts at a conference at  Catholic-run Loyola Marymount University. He said he had talked early this  month to Catholic priests in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria who had been  imprisoned for their beliefs before the communist governments collapsed.  </P> <P> "When I heard how they suffered, I couldn't help but think of the pro-life  movement in this country ... how (people) were ridiculed for their beliefs and  attacked," Mahony said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles archbishop praised the group's emphasis on prayer. He also  urged patience with what he called the "ignorance" of abortion rights  advocates, saying their stance is based "so much on simplistic slogans."  </P> <P> Mahony had cautiously backed Operation Rescue when it began protests in  Southern California before Easter last year. But he denied the use of Catholic  churches last August for the movement's rallies, contending that the church  might lose its insurance coverage.  </P></p>

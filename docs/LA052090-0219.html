			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RURAL PORTOLA HILLS RESISTS CITYHOOD FEVER;  </P> <P> INCORPORATION: THE YOUNG CANYON COMMUNITY IS BEING WOOED BY BACKERS OF A PLAN  TO INCLUDE IT IN A NEW MUNICIPALITY OF EL TORO, BUT MANY RESIDENTS ARE OPPOSED.  </P> <P> Debbie Brown moved into her new Portola Hills tract home in the rolling  foothills of the Santiago and Modjeska peaks to steer clear of the hustle and  bustle of El Toro.  </P> <P> Now she's afraid the bucolic lifestyle that she bought into a year ago will be  spoiled by an El Toro cityhood movement that wants to bring her Trabuco Canyon  community under its umbrella.  </P> <P> "We have nothing in common," Brown said recently. "We don't share the same  interests."  </P> <P> Brown is heading a campaign to exclude the semi-isolated neighborhood of  Portola Hills from a plan to incorporate a wide area in the Saddleback Valley  -- a move that could conceivably postpone a hoped-for November ballot measure  until next year.  </P> <P> The El Toro-based Community Coalition for Incorporation wants voters to approve  the creation of a 21-square-mile city comprised of El Toro, Lake Forest,  Portola Hills and the yet-to-be-built Foothills Ranch.  </P> <P> But while a growing number of other South County communities are turning to  cityhood as a way to better deal with local issues, Portola Hills seems to be  one of the last holdouts, saying no thanks to local representation.  </P> <P> Residents say the 1,000-acre Portola Hills neighborhood of 976 homes,  townhouses and condominiums at the junction of El Toro and Santiago Canyon  Roads should be left to follow its own destiny.  </P> <P> "That is why we moved up here," Brown said, noting that the nearest supermarket  is miles away. In fact, the only business within walking distance is Cook's  Corner, the landmark bar known best as a hangout for crusty Trabuco Canyon  residents and bikers.  </P> <P> Although longtime Trabuco Canyon residents have rejected any association with  Portola Hills, the development's homeowners prefer to be identified with that  rural community rather than built-out El Toro.  </P> <P> Portola Hills was built four years ago by the Baldwin Co. for middle- and  upper-income home buyers who were courted with a promise that they would live  in seclusion, far from El Toro's theaters, stores and traffic.  </P> <P> "When people think of El Toro, they relate it to the Marine base" and  high-density development, said two-year resident George Kowalik during an  emotionally charged residents' meeting this week. "That can't be good for our  property values."  </P> <P> At the meeting, held at the Portola Hills Recreation Center, anti-cityhood  leaders claimed that a majority of their neighbors backed their movement, and  they have been soliciting signatures to document the level of local opposition.  So far, more than 400 signatures have been gathered, Brown said.  </P> <P> Some of the 100 Portola Hills residents at the meeting said they were satisfied  with county services and did not want to be saddled with another layer of  government.  </P> <P> Still others argued that they would consider forming their own city in the  future. A few feared that property taxes will be raised under a new city  government, a complaint denied by cityhood supporters.  </P> <P> "It is just too soon for us to be a city," Brown said. "Each person has his own  reason (for rejecting cityhood), but we have the same goal."  </P> <P> Cityhood coalition chairwoman Helen Wilson, who is hoping the Local Agency  Formation Commission approves a November ballot measure, said she would  consider dropping Portola Hills from the plan if it threatens that target date.  </P> <P> "I feel in my heart that they should be in it," Wilson said. "(But) if it  continues to be a hotbed, we'll drop it," Wilson said. "We have no problem with  that."  </P> <P> Wilson said the coalition's steering committee will be meeting over the weekend  to discuss changing the proposed boundaries. Leaving out Portola Hills will not  affect the proposed city's financial stability because there are no businesses  located in that community, she said.  </P> <P> Since Proposition 13, cities have relied heavily on tax revenue from local  businesses.  </P> <P> Carving Portola Hills out of the northernmost portion of the proposed city  would shrink the size of the city by about one-tenth, Wilson said. "We can live  with that," she said.  </P> <P> Wilson said, however, that she will fight a recent proposal by Portola Hills  community leaders to ask LAFCO to also exclude the Foothills Ranch property  that is located north of the proposed Foothill Transportation Corridor.  </P> <P> The proposed Foothills Ranch Planned Community, located between Portola Hills  and El Toro, will include 4,000 homes, as well as industrial and commercial  centers.  </P> <P> Brown said that she and other Portola Hills residents are eyeing about half of  the planned community because it will generate commercial tax revenue for  Portola Hills if it eventually decides to incorporate.  </P> <P> That dispute could cause the cityhood vote to be postponed until March, LAFCO  executive director James Colangelo said.  </P> <P> Colangelo said that LAFCO has scheduled a public hearing on June 20. If the  dispute is not settled by July 11, "there's a pretty good chance it will be a  March vote," he said.  </P> <P> Some Portola Hills residents who support El Toro cityhood said they were  saddened over the call for excluding their neighborhood, arguing that only by  joining a city would residents be able to develop a long-awaited park and enjoy  increased police protection.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry about all this," said Margaret Nicholson, an outspoken advocate of  cityhood. She said the anti-cityhood group has not taken into consideration  that more than 200 of the 1,000 registered Portola Hills residents have signed  pro-cityhood petitions since January.  </P> <P> Nicholson, who is also president of the Portola Hills Homeowners Assn., scoffed  at opponents' distaste for politicians and local government, pointing out that  only 56 Portola Hills residents bothered to vote in the last election.  </P> <P> "It's amazing that people complain about politicians when they don't even  vote," Nicholson said.  </P> <P> Bob Bess, another pro-cityhood Portola Hills resident and member of the  coalition steering committee, conceded that a majority of his neighbors do not  favor cityhood.  </P> <P> "I personally think that the community will be better off as part of a city,"  Bess said. "But it won't do the cityhood campaign any good to drag people in  kicking and screaming."  </P> <P> Times correspondent Len Hall contributed to this report.  </P></p>

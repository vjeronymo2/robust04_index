			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs, has sent a letter to United Nations  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, informing him about the  constructive atmosphere and results achieved in negotiations  with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Geneva  on 9 and 10 February. In his letter Minister Granic informs  Butrus-Ghali about the readiness displayed by both sides to  intensify negotiations which have been initiated on the  resolution of remaining contentious issues and future relations  between the Croatian and the Bosnian Muslim nations.    Minister Granic welcomes the consent given by the  governments  of the United States, European, and other countries for pressure  to be stepped up on all the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  in order to reach a final solution on the basis of the European  Union action plan. Minister Granic also expresses support for  the NATO readiness to use force to lift the siege of Sarajevo,  which represents the first step in the implementation of that  plan.    The Croatian minister of foreign affairs also informs the UN  secretary general about Croatia's readiness to meet the request  of the UN Security Council to reduce tensions between the  Croatian and Muslim sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the spirit  of a cease-fire agreement that the two sides have previously  signed.    The Croatian government will also turn to UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] representatives in order to coordinate the  verification of moves by the Croatian Government and the  Croatian Defense Council, which should reduce tension and  rebuild trust between the Croatian and Muslim sides,  particularly in central Bosnia and in Mostar.    The Croatian Government asks the UN Security Council to  offer  guarantees with regard to halting the offensive actions of the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in these areas, in the spirit of the  aforementioned Geneva negotiations.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Challenge to SEs from futures on individual shares - Risk &amp; Reward The world's stock exchanges, which have been slow to jump into the derivatives fray, may find a fresh challenge at their flanks if London's Liffe and the Sydney Futures Exchange are successful in their plans to launch futures contracts on individual shares. Trading futures on individual equities is specifically prohibited in the US under a 12-year-old accord between the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities regulator, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary futures regulator. The SEC and CFTC decided to prohibit these instruments in 1982, while allowing the creation of futures on broad-based stock indices. The SEC feared that futures on individual shares would open the door to price manipulation. However, institutional money managers' appetite for ways to allocate assets efficiently and to leverage investments may force US regulators to rethink their position if overseas equity futures contracts are successful. Mr Les Hosking, chief executive of the Sydney Futures Exchange, believes the time is right for futures on a limited number of well-capitalised companies whose shares are liquid and actively traded. 'These products would be an alternative to buying and selling individual shares. Futures are cheaper, more efficient and allow more leverage,' he says. Mr Hosking has floated the idea of trading futures on the shares of three of Australia's biggest companies - mining giant BHP, News Corporation and the National Australia Bank - with the Australian Securities Commission. So far, he says, the regulator 'hasn't raised issues that would indicate rejection'. In London, Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive, said similar products on a handful of UK stocks are under preliminary consideration. If futures on individual equities catch on, they will only be suitable for the largest companies in each country. Mr Hosking says that if his three initial share futures contracts are a success, he could only expand the concept to the top 10 capitalised stocks in Australia. However, there is nothing in Australian law to stop the SFE from trading futures on shares in companies like General Motors or reaching into emerging markets. On the US side, 'The CFTC and the SEC might have something to say about US customers using the products,' Mr Hosking says. Fortunately for the SFE, the Australian companies being considered for futures contracts have not baulked at the idea. While their blessing is not technically necessary, their endorsement is important, Mr Hosking says. He has spoken to all three and says they see benefits from having futures contracts on their stock. Analysts say that for a select group of shares, a futures contract would offer benefits over existing options products. Liquidity in stock options is often spread over a wide variety of strike prices and expiration dates. Futures on shares could offer a deeper, cheaper market, with liquidity centralised on quarterly expirations. The share futures being considered by the SFE would be settled in cash, rather than the shares themselves, making them more attractive from an administrative standpoint than share-settled options. Proponents say having futures on a few top companies in every country would help investors focus their portfolios. Currently many fund managers arrange international equity exposure by dealing in stock index futures contracts from a variety of countries. Often the composition of these indices is flawed, or fails to match investors' objectives. Individual share futures would offer an alternative.</p>

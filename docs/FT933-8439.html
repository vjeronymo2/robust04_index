			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Diphtheria threat to Russian travel THOMSON, THE UK market leader in foreign holidays, is suspending trips to Russia because of an outbreak of diphtheria there. All the company's city-breaks to Moscow and St Petersburg are being cancelled from the start of next month and fares are being refunded. Passengers due to travel this month are being offered refunds. They are being told that they should be inoculated if they decide to go. The company said hundreds of customers would be affected. The Department of Health last month told travellers to Russia to ensure that they were vaccinated. Thomson said: 'In the last few weeks the situation seems to have worsened.' But the Association of British Travel Agents said yesterday that it was safe to travel with the proper immunisation. Mr Keith Betton, Abta's head of corporate affairs, said: I would not advise people to rush out and cancel because other companies may well take a different view of this.'</p>

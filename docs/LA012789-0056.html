			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AS COACHING GOES, SHIMIZU SHOWS HE'S A GOOD SCOUT  </P> <P> The approaches of Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell and Kennedy Coach Yutaka  Shimizu, in terms of pregame scouting, are decidedly different. The results,  though, are often similar: Cleveland (16-2, 6-0 in league play) and Kennedy  (12-4, 5-1) will play for first place in the North Valley League at 7 tonight  at Kennedy.  </P> <P> Shimizu prefers to see an opponent play as many times as possible. Braswell  does not spend nearly as much time scouting. In fact, Braswell simply would  prefer to see a lot less of Shimizu.  </P> <P> "Shim's the tactician, the magician," Braswell said. "I don't even waste my  time sending anybody over to scout his games because it wouldn't do any good.  He just changes everything all around every game."  </P> <P> Shimizu feels otherwise. Braswell, in fact, has a running gag with Shimizu and  Taft Coach Jim Woodard, who also has scouted several Cleveland games this  season.  </P> <P> "Every time I look up in the stands, I see those two," Braswell quipped. "I  keep telling them that they've seen more Cleveland games than I have."  </P> <P> Shimizu said that he scouts more games than Woodard and that there is a reason.  </P> <P> "He remembers everything," Shimizu said of Woodard. "Not me, I have to see  somebody two or three times before it sinks in. Heck, I just go from day to  day." STEVE ELLING  </P></p>

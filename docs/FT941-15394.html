			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Spanish inflation rises to 4.9% A sharp rise in fresh food prices last month pushed Spain's year-on-year headline inflation rate at the end of 1993 up to 4.9 per cent, 0.4 per cent above the government's target, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The increase could undermine government efforts to enforce wage moderation this year. Fresh food prices jumped 1.5 per cent against a rise of 0.5 per cent in December 1992. Rises in other components of the price index were below those of 1992 when annual headline inflation was 5.3 per cent.</p>

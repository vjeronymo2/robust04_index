			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Polaroid plans to create three business units POLAROID, the US photography company, plans to create three business units for the company as part of its 'strategic vision' from the beginning of next year, agencies report. The company said the three operations would be 'highly autonomous with specific profitability goals', with each relying primarily on its own sales and marketing, business sector management, and manufacturing and development groups. Polaroid said it would group its operations in core photography, high resolution imaging, and imaging media and peripherals. It also intends to offer early retirement for selected employees. Details would be available next month. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of employees who will be offered the early retirement option, or on the financial impact of the programme. Polaroid has about 11,000 employees.</p>

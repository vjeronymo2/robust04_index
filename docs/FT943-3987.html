			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Rail chiefs plan to share cost of future disruption The cost of future rail strikes will be covered by an industry-wide risk-sharing scheme, the office of the rail franchising director said yesterday. The scheme would spread the cost of 'severe disruption', such as strikes, bridge or tunnel collapses and acts of terrorism, between operating companies. It would also help to reduce the threat posed to the privatisation of the railway by the continuing signal workers' dispute, now entering its 14th week. The RMT transport union has said that the damage caused by the strikes to the finances of the train operating companies will make it impossible to sell them to the private sector before the next general election. However, a spokesman for the franchising directors said there had 'been no lessening of interest from the companies seeking to buy franchises' since the dispute started. The risk-sharing scheme under discussion would go further than existing industry arrangements because it would indemnify train operating companies against revenue losses and not just against the direct cost of an incident. The franchising director's office said: 'Strikes would be a risk that would be managed. The details are still being discussed and finalised.' The franchising director and the train operating companies have been in talks with the insurance industry to devise a method of covering catastrophic losses. At present, British Rail meets all but the largest losses. But a conventional insurance arrangement would be extremely expensive, insurance industry sources said. Insuring railway operations would be a new experience for British insurers, so initially premiums would be high. Insurance costs could be the third-largest item of expenditure for the train operators after track access charges and salaries. A risk-sharing scheme, by contrast, would be cheaper to operate. Rail industry officials believe the signal workers' strike is the 'last gasp' of the old railway structure. Drivers and maintenance workers will in future be employed by individual companies so would not have the capacity to disrupt the entire network. In a separate development, the Department of Transport and Railtrack denied they had discussed a 'doomsday plan' to sack the signal workers and shut large parts of the railway network if the dispute continued. The next two-day stoppage is due to start at midnight although Railtrack said it expects to open more than half of the network. Labour faces rail strikes motion, Page 6</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium stocks top 1m tonnes  -Week in the Markets ALUMINIUM HAS begun the new year by earning the dubious honour of being the first metal to build up a stockpile of more than 1m tonnes in London Metal Exchange registered warehouses. The exchange yesterday announced a 21,800-tonne rise that took the total to 1,008,950 tonnes, nearly 700,000 tonnes up from the start of 1991, when stocks were already at a record level. The reaching of this unwelcome milestone came as no surprise, however, and, although the rise was at the upper end of traders' expectations, LME aluminium prices remained above the life-of-contract lows reached last month. Dealers explained that the continuing rise in stocks had been largely discounted in the market. The cash price closed Dollars 12 down yesterday at Dollars 1,107.50 a tonne, but that was seen chiefly as a reflection of the firmness of the US dollar, which reduced the likelihood of consumers coming into the market ahead of the weekend. The weaker tone towards the end of the week was in part a reflection of disappointment at the three months delivery position's earlier failure decisively to break through resistance at Dollars 1,150 a tonne, although it did exceed that level briefly on Thursday. The three months price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,130.50 a tonne, down Dollars 6.75 since Christmas eve, and dealers said a renewed test of support at Dollars 1,120 a tonne was likely soon. In comparison with aluminium's record-breaking level the LME stocks total for copper - up 4,900 tones yesterday to 332,325 tonnes - looked relatively modest. But it was the highest since March 1984 and helped to send LME prices to 7-month lows. Copper prices had begun the week on the up-beat as the LME caught up with a rally on the New York market the previous Friday, when the London exchange was closed, and was further encouraged by interest rate reductions in the US and Japan. But the more buoyant mood was short-lived and despite a small rally yesterday the cash position ended at Pounds 1,150.50 a tonne, down Pounds 4.25 from the Christmas eve level. Dealers said the fall was influenced by renewed weakness in the New York market, plus options-related and stop-loss selling. A recent downtrend in LME zinc stocks was halted yesterday by a 1,850-tonne rise to 154,050 tonnes. That sparked a sharp price setback and narrowing of the cash premium over three months metal. The cash price closed at Dollars 1,145 a tonne, down Dollars 26 on the day and Dollars 21.25 on the week, while the three months price was down Dollars 17 on the day and Dollars 5.75 on the week at Dollars 1,105.50 a tonne. The upturn in stocks, after a fall of about 13,000 tonnes during December, tended to support traders' suggestions after the announcement on Tuesday of a 4,600-tonne rise that represented the tail end of a large merchant shipment of Peruvian metal to the US. Tin is the only LME metal whose stocks are not at a historically high level, but that seems to be doing little for sentiment. Dealers ignored a 25-tonne stocks fall yesterday and after another failure to hold above the Dollars 5,650-a-tonne level the three months position fell Dollars 80 to close at Dollars 5,567.50 a tonne, Dollars 60 below the pre-Christmas quotation. At the London bullion market silver prices staged quite a strong technical rally but stopped just short of the psychologically-important 400 US cents-a-troy ounce level. The cash price ended the week 11.50 cents up at 399.50 cents an ounce. The platinum price began the week with a sharp fall in thin trading to reach the lowest level for six years at Monday's morning fixing. But by yesterday afternoon's fixing it had recovered to Dollars 337 a troy ounce, up Dollars 2.35 on balance. The gold price moved in a narrow range meanwhile, ending Dollars 1.20 down on the week at Dollars 352.15 an ounce. Investment fund selling put cocoa and robusta coffee prices under pressure at the London Futures and Options Exchange, although there were no fundamental developments to explain the falls. The May delivery cocoa price steadied somewhat yesterday, ending down Pounds 1 on the day and Pounds 32 on the week at Pounds 758 a tonne, and March robusta rallied to close at Pounds 526 a tonne, up Pounds 11 on the day but still Pounds 26 down on the week. In New York demand was stronger for the milder arabica coffee variety and in late trading yesterday the May futures position was quoted at 81.70 cents a lb, up 1.8 cents from the earlier in the week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium  +21,800  to  1,008,950 Copper      +4,900  to    332,325 Lead           -25  to    126,350 Nickel         -72  to     11,850 Zinc        +1,850  to    154,050 Tin            -25  to     13,670  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

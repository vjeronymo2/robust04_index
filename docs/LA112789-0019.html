			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER, CONSERVATIVES LAG IN OPINION POLLS  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faced growing political trouble Sunday as  opinion polls put her Conservative Party's popularity at its lowest point in  nine years.  </P> <P> Two-thirds of those polled said she should quit.  </P> <P> Two days ago, Thatcher, 64, confounded expectations that she would step down  after the next general election, saying she is prepared to lead her party into  two more elections "by popular acclaim."  </P> <P> However, an opinion poll in the Sunday Times showed the opposition Labor Party  with 51% support -- 14 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives. It was  Labor's biggest lead since 1980.  </P> <P> Another poll in the Observer showed that two-thirds of the voters believe  Thatcher should resign before the next general election, which must be called  by mid-1992. It showed that 44% believe she should quit now, while 22% would  like to see her go in 1992.  </P></p>

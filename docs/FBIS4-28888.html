			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- A seminar on the work  of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il "Our Socialism Centred  on the Masses Shall Not Perish" was held by the Dar-es-Salaam,  Tanzania, association for the study of the chuche idea.    The speakers said that the advantages and vitality of  Korean-style peculiar socialism centred on the popular masses  have been fully displayed in all fields and that the socialist  system of Korea is a genuine popular one which provides the  masses of the people with an independent and creative life.    A reading session of this work was held by the Zairean  Society for the Study of Kim Chong-il's Works.    The speaker said Korean-style socialism is a socialism  centred on the popular masses where they are the masters of  everything and everything serves them. They noted that since  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always adhered to  the independent stand, it has been able to defend the national  dignity and successfully carry on the cause of socialism in any  storm and stress.    A seminar on the work "Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable"  took place at the department of the state in charge of  irrigation of the Ministry of Agriculture of Mozambique.    The speakers said the work is a great textbook of revolution  that gives a scientific exposition of the unavoidableness of the  downfall of imperialism and the inevitability of the triumph of  socialism.    Noting that though the imperialists are trying to destroy  Korean socialism, it is a daydream, they stressed that nobody  can match the Korean people united closely around their leader  and their party.</p>

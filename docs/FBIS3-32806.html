They belong to the same group of  peasants that had been evicted from a property owned by  [Colorado Party] Senator Blas N. Riquelme, on which they were  squatting. The National Police quelled the riot, causing  injuries to 12 people.    [Begin National Police Chief Superintendent Mario A. Sapriza  recording] At approximately 0900 this morning, a group of  peasants who had been evicted from Mr. Riquelme's property  blocked Route No. 3 with six logs that they laid on the highway.  They even had gasoline at their disposal so as to set fire to  these logs and also destroy the highway. This is the reason why  the police had to intervene in this affair. They ordered the  some 400 peasants who were blocking the road to leave and make  way for vehicles, as there was already a bottleneck. The  peasants, however, responded violently to the security forces.  Hence, the riot police were summoned and following a clash that  lasted approximately two or three minutes, they managed to drive  them off. [end recording]    As a result of this crackdown, one peasant was seriously  injured and 11 others sustained minor injuries. They were  rushed to Santani clinic, located at Santani City, where they  were given medical attention. [passage omitted]    Peasants blame the government for what happened today and  expect it will try to find a solution to the conflict.    [Begin Adalberto Benitez, leader from the Struggle for Land  Movement, recording] The way the government and institutions  acted today is not surprising to us because they prefer to quash  us instead of solving our land problems. This attitude finally  goaded us into the use of force and into taking the measures we  are taking to air our grievances. We want congressmen who sit  on the Human Rights and Agrarian Reform Committees, the IBR  [Agrarian Reform Institute], Judge Silvio Flores Mendoza, and  the owner [of the property] to come here to settle the following  issues:    1. The immediate release of our comrades who are being held  in custody.    2. Clearing up the murder of our comrade Maximo Prieto.    3. Medical attention for our comrades who are in the  hospital  and for a child, who following the crackdown, developed mental  problems due to the blows he received.    4. A commitent to investigate Senator Blas N. Riquelme's  large, unproductive estates and the expropriation of the 5,000  unproductive hectares we have laid claim to.    5. Immedate withdrawal of bulldozers and specialized riot  police from the place and the return of our belongings. [end  recording]</p>

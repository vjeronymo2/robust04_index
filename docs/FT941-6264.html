			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Krupp-Hoesch to fight cartel office over ruling to sell unit Krupp-Hoesch, the merged German steel and engineering group, plans to fight an order by the German federal cartel office to sell part of its vehicle spring manufacturing capacity. The company said it would challenge the ruling by the competition authorities that it must sell its vehicle spring manufacturing division at Krupp Bruninghaus because of its dominant position in the market. An agreement to dispose of the division was an important part of the deal negotiated by Krupp-Hoesch with the cartel office in April 1992 to get the go-ahead for the total merger of the two steel groups. However, just before the deadline to do so expired in December last year, the company served notice of cancellation of the agreement, arguing that conditions in the market had changed. The cartel office in Berlin announced on Monday that it was not prepared to accept the unilateral cancellation, and ordered Krupp-Hoesch to sell the division, or it would appoint an independent trustee to do so on its behalf. The office said a merger of the vehicle spring manufacturing capacity of Krupp Bruninghaus with Hoesch-Federn would raise the danger of the combined enterprise having a dominant market position. The two together would control more than 60 per cent of the market, with a turnover of between DM600m-DM700m (Dollars 353m-Dollars 412m). Krupp-Hoesch maintains that because of a slump in demand for its suspensions from the motor industry, the two vehicle spring divisions between them lost more than DM50m in 1993. It said if one of the two divisions was sold, the other could no longer survive. 'The conditions of competition in the automobile sub-contracting industry have changed so much since the original agreement was reached that there is no longer any reason to fear the emergence of market domination,' according to Krupp-Hoesch. The cartel office argues that other companies are still surviving in the industry, many of them small or medium enterprises with a much smaller turnover. It accepts that the motor industry has reduced its orders because of the current recession. Krupp-Hoesch will now take the case to the superior court in Berlin, although a delay of several months is likely before any decision is taken.</p>

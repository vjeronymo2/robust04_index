			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Managers support investment in railways BUSINESS managers are strongly in favour of investing in the railways, a survey disclosed yesterday. But while they back the railways, few travel by train, with 82 per cent of those questioned driving to work and only 10 per cent using the train. The survey of more than 1,000 British Institute of Management (BIM) members found: Three-in-five managers favoured more rail investment and only one in three supported more spending on roads. Nearly three quarters thought British Rail investment levels were too low. Only 15 per cent wanted more motorways built. Eighty eight per cent thought more freight should travel by rail. Forty three per cent opposed BR's privatisation. Fifty one per cent thought privatisation would improve services while 36 per cent said it would not. Overall, while managers thought more should be spent on the railways, they found car travel more comfortable, although rail was perceived to be better value for money. Mr Roger Young, director-general of BIM, said: 'Continued emphasis on the primacy of private transport will eventually work against the interest of the majority of users - and of the efficiency of the UK as a whole.' Unless the government acted to implement a national transport policy, the roads would 'become ever more congested as organisations and private motorists take to their vehicles,' he added.</p>

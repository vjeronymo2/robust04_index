			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Algoma Steel stages turnaround Algoma Steel, which was near collapse during the recession, has staged a turnround with a first-quarter profit of CDollars 16m, or 61 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 18m, or 68 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 27 per cent to CDollars 267m. North American car plants took more of Algoma's flat rolled products, and results benefited from a lower Canadian dollar. The common shares now trade around CDollars 13.60 against a few cents two years ago.</p>

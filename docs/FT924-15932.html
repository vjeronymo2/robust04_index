			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sober after Tuesday vote The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) index responded soberly to Tuesday's vote for impeachment proceedings against President Fernando Collor de Mello, writes Bill Hinchberger. The Bovespa index fell 822, or 1.8 per cent, to 44,494 after Tuesday's anticipatory 7.7 per cent gain. Turnover was about Dollars 88m. Traders said that the reaction partly reflected profit-taking. Analysts also believe that the market is waiting for the interim president, vice-president Itamar Franco, to determine his economic team. 'Until the new finance minister is named, everyone is waiting to see which policies will be adopted,' said Mr Roberto Serwaczak, research director with the local branch of Baring Securities. Some investors are worried that Mr Franco's nationalist reputation will be reflected in a slow down of the modernisation scheme started under Mr Collor. But they add that improved relations between the executive and legislative branches could help bring about much needed fiscal reform.</p>

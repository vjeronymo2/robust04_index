			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Lijun (1728 0500 6511): "Jilin Holds a </F> Work Conference on Management of Rural Financial Affairs"]    [Text] Reporter learned from the provincial work conference  on management of the rural financial affairs that concluded a  few days ago that in 1994 and 1995 the province will make "six  cleanups and six changes" in the rural financial affairs. Wang  Guofa, vice governor of the provincial government, made a speech  at the conference.    After summing up the province's achievements in rural  financial affairs made over the past years, the conference  pointed out: Now, problems in the management of rural financial  affairs, which are in urgent need of solution, still exist.  That is, the accumulated funds of agriculture are still being  drained, the funds obtained by some localities according to a  unified plan are not well managed, there are more instances of  illegally interfering in the management and the flow of  accumulated funds, the problems due to the raising of the  interest rates by the collectives and the problems relating to  "two debts" prominently exist, the rural areas fail to  effectively manage their financial affairs, some localities have  abolished county- and township-level agricultural economic  centers, some localities delegate the rights to the management  of rural financial affairs to towns and townships, and some  localities "wean" the rural areas from the management of their  financial affairs. So, the rural areas are lacking in basic  work conditions and basic organizations.    To this end, the conference urged: To strengthen the  management of the rural financial affairs in 1994 and 1995, we  should win a victory in the overall battle of "six cleanups and  six changes." "Six cleanups" indicate: Square accounts to solve  the problems due to complicated accounting; clear up collective  property to protect and expand the collective sector of the  economy; clear up internal and external debts to eliminate rural  debt chains; eliminate the raising of interest rates to solve  the problems of being heavily in debt; eliminate the peasants'  burdens to resolutely end the activities of wantonly collecting  funds, asking for charges, and apportioning expenses; and clear  up excessive staff members to solve overstaffing.    "Six changes" indicate: Implement the provincial people's  congress "regulations" on management of funds, "regulations" on  contracts, and "regulations" on the auditing work of the rural  areas, as well as the "regulations" on the peasants' burden as  stipulated by the state and the province -- both old and new  accumulated funds used to be "owned and managed by communities"  in the past and will be "converted into stocks and managed by  townships"; change the decentralized management of the funds  obtained according to the unified plan into centralized  management; change the peasants' burdens from unitary shares to  collection of funds from various channels; the basic work  relating to the management of financial affairs has been changed  from management at will to standardized management; change the  ways for management of rural financial affairs from unitary  administration to legalization; and change the ways for sorting  out rural financial affairs from periodic cleanup to regular  auditing examinations. The "six cleanups" and "six changes"  will be conducted among villages, communities (groups),  collective economic organizations and their subordinate  enterprises, enterprises, institutions, township-level  enterprises, and town- and township-level financial affairs  stations and offices.    The conference stressed: The governments at various levels  and all departments concerned should upgrade their understanding  and realistically strengthen the leadership over the work  relating to the cleanups and changes. On the basis of deeply  conducting investigations and study and firmly grasping the  implementation of the laws and regulations, we should strengthen  the setup of the rural financial affairs management  organizations. In the course of conducting the organizational  reform, the governments at various levels must not reduce the  staff and funds of the rural economic stations, still less "cut  the subsidies to them."</p>

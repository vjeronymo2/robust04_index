The secret report  by the U.S. Justice Department, which was the basis for putting  the then Austrian president on the Watch List and isolating him  internationally, has now been published (because of a court  ruling).    The world, which by this time is only moderately interested,  and Austria itself now can examine what excited us seven years  ago, what caused a rift right through the country, but also  forced us for the first time to deal with the Nazi past that had  been pushed away.    A first examination of the essence of the 204-page report  provides certainty: The differing assessment that had to be  reached seven years ago by any serious observer, including the  author of these lines, remains correct.    As an intelligence officer in the Balkans, Kurt Waldheim  dealt with war crimes in a clerical manner, so to speak; he  collected, summarized, and signed reports about them. Thus, he  knew about them. He was not involved in them in the sense of  having any authority to give orders. However, the report by the  U.S. Justice Department interprets this work massively to  Waldheim's disadvantage.    Waldheim was certainly a small cog, but he was located in an  important place in the German military machine, contributing to  the functioning of this machine. But he did not commit any  crimes. For the U.S. Watch List decision, however, it was  unimportant whether Waldheim had only collected reports about  atrocities or had provided the "logistical conditions" for them.  The corresponding law is so flexible that he had to be covered  by it.    The political assessment is something quite different.  Today, as in the past, one can say: Waldheim suffered an  injustice because his work in the Balkans was assessed too  harshly, too ignorantly, and probably also too maliciously by  the U.S. authorities and the U.S. public. It is also a fact,  however, that he kept silent about this work and covered it up  -- and this made him untenable as Austrian president.</p>

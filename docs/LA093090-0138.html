			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLORIDA ST. STRUGGLES AS STREAK REACHES 14  </P> <P> Terrell Buckley scored on a 53-yard interception return and Errol McCorvey went  77 yards with a recovered fumble to help Florida State defeat Virginia Tech,  39-28, Saturday at Tallahassee, Fla., and increase the nation's longest winning  streak to 14 games.  </P> <P> Florida State (4-0) didn't get the lead for good until Buckley's touchdown run  in the final minute of the third quarter made it 32-28.  </P> <P> McCorvey's touchdown with 3:59 left in the game completed the scoring, giving  Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden an opportunity to pick up his 200th career  coaching victory next Saturday against rival Miami.  </P> <P> Virginia Tech (2-3) led 21-3 early and 28-25 with 2:51 left in the third period  after a four-yard pass from Will Furrer to Vaughn Hebron.  </P> <P> Furrer, who completed 21 of 37 passes for 194 yards, also threw two first-half  touchdown passes to John Rivers on plays covering four and two yards.  </P> <P> Buckley stopped Tech's final drive with two minutes remaining with his second  interception of the game. Buckley, who has four interceptions this season,  returned his second theft 41 yards from his own end zone.  </P> <P> Florida State intercepted four passes by Furrer and one by backup Rodd Wooten.  </P> <P> No. 19 Clemson 26, Duke 7 -- The 19th-ranked Tigers, stung last season by their  first loss to Duke in nearly a decade, beat the Blue Devils in an Atlantic  Coast Conference game at Clemson, S.C.  </P> <P> "Duke spoiled things for us last year," linebacker John Johnson said. "We  wanted to let them know it wouldn't happen again, starting from the first  kickoff."  </P> <P> Duke, 1-3 overall and 0-2 in the ACC, trailed Clemson (4-1, 2-1) only 10-0  after the first half, but pulled away in the third quarter before 81,500 at  Death Valley.  </P> <P> Last year, Duke rallied from a 14-0 halftime deficit to beat Clemson, 21-17,  for the first time since 1980.  </P> <P> The Tigers drove 75 yards in 10 plays -- the key play a 30-yard run by Rudy  Harris -- on its first possession of the second half to go up 17-0. DeChane  Cameron, who also threw for two touchdowns, capped the march with a two-yard  run.  </P> <P> The Blue Devils' only score was a 78-yard kickoff return touchdown by Leroy  Gallman with 1:28 left in the game.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech 27, No. 25 South Carolina 6 -- Quarterback Shawn Jones ran for the  Yellow Jackets' first touchdown and his passes set up two other scores at  Atlanta .  </P> <P> Jones scored on a bootleg from a yard out in the second quarter, Stefen Scotton  plunged two yards for another score and Jeff Wright scored from 20 yards out  for Tech (3-0), which also got field goals of 42 and 20 yards from Scott  Sisson.  </P> <P> Jones completed 11 of 20 passes for 136 yards, with two interceptions, before  being shaken up and taken out of the game midway through the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> South Carolina quarterback Bobby Fuller completed 14 of 28 passes for 143  yards, but he was intercepted three times and sacked five times by a Tech  defense led by Ken Swilling and Marco Coleman. Coleman sacked Fuller once and  twice hit him as he released the ball during a fourth-quarter drive.  </P> <P> The Gamecocks fell to 3-1.  </P> <P> North Carolina State 12, North Carolina 9 -- Damon Hartman kicked a 56-yard  field goal as time expired and turned the Wolfpack's afternoon of frustration  into a victory over the Tar Heels in a battle of field goals at Chapel Hill,  S.C.  </P> <P> Hartman's field goal, a line drive, completely silenced a partisan North  Carolina crowd which had earlier booed the decision to go for the tie when the  Tar Heels were at the North Carolina State five.  </P> <P> Hartman broke his own school record of 54 yards, set against North Carolina in  1988.  </P> <P> North Carolina State is now 3-2 and 2-2; North Carolina 3-2 and 0-1.  </P> <P> No. 7 Virginia 63, William &amp; Mary 35 -- Terry Kirby and Nikki Fisher paced  a 398-yard ground attack and the No. 7 Cavaliers used a third-quarter surge to  pull away to a victory over the pesky Indians at Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> Virginia, off to a 5-0 start for the first time since 1949, scored 22 points in  the opening 5:01 of the second half to build a 49-21 advantage.  </P> <P> Kirby ran 23 times for 188 yards and four touchdowns, and fellow tailback  Fisher had 164 yards and two scoring runs in 14 carries.  </P> <P> Virginia's Shawn Moore completed 15 of 26 passes for 291 yards and two  touchdowns, but he hit only seven of 16 in the first half, frequently  overthrowing open receivers.  </P> <P> William &amp; Mary (2-2), which beat the Cavaliers in 1987 and played them  tough in losses the last two seasons, trailed only 27-21 at halftime. The  Indians are ranked No. 20 in Division I-AA.  </P> <P> Southern Mississippi 25, Louisville 13 -- Tony Smith returned a punt 46 yards  for a touchdown to open a 22-point first-quarter blitz that helped the Golden  Eagles (3-2) win at Hattiesburg, Miss. Louisville is now 3-1-1.  </P> <P> Wake Forest 52, Army 14 -- Anthony Williams rushed for 136 yards and two  touchdowns and the Demon Deacons (2-2) capitalized on four Cadet turnovers for  24 points and breezed at Winston-Salem, N.C. Army is now 2-1.  </P> <P> Memphis State 22, Tulsa 10 -- Freshman Joe Allison kicked three field goals,  including a 49-yarder into a stiff breeze, and quarterback Keith Benton scored  on a five-yard run in the fourth quarter to lead the Tigers (2-1-1) at Tulsa,  Okla.  </P></p>

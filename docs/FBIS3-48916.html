The statement by the Prosecutor  General's Office reads:    Following a preliminary study of the materials, it emerges  that they do not enable one to establish the presence or  otherwise of sufficient information on the commission of crimes  of a general nature.    According to the statement, the materials also cannot serve  as a basis for mounting a preliminary investigation under  Article 191 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Most of the  materials received were in the form of xerox copies of letters,  contracts, and memoranda that did not even bear the signatures  of the persons who compiled them. The materials also included a  complaint to Mr. Berov submitted to the Council of Ministers on  1 October 1993, protesting against acts by officials from the  Ministry of Trade. However, the document contained no  information as to whether any official action had been taken on  the matter or on what was established as a result of the  complaint.    The Prosecutor General's Office hopes that the Trade  Ministry  officials in question will carry out their duties by taking  action on the complaint after studying each individual case that  it brings to their attention, and that, in the event of  information emerging on the commission of a crime, they will  provide specific information to the prosecution service.</p>

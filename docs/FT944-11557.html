			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hanson Pounds 2m joint venture in China Hanson, the UK conglomerate, has made its first foray into the Chinese market in a Pounds 2m joint venture with Beijing's gas monopoly to produce gas meters. Hanson Pacific was broker to the deal which UGI Meters, a Hanson subsidiary, signed with the Beijing Municipal Gas Company. UGI owns 55 per cent of the joint venture. The deal is a departure for Hanson, which has not shown much interest in joint ventures in the past. Mr Robert Hanson, chairman of Hanson Pacific, said the idea of joint ventures was a 'big change in our corporate philosophy'. Mr Simon Hsu, who was appointed chief executive of Hanson Pacific earlier this year to spearhead the group's expansion in Asia, has convinced the Hanson group that partnerships are a better way to penetrate China than take-overs. Yesterday he said he was working on 'four or five' other deals that the group was looking at seriously. Underlining the company's interest in Asian business, Mr Hanson, Mr Hsu and Mr David Clark, the group's chief executive in the US, are embarking on a 10-day tour of China and south east Asia on Monday to look for sales opportunities. Mr Hsu said UGI had big plans for its gas meter business in China. It is to build a factory in Beijing to manufacture state of the art gas metering equipment for sale to the gas utility in the Chinese capital. UGI plans to increase production from an initial 200,000 units a year to up to 700,000 units in three years. The joint venture will also seek export opportunities within the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Hanson said: 'We've spent time encouraging our operating companies to invest in this area.' However, he added that Hanson had no set level of investment planned for Asia-Pacific.</p>

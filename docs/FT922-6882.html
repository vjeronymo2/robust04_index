			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / India's satellite launch success INDIA yesterday successfully launched a satellite into orbit using a locally developed rocket. The launch follows two failures four years ago. The launch of the rocket, the third version of the 'augmented satellite launch vehicle', took place at the Sriharikota launching station of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), north of Madras. The satellite is part of a series launched by the Indian government for research purposes. Although designed by Isro, components for the rocket and the satellite were obtained from various sources, including the US which last week banned exports to Isro because it had bought cyrogenic rocket technology from Russia. The ban is bound to slow India's space programme which the government claims is for peaceful purposes and not for development of missile technology, as the US alleges. Prof U R Rao, chairman of Isro, said after the launching that it was a 'total success'. The two tasks of proving the functioning of the rocket and orbiting the satellite had been completed successfully, he said. India issued charges yesterday against the head of a Sri Lankan Tamil guerrilla group for the murder a year ago, of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, Reuter reports from Madras. The special investigation team looking into Mr Gandhi's killing on May 21, 1991, charged Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, head of the Tamil Tigers, and his intelligence chief, Mr Pottu Amman. India has asked Sri Lanka to arrest and extradite Mr Prabhakaran.</p>

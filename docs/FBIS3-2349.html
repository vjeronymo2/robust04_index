Following the protests "an order was sent down for  strict rectification of all religious groups in Qinghai", said  Father Li Zhixin, a 38-year-old Catholic priest in the  provincial capital of Xining. "Their prime target has been  Muslims, then Catholics, because most of them belong to the  underground church."    Father Li said that in addition to being watched by police,  he had recently come under surveillance by the State Security  Bureau, which handles cases thought to threaten national  interests. They have branded him a counter-revolutionary.  Police have warned him several times to stop celebrating Mass,  and have told him he would be arrested if caught doing so. The  latest threat came last week. They have also demanded that he  turn over all money collected from followers. "I told them,  it's my responsibility, I have to do my missionary work," he  said.    Father Li has been a priest since 1982 and has celebrated  Mass daily in homes of followers. But in the past year, it has  become increasingly dangerous. Father Li, who works as a deputy  manager at a factory, said police last November raided a convent  where he had just celebrated Mass. Thanks to a tip-off, he  managed to leave before the police arrived. Another priest was  arrested and held for a day, and five nuns were taken away in  handcuffs and sent back to their homes.    The state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association has one  priest and at most about 200 followers in Xining, while the  underground church, which in defiance of government regulations  pledges allegiance to the Vatican has three priests and about  10,000 followers, according to Father Li. Last spring he was  detained while celebrating Mass in Jiangsu province. Police  handcuffed, beat and interrogated him in an attempt to get him  to admit he was acting illegally and selling out China.    Sometimes they made him sit on the floor and hold out his  arms straight in front of him for two hours at a time. They hit  him when his hands began to drop. The interrogations took place  up to five times a week. He also was forced to break rocks.  Police threatened him with up to seven years in jail for his  missionary work, but to his surprise, he was released and sent  back to Qinghai after two months.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / French surge in RSI sufferers Repetitive strain injury (RSI) has become the leading professional health problem in France, where the number of people claiming social security compensation has tripled over the past five years, it was reported yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. An international conference in Nice on health in the workplace was told that the number of sufferers from stress-related tendonitis reporting their problems to France's National Office for Health Insurance (CNAM) had risen from 646 in 1987 to 2,105 last year. This was out of a total of only 5,080 professional illness claims settled by CNAM last year.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'INS RAID ON SITE SCUTTLES BUDDING TRUST'  </P> <P> I did not realize that there was a Republic of Laguna Beach until reading the  article in the Orange County section (Nov. 30) titled "Raid at Dayworker Site  Angers Officials." On first reading, I was amused by the contradiction of a  police department which encourages lawbreaking. When one aids or abets others  to violate the laws of the United States, it is generally viewed as a crime.  </P> <P> However, since Laguna Beach apparently does not recognize the authority of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service or federal law, then one must recognize  the emergence of an independent Republic of Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> On reflection I have begun to view this attitude of disregard for laws as a  symptom of a deteriorating society. I am sure that I am not alone when I say  that I see countless examples of petty lawlessness being committed every day.  </P> <P> Sociologists will suggest that this petty lawlessness is based in part upon our  perceptions of our leaders and government. If Laguna Beach can so easily bypass  federal laws because of local self-interest, then why should the ordinary  citizen be any less self-interested? It makes one wonder whether the ordinary  Laguna Beach police officer has to rationalize, the giving of a traffic ticket  on the one hand while on the other hand he directs illegal aliens to a hiring  location so that the people of Laguna Beach can hire undocumented aliens.  </P> <P> The issue is not whether one does or does not like the federal immigration  laws, but rather the effect on our society from an apparent blatant disregard  of our laws.  </P> <P> WALTER A.

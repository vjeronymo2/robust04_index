			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Obrenovac, 31 Dec (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the Assembly of the republic of Srpska, has said  that this year the Serbs of the republic of Srpska have been  carrying out the difficult task of fighting the entire world to  save their state, their dignity, and their freedom. In this  difficult struggle we have managed, along with all the other  Serbs who have been vilified for demonstrating solidarity with  us, to resist all the pressures which fundamentally aimed to  bring about Serbian divisions and rifts, Krajisnik said.    Krajisnik maintains that there has been no justice or law in  all these assaults on us, something that is best borne out by  the European Union [EU] stands, as it in fact encouraged the  Muslims to first gain a foothold in central Bosnia and then to  take on the Serbs in the spring. We will, of course, be ready  for them, Krajisnik cautioned.    Asked by a Obrenovac radio reporter whether a change in the  leadership of Herceg-Bosna would tilt the balance of forces on  the ground, Mr. Krajisnik said that the possibility of Mate  Boban being replaced by Akmadzic would result in better  relations between the Croats and Muslims, something that in its  turn would not bring about changes to the Serbian negotiating  position. "All the more so since neither of them takes any  steps, as this is done by Mr. Tudjman, the Catholic Church and  the Vatican. In any case, as far as the Muslims are concerned,  there will be no further concessions, as it has already been  proved that they cannot reach their goal. Concessions in  western or eastern Bosnia would jeopardize the continuity of the  republic of Srpska," Krajisnik said.</p>

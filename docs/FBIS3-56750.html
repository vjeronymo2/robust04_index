Strong Economic Managers Getting Their  Way in Council of Ministers"]    [Text] Yegor Gaydar did the last thing he could for  President Yeltsin: He announced his resignation when Bill  Clinton's plane was approaching the United States. Whereas for  Boris Fedorov, Gaydar's economic policy and parliamentary bloc  comrade-in-arms, his decision came as a "total surprise," Viktor  Chernomyrdin, according to his secretary, had been ready --  meaning that the prime minister had well realized where his  actions were leading. As of November, Gaydar had been virtually  barred from making decisions on the republic's budget on  instructions of the head of the government. On 10 November,  Viktor Chernomyrdin issued personal instructions transferring  export quota responsibility to Oleg Soskovets; he himself  completely took over the sharing out of centralized credits.  All these were indications that the Council of Ministers was  going back to the Soviet style of work.    As early as the end of last year, several decisions were  made  which were clearly not backed by the budget's resources:  subsidies for a number of economic sectors, and the indexation  of minimum wages and pensions by 1.9 times. To the rejoicing of  officials in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the  sphere of export licensing has been widened; meanwhile, the  dragging of Tajikistan and Belarus into the ruble zone spells a  serious threat of price hikes in Russia. Thus, even the  presence of Gaydar and Fedorov did not prove a serious  constraint for the prime minister lately: He has achieved  control of the cabinet of which he is in charge. An attempt to  do the same on the scale of the Russian economy is seen as less  than productive.    Even assuming that Fedorov stays "on the promise" to fight  inflation by all means, his good intentions would soon be swept  away by the wave of demands from the agro-industrial lobby,  while he would become a decorative symbol of reforms. The  finance minister cannot but realize that, hence he would hardly  agree to the role of scapegoat. Without him the government's  Credit Commission, which in one way or another somehow filtered  the thousands of requests for centralized credits from regions,  sectors, and enterprises, would soon die.    Viktor Chernomyrdin cannot be thought as totally ignoring  the  danger of inflation. Ukraine's example has long been for him a  warning sign. And he would not have dared to oust monetarists  from the government without having some idea, or program, in his  name. He has such a program today, and he is quite enthusiastic  about it. This is the concept of selective support for key  enterprises of the national economy. Elaborated by Professor  Yasin, it would not have drawn any objections from Gaydar,  Chubays, or Fedorov had it contained reliable mechanisms to  implement it. They are extremely weak at the moment. As a  result of selective financing for the "points of growth," the  thread of inflation will be stripped.    It is good in a sense that "strong economic managers,"  "pragmatists," will work in Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet of  ministers in an undiluted form. The purity of the experiment,  as they say, is guaranteed. One unpleasant thing is, they are  going to experiment with a living country.    It is historically clear what hyperinflation ends in for a  country. The more so because the old-new communists and the  president's "best friend" who once a month "plays chess with  him" are already vibrating with impatience.</p>

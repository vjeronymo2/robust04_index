			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Germans plan to shift production abroad ONE IN three German companies intends to transfer part of its production outside the country in the next three years, compared with one in four that planned to do so in the past three years, according to a survey conducted by the German chamber of trade and industry, the DIHT. The survey, which polled 10,000 large and medium-sized companies in western Germany, says the favourite relocation site is eastern Europe, followed by Asia. The European Community, which swallows the bulk of German investment abroad, is gradually diminishing as a favoured manufacturing base, it notes. DIHT regularly polls its member companies, but this is the first time it has done so on the subject of relocation. One in four said it had planned partially to move production sites abroad in the last three years. Those that did so created an estimated 210,000 jobs. The sharpest rise in planned relocations is among manufacturers, with 36 per cent now saying they will partly move abroad in the next three years. In the last three years, 28 per cent of them planned to do so. Companies cite high domestic labour costs as the primary reason for plans to move production abroad. They also point to shorter working weeks and machine-running times as factors hindering domestic productivity. Companies also blame strict environmental legislation, saying it is forcing them to invest in non-productive assets in Germany. They also say long waiting periods for permission to build new plants or conduct certain types of research, such as biotechnology, are pushing them beyond their national borders. Eastern Europe is named by nearly all as a favourite region to develop new manufacturing bases. They say the region combines a labour force with low wages. Poland, former Czechoslovakia and Hungary have an average hourly wage of DM5 to DM7, compared with DM42 in Germany. 'German companies have to reduce total costs by 20 to 30 per cent to remain competitive in global markets. Eastern Europe, which is on their doorstep, offers them a chance to do this,' says Mr Siegfried Utzig, senior economist at the German industry federation, the BDI. The opening up of the former communist bloc is also offering new opportunities for the small and medium-sized enterprises which form Germany's industrial backbone. 'Large German companies have always moved production sites abroad as part of their growth strategies. But what we see now is smaller companies going abroad. This contributes to the growing unemployment in Germany,' says Mr Michael Fuchs, head of the German association of exporters, BGA. In Baden-Wurttemberg, the southern state with the highest number of medium-sized enterprises, 40 per cent of the companies said they planned to move some of their production abroad in the next three years. This compares with 27 per cent of them having partially relocated in the last three years. A second favourite region is Asia, where larger companies are opening production sites to compete on local markets, in particular with Japanese groups.</p>

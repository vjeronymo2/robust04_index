			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Pounds 9.5m of shares recovered Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank, said yesterday that it had recovered five stolen share certificates worth some Pounds 9.5m. The bank, one of the world's largest custodians of securities, reported the loss to the British Bankers' Association on April 12. Mr Jeffrey Evans of Bankers Trust said yesterday: 'This does happen  - it is not a unique occurrence.' He added that an audit of the 15,000 share certificates in its UK vaults, carried out since the discovery, had revealed no further losses. The missing certificates, which represented shares in Guinness, British Gas and British Airways, were held in the bank's vaults at Moorgate in the City of London. Mr Evans added: 'No money has been lost either to the bank or to its clients.' The bank holds audits of its share certificates several times a year.</p>

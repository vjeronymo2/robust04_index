			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Ford considers moving European staff FORD, the US carmaker, said yesterday that it has considered moving part of its Ford of Europe headquarters staff from the UK as part of its restructuring programme. The company said, however, it had no 'definite plan' to press ahead with such a move. In a statement to staff it insisted that 'no decisions have been made to move any activity at this time'. The Ford of Europe headquarters is at Warley, Essex, the same location as the base for Ford of Britain. Ford of Europe fell into loss last year. The company said yesterday that as part of its overall restructuring programme it was 'leaving no stone unturned to find ways of improving the international competitiveness' of its European operations. Its financial performance in the past two years has been overshadowed by the resurgent fortunes of General Motors in Europe - under the Vauxhall name in the UK and Opel on the Continent. GM reorganised its European operations in the late 1980s. It established a small headquarters staff in Zurich, Switzerland, as a neutral location away from its main production and research and development operations in Germany, the UK, Belgium and Spain. It is understood that Ford has studied the idea of a similar move. The company said that recent 'allegations' that it planned to move its engineering activities from the UK to Germany were 'absolutely untrue'.</p>

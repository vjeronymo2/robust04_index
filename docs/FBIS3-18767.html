However,  the Twelve are not considering a resort to a new trade tool of  their own for now. In addition, the Twelve still openly  disagree on the message they should tell the world on the  occasion of the new world trade organization's inauguration.    In a common statement, the Twelve's foreign affairs  ministers  express their concern about the implementation of U.S. trade law  Super 301. The EU Council condemns the use of such unilateral  actions in international trade conflicts. The Twelve ask that  all trade partners act according to the agreements reached  within the framework of the multilateral GATT negotiations. The  European Commission must thoroughly investigate whether the U.S.  trade sanctions, which are directed against Japan, are a  violation of the GATT agreeements.    However, the Twelve are not sharpening their knives right  away. So far, the possible creation of a new European trade tool  intended to protect the EU against unfair trade practices has  been ruled out altogether. The Twelve agreed on this last  December, when they ratified the GATT agreement.    On behalf of the Twelve, EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan  outlined the provisional state of affairs regarding the  commitments for market access. The latter revealed that the EU  would scale down its original offer regarding trucks and  nonferrous metals. The EU Commission is negotiating with the  United States for an improved and more equitable offer.  [passage omitted]</p>

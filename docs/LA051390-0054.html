			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PROBLEMS AT FOOTHILL HIGH IN TUSTIN NEED TO BE RESOLVED  </P> <P> Historically, teachers have been underpaid. The profession was dominated by  women, who in prior years could be paid less for the same work. Times are  changing with regard to women's ability to earn equal pay for equal jobs, but  the teaching profession is still woefully behind in its salaries.  </P> <P> No one will argue that the teaching profession is one of the finest and most  honorable of the professions. Nor would anyone argue that it is one of the most  important if we are to improve the standard of living of our nation.  </P> <P> Tustin teachers want more money, and they deserve more money.  </P> <P> The Foothill High School teachers are not assigning homework as part of a job  action in protest of their no-contract situation. In other words, they  theoretically teach the material, and the student is somehow supposed to learn  the material without ever having to study outside the classroom or perform any  repetitive reinforcement tasks.  </P> <P> The teachers claim they will not give 120% in the classroom. No one has ever  asked them to give 120% in the classroom. However, as long as they are in the  classroom, we as parents and taxpayers deserve 100% effort, including the  traditional assignment of homework in the form of outside research, outside  reading, mathematics assignments, chemistry assignments, etc.  </P> <P> The Foothill High School teachers are still collecting their wages for their  "work" but yet are not willing to perform their "work." Since they are working  without a contract and believe that wage negotiations are at a standstill, they  have the option of going on strike.  </P> <P> If they choose that option, they should go on strike and close the schools down  completely. They should bring the district to its knees and force it to pay an  adequate wage.  </P> <P> If they are not willing to go on strike, then they must accept the wage the  district is paying and perform their jobs as required or seek employment  elsewhere.  </P> <P> FRED W. ANDERSON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

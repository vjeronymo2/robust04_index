			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A firm belief in reincarnation - The Design Council's new chairman claims reports of its death have been exaggerated The view from Utopia is that something very constructive has just happened to the Design Council. To the rest of the world it seemed last week that the 49-year-old body was to be dismembered and buried, at least in its present form. The government announced that it planned to integrate many of the council's functions into the new Business Links network of service centres for smaller businesses. But to John Sorrell, who takes over as chairman of the redesigned council in January and whose consultancy Newell and Sorrell is based in the small north London enclave of stylish businesses called Utopia Village, the possibilities of reincarnation are immense. 'There's been too much talk of 'dismantling'. This is refocusing. It's exactly what's happened with a large number of household-name British industrial companies - they've refocused, restructured and they're stronger than they were before.' Sorrell, a former chairman of the Design Business Association, is chairman of the design consultancy he founded with his wife Frances Newell in 1976. Its principal business is corporate identity and the Automobile Association and InterCity are two of its best-known clients. Not that Sorrell will be spending all his time at Newell and Sorrell in the coming months. He will be heading a review of all the Design Council's activities with the aim of getting it into its new shape by the end of next year. His review will not, he says, be circumscribed by a new pre-set budget, although it is widely thought that the government will cut the council's grant from Pounds 7.5m to less than Pounds 3m. 'It's incredibly misleading to look at the effectiveness of the organisation in terms of headcount and amounts of money,' he says. Instead, he will be guided by the government's plan to deliver services through Business Links wherever possible. Sorrell is anxious not to be seen to be pre-empting the review. 'We anticipate that the various information and advice services which are currently available - such as the Design Advisory Service, the Materials Information Service, the Consultancy Register, the Product Development Advisory Centre - will need to be looked at in terms of their integration into Business Links if ministers' strategy is to be followed,' he says. Also under scrutiny are the council's magazines Design and Engineering, its premises in Haymarket, London, and the design awards. The council's acclaimed education work it is thought will continue to be carried out centrally. A significant problem for Sorrell to consider in these early stages lies in transferring services to Business Links - only three of the 200-plus planned Links have been forged. Sorrell says: 'It would be an absolute disaster if there were disruption. If certain services are to be transferred, then we'll do it very calmly, very carefully.' So what will the council be left with when the review is over? Tim Sainsbury, Department of Trade and Industry minister, says it should be 'a powerful voice for effective design, a bridge between industry and the design community and a vital catalyst stimulating initiatives'. If Sorrell pulls this off he may hold the blueprint for all small but perfectly formed councils, quangos and worthy bodies in Utopia.</p>

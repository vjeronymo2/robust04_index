			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM group metals closed above the day's lows in London after falling in the wake of an overnight report that Japanese car-makers will cut imports in 1993 and may sell metal from their stockpiles. 'Platinum and PALLADIUM really needed a shake-out and I think that's what we've seen on the Japanese news, but the main improvement in platinum demand is likely to be in Europe and the US this year,' one dealer said. Nymex platinum and palladium futures were down at midday. RHODIUM was quoted at Dollars 1,500 on the free market in London, down Dollars 150 on the day; a possible retreat to Dollars 1,400 was predicted. ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices moved up to the higher ends of comparatively narrow ranges on the LME. Dealers said aluminium's gains were fostered by reports of a 36,000 tonne production cutback at a US smelter. Talk also circulated that Bonneville Power Administration restrictions will make power increasingly expensive for the aluminium smelters it services. Compiled from Reuters</p>

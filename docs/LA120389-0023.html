			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> ENGLISH BEAT: British popsters have always been fascinated by Reggie and Ronnie  Kray, a pair of nasty East End gangster twins who made London tabloid headlines  in the '60s for stabbings, murders and other horrific forms of skulduggery.  ("Stormy Monday," a 1988 film co-starring Sting and Melanie Griffith, features  a pair of hoodlums loosely based on the Krays, who were also spoofed as the  Piranha Brothers in several Monty Python routines.) Now the evil twins are  being immortalized on celluloid, thanks to Gary and Martin Kemp of Spandau  Ballet, who've just completed a movie called "The Krays." The film's producer,  Dominic Anciano, bought the rights to the project from the Who's Roger Daltrey,  who had originally been interested in playing one of the twins. Expect to see  the film out sometime next year. . . . Back from another stay in a rehab center  (which he entered after being detained for assaulting his wife, who later  dropped charges), rock bad-boy Ozzy Osbourne is at home in England at work on a  new album, titled "No Dogs Allowed." . . . Marianne Faithfull is recording a  live album in New York, with an all-star cast including the Band's Garth  Hudson, Dr. John and (Tom Waits guitar wiz) Marc Ribot. It's due for release in  early spring.  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / 'I cannot do without you,' Blair tells union barons 'Fairness not favours' is how Opposition leader Mr Tony Blair describes relations between the trade unions and a future Labour government led by him. His carefully chosen words have been interpreted by some as a sign that he wants to distance Labour from its union allies. Mr Blair's refusal to back the rail signal workers has been taken as a sign that he finds the unions an embarrassment to the party. But during his dinner with the Trades Union Congress general council in Blackpool on Tuesday Mr Blair left most union leaders in no doubt that he believed Labour needed their help to win the next general election. 'I cannot do without you,' he said. He emphasised that he was committed to the union agenda of full employment, a national minimum wage to help end poverty pay, and the introduction of legal rights for workers. Mr Blair made clear to his TUC hosts that he would develop policies to implement those agreed aims at his own pace and not at anybody else's. He emphasised that Labour would govern in the 'public interest' unbeholden to any pressure groups such as unions. Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU union's general secretary, may believe it is 'insulting' to suggest unions are on a par with other voluntary associations in the eyes of a Labour government, but Mr Blair is determined to avoid Conservative accusations that either he or his party is in the grip of union barons. Nor does he want to return to incomes policies that would force trade unions to shoulder wider responsibilities in return for political privileges. None of this should come as any surprise to those with understanding of party-union links. When Hugh Gaitskell addressed the TUC as Labour leader on the eve of the 1959 general election he told delegates that they and Labour had 'different jobs to do. You have your industrial job and we have our political job. We do not dictate to one another'. The two wings of the Labour movement had 'common aims' and it was in the interests of both 'to work in harmony'. What Mr Blair is suggesting reflects that position and it enjoys the full support of Mr John Monks, the TUC's modernising general secretary. The TUC is also keen to keep clear of any return to formalised entanglements with the Labour party. The close alliance between them in the 1970s, enshrined in the Social Contract, was a breach with previous practice. In its evidence to the Donovan royal commission on the unions in 1966, the TUC under George Woodcock said there was 'a significant divergence of function' between Labour and the unions. The TUC said: 'The existence of common roots yet distinct functions is the most important feature of the relationship. The relationship becomes strained if either attempts to capitalise on the loyalties which exist, and the strength of the relationship lies paradoxically in the looseness of the ties.' Some union leaders may have reservations, but they support Mr Monks's strategy to re-establish the TUC's room for political manoeuvre as an independent campaigning voice in public policy debate. This is what it enjoyed in the past under Labour prime ministers Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson before the Social Contract. In this respect, party-union relations may be returning to what they were during Labour's political ascendancy nearly 30 years ago.</p>

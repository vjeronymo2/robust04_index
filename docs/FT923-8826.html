			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Egypt moves on customs Egypt took a further step towards a market economy yesterday, abolishing customs concessions for state-owned companies and ending a ban on some imports, Reuter reports from Cairo. A presidential decree setting new customs rates went into effect at midnight at ports of entry, allowing imports of 30 previously banned categories and cutting an import blacklist to 75 items. Freeing trade and ending prerogatives enjoyed by the subsidised public sector have been high on a reform agenda agreed with the IMF.</p>

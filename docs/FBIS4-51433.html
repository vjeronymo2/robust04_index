			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "In a Letter to NPC Standing Committee, Seven </F> Student Movement Leaders Call for Rehabilitation of 4 June  Incident"]    [Text] Seven former Beijing student movement leaders wrote  a letter to the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress [NPC] yesterday, calling for rehabilitation of the 4  June 1989 incident. The letter's full text is as follows:    "The Standing Committee of the NPC of the People's Republic  of China:    Five years have elapsed since the democracy movement took  place in 1989. As the citizens of the Republic who took an  active part in the movement in the capacity of young students,  we have never forgotten it, because we firmly believe that the  movement has played an incalculable role in propelling history  forward. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the  democracy movement of 1989, by exercising the political rights  of citizens according to law, we openly express the following  three strong appeals to the NPC Standing Committee, the supreme  power organ of the state:    1. Reappraising the democracy movement of 1989. It was a  patriotic democratic movement of the whole people with young  students as the mainstay. During the movement, we always  adhered to the principle of "peace, reason, and nonviolence."  We deem it unjust for the government to determine the nature of  the movement as "a disturbance and counterrevolutionary  insurrection," and it must be reappraised as soon as possible.    2. Releasing all those who have been locked up until now  because of the 4 June incident.    3. Giving special care and allowance to members of the  bereaved families in the 4 June incident and properly solving  the livelihood problem of those who were put in prison for their  part in the 4 June incident and have now returned to society.    We maintain: The 4 June incident has formed an unavoidable  "knot [jie 4815]" in the development of the Chinese nation's  history. At a time when the drive for reform and opening up to  the outside world has entered a crucial stage, like the  government, we hope for a stable social environment. Moreover,  solving the problem of 4 June incident and untying the "knot" in  the people's hearts will help alleviate social contradictions,  promote social stability, build the democratic legal system, and  promote social progress. We sincerely hope that the government  will boldly take this wise step by setting the interests of the  nation and the future of the state above everything else.    It is our request that Standing Committee members will  consider the above proposals."    The seven former student movement leaders who signed the  letter were Wang Dan, Ma Shaofang, Zhai Weimin, Shao  Jiang, Li Hai, Zheng Xuguang, and Guo Haifeng.    As the letter was sent on the evening of the fifth  anniversary of the 4 June incident, this event is thus very  sensitive.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: MYSTERY LEFT UNSOLVED BY FALL OF WALL  </P> <P> All the politicians and pundits have offered their analyses about the crumbling  of the Berlin Wall and what it means to world events. Every time I see a  picture of the Wall, though, all I can think about is Sarah Pryor.  </P> <P> On Oct. 9, 1985, Sarah Pryor, 9, who lived in Wayland, Mass., told her father  she was going to go out for a walk in the neighborhood. It was 4 p.m. Wayland  is a quiet, usually peaceful town of 15,000.  </P> <P> Sarah had just finished eating a dish of Jell-O that she had made for herself.  She watched a TV show, and that's when she told her dad she was going to go  out.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Aren't you going to clean the dish of Jell-O?' " recalls her father,  Andrew Pryor. "She said she'd clean it when she got back. She walked out the  front door. I never saw her again."  </P> <P> According to Wayland Police officers, Sarah walked north on Concord Road for  approximately 1 1/2 miles. Several people saw her as she walked. Then she  disappeared. According to police, "We don't know exactly where. It is our  belief that she was abducted. But we have no crime scene, no witnesses and no  physical evidence. We do not know what happened to this child."  </P> <P> Sarah was described as "your basic, average, happy-go-lucky, 9-year-old girl.  She was shy around strangers. She was very much family-oriented and very  athletic. She did well in school."  </P> <P> In 1987, almost two years after Sarah Pryor disappeared, an American journalist  named Martin Yant was traveling in Germany, and he made a point of visiting the  Berlin Wall. There was graffiti on the Western side of the Wall, which  surprised Yant: Somehow it had never occurred to him that there would be  graffiti on the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> As he looked at the Wall, Yant saw something that startled him. Amid all the  drawings and scrawlings and German words, there was this, in English, painted  in white:  </P> <P> "Sarah Pryor, wherever you are, we love you. Age 9. Missing October 9, 1985.  Whalen, MA., U.S.A. God love you."  </P> <P> Yant recorded this in his notebook, and when he returned to the United States  he contacted me. He had no idea if there really was a Sarah Pryor. And if there  was, what was the message doing on the Berlin Wall?  </P> <P> It turned out that there was no city called "Whalen" in Massachusetts. But  there is a "Wayland," and when I started talking to people in Wayland, I  learned of the Sarah Pryor story.  </P> <P> The police in Wayland were aware of the message on the Wall: Tourists in  Germany had sent them snapshots of it. But the police, in 1987, had no idea how  the message had gotten on the Wall, or what its significance was. Had it been  placed on the Wall by Sarah's family? Had it been placed there by people with  knowledge of Sarah's whereabouts? And one thing about it was so odd: All the  details were right, including her age and the exact date she disappeared, but  the name of the town was spelled wrong. If someone knew about Sarah's  disappearance, why would they not know that it was "Wayland" and not "Whalen"?  </P> <P> Her parents had not visited Germany and had no idea how the message got on the  Wall. The police were just as baffled.  </P> <P> And now the Wall is coming down, both symbolically and literally as people chip  away at it. I found myself looking at the news coverage, and thinking about  Sarah.  </P> <P> "Sarah is still missing," said Lt. Gerald Galvin of the Wayland Police Dept.  "We still do not know exactly what occurred. Every time someone reports a  sighting of a girl they think is Sarah, we check it out. The investigation has  gone from Maine to California to San Juan. We have nothing."  </P> <P> Lt. Galvin said no one has ever come up with an answer to how Sarah's name got  on the Berlin Wall, or why. "But that's what I thought about, too, when all the  news was coming out of Berlin," he said. "I looked at the news coverage and I  looked for the message about Sarah. I didn't see it. I wondered if it would be  torn down or chipped away."  </P> <P> Sarah's father said he was watching the news coverage every day, too.  </P> <P> "I really had very mixed feelings," he said. "I know that what is happening  with the Wall has great international significance. But as I looked at all the  people climbing onto the Wall and whatnot, taking pickaxes to it -- well, I  know that what was happening was historic, but I have to admit, I was thinking  about something else."  </P> <P> If Sarah Pryor is alive, she is 13 now.  </P></p>

He said he had accepted  Fedorov's resignation and this matter would be decided by  President Yeltsin.    The prime minister also said that he had conferred with the  head of state for 30 minutes Monday morning discussing the  budget draft for the first quarter of the year. He explained  that he had never had and would not have "any differences with  the president and never intended to pass the buck to him."    Answering an Interfax question, Chernomyrdin denied press  reports that he had invited Professor Leonid Abalkin, an  authority in economics, to work as his adviser. He said,  however, that he wanted to have a closer look at what each of  his advisers was doing.    Chernomyrdin promised that the government would pay its  debts  to farmers but emphasized that this had to be done "in a  reasonable way and the cabinet does not intend to grant credits  easily."    Chernomyrdin said his government would stick to its policy  of  reform, "but the time has come when, in addition to monetarist  ways of solving economic problems, non-monetarist methods should  be used, too." There is, for example, one mechanism that has  never been used previously -- "agreements between the  government, trade unions and producers on the pricing of output  and on setting the levels of wages for a certain period," he  said.    He said the present tough credit and financial policy would  be continued.    Commenting on the future monetary union between Russia and  Belarus, the prime minister said not enough preparation work had  yet been done for the relevant documents to be signed. He said  he would certainly visit Minsk. "The hullabaloo over relations  with Belarus" is "harmful and totally wrong," he said. "They  want to pull us further away from each other, but they won't  manage to," he said.    Chernomyrdin said Russia would remain loyal to the CIS  economic union treaty. "Nothing has ever been done or will ever  be done at the expense of Russia and the Russians, or at the  expense of Belarus, Kazakhstan, or Ukraine," he said.</p>

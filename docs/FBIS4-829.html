			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- The Inaktha Freedom  Party [IFP] Youth Brigade on Monday [18 March] announced a  stayaway in Johannesburg and its environs on Tuesday, saying  this was part of its right to push for true democracy in South  Africa.    At the same time, the Youth Brigade set a deadline of 4PM on  Tuesday for President F W de Klerk to respond to a series of  demands, failing which it would embark on rolling mass action.    "We also ask our people to mark tomorrow (Tuesday) as a day  of prayer for our parents who were murdered by (African National  Congress armed wing) Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the  Nation] thugs in Johannesburg two weeks ago," Mr Zenzeli  Phakathi, the brigade's national publicity secretary, told a  press conference in Johannesburg.    He said demands put to Mr de Klerk include investigating the  deaths of eight people outside the ANC's Shell House  headquarters on March 28, to explain why MK had not been  disbanded and IFP constitutional requirements.    If Mr de Klerk did not responded appropriately to their  demands, the Youth Brigade would embark on "rolling mass action".    This would be spontaneous, with participation by IFP members  in Natal, the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], the  Orange Free State and parts of the Cape.    IFP Central Committee member Themba Khoza acknowledged the  action could have serious consequences for the economy. "We say  that the rand is our major target. We want to shoot it down. But  before the rand falls, (Mr) de Klerk must rise and deal with our  demands," Mr Khoza said.    "This is civil disobedience in the way that Mahatma Gandhi  carried it out. The position of the Youth Brigade needs to be  taken seriously. We are trying to prevent a civil war," he said.    On the constitution, Mr Khoza said it was important the  April  elections be postponed.    "If they don't postpone the elections half the people will  stay away and will not want to be ruled by a new government  composed of (Mr) Mandela/(Mr) de Klerk.    "We say they should rather postpone the elections for two or  three months and deal with the unrest during that period, rather  than have the elections now and then have unrest that does not  stop at all," he said.    He said the IFP Youth Brigade had the support of the parent  body's national leadership.    "We are one body just as an upper abdomen and a lower  abdomen  are linked."</p>

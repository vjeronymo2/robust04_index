			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Higher costs blamed for fall to Bt4.8bn at Siam Cement SIAM Cement, the Thai conglomerate and largest cement producer in the country, yesterday announced a fall in consolidated net profits to an estimated Bt4.81bn (Dollars 200m) in 1991 from Bt5.35bn in 1990. It blamed increased costs for the decline. Although the profits were below expectations, this year's results are expected to benefit from low energy prices and increased local cement production capacity, which will reduce the need for expensive imports. Consolidated net revenue was put at Bt53.17bn, up from Bt44.06bn in 1990. For the parent company, net profit in 1991 fell to Bt3.89bn on net revenue of Bt35.60bn, compared with 1990 profits of Bt4.71bn on revenue of Bt31.06bn. Siam Cement proposed a final dividend of Bt9 a share, making an unchanged total of Bt18 for the year. The company said it had held prices stable for most of its products while absorbing higher costs for fuel, financing and raw materials, including imported bagged cement, which has to be sold at the prevailing local price. 'Their capacity is increasing very substantially,' said one broker in Bangkok, 'so we expect their margins to increase very substantially, too, in the next two years.' Siam Cement plans to raise its annual capacity in Thailand to 16m tonnes by October and to 19.5m tonnes by 1995, from the current 12.4m tonnes. Other investments include the group's first overseas factory - a ceramic tile plant in Tennessee in a joint venture with Finfloor of Italy - and a Bt6bn joint venture with Yamato Kogyo of Japan to make structural steel in Thailand. The group is also negotiating deals in Vietnam. Mr Amaret Sila-on, the Thai commerce minister and former Siam Cement executive, forecast that the country's cement production capacity would double to 40m tonnes in the next five years. Although the industry was well-placed to compete in the region, he said, Thailand could be constrained in the long term by environmental and raw materials constraints.</p>

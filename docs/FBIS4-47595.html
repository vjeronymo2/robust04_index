			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Conversation with Yuriy Naydo, director of the Center of </F> Structural Studies and Industrial Policy of IMEPI RAN, and  Stanislav Simanovskiy, director of the sector of innovative  policy of the same institute: ``Technological Sovereignty'' is  Much Easier to Lose Than to Recover'']    [Text] One of the problems that is coming up as Russia  moves toward a market economy is the necessity of reinforcing  national technological security. However, this is not only a  consequence of market reforms, but also a condition for success  of these reforms. After all, scientific-technical potential is  practically the only strategic resource that Russia can rely on  to extricate herself from economic crisis. We decided to turn  the podium over to specialists who have long and persistently  tried to call the attention of the authorities and the public to  this issue. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was visited by Yuriy Naydo,  director of the Center of Structural Studies and Industrial  Policy of IMEPI RAN, and Stanislav Simanovskiy, director of the  sector of innovative policy of the same institute.    Yuriy Naydo: Unfortunately, failure of the state  to take action is leading to Russia's de facto loss of  ``technological sovereignty'': scientific-technical potential is  rapidly being destroyed, erosion of key personnel is glaringly  evident, the material-technical and informational base of  science is deteriorating, and scientific-technical projects lie  dormant.    A situation where science is being transformed to nothing  but  expense is one of the terrible signs of loss of technological  security of the nation. This is inevitably followed by a  widening lag behind the world community and lopsided  technological dependence on developed Western nations that will  be very difficult to overcome.    As a result, our nation will be unable to make a claim to  participation in the international division of labor as a  partner on equal footing, and will be condemned to continually  pumping a considerable fraction of its national income over to  the use of states on a higher stage of scientific-technical  development.    Stanislav Simanovskiy: As we change over to the  market, to an open economy, there is a sharp increase in the  role of international cooperation. Without it, Russian science  will be hard put to survive, since there is almost no internal  demand on the transitional stage for domestic scientific and  engineering advances. And this means that without international  cooperation we cannot avoid the collapse of the  scientific-technical potential of Russia. But this is only one  obvious aspect of the problem. Another aspect is not so obvious  at first glance. The fact is that international cooperation,  allowed to find its own level, objectively carries the threat of  a decline in national technological security. This is confirmed  if only by the example of today's assistance given by the world  community to Russian science. Today the volume of such  assistance (both actually provided and pledged) is about $600  million. More than ten different funds have been established in  the West to support science in Russia. Among others, there are  the well known Soros Fund that allocates 100 million dollars to  CIS nations for 1993-1994, the U.S. National Science Fund ($25  million), the Mitterrand Fund, General European Fund (4 million)  and so on.    In my opinion, Russia ought to accept such help with  gratitude. But in doing so, she is obliged to take care that  this assistance does nothing to harm the technological security  of the nation.    For instance just take the system of gathering information  about research and development, scientific institutions and key  researchers when submitting requests for grants and other aid.  It gives the West an exhaustive picture of Russian scientific-  technical potential. And it does this in detail that at times is  not accessible to Russian governmental agencies responsible for  the development of science and engineering. The most promising  research and the most productive scientists can be freely used  in the interests of Western science, engineering, and economy as  a whole. In particular, by offering stipends to the most capable  students, contracts for internship and work abroad to the most  promising young scientists and specialists. By financing  individual scientists and teams, providing research equipment,  the West is actually setting up in Russia its own kind of  industry to serve its own economy. In truth, whoever pays can  call the tune. There is also the potential possibility of saving  individual areas of Russian science and engineering, and even  shutting them off from considerations of the competitive  struggle. In their attempts to earn some cash, our scientists  are ready to take next to nothing for transfer abroad of  research results, many of which surpass the world level and are  the genuine national property of Russia. And in essence, all of  this is nothing more than flow to the West of Russian national  wealth without equivalent reimbursement.    Naydo: Under conditions of a totalitarian regime,  autarkic economy (i.e. closed, self-sufficient), technological  security was looked at primarily in the context of  military-political rivalry, the arms race. With the transition  to an open market economy, its content shifts toward the  economic sphere. Today, technological security should primarily  ensure success of the nation in the hard competitive struggle  for the world market. And there is feedback between  technological security and competition: the stronger the  competitive positions of a nation on the world market, the  stronger will be its technological security.    Simanovskiy: Active political and diplomatic  measures will be needed to stop the discriminatory practice of  the West that was introduced during the years of the Cold War  and that makes it difficult for our nation to have access to  world advances in science and engineering. Now it looks like the  process is slowly moving in the reverse direction. Nevertheless,  there are still no guarantees that limitations of this kind will  be reinstated in full measure if political development in Russia  should be interpreted as unfavorable for the West.    Naydo: An effective solution to the problem is not  to return to yesterday's autarky, but rather the reverse, to  reinforce and develop the closest and strongest contacts with  the world community. Most optimum are cooperative ties  distinguished by forming equal technological  interdependence of partners. This safeguards uniform  technological dependence of participants in international  cooperation. It means equality of economic conditions of  international exchange, precluding redistribution of the  national income of the less developed partner to the advantage  of the more developed partner. It also means equality of  potential loss in the case of breaking of technological ties.    The tasks of retaining the scientific-technical potential of  Russia and preventing lopsided technological dependence on the  West are intimately intertwined. However, they need to be  handled by different approaches. Financial support of science is  needed to retain our scientific-technical potential. In addition  to that, prevention of lopsided technological dependence  requires that the state and the private sector keep a watch on  utilization of our stock of inventions, developments and  technologies. A watch that on the one hand encourages  international competition, and on the other hand sets up a  barrier to squandering of national scientific-technical  achievements of strategic significance. Such supervision, based  mainly on economic methods, should be an integral part of a  unified state scientific-technical policy.    Simanovskiy: Problems of technological security  should be permanently on the agenda, and the topic of at least a  yearly report by the President and the government. Such an  approach would force the leadership of the nation to look at the  literally perishing scientific-technical potential, academic,  industrial and institutional science, the enormous defense  conversion sector of the economy, and the military-industrial  complex, at coming up with a scientifically sound governmental  scientific-technical policy.    Legislative support is needed as well: a codex of laws about  the scientific-technical policy of the state, the academic  scientific establishment, the status of the scientist,  protection of intellectual property, transfer of technologies  from defense to civilian sectors, governmental classified and  confidential items, and also a block of laws and normatives  regulating the process of the brain drain both out of Russia to  other nations, and out of nations of the former USSR into Russia.    Naydo: Federal agencies of authority ought to have  a clear idea about what the nation still has at its disposal in  the technological sense. This would be aided by an inventory of  scientific and engineering attainments of the nation, an  assessment of the prospects for commercial sales on foreign  markets, ascertainment of areas where we lead and lag with  respect to the world level, and accordingly determination of  priority areas of technological export and import.    Simanovskiy: Apparently, we also need an agency on  acquiring and utilizing international material and technological  assistance for Russian science. Such assistance requires  coordination on a multilateral level; among other things,  setting up an information system, a unified financial fund or  bank, an insurance company, and the like. The main thing is  maximum simplification of access to outside sources of funding  for all deserving claimants.    The problem of technological security of the nation will not  be solved in one day. It is going to take constant and  persistent attention. But the steps that we have proposed are  only a part of what is needing to be handled without delay.  Tomorrow it will be too late. For now there is still a chance of  rectifying the situation.</p>

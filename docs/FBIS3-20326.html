			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Klaus-Peter Schoeppner, managing director of the </F> Emnid Opinion Research Institute in Bielefeld: "The Mistakes  Made by the Union Parties and the Form Of the Day of the SPD"]    [Text] Exclusively on behalf of the BERLINER ZEITUNG,  the Emnid Opinion Research Institute, at monthly intervals,  prepares compilations of significant trends and relevant opinion  research data.    Enough of all the talk, election promises, and verbal  attacks. It's time to vote. But when super election year 1994  kicks off on 13 March with the Lower Saxon Landtag election, the  parties will leave their starting blocks on a very unequal basis.    What is certain is that only the SPD [Social Democratic  Party  of Germany] has been able to maneuver itself into a favorable  starting position. But only because the Republikaner, following  a good start, have gone into a tailspin, and the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democratic Union/ Christian Social Union], as well as  the Alliance 90/Greens, are almost still in their starting  blocks.    At a time when the importance of fundamental party concepts  for deciding the outcome of elections is declining, when  confidence in authority has been lost, when CDU and SPD become  interchangeable, and the percentage of hard-core voters who will  remain loyal to a particular party is dropping, likableness and  the political climate take on additional significance. The party  on top, prestigewise, suddenly seems to be in much better shape  than would follow from its share of the voters.  <H5>  Personal Liking Will Be Decisive </H5>   Particularly the easily influenced, politically  disinterested, and indecisive voters base their decision on the  form of the day. As many as 5 percentage points of votes gained  or lost can easily be the result of the political mood.    And this mood is, if anything, favorable for the SPD at the  moment, while being unfavorable for the governing coalition in  Bonn. Forty-nine percent of those polled see Scharping's party  [the SPD] in front in February 1994, only 18 percent the  CDU/CSU. The approval rate of the Republikaner has clearly gone  down. Prior to the onset of the election marathon, Schoenhuber's  amorphous scare slogans become ever less entrancing. The FDP  [Free Democratic Party], but also the Alliance 90/Greens, have  been fighting a headwind for some time already.    The state of low esteem of the Union parties has now lasted  almost three years. Scharping, on the other hand, following the  loss of esteem caused by the Engholm resignation, has gradually  brought his party back to smoother waters. But the SPD's  passable form of the day still seems to be based more on the  contrast that it presents to the mistakes of the Union than on  the high esteem in which the opposition party in Bonn is held.  Only a little less than half the people entitled to vote (46  percent) consider it capable of taking over the government. A  majority (55 percent) is still dissatisfied with the  challengers. All signs seem to point to a basic position of the  electorate, viz. that he who does nothing also runs no risk of  doing anything wrong.    That could be risky, however. It took only three months  following the 1990 election for the standing of the Union  parties to drop into the cellar. The SPD had a similar  experience after the Engholm affair, but it recovered just as  quickly. Although 63 percent, more than at any time since  mid-1991, expect to see a red-green election victory, the SPD,  by the time of the election, can still run into difficulties to  the extent that the Union parties succeed in demanding that the  SPD take a clear position with respect to personalities and its  program.  <H5>  Voters Frightened Off </H5>   It is the coalition question which will most likely become  the acid test for the SPD. The majority of voters currently  prefer above all the grand coalition which is so highly  unpopular in SPD circles. SPD supporters, on the other hand,  want a red-green coalition, a model for governing which not even  20 percent of those entitled to vote support. The SPD will  preserve its competence for having a decent plan to deal with  unemployment, currently the most important political task, only  as long as it does not have to give consideration to the  probable coalition partner Alliance 90/Greens. Regardless of the  SPD's decision in the coalition question, a large number of  voters and sympathizers will be frightened off in any case.  <H5>  Change Remains Permanent </H5>   The more the election takes on the characteristics of a  protest election, the greater will be the prospects for success  of the little parties. There have been increased indications  since February, however, that repudiations of the established  parties have decreased in number. More and more people are  realizing that many splinter parties have little more to offer  than nice-sounding words. Accordingly, the number of nonvoters  has been going down continuously since the beginning of the year.    At this point, only every tenth German still feels that the  Republikaner pursue "democratic" goals. Without a solid voter  base in the west, the chances of the PDS [Party of Democratic  Socialism] remain doubtful. Only a party along the lines of the  "Instead" [Statt] Party could spring a surprise. But here too  the percentage of Germans belonging to the broader circle of  sympathizers of this party has declined from 60 to 30 percent.    As of the beginning of 1994, only 16 percent of Germans are  still dedicated supporters of their party, and, seven months  before the Bundestag election, not even 50 percent know yet how  they will vote.    Against this background, there is still room for migrations  of the electorate. For that reason, in election year 1994, the  slogan of the political parties at this low point in the  political atmosphere is, as never before: Nothing is more  permanent than change.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dream Coalitions of the Voters(in percent)                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CDU/CSU with SPD                      |26                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CDU/CSU with FDP                      |17                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CDU/CSU with the Greens               |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |CDU/CSU with Republikaner             |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SPD with the Greens                   |19                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SPD with FDP                          |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SPD with Republikaner                 |2                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No answer                             |18 Source: Emnid                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

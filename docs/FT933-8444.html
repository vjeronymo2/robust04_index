			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Industry pay rises at 16-year low, says CBI PAY RISES in manufacturing industry averaged 2.3 per cent in the second quarter, the Confederation of British Industry reported yester-day. It was the lowest quarterly figure recorded by the CBI since its records began in 1977. It compares with 2.5 per cent in the first three months of the year and 4 per cent in the second quarter of last year. Service company pay awards in the second quarter this year provisionally averaged 2.9 per cent. The CBI said there was no evidence of a bottoming out in the level of pay settlements or that workers in companies which imposed pay freezes in 1991-92 were 'catching up', with large rises to compensate for the freezes. Manufacturers settling during the second quarter reported productivity gains averaging 3.8 per cent. Although the fall in unit labour costs for the second quarter is expected to be 2.6 per cent, down from a fall of 3 per cent in the first quarter, the overall fall is better than Germany, France, Japan and the US. Research by the CBI Pay Databank has found that in 1992-93 the average increase in companies which froze pay in the previous year was 2.1 per cent. This was lower than the average Databank increase of 3.4 per cent. The CBI says: 'Therefore there is little evidence to suggest that there has been a wave of 'catch-up' awards in 1992-93, and the evidence strengthens the position of public-sector managers facing possible 'catch-up' claims after the government's 1.5 per cent limit.' Only 88 Databank companies froze pay for 12 months or more in 1991-92. The freezes hit non-manual employees more than manual employees, and were concentrated in the retail and business services sector, although manufacturing was also affected. The highest proportion of freezes was in the south-east and the west Midlands. Pay freezes of less than 12 months are widespread, affecting about one in three manufacturers and one in four service-sector companies. The latest CBI employment affairs report says that, in spite of all the changes in the law in recent years, the number of employees 'actively taken out of the collective bargaining net has so far remained relatively low'. The report says that the decline in union membership and recognition is more the result of the failure of unions to colonise greenfield sites and small companies in the services sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, at the Wullowitz border checkpoint near  Freistadt, Upper Austria, 70 Czech UN soldiers on their way back  from the former Yugoslavia were stopped.    The suspicion that they had arms with them was substantiated  when their two buses were searched. A total of six hand  grenades and one pistol were found. By evening, 67 UN soldiers  could continue their journey home; three others are still being  interrogated.    Inquiries so far have led to the conclusion that the three  soldiers probably took the weapons with them only as "souvenirs"  of their mission in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

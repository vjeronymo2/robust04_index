			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Berlusconi and Bossi kiss and make up Feuding members of Italy's ruling coalition made a concerted effort over the weekend to show they had patched up their differences at a secret summit between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and Mr Umberto Bossi of the Northern League. Since the March general election, blunt-talking Mr Bossi has repeatedly criticised Mr Berlusconi for political misjudgments, and fears of a split in the coalition have contributed to tension on Italian financial markets in the last fortnight.

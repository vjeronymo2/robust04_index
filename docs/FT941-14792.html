			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Move on Israeli bank shares sell-off Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's minister of finance, said yesterday the government would issue the tender for the sale of Bank Leumi, Israel's second largest banking group, within a month. Mr Shochat said a controlling stake, defined by the government as at least 20 per cent of the shares, would be sold to local or foreign investors in Bank Leumi and, later in the year, in Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank. The sale of ownership in Bank Hapoalim would depend on the speed of the sale in Bank Leumi. In 1992 Bank Leumi reported consolidated net profits of Dollars 76m (Pounds 51m) from total consolidated assets of Dollars 28bn. For the same period Bank Hapoalim reported net profits of Dollars 90m from assets of Dollars 36bn. Last year the government began selling shares through the Tel Aviv stock exchange in the banks, both of which were taken over by the government in 1983 after a share manipulation scandal.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Airport staff face demotion A THIRD of senior managers at Manchester Airport have been told they must apply for middle-management postions or take redundancy, Catherine Milton writes. Successful applicants will not lose pay for two years, after which pay will drop to the rate for the job. The eight people involved are not guaranteed jobs within the airport. The airport said: 'Although cost-cutting is part of the motivation, it is primarily a cultural change to drive the business to be more market-led and customer-oriented.' A further 30 jobs are likely to be affected next month when the review will announce a new structure for middle management. Those affected will be able to apply for re-designed middle-management positions or take redundancy.</p>

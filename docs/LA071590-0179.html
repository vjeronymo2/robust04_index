			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPLE GIVEN STATE LICENSE TO BE COLLEGE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: HSI LAI MONASTERY IN HACIENDA HEIGHTS WILL OFFER UNDERGRADUATE  DEGREES IN BUDDHIST STUDIES AND MASTER'S DEGREES IN RELIGIOUS STUDIES.  </P> <P> Hsi Lai Temple, the largest Buddhist monastery in the Western Hemisphere, will  begin offering bachelor's and master's degrees next year, becoming one of a  handful of Buddhist organizations licensed by the state to confer college  degrees.  </P> <P> State education officials July 2 gave permission to the 2-year-old temple to  open a private school that will grant bachelor's degrees in Buddhist studies  and master's degrees in religious studies. The temple is a branch of Fo Kuang  Shan, Taiwan's largest Buddhist organization.  </P> <P> The school will open next spring with from 50 to 100 students, 10 faculty  members, and a handful of advisers, said Venerable Yung Kai, a nun at the  temple who is serving as acting academic affairs officer.  </P> <P> It will be run out of the Hacienda Heights temple at first. Eventually, the  Buddhists plan to open a full-fledged university at another location that will  teach a wider range of subjects, including philosophy, business management and  humanities, she said.  </P> <P> Through teachings, which will be in English, the Buddhist leaders want to  promote "a cultural exchange between the East and West," Yung Kai said.  "Hopefully, we will contribute to world peace."  </P> <P> The United States was not the first choice of temple officials. Originally,  they wanted the school close to the Fo Kuang Shan temple in Taiwan, which is 10  times the size of the Hacienda Heights temple. But that idea met with  resistance from the Taiwanese government, which Yung Kai termed "very  restrictive" when it comes to licensing colleges run by religious  organizations.  </P> <P> There are Buddhist colleges in Taiwan, but none are government-approved, she  said.  </P> <P> So after the Hacienda Heights temple opened in 1988, the Venerable Hsing Yun,  Fo Kuang Shan's leader, turned his attention from Taiwan to Southern  California. The area is a prime location for a university campus, Yung Kai  said, because it can draw on the expertise of American Buddhist scholars.  </P> <P> One such scholar is Lewis Lancaster, a UC Berkeley professor in the Department  of Oriental Languages who is serving as an adviser to Hsi Lai Temple. He said  he may teach at the new school as a visiting lecturer. Lancaster also is  heading a Fo Kuang Shan project to record Buddhist scriptures on compact disc  so they can be viewed on a computer screen.  </P> <P> Lancaster said that although a Buddhist college here is akin to Catholic or  Protestant schools in China, it may seem "very strange to us (that) a Buddhist  group comes into our environment and offers this kind of instruction. I think  it's wonderful. It's time for all of us to realize we do live in a global  environment."  </P> <P> Hsi Lai Temple, with its glistening tiled roofs, traditional Chinese  pagoda-style architecture and towering, brightly painted statues, has become  something of an American tourist attraction as well as a solemn retreat for the  East San Gabriel Valley's burgeoning Asian population.  </P> <P> The 10-building, 15-acre complex is one of about 50 temples that Fo Kuang Shan  owns around the world. The Buddhist organization is planning to break ground  soon on another temple in Sydney, Australia.  </P></p>

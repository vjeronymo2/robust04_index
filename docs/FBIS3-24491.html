Dashyan; UDC  621.373.826.038.825.2]    [Abstract] Passive synchronization of the modes of YAG:Nd  and YAlO[.sup]3[/] lasers using  CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1- x)[/]-doped glasses is  discussed. The optical block diagram of the laser is provided  and its functioning is described. The laser resonator is formed  by a spherical mirror and a planar output mirror. A passive  synchronization of modes was obtained when glasses with  CuInS[.sup]1.2[/]Se[.sub]0.8[/] monocrystal were used as  passive gates in pulsed solid state neodymium lasers. The pulse  width was 36 and 16 ns for the YAG:Nd-and YAlO[.sup]3[/]:Nd  lasers, respectively. The passive gates operate as saturating  absorbers at low intensities and perform negative feed-back at  high radiation intensities. The glasses with  CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] are a promising material  for semiconductor cavity saturating absorbers for solid state  lasers operating in a self-starting mode. The saturating  absorbers exhibit a rapid relaxation, and have low losses and  high saturation intensities. They can operate in a nonlinear  mode within resonators of solid state lasers, interacting with  pulse intensities in a pico range. The required operating wave  length can be selected within the 0.9-1.3 m range by  changing  the stoichiometry coefficient and composition of the glass.

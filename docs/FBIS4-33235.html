			<p>BFN     [Text] Since the Cartagena Agreement on the struggle  against drug trafficking was signed on 15 February 1990, which  includes the United States, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, never  has such a tense situation been generated among the signatory  nations as the one observed last weekend between the United  States, Colombia, and Peru.    One month ago, the Pentagon issued an order to suspend  operations of the two radars that detect aircraft. These radars  operate in Colombia as a result of that agreement. The same  decision was made regarding the radars that operate in Peru.    This decision -- labeled by high-ranking Colombian  Government  spokespersons as "not consulted, untimely, unilateral, and  discourteous" -- has not been officially communicated to the  authorities by the U.S. Government which has preferred to remain  silent.    The incident began on Sunday, 1 May. On that day, the  Colombian Air Force officer in charge of radar operations in  Aracuara and Leticia (Amazonas), officially communicated to the  Defense Ministry that the passing on of information on flights  from the radars was being suspended by the U.S. military without  any explication. Since then and to the present, the two  Colombian radars have not been operating.    The order was issued by the Pentagon to the soldiers through  the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. A high-ranking government  official said: "The news was baffling although at the beginning  it was said that the suspension was only for eight days."    The following day, a Colombian Government official contacted  the embassy, which had no official information. At that point,  President Gaviria decided to request a formal explanation for  what was happening. That was 28 days ago, and no reply has been  received as yet.    In Colombia, the matter was handled with confidentiality,  until Sunday, when U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST reported that  Colombia and Peru "would take reprisals" against the United  States as a result of its decision to suspend operations of the  four radars. Those "reprisals" would be the decision to ship out  of the country two 30-year-old radars that were used in the  Vietnam War and which have been of no use in the struggle  against drug trafficking for the past month. A government  spokesman said that of course the removal of the radars would  also be accompanied by "a cordial invitation" to the U.S.  soldiers and experts in charge of their maintenance to leave the  country. No government official has confirmed or denied that  decision. A government spokesman consulted by EL TIEMPO,  however, said "it is obvious that if the radars are useless,  there is no sense in keeping them or their technicians in  Colombian territory."    Meanwhile, the authorities know that drug traffickers'  illegal flights have been on the rise in the past month due to  the total absence of control in that Amazon area. This is where  drugs from Bolivia and Peru enter Colombia.    The official report on the illegal flights indicate that in  1993, in that area, 375 aircraft were detected and up until 1  May this year, 200 flights were reported. This past month an  average of one illegal flight per day has been added.    The government's final determination on the U.S. decision  will only be adopted when the United States gives a formal  explanation of what is occurring. In the meantime, it is only  known that the suspension of radars operations was decided by  the Pentagon, apparently without the blessing of the State  Department or the Justice Department. What some government  officials fear is that an explanation will never be received,  therefore Colombia will have to make a decision.    Those who are caught driving under the influence of drugs  or other substances will be sentenced to pay the minimum of 20  equivalent salaries, and their driver licenses will be suspended  for up to a year. They will even be arrested for 24 hours, and  their vehicles will be impounded.    Likewise, those who, through a medical examination, are  found  addicted to any psychotropic substance will not get their  licenses renewed, and those who, after obtaining their licenses,  become addicts or second time offenders in illegal possession of  ammunition, arms, or explosives will get their licenses revoked.    Heads of public offices are authorized to unilaterally  breach  work contracts when public employees go to their workplaces  under the influence of any substance or when they consume or  incite others to consume drugs in the workplace.    Furthermore, all public employees of sound mind are  forbidden  from using and consuming drugs and psychotropic substances.  They will be penalized as stipulated by Decree-Law 2400 of 1968  and by other regulations that supervise public posts.    The consumption of psychotropic substances and drugs is also  forbidden to those who, due to the nature of their jobs or  professions, impose risks to others.    The Decree includes in this category drivers of any type of  vehicle, pilots, ship captains, aviation students, flight  instructors, machinists and operators, doctors, dentists, and  other health professionals who deal with or tend combustible or  flammable materials and substances, including explosives, toxic,  poisonous, corrosive, or radioactive substances, as well as  those who bear or ship arms, air traffic controllers and  operators, and all ground plane maintenance and support  technicians.    The violation of these regulations by these professionals  will lead to the suspension, disqualification, or revocation of  the license or permit to practice their professions.    The family, community, society, and state will be  responsible  for promoting or implementing policies geared toward avoiding  and undermining the causes and consequences of drug consumption.    This is why the National Drug Council will have to evaluate  the scope of the problem and coordinate with other governmental  institutions projects of prevention and programs that will be  implemented locally, regionally, and nationally.    The country's radio and television stations will also have  to  air campaigns aimed at fighting drug trafficking and consumption  as often and as long as the National Drug Council deems  convenient.    To that effect, the government ordered the council to issue,  within 30 days, pertinent regulations and asked the  Communications Ministry to continue to promote and develop  communication strategies to overcome this problem; besides, the  Health Ministry, secretariats, and departmental services will  embark on rehabilitation campaigns and programs at the level of  their treatment facilities.    Finally, public and private employers must conduct permanent  prevention campaigns to make preventive measures effective, and  they must let authorities inspect and investigate as needed.    Drug use and consumption were banned from public places,  including theaters and stadiums, as well as ships, planes,  government offices, restaurants, bars, night clubs, hotels, and  parks. Managers and directors of public places will be able to  expel drug consumers. Those public places that allow drug  consumption will be temporarily closed for up to 30 days.    Drugs whose effects enhance athletic performance, reduce  anxiety, and artificially diminish exhaustion cannot be used in  any sport activities. Doctors who prescribe these type of  substances to athletes will no longer be able to practice in the  country.    Those who drive under the influence of drugs will be  sentenced to pay up to 20 minimum monthly salaries, and their  driver licenses will be suspended for up to a year. They will  also be detained for 24 hours.    No public or private employee will be able to go to his  workplace under the influence of drugs or to consume them while  working. Violating this regulation will cause employers to  breach his contract.    The decree also stipulates prison inmates are forbidden from  possessing or consuming drugs and psychotropic substances, as  stipulated by 1993 Law No. 65 of the Penitentiary Code.    After medical, psychological, and psychiatric evaluations  are  made, prison medical services will include rehabilitation  treatment for inmates who are consuming psychotropic substances  to help them recover. This regulation does not exempt them,  however, from being penalized, as stipulated by the law.    Penitentiary and surveillance guard members who are caught  consuming or possessing drugs or who bring drugs to prisons will  be fired. Disciplinary measures will be taken as well.    From now on, those who request gun licenses will be given a  psychological and physical aptitude test. In case they are  found to be drug or psychotropic substance addicts, their  licenses will be revoked. Furthermore, those who bear arms,  explosives, or ammunition under the influence of these  substances will be sentenced to pay up to the minimum of one  monthly salary, although this does not mean they are exempt from  disciplinary measures. Second time offenders will have their  gun licenses permanently revoked as stipulated by Decree 2535 of  1993.    The Minors Protection Code stipulates minors, pregnant or  nursing women, and those who are considered unstable according  to the Civil Code are forbidden to consume drugs. The  regulation indicates women in either one of these two conditions  or minors who consume drugs will be sent to a family counselor  who will be able to reprimand the dependent minors' parents, to  grant custody to a close relative, to place them in a foster  home or a special protection center, or even to begin procedures  to adopt neglected minors.    These measures are aimed at guaranteeing personal care and  abating the perils that may threaten minors' health and morale.</p>

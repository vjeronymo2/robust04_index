			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Liberal Democratic Party leader </F> Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Cenk Baslamis in Moscow; date not given  -- recorded; Zhirinovskiy speaks in Turkish]    [Excerpts] [Baslamis] We first asked Zhirinovskiy how he  assesses the election results.    [Zhirinovskiy] This was an unexpected victory. These  results were, therefore, a shock to Russia as well as the world.  They are auspicious results because the Russians are sick and  tired of the communists and the democrats. We are tired of  them. The people want a party with a different policy. The  people want a different political direction. Our party is just  like your Demirel's True Path Party [TPP]. There is the TPP  slogan: The party is in the building and the future in the hands  of the father. That is what has happened with us as well. The  Russians want a different party and a different direction. That  is why we were successful.    [Baslamis] [passage omitted] Zhirinovskiy has all the  characteristics of an extreme Russian nationalist. He  incessantly talks about the Russian Empire. While he claims  that he will be reannexing the former Soviet republics to  Russia, Zhirinovskiy is training his youths in special camps.  His commandos are studying the history of the Russian Empire  and practicing target shooting.    [Zhirinovskiy] I would like to state right now that we are  working for peace. We do not want war. We do not want to  occupy more territory. We want a mixed economy. We are not  communists. We are not fascists. We are to the right of center.  We are a centrist party. We are neither leftists nor  rightists, we are centrists. That is what we are.    [Baslamis] No matter how strongly Zhirinovskiy claims to be  a centrist, he is frightening everyone by hoisting the flag of  extreme nationalism. The message that World War III is around  the corner especially sends a chill up our spine. Zhirinovskiy  claims to be misunderstood.    [Zhirinovskiy] At times I express the realities. I say what  can occur. Certain people claim that I am expressing my wishes.  What I am saying is that World War III is a possibility. I do  not wish it but if the wars in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and  Central Asia continue; if something happens between Iran and  Iraq; or if the Kurdish problem in Turkey expands, then World  War III might occur. I do not want it but we are slowly  approaching that eventuality.    [Baslamis] The following book is a best seller in Moscow.  It is called The Last Assault on the South written  by Zhirinovskiy. In this book, he recounts how he will rebuild  the Russian Empire. A third of the book is devoted to Turkey.  He has very interesting theses and scenarios concerning Turkey.    [Zhirinovskiy] If the war continues in the Caucasus, Turkey  will definitely be involved in it.    [Baslamis] Together with the Azerbaijanis?    [Zhirinovskiy] Then there are the Kurds and the Armenians.  It will be a complex issue. The Turks will side with the  Azerbaijanis and the Kurds with the Armenians. Iran will be  helping the Armenians and the Kurds. This region is exploding.  On the western front Turkey will be facing both Bulgaria and  Greece.    [Baslamis] In his book, Zhirinovskiy extensively talks about  the Kurdish problem. What is interesting is that he claims that  only Russia can solve this problem. He stresses that otherwise  a Kurdish state will definitely be established. In his book he  says: Pay attention to the Caucasus. The key is in the  developments in that region.    [Zhirinovskiy] If the war in the Caucasus continues then the  Armenians will occupy Azerbaijan and arm the Kurds who will, in  turn, launch a big offensive in eastern Anatolia to establish a  Kurdish state.    [Baslamis] On the one hand, Zhirinovskiy makes these claims  and on the other he says that these are his simple predictions.  He further claims that he does not intend to place Turkey in a  difficult situation.    [Zhirinovskiy] This is only a thesis. This is not my wish.  I love Turkey and the Turks. I am only expressing my views on  what might happen. This is not my wish but it might happen.    [Baslamis] Despite Zhirinovskiy's claims to love Turkey,  his love of Turks is doubtful. We do not know whether he is  motivated by this love or not, but he refers to Turks at every  opportunity in his book. How does he refer to the Turks? He  describes them as barbaric and says that there is no such thing  as Turkish culture. He adds: An unsheathed sword cannot be the  basis for culture. What does Zhirinovskiy actually think about  the Turks?    [Zhirinovskiy] Everything is all right in the current  Turkey. The Turks, however, arrived five centuries ago on  Byzantine territory as enemies. They were the real enemy. They  were not invited by anyone. They were living around Tashkent.  They decided that the bread and water in the region were  insufficient and mounted their horses to see what there was in  the west. They decided that they had the power to occupy the  rich people living in peace in the west. What kind of behavior  was that? Why did it happen? This is all written down in  history. I say that this is not the fault of the current  Turkish people. There is a different people now, five centuries  have gone by since.    [Baslamis] Zhirinovskiy is one of those most disturbed by  Turkey developing relations with the Central Asian republics.  The visit of Turkish leaders to the Turkic republics is,  according to Zhirinovskiy, extremely meaningless.    [Zhirinovskiy] Suleyman Demirel recently visited Ashgabat  and other places. He met with Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president,  and the presidents of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and  Azerbaijan. He is gathering them around himself. This, of  course, is viewed as strange in Russia. Why did Demirel visit  our Central Asian republics? There are Russians living there.  There is a Turkish speaking population but there is also a  Russian speaking population.    [Baslamis] Zhirinovskiy is warning both Turkey and the  Western countries against interference in Russia. Actually, his  book's message can be summarized as follows: If you interfere  with us you will regret it.    [Zhirinovskiy] This is not what the Russian people want.  Let them interfere with another people. It can backfire. That  is what I wrote. It can backfire. That is why I wrote this  book. It is all written there, it is written on what will  happen if this interference continues. If this policy is  pursued then it will backfire. The Russians will advance up to  the shores of the Indian Ocean. The Turkish Army advanced up to  the shores of Constantinople once. The Russians will now advance  up to the shores of the Indian Ocean.    [Baslamis] His extreme nationalism pushes him to open  threats. How does Zhirinovskiy view Turkey, where he was  detained some 25 years ago? What is his assessment of the  political parties?    [Zhirinovskiy] I say that we are closer to ANAP [Motherland  Party] and the TPP. You also have this religious party, the  Prosperity Party. There are some similarities. We are,  however, closer to the parties of Demirel and former president  Turgut Ozal, namely ANAP.    [Baslamis] This is the kind of leader Zhirinovskiy is.  Demagogue and crazy are a few of the mildest adjectives used in  connection with Zhirinovskiy. What does he think about these  adjectives?    [Zhirinovskiy] It is all propaganda. They [not further  specified] also have such a center in Europe. They have one in  our country as well. The Russian people are greatly influenced  by my party. This kind of propaganda is being waged to counter  this influence. According to the propaganda I am either a  Zionist or an anti-Semite, either close to the communists or a  fascist, either a racist or mad. They also claim that certain  things happened to me in Turkey or that I wanted to live in  Israel. This is all part of a scheme to reduce my influence on  the Russian people. This is pure propaganda. This is a false  weapon that has always been used in politics. They think that  maybe the Russians will keep away from my party. The contrary  is happening, however. That is why I am, in a way, happy. I am  not the one, however, who is making this happen. This is the  work of propaganda centers. It is also the work of my  adversaries, the other parties opposed to me. It is, however,  backfiring. I am, of course, quite happy with this outcome.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK is living beyond its means, warns Bank governor MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, yesterday warned that Britain, like other countries, was living beyond its means and had to take action to cut its fiscal deficit, writes Peter Norman. In an interview, Mr Leigh-Pemberton told the Financial Times that inflation worldwide was now largely under control. 'So it would be very sad if, having almost defeated inflation, the world drifted into an era of fiscal deficits, which reflect not so much cyclical problems as structural elements which suggest that the industrial countries are living beyond their means,' he said. Britain was one such country where 'welfare payments and benefit systems are so expensive that they are probably beyond the normal annual revenue tax base', he said. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he had no quarrel with Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget, which set out a series of tax increases to reduce the deficit but largely postponed their implementation for at least a year. However, he stressed that Britain had to 'get back on course to balancing the budget over the medium term'. Interview, Page 20</p>

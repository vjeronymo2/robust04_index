			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARLIAMENT BACKS THATCHER ON GULF  </P> <P> Britain's Parliament on Friday strongly backed Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher's dispatch of forces to the Persian Gulf and her refusal to rule out  military action against Iraq.  </P> <P> At the end of a two-day emergency debate, the House of Commons supported  government policy by a vote of 437 to 35, far higher than the 100-seat majority  Thatcher's Conservatives normally command in the 650-member chamber.  </P> <P> Britain was the first country to commit forces to back the U.S. military  buildup in the gulf after Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Britain has sent three squadrons of fighter-bomber aircraft, a destroyer and  two frigates to the area. A second destroyer and three minesweepers are also on  their way. Officials said a further commitment would almost certainly be ground  troops.  </P></p>

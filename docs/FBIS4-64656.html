			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- South Korean Defense Minister  Pyong-tae Yi ended his three-day visit to Germany in Berlin on 5  May. The visitor laid a wreath at the memorial to the  resistance fighters of 20 July 1944.    A Bundeswehr press officer said that on the sidelines of the  ceremony, the politician had said he did not currently see a  danger of war for his country. However, the North Korean troops  were holding military exercises. Tensions between the two parts  of Korea increased over the past months because of the DPRK's  nuclear program.    The minister had met with his German counterpart, Volker  Ruehe, in Bonn on 4 May. During their talk, both agreed on  closer defense and military policy cooperation between the  Federal Republic of Germany and South Korea.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SELF-INTEREST AND OIL CRISIS IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> Speaking of the 2,500 American "detainees," President Bush said, "Anything that  compels individuals to do something against their will would, of course,  concern me." I have to laugh and then cry.  </P> <P> It never seems to bother Bush when he wants to compel several million women to  be "detained" by a fetus.  </P> <P> If we had a sane planetary population policy, we would not need to be in the  Persian Gulf. What we are watching is the start of the real wars, not for  politics or ideology, but for real things -- food and energy, natural resources  and living space. We are fighting like bums over a bottle of wine, but today we  are billions armed with chemical and nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> WOODROW J. HUGHES  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

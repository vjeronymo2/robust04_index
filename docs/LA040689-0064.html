			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MOVES TO SPEED SOVIET IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> Goaded by a growing backlog of Soviet citizens trying to enter the United  States, the Bush Administration asked Congress on Wednesday to allow admission  of as many as 30,000 immigrants a year for "foreign policy reasons."  </P> <P> The bill, drafted by the departments of State and Justice, would establish a  five-year program to admit persons who fail to qualify as refugees because they  cannot establish a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country and  who do not satisfy normal immigration standards.  </P> <P> Although the bill does not cite specific nationalities, the Administration said  it was aimed at Soviet citizens -- mostly Jews, Armenians and evangelical  Christians -- who are leaving the Soviet Union in increasing numbers under  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's relaxed emigration policy.  </P> <P> More than 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in  Moscow for permission to enter the United States as refugees, and another 7,000  are waiting in temporary quarters near Rome. About 4,000 Soviets a month are  seeking to settle in the United States.  </P> <P> The sudden outpouring of Soviet citizens has swamped the U.S. government's  refugee program, which pays transportation costs and provides welfare benefits  to eligible persons.  </P> <P> Under the proposed new classification, qualifying immigrants would receive none  of the financial benefits extended to refugees but would be eligible to become  U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> By easing the oppression of earlier years, Gorbachev's policy has produced a  dilemma for Soviet emigrants. The very fact that emigration has become easier  has tended to undermine the claims of political persecution on which refugee  status is based.  </P> <P> The proposed statute would authorize the President to designate classes of  aliens whose admission "is deemed for foreign policy reasons to be in the  national interest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apply for 'Parole'  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration had promised that all Soviet citizens seeking to  enter the United States would be permitted to do so. Those who failed to  qualify as refugees were invited to apply for a "parole" from Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh.  </P> <P> The parole status has been unpopular with potential immigrants, however,  because it does not permit them to become eligible for U.S. citizenship.  </P> <P> "This legislation is far superior to the exercise of my parole authority --  which is only a stop-gap response -- as it will allow these people to enter as  permanent residents and qualify for limited social welfare benefits that are  not available to parolees," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> He noted that the legislation would also extend eligibility for U.S.  citizenship to parolees admitted between Aug. 15, 1988, and Sept. 30, 1989.  </P> <P> Most of the Soviets awaiting U.S. visas in Rome are Jews who left the Soviet  Union with visas to Israel but decided instead to settle in the United States.  Under Soviet law, it is usually easier for a Jew to obtain permission to move  to Israel than to the United States. Many Soviet Jews who apply for permission  to go to Israel have no intention of doing so.  </P> <P> The situation has long been a cause of friction between Israel and the United  States, because Israel wants the Soviet Jews to settle there. The United States  maintains that emigrants should have freedom of choice.  </P> <P> Avi Pazner, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said Secretary  of State James A. Baker III told Shamir on Wednesday that although the United  States has not softened its support for freedom of choice, he believes that  persons with visas for Israel should go there.  </P> <P> Pazner also said Shamir suggested that Soviet Jews who want to settle in the  United States should apply for U.S. visas and remain in the Soviet Union until  they are granted, instead of going to Rome, where living conditions for  emigrants in transit have become overcrowded.  </P></p>

These three parties have  nominated Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares for president, Tomas  Altamirano Duque for first vice president, and Felipe Virzi for  second vice president. Welcome to "Challenge 94"    [Perez Balladares] Thank you. [Passage omitted]    [De Reyna] You have recognized that although in 21 years [of  military regime] there were many achievements, 21 years is a  long time. Besides, governing with absolute power and heavy  financing makes it possible to achieve many things.    [Perez Balladares] I don't think it was during those 21  years  that many things were achieved. When I speak this way, I am  referring to the time I participated, basically from 1976 to  1982. At that time, we indeed had good conditions to obtain  financing. With a little imagination, new alternatives, it is  also possible to provide solutions without necessarily having  the financial flows we had at that time.    [De Reyna] Let us talk of the 1976-1982 period. Errors were  made at that time. Do you admit this?    [Perez Balladares] Of course.    [De Reyna] Which one?    [Perez Balladares] We must admit many errors from that  period, as well as from other periods, the current period. Only  a person who does nothing makes no mistakes.    [De Reyna] There are errors that are committed so often....    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Name one.    [De Reyna] Squandering of money, corruption....    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Those are objective errors,  I mean subjective. You are giving a subjective opinion. Name  one specific objective error.    [De Reyna] Human rights violations.    [Perez Balladares] Which ones?    [De Reyna] There are lists, even murders.    [Perez Balladares] Again, this is subjective. If you say,  such and such person was killed, and it has been proven that  that person was killed, I can answer.    [De Reyna] It just so happens that whatever happened during  that period cannot be properly investigated. Do you agree or  not?    [Perez Balladares] Well, I think these things have not been  properly investigated in these past four or five years. There  has been so much talk of all the monstrosity and things that  happened, and why is it that nobody has been convicted, or why  is it that nobody is guilty? Of course, I am excluding those  cases that have gone to trial, and that we also reject.    [De Reyna] You have touched on a point that brings to mind  the topic of the problem of justice. We have a serious problem  with justice, and it is not a recent development. This has been  happening for many years. How do you plan to resolve it?    [Perez Balladares] That is true, the problem is very serious  and goes back many years. I believe the problem has its  origin.... [pauses] pardon my ignorance, I am simply an  economist and not a lawyer. I believe the problem originates  within the Attorney General's Office, which to my way of  thinking is where investigations could be handled with greater  justice and honesty. Thus one of the things I propose is that we  have a totally independent attorney general, someone whose  credibility and respect is acceptable by all citizens in order  for his investigations and positions to be perfectly honorable  and acceptable. [passage omitted]    [De Reyna] Let us talk a little more about the people who  surround you.    [Perez Balladares] You have my two vice presidents here with  you.    [De Reyna] Yes of course, but I am referring to the other  people around you. It is being said that you are hiding some  people who are very close to you, who are your advisers. Is that  true?    [Perez Balladares] [laughs] Look, Dorita, I have heard that  story so much that it really makes me laugh. Let me tell you  something. There are 154,000 members in my party. Those people  -- to whom you are referring -- are names that unfortunately  were demonized because they did dishonest things at certain  times, because they were quoted out of context many times,  because they were demonized by the media, or because they did  dishonest things. That group is less than 20 people. If you make  a list and you get more than 20 people, believe me, I will give  you a prize. There are 154,000 persons in my party. That is not  the problem as they are not my advisers. Evidently, when one  engages in a political campaign, when one belongs to a party  that tries to be democratic, I cannot become judge and jury and  tell these people: You can be next to me or you may not. The  internal democracy must be...    [De Reyna, interrupting] Yes, Dr. Perez Balladares, but you  accept that you have 20 people...    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] I am not accepting that. I  told you they are names of people who have been demonized.  Nonetheless, there are candidates...    [De Reyna, interrupting] You said they did dishonest things  in the past...    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Some of them did and others  did not...    [De Reyna, interrupting] Pardon me, let me ask you a  question. How can you control people like that, once you reach  the presidency?    [Perez Balladares] The same way I have done it...    [De Reyna, interrupting] Then, that means you do have  them...    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] Look, right now, they are  not playing any special role. I cannot kick them out of the  party, however, unless they have done something serious. They  have every right to nominate themselves for office, to be  members of the party. In the long run, the party's internal  democracy will decide if they can or cannot be party leaders, or  if the party can nominated them. [passage omitted]    [De Reyna] Now, we would like to talk with the vice  presidential candidates. Even though the Constitution does not  assign specific functions to the vice presidents, the country  has a certain degree of expectations regarding the vice  presidential candidates accompanying the presidential  candidates. Mr. Altamirano, you have held public offices in the  past. You were the director of the National Sports Institute  [Inde], is that right?    [Altamirano] That is correct. I was also housing minister.    [De Reyna] You were housing minister as well as public works  minister. There are many claims you squandered money, were  corrupt, stole, can you say something about that?    [Altamirano] About claims of squandering money and thefts?    [Reyna] That is correct.    [Altamirano] Look, I donated my Inde salary for 4 years.  That  money was used to build eight electric pylons in the interior of  the Republic, and now they now have electricity thanks to that  donation....    [Perez Balladares, interrupting] You mean the pylons at  eight  stadiums, right?    [Altamirano] Yes, at eight stadiums... [pauses] six  stadiums.    [Perez Balladares] You built the pylons at six stadiums with  the donation of your salary, right?    [Altamirano] That is correct. Today, I am being accused of  other charges. This is slander and defamation. It is said I  stole $8,000 worth of PVC pipes... [pauses] $6,000 in PVC pipes.  Who is going to steal $6,000 worth of PVC pipes after donating  that amount of money? Of course, this is no excuse. Actually,  those charges are ridiculous. The public works minister at the  time, a Mr. Orillac, sent some people to my farm to investigate  a bulldozer I had.    [De Reyna] You are referring to Minister Orillac of the  Endara Government?    [Altamirano] I am referring to Rene Orillac who sent people  to inquire about a bulldozer my grandfather purchased for  $23,000 from Cardoze and Lindo. That bulldozer is over 30 years  old. [passage omitted]    [De Reyna] Mr. Virzi: Since you are an expert in the  agricultural sector, I would like to ask you what your  recommendation for the government program is inasmuch as the  agricultural sector cannot compete in an economic opening.    [Virzi] As Dr. Perez Balladares has said, my responsibility  on this ticket is the agricultural sector.    [De Reyna] What do you recommend for improving the  agricultural sector in Panama, for example?    [Virzi] Highways, roads; low-cost highways because of  financing. More than anything else, highways because that is  what worries us. [passage omitted]    [De Reyna] Mr. Perez Balladares, what is your opinion?    [Perez Balladares] You began by talking about the economic  opening. Let us focus our discussion on that. There has to be an  economic opening, and he agrees with that. We cannot have an  economic opening at the cost of ruining the agricultural sector  however. We cannot bankrupt all farmers so they will move to the  capital city. Some agricultural products -- and I will mention  some: rice, corn, beans, potatoes, onions, and others -- must be  protected, but not necessarily subsidized. They cannot compete  freely. Then, there are other things that must be done, like  Virzi has said. For example, there must be production highways.  For example, the cost of some of these products in the national  market is high because it is so difficult to transport them from  the fields. The other aspect is the financial aspect Virzi  mentioned. The Agricultural Development Bank no longer lends  money to the farmers or it lends money to those farmers who do  not need it.    [De Reyna] Have you already prepared a program for that?    [Perez Balladares] Of course. [passage omitted]    [De Reyna] Dr. Perez Balladares: People wonder where you got  your fortune. Do you have a fortune and can you explain where it  came from?    [Perez Balladares] [laughs] Yes, of course. I am not a poor  man, but I do not think I have a fortune per se.    [De Reyna] Are you worth several million [monetary unit not  specified], for example?    [Perez Balladares] Yes, several million, of course.    [De Reyna] How many?    [Perez Balladares] I will leave that to your imagination.    [De Reyna] You are going to have to make a financial  statement.    [Perez Balladares] Yes of course; I will make a statement in  due time. Let me tell you something. Panamanian society has a  problem, and it is a good idea to bring it up. Contrary to other  countries where successful men are respected, emulated, and used  as examples for society to imitate, here in Panama,  unfortunately, successful men are the target of envy, usually by  incompetent people. Therefore, people say the money is the  result of theft. I will tell you something. I have the great  fortune of having a father -- who is still alive -- and a mother  who worked very hard and made money. I have been very lucky and  I have made excellent investments. Right here, in front of you,  I purchased a building with a $330,000 bank loan.    [De Reyna] Is that the building where the Ibero-American  Bank  is located?    [Perez Balladares] Part of the offices of Telemetro  Television are located there. That building, which cost me  $330,000 in 1974 when I was not part of the government, is now  worth over $2 million. I have received offers for that building.  What do you call that?    [De Reyna] Are you going to sell it?    [Perez Balladares] I will let you know when I am going to  sell it. That is foresight, good luck. [passage omitted]    [De Reyna] Many people wonder what will you do with the  military? Several times you have said the military will not  return to power. The people continue to be concerned about that  however. Some military, who are living abroad, have recently  said they are just waiting for you to reach power in order to  return to power.    [Perez Balladares] Those must be some pro-Carles military  who  want to hurt me.    [De Reyna] Yes? I want to ask you another question. You  wanted to be a presidential candidate in 1984 as well as in 1989?    [Perez Balladares] Yes, in 1984, but not in 1989. In 1984,  that is what caused me to be exiled.    [De Reyna] You have repeatedly said General Noriega did not  let you become a candidate?    [Perez Balladares] Noriega, among others. There were several  military men who prevented me from becoming a candidate.    [De Reyna] As you evaluate the past, do you think that was  beneficial to you?    [Perez Balladares] Yes, of course. Looking back and seeing  what happened to the person [Nicolas Ardito Barletta] who  unfortunately replaced me, I think they would have had to kill  me. I am not that type of man. The Lord knows why he did it.    [De Reyna] Thank you and good night. We thank our guests.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. ASSISTANCE FOR LENINGRAD  </P> <P> As I look out of the window of the Criminal Courts Building in Los Angeles, I  am reminded of the myriad problems facing the city: dirty air, crime, filthy  streets, homelessness, poverty and depression in South-Central Los Angeles. Yet  Mayor Bradley wants to render assistance to the city of Leningrad.  </P> <P> Come on, Mr. Mayor, you are the mayor of Los Angeles. You were elected to serve  the people of the city. Your record in South-Central Los Angeles is  disgraceful.  </P> <P> Mr. Mayor, help your own fellow Americans. The homeless need shelter, the  people in South-Central L.A. need supermarkets with competitive prices, more  police are needed, homes in South-Central need to be upgraded and the Civic  Center is a blighted area, not worthy of a major city.  </P> <P> Mr. Mayor, you were put into office to serve the people of Los Angeles, not to  conduct self-serving foreign aid. Leave that to the federal government.  </P> <P> GEORGE SAUDI, Altadena  </P></p>

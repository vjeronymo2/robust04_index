Shops were closed in these camps and black flags  were raised to mourn the righteous Palestinian martyrs.    The factions affiliated with the Alliance of the Palestinian  Forces in Syria decided to receive condolences for three days,  as of today, Saturday, in the al-Yarmuk branch of the  Palestinian Youths.    Palestinian popular organizations and masses today staged  sit-ins at the offices of the International Red Cross, the  United Nations, the Arab League, and the PLO in Damascus. They  handed protest memorandums to the representatives of these  organizations on this terrible massacre. The memorandums urged  the international organizations and community to move swiftly to  stop the massacres against the Palestinian people, to carry out  their duties and safeguard the lives of innocent people, and to  implement the international resolutions which call for  protecting people under occupation. The Palestinian  organizations' memorandums stressed that the new massacre will  not prevent the Palestinian people from continuing their just  struggle until they achieve all their objectives.

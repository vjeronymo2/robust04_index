			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Tesco and Next say sales are improving CONFIRMATION of an improving trend in retail sales came yesterday from Tesco, the supermarket group, and Next, the fashion retailer. Both said when announcing annual results that sales had been picking up. Confident trading statements from retailers could continue as most companies in the sector report during the next few weeks. One retail analyst said: 'The more retailers we talk to, the more apparent it is that there is the beginning of a mild recovery.' Government statistics had shown a slight rise in retail sales in the first two months of the year. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, said 'from our point of view recession is clearly moving away now'. Food retailers are relatively immune to recession but Sir Ian said: 'September to November last year was a bad time for us.' Sir Ian said confidence was starting to return and 'there is clearly a recovery'. The group started to open stores in England and Wales on Sunday in December, which helped sales, and he said 'Christmas was very good'. Sales volumes this year were rising marginally, whereas last year they had been slightly down. Next reported a turnround from losses of Pounds 40.7m before tax to a profit of Pounds 12.3m, better than the market had expected. Lord Wolfson, chairman, said since February 1, the group's high street shops were showing a 7 per cent sales increase, a rate higher than inflation in clothing, although the group had closed 5 per cent of its shop space. Lord Wolfson said 'whilst we expect the retail environment to remain difficult for much of the year ahead, trade is improving'. Mr David Jones, chief executive, said he could not tell how much of this was due to the group's own efforts to improve its product ranges and how much was a general upturn in trade. Laura Ashley, the fashion and furnishings retailer which reported on Monday, said UK sales were flat in February and March against 1991. However, last year's March figures included Easter, which lifts sales, so on a comparable basis March this year had been better. Both Tesco and Next said if a Labour government introduced minimum wage legislation it would have no material effect on them. Tesco shares rose 4 1/2 p to 255 1/2 p and Next shares were up 5p at 71p yesterday. Results, Page 22 Lex, Page 20</p>

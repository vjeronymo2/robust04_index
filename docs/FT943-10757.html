			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / US funeral group lifts bid for Great Southern Service Corporation International, the world's largest funeral company, yesterday increased its bid for Great Southern Group from 600p to 680p, and purchased a further 16.5 per cent of the UK funeral company's shares. Great Southern urged shareholders to take no action. After buying 1.96m ordinary shares and 3.87m convertible shares yesterday, SCI controls 27 per cent of Great Southern's fully-diluted share capital. The outcome of this battle between contrasting companies still hangs on the decision of the Field family, which has been in the burial business since 1690. JD Field owns 56 per cent of Great Southern's shares, and although 70 per cent of the private company is owned by trusts linked to the Field family, the family owns enough shares directly to block any acceptance by trustees. SCI has been perplexed by the Field family's unwillingness to negotiate directly in what is now a Pounds 99.1m takeover bid. Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI president, said: 'There is a cash bid for their company, and these directors have upped and gone to Cowes. It is unbelievable.' It is understood that an earlier meeting with the advisers of Great Southern collapsed after SCI was told it could only negotiate if the bid price 'did not begin with a six'. The latest offer represents a 43 per cent premium to the Great Southern share price before the announcement of the initial offer, and a historic price-earnings ratio of 24.2. SCI claims the p/e is higher, questioning the accounting policy of Chosen Heritage, Great Southern's pre-paid funeral business. SCI only books profits on completed funerals. 'I would not feel right about taking that money out, while the people were still walking,' said Mr Heiligbrodt. SCI's offer closes on August 20.</p>

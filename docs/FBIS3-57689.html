			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justinas Karosas, chairman of the LDDP </F> faction in the Seimas, by Gintautas Kniuksta in Vilnius; date  not given: "J. Karosas: `I Will Never Admit That We Are Making  Concessions to the Opposition...'"    [Excerpts] [Kniuksta]One would like to speak about  something pleasant and bright in the beginning of the new year.  The current period is not indulgent to you, politicians. Talk  about the party's split and extremely categorical statements by  some of its members show that something is wrong in the  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] family as well. Might  I be wrong?    [Karosas] The situation in the LDDP family, as you put it,  is  the same as in our society. Over those 50 years, we have  acquired a bad habit of saying that everything used to be all  right everywhere.    Western parliamentarians even fight among themselves.  Discussions in the legislature is a completely normal  phenomenon. [passage omitted] The difference of opinions is a  sign of the community's democratization.    Another issue is that Seimas' [parliament] activities will  not be effective until we develop a critical approach toward  ourselves and overcome personal ambitions. I think that the  Seimas' work last year was satisfactory. However, I would like  the legislature to make greater progress over the next year.    [Kniuksta]Nevertheless, let us recall Vytautas  Petkevicius' statements, Vytautas Bubnys' withdrawal from the  LDDP faction, and the conference of LDDP members in the Klaipeda  region. Might you have underrated those people? Might you have  not proposed some higher positions to them? By the way, do you  agree that the LDDP faction has some casual people who do not,  perhaps, deserve their status of Seimas members? Certainly,  this is an internal party problem. Believe me, however, that it  interests the community as well.    [Karosas] All of us are casual people in the Seimas to a  certain extent. Many of us did not intend to become  professional politicians. We were just fated to become so.    Disagreements had to come out sooner or later, because since  the very beginning, our party has had not only moderate members  but also militant or more radically oriented ones. The latter  imagine that a democratic state can be created by resolute and  extreme actions. Some of them often proposed to change employees  in self-governments immediately, in a word, to make serious  changes, forgetting that in a normal community employees can be  dismissed only in line with the law. I understand the  legitimate anger of some people. They were painfully  mistreated, blackmailed, and laid off by the former government.  Now they are demanding the same treatment for those who did  that. However, someone must rise above this rage and think how  to lay the foundation for our democratic state. I suppose that  we must undertake this mission. This orientation has a  perspective and meets the standards of a civilized and  democratic community.    I hope that the new majority that will come after the next  elections will discontinue this type of behavior. It will abide  by the law, recognize that one ruling party replaces another,  and so on. I do not claim that there is no irresolution in the  activities of our party, but I speak out against the arbitrary  restructuring of government institutions by ignoring the law and  forgetting that such actions will wind up the coil of hatred. A  democratic state cannot be created in such a manner.    [Kniuksta]By the way, the LDDP is being reprimanded for  lack of resolution. Do you agree that your party is continuing  the chain of mistakes begun by Sajudis? I have heard in  Samogitia [Lithuania's northwestern part] that the LDDP works as  though it lived in 1988 and tries to flatter the opposition.  However, nothing good will come out of this friendship because  V. Landsbergis' tactics are very clear.    [Karosas] I understand those opponents who think and talk  like this. Unfortunately, the current opposition is not that of  a democratic community. It follows the principle "the worse the  better" and does its best to implement it. They think that this  will help them to win more political capital.    Let us remember the opposition's behavior after our victory  in the elections. Its high-ranking members were travelling  throughout the world and spreading the thought that communists  were returning to power, that Soviet socialism would be  restored, that no foreigner would invest in Lithuania, and so  on. [passage omitted] This is an open sabotage of state  interests and a damage to its prestige. Party interests are  never raised above the state in normal society.    The opposition forgets that its blackmailing statements or  actions are damaging to the state's interests. I will never  admit that we are making concessions to the opposition. We  simply want to stop winding the coil of hatred which I have  already mentioned. The fact that a party has its majority in  the Seimas and its government does not mean that such  authorities are agreeable to all society. The majority rule  cannot be identified with the state and society, because about  one-third of the Lithuanian people voted for the opposition.  Certainly, it is totally abnormal when officials, who are our  political opponents, openly ignore Seimas laws or government  resolutions.    We have not yet managed to reach an agreement with the  opposition because the latter imagines that a consensus would be  ruinous to it. A consensus would be useful to the state, and  thus, to the ruling party as well. All this is unacceptable to  the opposition.    We are forced to follow the principle of the so-called  "voting machine." We have no other option if we want to do  something beneficial for the state. However, we cannot ignore  the opposition, and a certain search for a dialogue is  essential. Another issue is that our success here is rather  poor, and this irritates people.    However, we must overcome this hostility. If we turned  away from the opposition, we would create a totalitarian rather  than a democratic state. By the way, the opposition has simply  provoked us since the very first days of Seimas' work. [passage  omitted]    [Kniuksta] Thus, the LDDP is forced to maneuver, although  some people assess such tactics differently.    [Karosas] [passage omitted] One of the more prominent  achievements of our moderate policies or maneuvering is that the  division of society has almost disappeared today. This success  cannot be denied.    When two years ago we went to rural districts, people would  speak only about Brazauskas, Landsbergis, and other politicians.  We hear something completely different today: They usually  raise specific everyday problems. If we had not pursued such  moderate policies, we would again have two distinct camps today.  Therefore, I understand the opposition's pressure on  television. By taking advantage of a million-strong public, it  would be possible to incite people again and engage in overall  negation of any positive sides of the current government.    [Kniuksta] By the way, some of your opponents also  admit this. Tensions have eased after the elections, and the  constant search for enemies has disappeared. It is enough to  remember the speeches of the former Supreme Council chairman  [Landsbergis] about crawling coups, revolutions, packs of dogs,  and so on. However, can a situation with strikes and pickets of  teachers, medical workers, and farmers be called stable?    [Karosas] This stability is fragile. However, I think that  everyone would agree that prices in stores do not change each  day. This is incomparable with what we had six months or a year  ago. Finally, let us take hot water and heating. These are also  the signs of stability. Certainly, these are only the first  signs, and we have nothing much to rejoice in. Life, albeit  poor, is more stable, and people have some hope in the future at  least.    Strikes and pickets occur throughout the world. They are  especially attractive to people who have left the socialist  camp. Formally, these people dissociate themselves from  socialism, but actually they want it. Recent sociological  studies show that only 6 percent of those polled believe that  they are themselves responsible for their lives. All others  accuse the Seimas, the president, and the government, rather  than themselves. They want the state to take care of them, plan  prices, crops, and so on.    The most interesting thing is that this socialism is also  advocated by the conservatives or our opposition. For example,  Mr. G. Vagnorius' proposals concerning the indexation of incomes  and agriculture clearly demonstrate that the conservatives want  socialism. What a paradox!    The worst thing is that strikes and pickets are extremely  politicized. [passage omitted]    Behaving in this manner, it is as though the opposition does  not understand that the disruption of political stability is  dangerous to Lithuania, particularly against the background of  the recent events in Russia. For example, the conservatives'  congress declares the idea of early elections, while  Zhirinovskiy wins the elections in Russia a week later. The  destabilization encouraged by our opposition coincides with  similar processes in Russia, which is extremely dangerous to the  state.    Finally, what does the unstable situation mean to foreign  investors? Lithuania's prestige is low as it is, while we want  to continue to shake it with strikes and so on. How can we say  that the conservatives help the state if they tolerate and  encourage such acts?    [Kniuksta]Let us go back to the economy. Memorandums  are in fashion today. The liberals also write them. In their  opinion, LDDP's economic policy ruins the hope for economic  reform in the country. The LDDP which won the elections by the  majority of farmers' votes ignores their interests.    [Karosas] The liberals have already received one bitter  lesson during the previous elections by demonstrating the idea  of pure liberalism typical of the late 20th century. It seems  that this was not enough for them. They are proposing pure  liberalism as the greatest achievement and the clearest doctrine  forgetting our reality and the fact that the current free market  is a social market. By the way, some liberals, angry with their  defeat in the elections, criticize us for socialism, while the  social democrats accuse us of liberalism.    We, as social democrats, are told that LDDP policies are not  social democratic. However, the social democratic policy can be  implemented only in an efficient social economy of a free  market. [passage omitted]    We are only creating an economic foundation for society  based  on a social market, which is a necessary condition in  implementing the principles of social democracy. Therefore, the  state must look for provisional options. We engage in  discussion with farmers who sometimes drag us into the planned  economy which has no future. However, we cannot reject their  request to regulate certain issues.    Farmers were instructed for many years what to grow and how  much. Last spring, the government rendered much assistance to  farmers, but this support returned as a stone to its garden.  Farmers said that we had helped them to sow the crop but that  we did not want to buy it. Such "clashes" are likely to occur  many times.    People must get accustomed to the "do-it-yourself"  principle.  We understand perfectly well, however, that the state and its  institutions must help people in the transitional period.  Certainly, certain "clashes" between the state and the people  are inevitable. However, when the state does not do something,  people themselves must undertake it. [passage omitted]    [Kniuksta] We hear from the same people that the LDDP  is doing nothing, that it is drifting down the stream, and that  all achievements are spontaneous.    [Karosas] I think that the element of spontaneity is a  normal  social condition, but I do not agree with the thought that the  LDDP is doing nothing. Last year, we created the basis for the  continuation of economic reform and restrained inflation. We  know that A. Slezevicius' government inherited some debts -- $43  and $28 million for gas and nuclear fuel, respectively. The  government paid off these debts over a short period of time and  created conditions for the normalization of gas deliveries and  the production of electric energy. Does this say nothing?    [Kniuksta]I think that the future of industry is very  problematic. Although still breathing, industry is clearly  dying.    Let us take the system of education, for example. It is  obvious that there are too many higher educational  establishments in Lithuania, but not in the sense that Lithuania  has enough educated people. We simply cannot afford so many  higher schools. The same applies to the national defense  system. True, Mr. Landsbergis holds a different opinion on  these problems. I say to him: "How can I invite 100 guests if  I have only one refrigerator of food. Will I not look  ridiculous?" The professor replies that there must be three  refrigerators full of food. From where can we take them?    Many structures of our young state were created according to  the principle "we must have the same as in the West." Since a  drop in production was catastrophic, the burden of supporting  such expensive structures became heavier on taxpayers. [passage  omitted]    [Kniuksta] The Council of the Citizens' Charter  maintains that the interests of the ruling LDDP dominate radio  and television programs. In my opinion, LDDP's propaganda is  insufficient. The LDDP underrates the power of the mass media  and advocates its activities too little. Another thing is when  some mass media have a liking for a particular political  force....    [Karosas] Yes, we advocate the ideas of our party and the  state insufficiently. We did not care about this when we began  our work in the Seimas. Now we are trying to speak on the radio  and write more articles. Many opponents still imagine that the  ruling force has newspapers, television, and radio in its hands.  However, the mass media themselves choose sources of  information in democratic society.    I think, and people will agree with me, that we hear more  representatives of the right-wing opposition on radio and  television today. The worst thing is that we lack official  information about the government's work even in the  state-supported mass media. [passage omitted]    It is useless to try to change something immediately. Much  time will pass until we develop people's political culture.  This cannot be achieved by administrative measures. On the  other hand, it is abnormal when some papers defile the president  elected by the nation, or when the chief of television prevents  the director of the Statistics Department from addressing the  public and familiarizing it with official data about the  country's economic and financial condition.    [Kniuksta] What are your personal relations with  Vytautas Landsbergis?    [Karosas] We maintain certain official relations. I do not  like to characterize my political opponent and I consider it to  be incorrect. I can only say that no politician, if he is  democratically oriented, should assume the role of a messiah,  the only true defender of independence. If a politician lacks  self-criticism, and if he sees only mistakes in the behavior of  others, he will inevitably raise himself above the rest and will  readily or unwillingly assume the position of the father of a  nation or a state. Nor do I like Machiavellian politicians.    [Kniuksta] How are you preparing for the elections to  self-government councils? By the way, how do you assess the  elections in Kaisiadorys [elections did not take place due to  low voter turnout]? Have you learned any lessons?    [Karosas] The elections have shown that people have become  less politicized and that they cannot be bought with political  chatter. People are beginning to understand that impossible  things cannot really be accomplished. We are moving from the  politicized stage in the community's life to the economy.  Therefore, the force that will propose comprehensible and  realistic measures for the resolution of problems will win the  elections. I think that our government has possibilities to  resolve the problems over the remaining three years in such a  way that would increase our prestige during the next elections.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton and Bosnia THE US and four fellow members of the United Nations Security Council have acknowledged, by the intensity of their weekend negotiations over Bosnia, that the moment of truth in this war has arrived. The 13-point communique proclaims international determination to contain the war. But the clearest if unstated message from Washington is that this common front is more facade than reality, largely because the US is unwilling to get involved on the ground. If there is any chance of exerting effective pressure on the Bosnian Serbs through non-military means, it lies in tightening the blockade at the Bosnian frontier. Ostensibly, Serbia has now changed sides, backed the Vance-Owen peace plan and declared its intention to put pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia, by co-operating in the imposition of international sanctions. The statements of the Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, cannot be taken at face value, however. Preliminary indications are that he is not carrying out his newly declared policy. Monitoring sanctions If tighter sanctions are to be effective, they must obviously be monitored internationally at the Serbia-Bosnia frontier. But the Yugoslav authorities have already announced their rejection of international monitors, and the Washington communique meekly indicates that there will be no attempt to override Serbian objections. If this is a measure of the determination of the international community, we may be sure that Mr Milosevic will conclude that he is free to pursue a goal he has always pursued - a greater Serbia. The five-power communique also endorses the concept of 'safe areas', but it does so in terms so lukewarm that it is hard to believe that this is the prelude to serious guarantees of territory for the Bosnian Moslems. That Russia is considering sending troops is good news, though Russians, traditionally allies of the Serbs, may not be ideally qualified for protecting Moslem areas. That the US will not be sending forces is decisively bad news. Safe areas cannot be protected except by putting troops on the ground, and this policy cannot carry real political conviction unless there is a military contribution from a wide range of countries. The (unstated) US undertaking, that it may go so far as to use air power to help to protect UN troops in the safe areas, is manifestly no substitute. It merely reinforces the message that the US administration does not want to get involved. Clear message President Clinton's wariness is understandable, to the extent that there are no good options facing the outside world. But caution is not in itself a policy, and by now American hesitation has become profoundly counterproductive, because of the clear message of tacit acquiescence it sends to the Serbs. An American contribution to an international contingent for protecting the safe havens would reverse that message and so reinforce the credibility of the undertaking that the numbers of soldiers required, and the dangers facing them, might both be much reduced. The European Community is under a similar imperative. So far the main burden of Europe's military contribution to the humanitarian operations in the former Yugoslavia has been borne by France, Britain and Spain, in that order. Even if Germany can claim particular impediments, it must soon decide whether to exercise the political responsibilities consonant with its newly recovered sovereignty. The other member states should already be pulling more weight, as required by the declared objectives of the Maastricht treaty. In partnership with the UN, the European Community has been in the forefront of international efforts to press for a settlement in the former Yugoslavia. Logic and self-respect demand that all the member states which can should live up to the responsibilities they have implicitly claimed. This is a moment of truth, not just for the war in Bosnia, but for the claims of the international community to promote a better world order. If these efforts fail in Bosnia, then the US, the EC and the new Russia will all bear a heavy responsibility. And the new but fragile role of the UN as an instrument for peace-making in the post-cold war world will suffer a lasting blow.</p>

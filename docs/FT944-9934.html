			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Czech mate to Kohl? Clinging to the past is an understandable reaction to the continuing uncertainty in central Europe. But even so, the recent celebration by the Czech Republic of the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918 looks like nostalgia in the extreme. The Czech Republic, as well as Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary were left in a no-man's land after US president Bill Clinton and the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, agreed that the former communist countries of central Europe should remain outside Nato. They were left in a similar limbo at Yalta by an agreement between Stalin, Roosevelt and the reluctant Churchill. The results were not good. Such reaffirmation of a power vacuum in the space between Germany and Russia underlines the true significance of the 1918 redrawing of the map of Europe: the disintegration of the Habsburg monarchy by which France, in one of its unrealistic fits of grandeur, hoped to establish a cordon sanitaire of lesser allies on the eastern borders of Germany and Italy. France held on to this preposterous idea for only six years, when, at Locarno, it adopted, with the UK, Germany and Italy, the equally unrealistic concept of a Four Powers' Directorate which would rule Europe. The only act of this 'directorate' was the Munich agreement by which Czechoslovakia was handed to Hitler on a silver plate. The Habsburgs' central European empire, which in 1918 paid the price for linking its fate with the Hohenzollern Germany, had its origin in the union with Poland and Hungary established for the first time in the 12th century by the Czech kings. Unfortunately, the centrifugal forces of nationalism, unleashed in 1918, make it now almost impossible to seek stability in central Europe by a reconstitution of a strong, defensive, buffer zone between Russia and Germany. The other scenario open to the Czechs is to seek the protection of Germany. In spite of the bitter memories of Nazi occupation and the second world war, this solution was floated soon after the collapse of communist power in 1989. In 1990, when trying to obtain support for the establishment of a British trading centre in Prague, I was told by the British ambassador: 'We would rather wait a few years until the dust has settled.' And to my rejoinder, that by then the Germans will have taken the market, he said: 'Let them. After all, they are so much nearer and know it so much better.' I heard in this the echo of Neville Chamberlain's 'a far away country about which we know little' and was cross. Like most Czechs, I was also cross when president Vaclav Havel chose West Germany for his first visit abroad. Since then I have had time to realise that neither the British ambassador nor president Havel were much off the mark. Germany alone is aware not only of the economic potential, but also of a common security interest with the Czechs, wedged between Bavaria and Saxony, and reaching close to the very heart of west Germany. Economically the Czechs are now doing better than any other of the former communist countries and even repaid before time the monetary loan obtained from the IMF. Most foreign investments, trade - and tens of millions of tourists each year - come from Germany. Germany is building a highly profitable economic link with the Czech Republic without having to subsidise it in the way that it pours money into the four new lands which were East Germany. But can the Germans risk alienating France, the UK and US by acting alone in providing the Czechs with security? Would they dare to make a move suggesting the rebirth of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation which was Europe's superpower when the Czech king was emperor or primus inter pares of the Electors? Having secured four more years in office, chancellor Helmut Kohl may pursue the plan of making a close alliance with France the core of the European Union. In such a core, the centre of gravity would shift to Germany as soon as it recovered from the pains of unification. France then may have to drop its objections to an extension of Germany's strategic links eastwards. In such a situation the Czech Republic could again serve as a gateway to the other former communist countries, repeating thus the dual link the Czech Kingdom used to have with Germany and the Habsburg monarchy.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Australia's opposition leader shown to be no easy game for Keating: Alexander Downer is questioned by Nikki Tait on policies he wants to pursue When Mr Alexander Downer was elected leader of Australia's coalition opposition in May, commentators wondered if Mr Paul Keating would eat him alive. After all, Australia's prime minister is reknowned for his verbal sniping and relentless political assault. By contrast, the 42-year-old Mr Downer was unfamiliar figure outside Canberra. If a popular impression existed it was of an establishment scion, who came from one of South Australia's blue-blooded families and was steeped in Liberal party tradition. His father was immigration minister in the conservative Menzies government of the late 1950s; his grandfather, Sir John William Downer, was premier of South Australia. But, a month and a half on, perceptions are changing fast. Mr Downer has proved adept at parrying personalised attacks which are the hallmark of Australian politics, and is proving hard to needle. When Mr Keating raised the 'class spectre' by attacking Mr Downer's membership of the 'men-only' Adelaide Club, for example, the opposition leader pointed to the prime minister's own fondness for grand living (French Empire clocks, Sydney harbour views). When it was disclosed that Mrs Nicky Downer, Mr Downer's British-born wife, had never sought Australian citizenship, the opposition leader talked of women's rights. He has given his party's standing in the opinion polls a boost. Even Mr Bob Hawke, who unwillingly passed the prime minister's mantle to Mr Keating in 1991, reportedly told patrons of Canberra's casino last month Mr Downer would be Australia's next leader. But a bigger, and more serious, question still looms. Can Mr Downer can find policies which will distinguish the opposition from the government and yet woo Australia's change-resistant electorate? After all, the Labor party has used a decade of power to push Australia down a measured economic reform path, neatly cornering much of the middle ground. In an interview, the speed with which Mr Downer bites on this question suggests that he appreciates its sensitivity. 'Ah. That's not difficult at all,' he declares, arms stretched along a sofa in a pose of self-confident ease. 'The Labor party is equivocal about business, equivocal about investment, and equivocal about industrial relations and microeconomic reform. 'I think in areas like tax, improving the operations of tax system, improving how our labour market works, our credentials are entirely different from Labor's. They are simply incapable of reforming the labour market in a way that will improve productivity in Australia and bring it up to international standards, because of their umbilical link with the Actu (Australian Coucil of Trade Unions). It's something we can do much more easily.' This may sound simplistic, but it is also astute. Mr Downer has picked on business's two most frequently expressed complaints. Many industrialists would agree with the opposition leader when he goes on to describe Australia's labour market - a large part of which still depends on a centralised system of 'awards' and arbitration - as 'out of its time zone'. Meanwhile, the government's own industrial relations reform legislation, passed late last year, has been unpopular, with its measures to encourage decentralised work place bargaining more than offset - in the eyes of industry - by enhanced workers' protections. So what, in more precise terms, is Mr Downer going to do about it? 'In terms of the labour market, what Australia needs is much greater flexibility through enterprise bargaining,' he says. 'Now there have to be guarantees for workers, so they're not going to suffer declines in their wages, but there has to be a mechanism put in place which facilitates the negotiation of enterprise agreements, which will lead to substantial improvements in productivity.' Pushed a little further, he agrees the first element means some minimum wage guarantees. But he refuses to be drawn on the latter: 'How we'll move to enterprise agreements, we'll announce when our policy's announced.' What about tax, then? Mr Downer's predecessor made a bad political miscalculation when he suggested that Australia needed to shift from direct to indirect taxation by introducing a goods and services levy (rather like Europe's Value Added Tax). Unsurprisingly, then, his successor is treading carefully. 'There won't be radical tax reform,' says Mr Downer. 'There'll be gradual reform of the tax system and that will be phased over some period of time. That does include improving the way our indirect tax system works, but not changing its nature, just improving the way wholesale sales tax works.' He insists that he 'wouldn't place new restrictions' on foreign investment and adds: 'I certainly support the deregulation of international financial markets, with Australia integrated into those markets. But as an Australian, I'd like to feel that we had a greater capacity than we do have at present to invest in our own businesses - and that will only happen if we can build up household savings.' Could that not hinder the managerial and technological transference which tends to accompany foreign investment, and may be very valuable to Australia? This is an inconvenient complication, and Mr Downer becomes a little dismissive. 'Sure - all of those arguments I well understand. I'm just saying that all other things being equal, I'd like to see Australians investing in Australia. It's simply an emotional point.' One point on which Mr Downer does concur with his predecessor is on the need for Australia's Reserve Bank, the central bank, to be truly independent of political influence. 'All of us remember Mr Keating, when he was treasurer (finance minister), saying that he had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. It is inappropriate for the Reserve Bank to be in the pocket of the treasurer.' So just suppose the current opinion polls hold good for another two years, and Mr Downer heads to The Lodge, what would he see Australia contributing, in global terms, during in the latter half of the 1990s? For the first time in a lengthy interview, Mr Downer looks a little nonplussed. But he recovers quickly, and makes refers to 'building on the Apec process' a regional forum which he would use to develop 'non-discriminatory but liberalising trading arrangements' in the Asia-Pacific, playing a useful role in the area's defence. It is a solid, pragmatic answer - if short on imagination or higher aspirations. It is delivered, moreover, with all the confidence of a third generation politician. Mr Keating may have his work cut out.</p>

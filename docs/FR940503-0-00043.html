If the laboratory appeals the decision to the Director of NIST, the proposed denial or revocation will be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The proposed denial or revocation will become final through the issuance of a written decision to the laboratory in the event that the laboratory does not appeal the proposed denial or revocation within that 30-day period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If NVLAP finds that an accredited laboratory has violated the terms of its accreditation or the provisions of these procedures, NVLAP may, after consultation with the laboratory, suspend the laboratory's accreditation, or advise of NVLAP's intent to revoke accreditation.

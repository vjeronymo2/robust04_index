			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Like a Ripe  Fruit"]    [Text] [SPIEGEL] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who comes  from the north, blames you for the outbreak of the civil war.    [Al-Bid] Only an idiot would say that. Salih has been  hatching a plot since the very beginning. His intentions were  dishonorable. Unfortunately, we realized this too late.    [SPIEGEL] Were you and your Marxist colleagues in Aden not  aware of the dangers of unification?    [Al-Bid] We thought that after the end of the Cold War, the  spirit of the age would influence the responsible persons in  Sana'a and Aden. We thought worn-out ideologies would be  jettisoned and a common Yemeni model developed.    [SPIEGEL] The Muslim-conservative north is accusing the  socialists of not having abandoned their communist stereotypes.    [Al-Bid] On the contrary, we in the south have permitted all  political parties to exist. Even western diplomats are praising  our freedom of the press and freedom of speech.  State-controlled land and enterprises have been reprivatized,  and the state trade monopoly has been abolished. The north has  contributed nothing to the Yemeni marriage. On the contrary,  the gentlemen in Sana'a, obsessed with their tribal interests  and with gaining personal power, are trying to enforce their  anti-progressive ideas in the south, even by means of force.    [SPIEGEL] And you do not want to change the North Yemenis?    [Al-Bid] We want to change society and modernize it, but by  democratic means. The elections last year showed that our  ideas, geared at a social market economy and political  pluralism, have fallen on fertile ground even in the north.    [SPIEGEL] In the south, you were able to assert your leading  position, but in the north you have gained very little.    [Al-Bid] In any case, the election result did not suit the  tribal politicians and the social groups linked to them. They  thought the oil-rich south would fall into their lap like a ripe  fruit. What they failed to achieve with the ballot paper they  tried to achieve with a series of political coups and military  strength.    Why did I return to Aden together with all the other South  Yemeni politicians? Because in Sana'a and all over the north,  the murderers and Muslim terrorists who are fed by the ruling  clique are enjoying total freedom.    [SPIEGEL] For your part, you have extended military service  and equipped the south with foreign weapons.    [Al-Bid] Purely for the purpose of self-defense. Several  weeks ago, the Northern Army started cutting off all supplies to  our units in North Yemen, in order to destroy them later. The  storming of Aden is supposed to take place without any  resistance.    [SPIEGEL] Can you resist the militarily superior North?    [Al-Bid] We will use all the means at our disposal to  prevent the Middle Ages from also swallowing the South.</p>

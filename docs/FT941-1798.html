			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / US banks lift cost of loans after Fed move Many of the largest US banks - including Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Citicorp - raised their prime rate from 6 per cent to 6.25 per cent yesterday, the first general increase in bank lending rates for four years. Their move followed the 0.25 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates signalled by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday. The prime rate is used to determine the rate charged on many business and consumer loans. In the markets, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 16.69 higher at 3,879.24, while the long bond fell half a point on the day, reflecting profit-taking after Tuesday's late rally and a surge in commodity prices. Even though the Fed move was followed by yesterday's cut of 8 basis points in the German repo rate, the dollar failed to gain against the D-Mark. The US currency closed in London at DM1.685 from its Tuesday close of DM1.6885, and eased further to DM1.6815 in New York. European markets were mainly influenced by events in Germany, with shares climbing in Frankfurt on the cut in the repo rate. The Dax index closed 19.79 points ahead at 2,161.13. But European bourses later fell on fears that the German M3 money supply figures for February might show an annualised rise of as much as 30 per cent. The Eurotrack 100 rose 6.98 points on the day to close at 1,445.46. The interest rate increases reflected an attempt by the US banks to maintain their lending margins, which stand at historically high levels.</p>

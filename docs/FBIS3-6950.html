There was an influx of refugees as well as shells  landing in Thailand, opposite Khok Sabaeng Village in Tambon  Thakham, Aranyaprathet District, Sa Kaeo Province. The fighting  lasted over two hours. Twelve mortar rounds landed at Wat Khok  Sabaeng; a house was damaged. There was no report on death or  injuries.    According to information from the Cambodians who fled the  fighting to the Thai border, two Cambodian border patrol police  officials and three Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed. Thai  soldiers and border patrol police have been put on alert to  prevent infiltration and violation of national sovereignty.  There were sounds of gunfire from the fighting between the  Cambodian factions.    Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that about  35,000  Cambodian civilians fled to the Thai border, and Thailand is  giving them help for humanitarian reasons. He said the UNHCR  [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] had been  informed to provide assistance to the refugees. He, however,  confirmed that Thailand will not reopen refugee centers and will  push all those people over the border once the fighting is over.    Concerning a report saying the Cambodian Government is using  chemical weapons in operations against the Khmer Rouge, Gen.  Wichit said he had no information about that, but believed the  world would object to such a plan.</p>

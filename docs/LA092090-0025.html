			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: APPLES;  </P> <P> BAKED APPLE CUPS ARE WELL WORTH THE WAIT  </P> <P> This apple dessert is a bit time-consuming to make but well worth the effort.  It tastes amazingly rich to be so low in calories and cholesterol.  </P> <P> The secret to this "great impostor" is using melted vanilla ice milk as the  sauce instead of a classic creme anglaise, which is made with egg yolks.  </P> <P> BAKED APPLE CUPS  </P> <P> 4 Golden Delicious apples, cored and halved lengthwise  </P> <P> Julienned zest and juice of 2 large lemons  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and julienned  </P> <P> 2 cups vanilla ice milk, melted  </P> <P> Place Golden Delicious apples in baking dish, cut side up. Bake at 350 degrees  30 to 40 minutes or until easily pierced with fork. Remove from oven and cool  slightly.  </P> <P> Place lemon zest in saucepan, cover with water and bring to boil. Boil 2  minutes then drain. Combine lemon juice with sugar and mix well. Add lemon zest  and julienned apples. Mix well and set aside.  </P> <P> Make apple cups by carefully removing all but about 1/4 inch of pulp from skin  of cooled apple halves. (Be careful not to tear skin.) Cut pulp in thin  match-sized strips and combine with apple-lemon mixture and mix well.  </P> <P> Fill each apple cup with 1/2 cup apple mixture and pour any remaining juice  evenly over each serving. Return to 350-degree oven 20 minutes, then place  apple cups on large plate to cool. Pour any pan juices evenly over each  serving. When cool, cover and refrigerate until cold.  </P> <P> To serve, place each apple cup on plate. Pour 1/4 cup melted ice milk over top  of each cup. Makes 8 servings.  </P> <P>  Each serving contains approximately 130 calories; 5 mg cholesterol; 2 gm fat;  28 mg sodium.  </P> <P>  Jones is a food consultant and a cookbook author.  </P> <P> </P></p>

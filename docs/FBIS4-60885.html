			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 29 TASS -- "If the Russian Republican  Party have not signed the Social Accord Treaty, this would mean  its complete political isolation and sliding to recalcitrant  opposition", deputy of the Duma Vladimir Lysenko, co-chairman of  the party, told a news conference on Friday. Lysenko views the  signing of the treaty by Russia's political elite as an  important step toward civic accord and a breakthrough in public  conscience.    Lysenko hopes there will be no more revolutions in Russia.  Society embarks of a period of evolutional development. He  believes the treaty may offer an opportunity of political  stability in a country for at least two years. Political  competition will be manifested in parliamentary and presidential  elections, not through violent non-parliamentary actions.    Lysenko apparently decided to give the news conference  because of the situation that formed as a result of the  Republican Party's joining the treaty while leaders of the group  Yabloko in which the party is included refused to do so. It  should be noted that representatives of the Republican Party  were elected to the state duma on the ticket of Yabloko bloc.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US phone company launches toll-free callback service US telephone company Telegroup has launched a toll-free callback service for European subscribers which it says will more than halve weekday phone calls inside Europe, Reuter reports from Brussels. The service, called Global Access, allows subscribers in Europe to route calls through telephone switches in the US and Europe to take advantage of lower prices. Telegroup says it has 30,000 subscribers worldwide, of which half are in Europe. To make a call the subscriber dials the Global Access network in New York, using a touchtone phone, enters a code corresponding to his telephone number, and then hangs up. The subscriber is called back in a few seconds, receives a dial tone and then makes the call.</p>

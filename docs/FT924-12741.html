			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Press body backs self-regulation THE Press Complaints Com-mission argues today that self-regulation of the newspaper industry is now working effectively. The claim is made in evidence sent to Sir David Calcutt, who is investigating the performance of press self-regulation.

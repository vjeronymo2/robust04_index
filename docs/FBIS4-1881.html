			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),  met here today with Peter Tapsell, speaker of the New Zealand  Parliament, and the parliamentary delegation he is leading.    The Sino-New Zealand relations have been developing steadily  since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two  countries in 1972 and the parliaments of the two countries have  also kept in contact, Qiao said.    He believed, the current visit by Tapsell would play  important role in advancing the relations between the two  parliaments.    Both China and New Zealand are in the Asia-Pacific region  and  are both attaching great heed to the region's peace and  development, Qiao said, adding a peaceful and stable  Asia-Pacific region would benefit the world as a whole. In this  sense, the NPC wished to promote the cooperative relations  between the two countries through joint efforts.    China had made great achievements over the past 15 years  thanks to the reform and opening to the outside world and the  prospects are still brighter, Qiao said, adding however, efforts  of several generations are still needed before China could catch  up with some developed countries. Therefore, he noted, the  Chinese Government has maintained an "objective and cool-minded"  attitude in its future economic development.    Tapsell is New Zealand's first speaker from the opposition  party and the first speaker from the indigenous Maori people.  He said New Zealand has been shifting its trade and economic  ties focus from the traditional European Market to the  Asia-Pacific region, in particular to China, which has  registered a high economic growth.    Among those present at the meeting was vice-chairman of the  NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun who also greeted the speaker  at the airport upon his arrival Sunday [3 April].    Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee,  held talks with NZ [New Zealand] delegation on a wide-range of  issues of mutual interest.</p>

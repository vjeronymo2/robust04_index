			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Drink: The gentle giant of Park Avenue - Jancis Robinson goes to New York to meet the world's most influential wine merchant THE US may no longer enjoy its mid-1980s status as the wine world's biggest spender, but Abdallah H Simon is still the lynchpin of the international wine trade. This is not just because he is such an important customer - his Chateau &amp; Estate Wines Company sells up to 40 per cent of America's imports of fine wine, notably classed-growth bordeaux - but also because he is the only wine merchant to be taking decisions crucial to the world's wine trade with the benefit of four decades' experience. A measure of the breadth of that experience is that Simon must be the only Chevalier of France's elite Legion d'Honneur to be a graduate of England's Southport College, the University of Beirut, the Iraqi army and, when he finally managed to escape rising anti-semitism in his native Baghdad in 1943, the US forces in Europe. It was a seminal bottle of Ch Latour 1929 that propelled him from the family textile business into the fledgling US wine trade to which he has applied his business skills for 40 years, 18 of them creating Chateau &amp; Estate, an empire to his own specifications within America's leviathan of liquor, Seagram. Revered by all who matter in America's wine business, he is of course courted assiduously by some of the world's grandest wine producers. It would be reasonable therefore to expect a certain arrogance in the man, but from Bordeaux to the Bronx it is agreed that the softly-spoken 70-year-old Simon is, above all else, a gentleman. The US wine trade needs Simon. His honour and old world manners legitimise it. His warehouses feed it. His salesmen service it. His company effectively finances its investment in the now all- important wine futures market. (In many states, including New York, customers cannot be invoiced until the goods are delivered, which may be two years after wine futures are reserved  -hence some cancellations, notably of the somewhat stolid 1988s, which have not smoothed Monsieur Simon's biannual path to Bordeaux.) But the wine world needs the man himself at least as much as the corporation's ability to finance two to four years' stock. His contacts in France are personal and unparalleled. Only a handshake seals C &amp; E's agreements with the 200-plus regular imports listed somewhat incongruously in Seagram's corporate Brand Index, from St Emilion first-growth Ch Ausone to Trimbach's obscure Liqueur de Framboise raspberry syrup. In New York Ab Simon has additional duties as arbiter, father confessor and sounding board. 'Don't ask me about him, I tend to get emotional,' says Marvin Shanken, hard-bitten publisher of the industry's most-read publications, 'I really love the guy. Whenever I've had controversy as a journalist, whether he represents the wines himself or not, he's always given me an honest appraisal.' Michael Aaron, head of New York's most traditional smart wine merchant Sherry Lehmann, readily admits: 'If I formulate an idea about something, I call Ab to see what he thinks. He's a positive asset to the whole industry because he really understands the whole picture.' Understanding the whole picture nowadays means much more than being able to speak French and German and eat with a knife as well as a fork. It means coming to grips with America's increasingly faddish wine buyers, all of whom depend on the same two or three authorities to tell them, through controversial scores out of 100, exactly what to buy. 'Scores? Well, look,' says Simon 'we're novices in the wine market. Our consumers need to be guided. And the scoring system has definitely been very good for business.' American collectors today will buy only those years sanctioned by the oracles, which means that C &amp; E sold 1.5m bottles of 1989 classed growth bordeaux, but less than a fifth of that so far of the less-publicised 1990s. If Ab Simon earned the respect of the wine world by well-publicised efforts to hold down prices of the 1986s, his most expensive mistake was buying the overpriced, unloved 1984s in order to keep his allocations with the chateaux. That small but vigorous American minority prepared to pay Dollars 20 for a bottle of bordeaux nowadays has been primed to scorn 1984, which is why C &amp; E's 1984s (even the fabulous Chateau Petrus of which C &amp; E are given 90 per cent of the US allocation) are still being offloaded, via French and even British merchants, into French supermarkets. Simon has learnt his lesson. 'The 1984s highlighted for us that the US consumer needs a strong, clear image of a vintage. For that reason we won't be buying the 1991s, except for taking up our small allocations of the first growths, because the image of the 1991 harvest is so confused. And the 1991s are coming out at prices that are too high, higher than the 1987s which are not exactly selling, as we say, like hot cakes. The 1991 vintage is not for us in terms of futures and I don't think it is for the US market even after it has been bottled.' (Take that, Bordeaux.) He was to communicate all this to Christian Moueix of Ch Petrus over lunch the next day (he lunches about twice a week at the famous Four Seasons restaurant just below his quiet Park Avenue office). That night he and his popular wife, Francine, with whom he always travels, were still hosting a 15-wine dinner for 50 at 11.30. Those of us three decades younger found it quite punishing. But Simon says he has no plans to retire, and that last year's heart surgery should have set him up for many years more. 'I try very hard to do the right thing,' he claims as his motto. But there are those in the wine trade who feel that no eventual successor could possibly match his probity - and there are those who fear an option with very much more serious consequences, that Simon alone is capable of keeping Seagram's faith in the exceptionally labour- and capital-intensive fine wine market.</p>

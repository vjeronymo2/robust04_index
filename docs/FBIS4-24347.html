			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Eneias Comiche has told the  MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY, AIM, that the Mozambican  Government has not allocated 20 million hectares of land to the  Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corporation based in the  Netherlands. However, Comiche confirmed that last year the  Mozambican Government and that organization signed an agreement.  The finance minister said that contrary to reports made by a  number of Mozambican and foreign journalists over the past few  days that 20 million hectares of land were allocated to the  organization, this agreement does not allocate or grant to the  organization a specific portion of land in Mozambique. Eneias  Comiche added that if the corporation chooses to carry out  ventures in Mozambique, it will have to follow all the  procedures stipulated by the current laws in the country.</p>

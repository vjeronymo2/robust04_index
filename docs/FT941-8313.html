			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Malay state poll result angers PM Elections in the East Malaysia state of Sabah have precipitated a battle between local politicians and the federal government led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. In the weekend elections, the locally based Sabah Unity Party (PBS) narrowly defeated Dr Mahathir's National Front coalition, winning 25 seats in the 48-seat state assembly. But when Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the leader of the PBS and Sabah chief minister for the last nine years, went to be sworn in for another five-year term, he was forbidden entry to the governor's mansion. At first the governor, a federal government appointee, was said to be unsure of who to appoint chief minister. He was then said to be sick and unavailable to carry out his duties. The PBS said there was a plot to deny the party its position as leader of Sabah's government. Sabah is one of only two states in the Malaysian federation which is not aligned with the National Front. Dr Mahathir has made no secret of his antipathy towards the PBS and to Mr Pairin in particular. Last night, almost 24 four hours after the result was announced, Mr Pairin was still waiting outside the locked gates of the governor's mansion. The governor announced that a swearing-in ceremony would take place on Monday, but did not say who was to be appointed chief minister. Meanwhile, Dr Mahathir said he had received reports that Mr Pairin had locked up several elected PBS members of the assembly for fear that they would defect to the National Front. 'They should be given the right to decide which party to support,' said Dr Mahathir. The prime minister said the police might be forced to intervene if the members were being forcibly detained. The weekend's events mark another chapter in the colourful and often chaotic politics of Sabah, the former British North Borneo. The PBS has accused the National Front of money politics on a massive scale. 'Money was virtually being thrown from helicopters and distributed freely in coffee shops,' said Mr Pairin of the National Front's campaign.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: Guidance on quality standard Sir, 'BSI guidance for small firms' (June 1) records that 'purchasers have misunderstood the nature of the standard (BS 5750) and insist wrongly on all their suppliers being registered to BS 5750'. Purchasers mistakenly believe BS 5750 to be a product quality standard whereas it is a documented quality management system of business procedure. The Department of Trade and Industry confirms that 'BS 5750 is not a product quality system and does not directly improve the standard of the organisation's products and services nor does it confer excellence on the certified organisation, its products or services'. It is to be hoped the new BSI guide to purchasers will refer them to the Guidelines of Purchasing Practices issued by the Department of Environment in August 1992 which stated: 'A requirement that tenderers should be certificated under quality assurance standard BS 5750 . . . may restrict competition . . . and the absence of such certification cannot therefore be considered to indicate necessarily that a company is not competent to carry out work. An authority should not reject tenders solely on the grounds that a company does not have, or does not intend to have, a quality management system provided it is willing to offer other acceptable assurances or evidence of its capacity to carry out work according to specification.'

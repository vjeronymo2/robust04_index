			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / 'Where have you British been all these years . . .' In August a group of British businessmen spent 14 uncomfortable hours crossing the desert of Iraq's Al Nafar province from Jordan. Their destination was Baghdad. Because of UN sanctions there are no direct flights from Europe to the Iraqi capital but, against advice from the Foreign Office, they were willing to brave dust, heat and possible kidnapping. The prize was a chance to return to what, before the Gulf War, had been a lucrative market of Pounds 800m a year In spite of the government's public support for the continuation of sanctions against Iraq some British companies are preparing to resume trade with President Saddam Hussein's regime when they are lifted. On Sunday, 17 British water treatment and engineering companies will begin exhibiting at the Baghdad Trade Fair Centre. The British organisers of the fair - billed as covering humanitarian aid - say it has been cleared by the United Nations sanctions committee. Communication licences have been obtained from the Department of Trade and Industry, allowing participating companies to talk to the Iraqis about medical and water treatment and sewage products. The companies on the August trade trip had also been issued with communication licences by the DTI. They talked to senior Iraqi ministers who in turn arranged meetings with the heads of state-owned companies. Among the businessmen who travelled across the desert was Mr Christopher Doherty, managing director of United Projects, a trading company. Before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, his company was exporting up to Pounds 15m of goods a year to Iraq, including agricultural machinery and pharmaceutical products. Mr Doherty this week recalled: 'We went to reassure the Iraqis that we wanted to re-establish business. When we got there the Iraqis asked us: 'Where have you British been all these years?'' Others in the delegation included representatives of Binnie &amp; Partners, engineering consultants, and Thames Water. The two companies were exploring the possibility of restarting an abandoned water treatment plant they helped build. Mr James Hetherington, a director of Binnie &amp; Partners, said he agreed to join the delegation because it opened up the possibility of broadening commercial contacts with the Iraqis. 'I told the Iraqis we would like to repair the existing plant and in due course get more contracts.' Mr Ewan Drummond, business director with Johnson &amp; Johnson, a supplier of medical products which was involved in the August trip, said his company was hoping to win Iraqi contracts after sanctions were lifted. 'It is quite clear that the DTI was involved with the visit to Iraq,' he said. 'It was not an officially sponsored trip, but nor did the DTI disapprove. We always seek advice from the DTI to make sure that we comply with the sanctions regime.' Mr Ian Detheridge, financial director of Wright Rain, a water irrigation company, said: 'We were interested originally because we were told humanitarian aid was permissible and we wanted to sell the Iraqis irrigation equipment . . . but when we got to Baghdad we realised that the Iraqis' intention was to see the restoration of trade ties (with) the UK.' The trade visit was organised by a commercial lobby group called the Iraqi British Interest Group (IBI). It is also organising a trip in January for the vehicle and construction trades. Member companies pay annual subscriptions of between Pounds 250 and Pounds 500. The IBI describes itself as a 'strategic association'. Its main organiser, Mr Stephen Crouch, a business consultant, said its aim was 'to bring together intelligence on the Iraqi market to see how we can move in when conditions are better'. He added: 'Industry is very sensitive about being seen to have contact with the Iraqi regime. However, companies obviously want to maintain contact with the Iraqi state and to see what the country requires.' According to Mr Doherty, one of the group's strongest supporters is Mr Henry Bellingham, a Conservative MP who is parliamentary private secretary to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence minister. 'Mr Bellingham is fully supportive of what we are doing,' he said. Mr Doherty says Mr Bellingham was promoting British commercial links with Iraq when he met Iraqi officials in Amman in early September. When approached this week, Mr Bellingham said he had 'no regular contacts with IBI', and added that his contacts with the Iraqis were informal. Commercial support for the IBI has been growing. Some 100 companies from a range of sectors including pharmaceuticals, financial services, construction, and transport have expressed an interest in resuming ties with Iraq. One Whitehall official said Mr Crouch's objectives were 'a bit more loose than Her Majesty's Government's'. Mr Crouch insists he has British interests at the heart of his campaign. Companies which have signalled their intention to go to Iraq in January include Leyland Trucks, crane and construction equipment maker RB International and fire engine maker Angus Fires. Leyland said: 'When sanctions are lifted there is clearly going to be opportunities for new business. Our feeling is that our competitors are already preparing themselves.' UK companies fear that European competitors have been moving faster than they have. Trade delegations from France, Spain, Germany and Italy have visited Baghdad during recent months. Mr Andrew Brown, a senior manager with RB International, said last week: 'When sanctions are lifted, the whole place is going to come alive in trade terms. We want to be there when that happens.'</p>

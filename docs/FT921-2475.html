			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US increases spending on wheat export subsidies THE US Department of Agriculture has been spending more than ever on wheat export subsidies, despite a projected 18-year low in US wheat stocks, in order to maintain US foreign market share. Most of the subsidies, paid out under the US Export Enhancement Program, are still going to wheat shippers, although stocks are projected to fall to 390m bushels by the end of the marketing year, according to the National Association of Wheat Growers. It said total subsidies could surpass Dollars 1.5bn this year - 50 per cent more than the 1988 record. Although the US price strengthened to about Dollars 4 a bushel, subsidies were averaging about Dollars 54 a tonne through February, well above the previous year's levels. This month they have fallen to the mid-Dollars 40s level, which is still above 1991, a USDA official said. This is being watched closely by Australian officials, who earlier this year pleaded with President Bush to ease up on market-depressing subsidies. Mr John Sault, attache at the Australian embassy in Washington, said: 'It is a considerable concern to us that the EEP is being used so aggressively in circumstances where US stocks are historically low'. American officials, however, have argued that they are simply trying to match the price set by the EC. 'We get the same story from Europe,' he said. 'There is an element of validity on both sides, but once you get competitive subsidisation going on, then prices don't rise to the extent that they should.' At the same time, the US wheat farmers were infuriated by a USDA refusal to offer subsidies for a 1m tonne sale of wheat to India. Department officials offered various excuses, including one that India was not a 'traditional' US customer. The wheat growers' association argued, however, that the Indian market offered more growth potential the former Soviet Union, which was consistently able to get subsidies. There is some quiet speculation that the US wants to help Canada in the Indian market.</p>

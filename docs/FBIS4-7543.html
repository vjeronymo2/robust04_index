			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Gyorgy </F> Jozsef Farkas; place and date not given: "A Solution to the  Problems on a Rational Basis"]    [Text] The Bratislava weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK organized a  meeting between Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and 13  journalists. Our correspondent represented the Hungarian press  at this meeting that lasted more than one hour and that was also  recorded by Slovak Television. We publish here Jozef Moravcik's  answers to our correspondent's questions.    [Farkas] Mr. Moravcik! Elections are scheduled in Slovakia  in September, but the new Hungarian parliament will be elected  in May. Do you still see any possibility of developing  cooperation with the current Hungarian leadership?    [Moravcik] From Bratislava, at first sight it seems that the  current leadership in Budapest is not particularly worried about  the coming elections. We are not dealing with the timing of the  Hungarian elections, either, because we are regarding our  relations in broader aspects. However, we are aware of the fact  that diplomatic actions are in preparation in Europe that could  also be used well in shaping the relations between our  countries. I mean the coming Paris conference. No doubt, we  would both benefit if we could solve our problems without  outside assistance like the International Court, and if we  succeeded in preventing phenomena that lead to instability.  This requires the creation of foundations that facilitate a  more rational solution of our problems. We are ready to take  such a step anytime.    [Farkas] Do you see any possibility for Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszy to carry out his visit that was  postponed in November 1993?    [Moravcik] When I was foreign minister, we confirmed,  together with my Hungarian colleague, that the aforementioned  visit was to the benefit of both of us. However, as you know,  the problem of the extradition agreement emerged at the time. I  am convinced that we will overcome this obstacle that hinders  this visit, and the planned visits will take place. We are also  interested in opening new border-crossing points, and the  Slovak-Hungarian border is no exception to this, although there  are a lot more crossing points along this border than along our  other borders. However, our relations are specific, and, thus,  the solutions must also be specific. We are ready to open  further crossing points.    [Farkas] The economy can play an important role in our  cooperation. However, your predecessor, Mr. Meciar, objected to  the fact that Hungarian capital allegedly had an exaggerated  presence in southern Slovakia.    [Moravcik] It is generally useless to limit the inflow of  capital, and this particularly applies to Slovakia, which is  only a small piece of land in Europe. Besides, capital is  increasingly becoming international, and it is increasingly  hopeless to look for national features on it. Therefore, I find  it totally useless to seek ethnic features in the flow of  capital.    [Farkas] In conclusion, a question about the distribution of  the Danube waters. The European Union submitted a separate note  to your predecessor, but Mr. Meciar's answer is not known. Is  it possible that it will be your government's task to answer it?  If so, what can we expect?    [Moravcik] Actually, there was no talk of any obligation to  answer this note because it summed up the position of the  European Union for the Slovak Government. As for the  distribution of water itself, I regard this primarily as a  technical problem, and I agree with Mr. Jeszenszky that, given  the fact that this is a technical problem, we should tackle the  problem accordingly.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Petrobras improves to Dollars 269m PETROBRAS, Brazil's state oil monopoly, yesterday raised net profits to Dollars 269m for the first six months of 1993 as it benefited from cost-cutting measures, AP-DJ reports from Rio de Janeiro. The result was a sharp improvement from 1992, when profits totalled just Dollars 26m in the first half and Dollars 56m for the year. Gross earnings in the first six months were Dollars 8.3bn, and investments totalled Dollars 1bn. Mr Jose de Melo, assistant financial director, said the improved performance was due to cuts in operational and financing costs. He said that Petrobras had restructured its debt profile from short-term to long-term. An audit by the independent firm Ernst Young, Sotec in June had put the company's debt at Dollars 4.7bn, including Dollars 3bn in short-term obligations. Mr Melo said Petrobras' debt in June totaled Dollars 4.5bn, up from Dollars 4.2bn at the same time last year. The Brazilian government owes Petrobras Dollars 3.865bn. Mr Paulino Cicero, mines and energy minister, said that retail fuel prices, which are set by the government, were 42 per cent below what they should be. Increases have been delayed to avoid stoking up inflation, currently running at 30 per cent a month. Petrobras produces daily about 653,000 barrels of oil and 19m cubic metres of natural gas. Earnings in 1992 were Dollars 14bn.</p>

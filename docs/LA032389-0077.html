			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: NORWALK;  </P> <P> CITIZEN FORUM WAS 'WORTH EVERY NICKEL,' MAYOR SAYS  </P> <P> More than 100 people turned out for a daylong Community Congress last Saturday  that had participants break into discussion groups and brainstorm ways to  combat crime and other major problems facing the "Keystone City."  </P> <P> Norwalk officials spent much of the day just listening to residents, and in the  end declared that the $12,000 city-sponsored session had been valuable. "It has  been worth every nickel," Mayor Marcial (Rod) Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Two topics often raised by participants were public safety and human services.  Several people recommended that City Hall do a better job of making residents  aware of available services. And they also called for city officials to pay  more attention to drug-abuse problems, improve Neighborhood Watch programs and  increase police emergency response time.  </P></p>

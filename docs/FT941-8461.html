			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Southern Radio sells 22% stake in Orchard Media Southern Radio, which provides independent local radio services in Hampshire, Sussex and Kent, has sold its 21.96 per cent stake in Orchard Media, the commercial radio operator in Taunton and Yeovil, to Radio Investments for Pounds 282,000. The shares rose 9p to 111p. Mr Rory McLeod, Southern's managing director, said the sale was part of the group's strategy of focusing on its core business in the south-east of England and investing in radio companies where the group could add value. 'The sale has provided further cash to boost the group's reserves, already well ahead of budget following a first quarter of record revenues for the company. New, exciting opportunities are emerging and Southern Radio is well placed to take up those opportunities as they arise.' In December, Southern reported a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 956,000 (Pounds 774,000) for the year to September 30 on turnover 13 per cent ahead to Pounds 8.61m (Pounds 7.64m). Those results were the first full year for the group following the merger with Invicta Radio in December 1991.</p>

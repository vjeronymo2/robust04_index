			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Tax help to creditors - BCCI DEPOSITORS in Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed last summer, will be the main beneficiaries of new tax relief to insolvent deposit-takers, according to tax advisers. The relief will benefit all depositors and other creditors of banks and building societies which have ceased trading and gone into voluntary liquidation. The timing of the change, though, makes it of particular relevance to BCCI, by far the largest deposit-taker to fail. The new relief applies to the interest income earned on loans made by deposit-takers which have gone into liquidation. Until now, this has been treated as investment income, and been subjected 33 per cent tax. Unlike the regular income of other traders in liquidation, it has not been possible to deduct expenses and earlier trading losses from this interest income before tax. That difference has now been removed, though the concession will not apply to income from the proceeds of investments which have been sold off. The change should make more money available for distribution by liquidators of failed deposit-takers. Touche Ross, administrators to BCCI, said yesterday that it was too early to say what the effect of the change would be. However, one tax adviser in London said the ability to carry forward past trading losses to set off against interest income on the bank's loans should be a significant help to BCCI's creditors.</p>

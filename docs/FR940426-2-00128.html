			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that recision of the guidance would enable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it to award contracts consistent with its Board's policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring it to consider only avoidable costs when evaluating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost-effectiveness of private carrier proposals. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transit system argued that the avoidable cost method best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures the true cost savings achieved through the contracting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter presented an analysis by a Columbia University  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professor of a report by a consulting company recommending, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis of a fully allocated cost methodology, that a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transit system privatize 25 percent of its transit bus service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contrary to the cost savings projected in the report, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professor's study, using a marginal cost analysis, concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed privatization program would produce no savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, in fact, would cost the transit agency a considerable sum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the commenter argued, the proposal would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriously fragmented service and the associated organizational,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety, and service problems evidenced in other cities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> privatized on this basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter argued that experience throughout the country  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that forced privatization efforts have resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant cost increases, serious service problems, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ridership and revenue losses. This submission provided examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of areas where privatization allegedly increased costs. In one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case, an audit showed that projected savings of 30&hyph;40 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were actually in the 3 to 4 percent range. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contended that because the fully allocated cost analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires public agencies to include their fixed costs as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their bottom line as well as costs incurred for buses and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, comparisons on this basis are fundamentally flawed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They contended that fixed costs should not be included among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of a public transit operator because these costs will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred regardless of whether the particular service is offered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, some commenters argued in favor of the fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated cost methodology. By standardizing the way costs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counted, they contended, the fully allocated cost method can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce transactional costs, help highlight and eliminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-subsidies, and improve accountability and transparency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter argued: (1) That permitting public transit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to submit cost of service bids based solely on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-run marginal cost of service would result in calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ignore the costs of facilities and rolling stock and assume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the public transit agency operates its system at the least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible cost; (2) that marginal cost analysis does not permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the riding public and taxpaying public to compare the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of service for the transit system with and without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed alternative service patterns of providers of service;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) that direct comparisons of labor productivity between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public transit agency and private contractors would be difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or impossible since the bases for calculating costs would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different, as might the reliability and quality of the service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in question; and (4) that fully allocated cost comparisons are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to permit a transparent view of the costs of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and proposed services and the acquisitions of assets and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities that may be relevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter noted that concern about using fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated costs is misplaced in that the disclosure of all costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is designed to level the playing field in light of Federal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other subsidies available to public operators. This commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further noted that the fully allocated cost method is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical baseline, more of a disclosure than an absolute sum,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that fully allocated costs may be discounted for costs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be saved when determining the feasibility of using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Institutional Barriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current policy requires that local authorities ignore local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law when considering the feasibility of using private enterprise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in local transit service. That is, under the current private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enterprise policy, FTA does not recognize, as legitimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barriers to private enterprise participation, local laws or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy or labor agreements that call for direct operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass transit service. Many commenters maintained that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position unduly restricts the prerogatives of local officials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and impedes their ability to consider a broad range of transit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options. They also argued that the successful negotiation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collective bargaining agreements often requires that transit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials be accorded a maximum degree of bargaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility. The comments in response to this point varied:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unions and certain transit systems argued for flexibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light of unique local situations. Private operators argued in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> favor of a ``level playing field'' so that local arrangements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not used to bar private operators from being considered for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of providing public transit services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter argued that FTA must balance the two often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflicting provisions of the FT Act: the section 13(c) labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection provisions and the private enterprise provisions. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent that FTA reduces the private enterprise requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while the 13(c) requirement continues in full effect, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter argued, the balance will inevitably be altered and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> riders of public transit will be harmed by the imbalance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter noted that Federal financial assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily comes with overriding Federal requirements, e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement rules, that follow the Federal dollar. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent, the commenter contended, for an agency to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal procurement requirements on grantees, but at the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time to permit them to thwart the purposes and conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal assistance merely by agreeing with third parties such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unions. If, continued the commenter, the concern about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional barriers is labor protection, then one must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider that section 13(c) of the Act contains express  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions for the protection of labor. If Congress intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to exempt contrary provisions of labor agreements from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private enterprise mandates of the Act, it would have done so;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breaking down institutional barriers is a necessary precondition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to enabling competition to develop new and more efficient means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to deliver transit services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, others argued against using the transit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to override State constitutional prohibitions, State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local laws and referenda, rulings of State regulatory bodies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and local collective bargaining agreements. This policy, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contended, has had the net effect of depriving local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation leaders of the flexibility to determine to what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent privatization is in the best interest of their local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indeed, a member of Congress commented that ``the ISTEA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior congressional directives have emphasized that the criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and policies for choosing among public and private providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be left to local transit agencies and community planners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the proper role for the Federal government should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of neutrality on this essentially local decision.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, the same member noted, ``properly reflects the emphasis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on local decision-making which I and other architects intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the ISTEA.'' Similarly, a United States Senator noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``the new language (in the Notice of Proposed Recision) properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects the intent of ISTEA.'' And: ``The ISTEA emphasized that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria for choosing among public and private transit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers should be left to local transit agencies and community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Review of Existing Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing private enterprise policy provides that recipients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should review each route every three years to determine whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the services in question could be more effectively provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private operators. FTA noted that this represented a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant burden, particularly for major transit systems, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that local authorities should determine the frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any such reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

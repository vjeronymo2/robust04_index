			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool After an encouraging opening day to the new selling season last week, prices barely held steady, and ended only a fraction higher than at the close of the 1992/93 season. This week has seen the market slip further, despite reduced offerings in Melbourne due to a strike of laboratory technicians. The resumed easier tendency, after some improvement in the previous three months, is not helpful to business in related markets. The Australian market indicator on August 4 was 439c/kg, down 16 cents compared with a week ago.</p>

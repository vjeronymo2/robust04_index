			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Management: Incentive for bosses to rally around the standard - Lisa Wood explains why managers are finding it valuable to opt for vocational qualifications Mention the initials MCI to most UK managers and you are likely to get a blank response. At best they will think you are talking about a US telecommunications company. Yet 130 civil servants at the Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency know better. They are using new management standards set by the Management Charter Initiative in their annual appraisals. Formally launched in July 1988 to boost management training, the non-profit and part-government funded MCI has been dismissed by critics as little more than a talking shop. But now, three years on, it is starting to be able to point to some tangible achievements. 'Things are starting to take off now that we have something to promote actively,' says Andrew Summers, the new chief executive of the MCI and a former managing director of RHM Foods, a Ranks Hovis McDougall subsidiary. 'We have a 10-point code of practice, to which more than 1,300 companies have signed up.' The code of practice was a worthy document with signatories agreeing to a host of good practices such as providing access to training and a framework for self-development. However there was no mechanism to judge whether the companies were implementing the code. By contrast, the new middle-management standards  - based on the best practice among a sample of 4,000 UK managers - offer practical training guidelines. Along with two other standards for first line managers and supervisors, they have been linked to National Vocational Qualifications. These are are competence-based qualifications, which themselves are only starting to get off the ground. NVQs span a wide span of achievement - from basic competence to the vocational equivalent of a post graduate degree. The stiffest resistance to NVQs has come from the professions who resist competence-based qualifications. Summers says that one of the attractions of the MCI standards for many managers is that previous experience and learning can be taken into account when a person's competence to do a job is judged. He estimates that it costs between Pounds 800 and Pounds 1,500 for each individual to be accredited for the middle-management standards. This excludes the cost a company would incur in training a manager over a period of years but includes workshops and advice. A minimum time to obtain accreditation would be about three months with an average time being about 12 months. It is a considerable investment for an individual - or an employer - to make. Summers says that employers rarely say that cost is an important reason for not training their employees. More significant, according to survey results, is the time that training takes, with smaller companies in particular finding it difficult to release individuals from their workplace. NVQs, says Summers, ease this problem as almost all the assessment process is done at work. Some 76 'centres', including training companies and colleges, now have trained assessors who can accredit the new qualifications. A survey, published by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and management consultancy last week showed some 20 per cent of the large companies polled in May believed the MCI had encouraged the company's human resource development. Not bad considering that the survey was done around the time the new standards were unveiled.</p>

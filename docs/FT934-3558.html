			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Trimmed Charter remainson acquisition trail Charter, the industrial group, is still planning to make a substantial acquisition but believes most quoted UK companies are currently looking overvalued. Mr Jeff Herbert, chief executive, said the group would be more likely to buy a division from a multinational or look to parts of the world where companies were on a lower rating. He wants to add an extra leg to Charter's current portfolio, which supplies equipment to the mining and rail industries, and building products, including quarrying. Charter is on the acquisition trail after unwinding its links with Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group. Charter sold its 38 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, for Pounds 342m in February. It then then used part of the proceeds to buy out a 36 per cent stake in Charter held by Minorco, Anglo American's Luxembourg-based investment company. Charter has net cash of Pounds 147m, and will receive another Pounds 42m in 1996, but Mr Herbert said the money was not burning a hole in his pock-et. 'We intend to follow the advice of our top shareholders, who have told us 'be thorough, be patient, but get it right'.' Charter's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 37.9m to Pounds 31.3m in the six months to September 30, reflecting the Johnson Matthey disposal. However, operating profits of continuing operations rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 19.5m on turnover of Pounds 288.4m (Pounds 262.2m). Mr Herbert said: 'There have been some signs of recovery in our markets, but conditions for our coal and materials businesses remain difficult. Taken as a whole, we expect continued modest improvement from our operating businesses.' Earnings per share fell to 19.6p (23.2p), but the interim dividend is held at 7p. Charter said it had discovered historic misreporting of contracts in its Cape insulation business in France, which had led to a write-off of Pounds 3.9m to reserves and the dismissal of the managers involved. An ind-ependent review of contracts throughout Cape had shown it was an isolated incident. COMMENT Profits were a little higher than expected because of an exceptional gain of Pounds 2.6m on the disposal of a limestone quarry, but Charter's shares dropped from 731p to 719p as analysts pondered indications that both Pandrol rail fasteners and Andersen mining equipment had an unusually strong first half. The performance of the continuing businesses is respectable, given market conditions, but interest in Charter focuses on its expansion plans. The shares are on a 20 per cent premium to the market, reflecting the uplift in earnings which should follow the investment of cash, and the earnings enhancement caused by the buy-back of Minorco's shares. How the shares perform from here will depend on the execution of the group's long-pondered acquisition plans.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARINGS ON ASSIGNED-RISK POLICIES HALTED  </P> <P> Hearings into a proposed 112.3% average increase in auto insurance rates for  more than a million drivers insured under California's assigned-risk plan were  recessed Friday amid indications that any state Insurance Department decision  on the matter will be put off until the social and economic implications of the  increase are formally studied.  </P> <P> Administrative Law Judge J. L. Whitfield suggested that representatives of the  assigned-risk governing board confer with lawyers for a coalition of 15  minority groups on the parameters and the financing of such a study, which  could take several months. The coalition had intervened in the hearings to  oppose an increase they said could "wreak havoc" among low-income  policyholders.  </P> <P> Whitfield's decision to press for the study, meanwhile holding the hearing in  abeyance, was hailed by John Gamboa, executive director of the Latino Issues  Forum, one of the minority groups represented. "It is the first time anyone in  authority has looked at the total implications of a rate increase," Gamboa  said.  </P> <P> The proposed increase would raise rates for the minimum state-required auto  liability insurance to as high as $2,187 a year in Los Angeles and to an  average $1,500 statewide. Opponents suggest this would force thousands of  people to illegally drop their auto insurance.  </P> <P> Under the assigned-risk system, insurance companies doing business in  California are required to accept a quota of drivers who either cannot get  insurance or choose not to buy regular coverage. Insurers said at the hearings  earlier this week that the statewide deficit on assigned-risk coverage will  amount to $600 million this year.  </P></p>

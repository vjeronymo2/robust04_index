			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Statement by President of the Republic of Lithuania </F> Algirdas Brazauskas on NATO Membership for Lithuania"]    [Text] Today, I have forwarded a letter to NATO Secretary  General Manfred Woerner, in which I officially requested the  admission of the Republic of Lithuania to the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, taking into account the resolution of the  Seimas of Lithuania dated 23 December 1993.    Lithuania assesses the Partnership for Peace initiative  favorably. At the same time, we hope that the NATO summit on  10-11 January will open the doors of this organization to the  countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and that a way will be  found for partnership to gradually grow into membership.    We are fully aware that with the present statement,  Lithuania  is embarking on a new, complex, and responsible stage in  rapprochement with the European Union and NATO, which will call  for determination, new solutions, and large material resources.  I believe that much will be clarified following my visit to  Brussels scheduled for 27 January of this year.    The position of Lithuania regarding NATO membership is not  directed against neighboring states or any other European  country; all of them should find a place in the new security  structures of our continent. Just as before, we come out in  favor of close cooperation among Baltic countries in all areas,  including the area of defense, and in favor of reinforcing  security and stability in the entire Baltic Sea region.    Vilnius, 4 January 1994</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Italians set to vote for change ITALIAN voters look set to endorse a major change in the electoral system in Sunday's referendum that proposes to reduce the importance of proportional representation and introduce the principle of majority voting in the Senate. As the referendum campaign closed last night opinion polls indicated a majority of the 48m voters backed a reform of the voting system. But the polls also showed continued widespread uncertainty. This has been blamed at least in part on the fact that seven other issues are being voted on the same day - ranging from de-penalising personal drug use and ending state funding of political parties to the abolition of the ministries of agriculture and tourism. A survey by pollsters Doxa published yesterday showed 57 per cent in favour of a change in the voting system, 10 per cent against and 33 per cent undecided. Polls, only ever approximate in gauging Italian voter intentions, have consistently given a majority for the change but the percentages have varied widely. With polling stations also open on Monday, the result will not be known until late that night. But already yesterday there were signs that Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, was preparing the ground for significant changes in government next week in the aftermath of the referendum.</p>

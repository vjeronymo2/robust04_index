			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / A brief encounter, now line is engaged: The Franco-German telecoms pact was prompted by growing global competition Competition unleashed by the erosion of state monopolies is a primary driving force in Europe's telecommunications industry. It was the main influence behind the alliance of the French and German public telecommunications operators, launched on Tuesday. To exploit emerging markets, telecoms partnerships are being forged across the world. Afraid for their markets, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have joined forces to keep such rivals at bay - particularly the alliance unveiled in June between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US telecoms operator. A pact between the US telecoms giant AT&amp;T and several Asia-Pacific operators, agreed shortly before BT's, also concentrated French and German minds. AT&amp;T is not necessarily hostile: it needs a European partner and is currently in talks with the French and German companies about whether they might fill that role. But the prospect of a global AT&amp;T increased the pressure on them to form a joint venture before concluding any deal with the Americans. Technological advance, increasing the range of sophisticated network and multimedia services that operators can offer, is a second force behind recent alliances. The Franco-German link-up, teaming two public network operators, is of the more conservative variety. In the US, today's fashion is for 'multimedia' alliances between telecoms operators and entertainment, cable and computing companies. In the past few months alone there have been deals between US West and Time Warner, Bell Atlantic and TCI, and Southwestern Bell and Cox Enterprises. The heart of the Franco-German alliance is an Ecu1bn (Pounds 760m) company whose job will be to build a European 'backbone' network offering multinational companies enhanced services, including private networks that cross borders. The size of the market for such 'one stop' services is unclear. Mr Marcel Roulet, France Telecom's chairman, says the new company is aiming at the leading 600 or so multinationals. BT talked of 'thousands' of possible clients at the launch of its MCI venture, which plans to offer similar services to the Franco-German alliance. But only a handful of multinationals have yet shown much interest in patronising 'one-stop' shops. And with an increasingly competitive world telecoms market, the margins in the business are unlikely to be high. A recent survey by the UK's Telecommunications Managers Association showed that 94 per cent of 439 large companies - including many of Mr Roulet's 600  -had decided against contracting out their telecoms requirements. However, undue concentration on the immediate prospects for the partnerships would be a mistake. Business from multinationals can be expected to grow as the new alliances succeed in developing and customising advanced services over their dedicated networks. Moreover, multinationals are only the first target of the alliances. By 1998 European operators will be forced into head-to-head competition for basic 'voice' traffic using public networks - the medium for most of today's telecoms traffic. Mr Gregory Staple, a US analyst, estimates that the volume of international 'voice' traffic carried over the world's public networks will increase from 42bn minutes last year to 60bn in 1995, so the market at stake is considerable. Significantly, all the services to be offered by the Franco-German alliance are in markets already liberalised by the European Union. Only one existing deregulated market has been excluded - mobile communications; and at the launch of the alliance Mr Roulet stressed the potential for future collaboration in that field. Once teething problems are overcome, the alliance is likely to move into other telecoms markets as they are deregulated by the Commission. As Mr Jacques Champeaux, leader of the negotiations for France Telecom, put it: 'Growth depends upon the evolution of regulation.' The implication is stark: when Europe's public networks are opened to competition in 1998, the French and Germans may seek to merge some or all of their basic voice services. Given their size, that would create not just a European, but a global giant. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are, respectively, the world's second and third largest carriers of international telecoms traffic. In 1992 their combined traffic base was marginally behind that of AT&amp;T and more than three times that of BT, which ranks fourth. With economic revival in eastern Germany and the French and German operators' ambitions in eastern European, their relative position is likely to strengthen further. Nonetheless, it was perceptions of mutual weakness as much as of strength that drove Mr Roulet and Mr Helmut Ricke, his Deutsche Telekom counterpart, into each other's arms. In a speech to an FT conference this week, Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, said the modern national telecoms operator had to be a 'complex hybrid', with strong public service obligations at home, but acting as a predator abroad. BT, privatised for nearly a decade and operating in Europe's most liberal market, is indeed a predator, eager to exploit opportunities elsewhere in Europe. But the Franco-German deal shows that Europe's state-owned monopolies are learning fast. The courtship was remarkably short, starting immediately after BT and MCI announced their Dollars 5.3bn deal. As a Deutsche Telekom executive says: 'Of course we had to get in the same game, and fast.' It is not just the threat of international competition and technological change which are obliging them to do so. All of Europe's state operators already face growing pressure in their home markets. Over the last year both France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have been shaken by the success of newly licensed rival mobile phone operators competing against their mobile subsidiaries. The liberalisation of data and private networks looks set to pose a similar threat. Mannesmann, the main competitor to Deutsche Telekom in the German mobile phone market, last month launched a consortium with RWE, the energy-based conglomerate, and Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, to offer fixed-wire services to corporate clients. The consortium's ambitions are likely to expand in line with liberalisation. Mr Roulet and Mr Ricke also face obstacles as they try to implement the restructuring of their companies necessary to make the alliance a success. The present legal status of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom prohibits the companies even from swapping equity, something they are keen to do to underpin their marriage. Mr Ricke's priority is privatisation. Although the German government and Social Democrat opposition party have reached a tentative agreement on a privatisation plan, its progress is glacial. 'There is no definitive political consensus to create a private company - only a vague willingness,' says Mr Ricke. Privatisation is not on the agenda for France Telecom. Even plans to transform the operator into a state-owned company with share capital, which would facilitate international partnerships, are being delayed by strong opposition. Legislation to change France Telecom's legal status was due to be introduced into the French parliament next spring. But the planned reforms drew protests from trade unions, afraid that the change would mean job losses and cost-cutting measures, and would be a prelude to privatisation. A one-day strike in October was supported by about three-quarters of France Telecom's employees, forcing the government to extend negotiations. Even the alliance with Deutsche Telekom appears too much for some of the French operator's unions. The Confederation Generale du Travail, the communist-led union, said it represented a step towards privatisation and should be rejected. The union is planning to call another strike for December 14. BT's reaction to the Franco-German alliance was to call for the introduction of 'voice' competition before 1998, and for the early liberalisation of the market for telecommunications infrastructure, which would enable operators to build their own networks. But given their problems, Mr Roulet and Mr Ricke can see no virtue in accelerating the pace of liberalisation - with or without an alliance.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Irish twist beggars Major in Europe's poorhouse AS IF John Major's government did not have enough grief: monetary policy in ruins, no sign of an economic strategy, and trying to place Britain at the heart of a Europe in danger of cardiac arrest. Now it is being suggested that the UK - post-devaluation - is technically poor enough to apply for extra European Community cash from the Cohesion Fund. This was agreed at Maastricht for Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece - the treaty says handouts are applicable to EC member states whose per capita income is below 90 per cent of the EC average. Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party, yesterday wrote to Mr Major (with copy to the European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors), pointing out that UK per capita income at the purchasing power parities of today's rate for sterling is at 87 per cent of the EC average. Bingo. Ergo, could we have some of this Cohesion Fund - which Brussels wants to endow with Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in today's money - for Northern Ireland please? Mr Hume could not resist being a bit more mischievous. Under EC regional policy rules, the purchasing power parity formula was used to make sure that Northern Ireland is defined as among the most backward regions in Europe, so it can get the most generous EC regional aid grants, even though average income is higher than the qualifying threshold. This deal has already had some highly charged political implications. Last year the EC formed a free trade zone with the seven rich Nordic and Alpine countries of the European Free Trade Association. The treaty in question, the European Economic Area, requires the new partners to help backward areas of the Community catch up, and defined Ireland, both north and south, as one unit: 'The island of Ireland', equally eligible for such hand-outs. Mr Hume reminds Mr Major of this precedent, saying 'access to the Cohesion Fund would underpin the proper planning of an integrated environmental and transport infrastructure on the basis of the needs of the island of Ireland'. Should Mr Major choose to take up the opportunity offered by the UK's relegation, his alternatives are not appealing. The Cohesion Fund applies to countries, not regions, so he would have to acknowledge that the UK as a whole is in Europe's poorhouse. Or he could say that Northern Ireland should be treated - economically at least - as part of Ireland.</p>

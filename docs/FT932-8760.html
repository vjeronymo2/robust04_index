			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: A consuming interest in trade - Veteran activist Nader turns on 'free trade' AN ORDINARY consumer activist might be expected to applaud agreements which are designed to usher in freer trade - and, in theory, lower prices. But there is nothing ordinary about Ralph Nader, and never has been. The ageing white knight of US consumer activism is as angry as when he first burst on the national scene in 1968 to fight for car safety. He has long identified the 'imperialists' of multinational corporations as the enemy. And it is their influence with the US trade negotiating team that makes the Uruguay Round and the North American Free Trade Agreement suspect to him. Mr Nader has for three decades has been battling everything from diseased fish to higher car prices or dental X-rays and defective tyres. Since his heyday, he has suffered some loss of stature - critics portray him as a vengeful, thoroughly paranoid zealot - but he still ranks on the lists of Most Admired Americans, and there are still fans who, every four years, urge him to run for president. Mr Nader has trained his attention to an ever-expanding list of government and corporate evils. And so it is that he is sharpening his lance and forming alliances for a crusade against the talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Nafta. What drew Mr Nader's attention to the Uruguay Round was the decision, pushed by the US, to devise global rules to stem the use of health and safety standards as trade barriers. 'Trade agreements are becoming more and more blatantly over-reaching,' Mr Nader said, in a recent interview. 'They are going way beyond tariffs and traditional commercial issues into overriding what they call 'technical barriers to trade'.' The great fear of Mr Nader and his allies in the environmental movement is that a Gatt or Nafta dispute settlement commission would find US standards actionable because they are more stringent than those of the rest of the world. Citizen groups have no influence with these international panels; they cannot bring cases, nor are they party to the closed-door discussions that lead to decisions. Mr Nader is convinced that the multinationals will use these panels to weaken worker safety and food and health regulations. The current Gatt should be abandoned, Mr Nader said. The US should restructure its relations to give the greatest trade advantages to democracies which uphold worker and human rights. Democracies should only give up some of their sovereignty if it is to a democratic trading organisation which allows petitioning by citizens and local governments as well as national governments. Mr Nader slammed a foot-high stack of documents on his desk. 'This is the Nafta,' he said. 'Fewer people have read this than have read and understood Einstein's theory of relativity. I'll guarantee you that 99 per cent of the so-called liberal free traders have never read this or have never read detailed summaries of this and are simply thinking this is nothing more than a late 20th century version of Portuguese wine trading for British textiles.' It is not possible to have a trade alliance with Mexico, which has 'fundamental police state characteristics', he said. Besides its cheap labour, it has as a 'comparative advantage' its failure to enforce its child labour law. No trade agreement with the US can compel the Mexicans to enforce their worker, health or safety laws. 'Mexico is the land of the ultimate no-law law. Non-enforcement of laws is a way of life.' Although he generally favours lowering or eliminating tariffs, the effort should not begin until there are 'alternative employment opportunities', he said. In Mexico, for example, the planned phase-out of tariffs on maize over the next 15 years could dispossess 7m-8m peasant farmers. 'In the crime-ridden slums of Mexico City they can't even breathe fresh air or drink water. In the maquiladoras (border factories), they live in shacks. There is no community, no schools, no social life.' Prostitution and drugs, he said, accounted for a high labour turnover although wages there are nearly the highest in the country. The Nafta is expected to go to Congress this summer. It is already unpopular, and if Mr Nader has his way, he and his allies in the environment and labour movements will make it more so.</p>

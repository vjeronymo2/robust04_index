			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Dewhurst butchers chain faces shake-up DEWHURST, which runs the UK's biggest chain of butchers shops, will today disclose details of a substantial rationalisation of its 1,006 shops. Nevertheless the company, part of the privately owned Vestey business empire, yesterday refused to comment on the widespread reports that it planned to close up to 600 shops with the loss of 1,000 jobs. The company said it first had to inform its 4,234 staff of its decisions at regional meetings. There was disquiet, though, about possible closures at Dewhurst outlets yesterday. Dewhurst's plight may partly reflect the financial strains of the Vestey parent company, which was recently forced to make substantial provisions on its property portfolio. It also highlights the intense pressure that traditional butchers have experienced as a result of changing shopping habits and the growth of supermarket chains. According to estimates from Verdict, the retail research company, the big grocery chains now account for more than half of all carcase meat sold in the UK and about 92 per cent of bacon, ham, poultry and other meat products. Mr Richard Hyman, Verdict's director, said: 'I do not think it is too fanciful to suggest that this is at least partly due to the changing nature of society. 'Mothers do not pass on knowledge about cuts of meat to their children. It is pretty innocuous to go into a supermarket and choose a recognisable chunk of meat, whereas in a serviced butcher's shop you have to know what you are asking for.' Mr John Fuller of the National Federation of Meat Traders, which represents independent butchers, said butchers were trying to raise knowledge through educational programmes at schools. He added that, although butchers had undoubtedly suffered from supermarket competition, there were grounds for believing that smaller, family-owned butchers were experiencing a comeback, partly at the expense of the bigger chains  - such as Dewhurst. 'Elements like the weather do have an impact on whether people buy stewing steak or barbecue meats,' he said. 'The private butcher is an entrepreneur and can respond a lot more quickly than the larger managed groups.' Nevertheless, the latest government figures showed that the number of registered butchers firms fell by 540 to 13,641 in the year ending April 1991. Thirty years ago there were more than 33,000 butchers shops on Britain's high streets.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares survive bout of profit-taking AN EXCITING, and largely successful week for the UK equity market ended yesterday with share prices rallying strongly at the close of an erratic session, helped by renewed strength on Wall Street. Thursday's cut in rates by the Bundesbank was identified as positive for the UK stock market although most strategists agreed that any further reduction in domestic rates will probably be withheld until Budget day, early in March. Initial trading saw some good buying from the institutions but it was soon clear that their attention was focused on the utilities, conventionally seen as defensive stocks. A gain of 17.7 to 2,883.5 on the Footsie was steadily eroded and had been replaced early in the afternoon by a loss of 12.3. The Footsie has advanced nearly 2 per cent this week, edging above Footsie 2,900 briefly on Thursday afternoon. Support for the second-line stocks yesterday was disclosed in the gain of 7.7 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to 3,050.5. Later in the session, the UK stock market lay low until Wall Street responded with an early gain of 20 Dow points to improved US jobless totals for January. London reacted vigorously as the mood improved and, by the close of trading, the FT-SE Index was only 3.0 down at 2,862.9. Seaq volume of 691.9m shares, of which around 61 per cent were non-Footsie stocks, compared with 949.5m on Thursday. Retail volume of Pounds 2.14bn on Thursday was the highest daily total since September 18 last year when the market was celebrating sterling's departure from the ERM. High volume in the past two sessions has indicated the weight of trading activity in London as international institutions first anticipated and then responded to the Bundesbank's interest rate cut. Profit-takers moved heavily against bank shares yesterday, with some analysts fearing that the impending season of profits statements may bring a spate of rights issues. Properties, which, according to SG Warburg Securities, the UK investment bank and securities house, have outperformed the rest of the stock market by 22 per cent over the past two weeks, gave back a tiny proportion of their gains yesterday. Engineering and aerospace shares were also targets for profit-taking. Longer-term worries about inflation prospects surfaced in the gilt edged market where long-dated conventional issues closed a shade off on the day but index-linked gilts, the prime inflation hedge instruments, extended early gains to finish around 1/4 higher.</p>

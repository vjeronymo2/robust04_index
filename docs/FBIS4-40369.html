			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Correspondent Ernest Matskyavichus] [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia leader, LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  today said that the construction of Yeltsin's edict on fighting  organized crime was good on paper, but in reality lifeless. The  presidential program for fighting crime will be effective only  in conjunction with measures proposed by the Liberal Democratic  Party.    Apart from that, the LDPR leader expressed his opinion on  the  motives of Acting Procurator General Aleksey Ilyushenko, who has  lodged an appeal with the Duma on stripping Zhirinovskiy of his  parliamentary immunity and instituting criminal proceedings  against him.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I view this as a political  provocation. He is undermining the agreement on accord. He did  not agree this issue with the country's president. I am the  leader of the party that won the elections and head a deputies'  faction in the State Duma. This is a special situation.  Therefore this is his mistake and I think that after this he  will lose his post as acting Russian procurator general. This  will be our contribution -- quickly filling this post with a  worthy lawyer from our country. [end recording]    [Matskyavichus] Tomorrow the Duma council is to examine the  appeal from Acting Procurator General Ilyushenko.</p>

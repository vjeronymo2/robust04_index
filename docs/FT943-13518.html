			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Net profits improve 7% at French power group GEC Alsthom, the transport and power engineering company jointly owned by France's Alcatel Alsthom and GEC of the UK, yesterday announced a rise of 7 per cent in net profits for the year to the end of March, to Ecu329m (Dollars 279m) from Ecu308m. The net result was achieved on stable sales of Ecu7.93bn and operating profits of Ecu640m, a rise of 15 per cent over 1992-93. The company, which was formed five years ago, said it had maintained its rate of growth of new contracts, receiving orders worth Ecu9.32bn during the year. This took the year-end order book to a record Ecu17bn, GEC Alsthom said. The figures for last year's orders do not include the Dollars 2.1bn contract to supply high-speed trains and related equipment to South Korea. The contract, which was signed in June, followed several years of negotiations and was won in the face of competition from a German consortium headed by Siemens. Since the end of the last financial year, GEC Alsthom has expanded through the acquisition of a controlling stake in Linke-Hofmann-Busch, a German manufacturer of rail equipment. The acquisition, announced last month, is an important step into the German market, and strengthen's GEC Alsthom's presence in urban, suburban and inter-city rail equipment.</p>

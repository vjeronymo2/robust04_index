			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Nike plunge 30% to Dollars 52.3m Nike, the US maker of athletic shoes and sports wear, yesterday confirmed the gloomy trend in its financial performance by reporting a 30 per cent fall in net income to Dollars 52.3m from Dollars 76m in its second quarter to November 30. Mr Philip Knight, chairman, delivered a robust defence of the company's strategy and said he was optimistic about next year's autumn back-to-school season and beyond. 'We remain the best-positioned company in the industry to grow as we enter fiscal 1995,' he said Nike, which warned in September that this financial year's figures would fall short of 1992-93 levels, has been suffering from a shift in purchasers' tastes away from basketball and other sports shoes towards the rugged footwear made by companies such as Timberland and Dr Martens. Sales in the latest quarter fell by 8 per cent to Dollars 805.8m from Dollars 875.8m, and net income per share fell by 30 per cent to 69 cents from 98 cents. For the six months to date, net income was down to Dollars 166.4m from Dollars 198.6m. Nike said adverse shifts in exchange rates were partly to blame for the fall. On a constant dollar basis, it said, revenues would have been down by only 1 per cent and net income per share would have been 77 cents. Looking ahead, the company said worldwide orders for footwear and apparel for delivery between December and next April were Dollars 1.4bn, some 14 per cent below the comparable period. But Mr Knight said these figures disguised the reasons for optimism. Nike had a significant and growing share in the US market for rugged casuals, Mr Knight, but its solid advances in this sector had been overshadowed by a 25 per cent decline in its revenues from basketball shoes, a sector that had been experiencing 'the ebb and flow common in this industry between individual categories'.</p>

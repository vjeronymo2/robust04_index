			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Luxury sales help Time Prods to Pounds 4.7m Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution group, lifted both turnover and profits, excluding exceptional items, by almost a quarter in the six months to July 31. Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said yesterday he was pleased with the results and confident about the future. 'Rich people will always buy, but you have to have the things they want.' In the pipeline was 'the most complicated pocket watch ever made,' which would have 11 hands and movements on both sides and sell for more than Pounds 500,000. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.69m, against Pounds 5.33m last time, when profits on disposals totalled Pounds 1.48m. Total turnover rose from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 37.2m, including a Pounds 2.05m contribution from the Swiss distribution of Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker. Time, which already has the North American distribution rights, paid Pounds 2.5m cash and assumed Pounds 2.5m of debt to buy the Swiss rights last March. Mr Margulies described sales of luxury watches, which can be priced at up to Pounds 500,000, as satisfactory, with Audemars Piguet sales in North America exceeding expectations. The group, which holds agencies for seven luxury watchmakers, including Blancpain and Vacheron Constantin, sold 10 pieces at more than Pounds 100,000 in the half. Last year the group acquired Judith Leiber, the American designer of luxury handbags and evening bags which retail at between Dollars 1,200 and Dollars 4,000. It is planning to develop the brand, adding costume jewellery and other accessories. Luxury items made up 70 per cent of operating profits, compared with 30 per cent from the volume operations, including Sekonda watches. The cost of buying the Swiss rights to Audemars Piguet and lower rates reduced interest income from Pounds 513,000 to Pounds 138,000 and left the group marginally geared. But profits are skewed to Christmas and the second half, and the group expects to be cash positive by January. Earnings were 5.85p (6.67p). The interim dividend is raised by 0.25p to 3.25p.</p>

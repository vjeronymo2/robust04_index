According to General Manuel Andara, Venezuelan acting defense  minister, a commission is visiting the border area to establish  if the crash was caused by mechanical failure or was attacked by  Colombian guerrillas. National Guard members and some peasants,  who had been captured -- according to complaints on the  Colombian side -- in Colombian territory, were aboard that  helicopter. It was reported in Venezuela that these people were  arrested in Venezuela. We are now in contact with Hernando Prada  Gonzalez, Colombian consul in the town of Guasdualito, located  opposite the Arauca Intendance.    Good morning, please tell us what reports Colombian  diplomatic representatives have received from the Venezuelan  Government on the helicopter incident?    [Prada] Good morning, on Saturday at 1800 they released Mr.  Patino, who was the only person to be held in this border area  because of the helicopter accident you mentioned.    [Reporter] Did Mr. Patino say he was captured on Colombian  soil?    [Prada] Yes, he said this happened on the Puerto Rico path  in  Colombia. You have already told the country about this. He was  later taken aboard another helicopter to a military base  stationed in Guasdualito. Foreign Ministry officials were  following the case. On Saturday at 1800, he was turned over to  the Arauca military operation command.    [Reporter] In addition to Mr. Patino's report, has your  consulate received any other explanation or additional reports  from the Venezuelan authorities.    [Prada] No, the only thing we received was Mr. Patino's  return. We were told he was held as a witness to the helicopter  crash.    [Reporter] We have reports that another Colombian fisherman,  besides Mr. Patino, was captured and that the Venezuelans are  not reporting on his whereabouts.    [Prada] The consulate has no knowledge of that. We talked  with Mr. Patino, and he was the only person flown aboard a  helicopter from the crash site to this military garrison.    [Reporter] Colombian authorities are guarding the Venezuelan  helicopter. Has Venezuela requested the helicopter's return  through you or any other channel?    [Prada] Not at all. The helicopter is in the custody of the  Colombian authorities in Colombian territory. No request on the  matter has been submitted through this consulate.    [Reporter] Do you think this incident has harmed relations  between the two countries in the border area?    [Prada] I do not think so. We are promoting  Colombian-Venezuelan integration. The Colombian foreign minister  will refer to the incident this week. As far as our relations  are concerned, they will remain normal as they have until now.    [Reporter] Is the climate around your office the same? Have  you perceived any deterioration in the climate in Guasdualito?    [Prada] None at all.</p>

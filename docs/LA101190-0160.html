			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT TO OPEN COURT FOR TRAFFIC TICKETS;  </P> <P> JUDICIAL: THE BRANCH OF COMPTON MUNICIPAL COURT IS BEING ESTABLISHED TO EASE  OVERCROWDING AT THAT FACILITY.  </P> <P> Paramount will open a branch of Compton Municipal Court in a shopping mall in  January to speed the handling of traffic violations.  </P> <P> The court branch will be in response to complaints from residents about long  waits and crime in Compton. The branch will be housed in the Paramount Plaza  Shopping Center.  </P> <P> Compton Municipal Court is part of a statewide system handling civil, criminal  and traffic cases. At the criminal level, misdemeanors are tried and  preliminary hearings are conducted to determine whether defendants charged with  felonies should stand trial in Superior Court.  </P> <P> Compton's judicial district includes Carson, Lynwood, Paramount and other  Southeast areas of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> For several years Paramount residents have lobbied for a break with Compton  Municipal Court, saying its caseload is backlogged and the area around the  courthouse is unsafe. They have asked that Paramount residents be allowed to  use another court, such as Los Cerritos Court in nearby Bellflower, or to build  a courthouse addition to the Compton system in Paramount.  </P> <P> One of the residents, Daisy Majak, said the Compton system is so overwhelmed  that many Paramount cases, especially those involving minor offenses, "never go  to trial."  </P> <P> Resident Leona Stahovich agreed: "With their (Compton's) murders, rapes and  robberies and our tenant evictions, bad checks and traffic, our problems are  insignificant compared to their caseload."  </P> <P> Although Steven A. Sowders, head deputy district attorney for Compton, admitted  that the high volume leads to more plea-bargaining in drug and nonviolent  cases, he said this was typical for a busy courthouse.  </P> <P> "It is the second-busiest courthouse in the county," Sowders said, "following  only downtown Los Angeles. . . . The case backlog is a fact of life and goes on  everywhere. It is more acute in crowded courthouses."  </P> <P> The solution, he added, was building more courthouses.  </P> <P> Paramount residents said they are afraid of being in Compton. Majak said: "I am  not an easily intimidated person. When I go to Compton court, I fear for my  life."  </P> <P> But Paramount officials said an overcrowded caseload and not crime in Compton  was behind the decision to open a storefront courthouse.  </P> <P> Officials said fear or crime is exaggerated.  </P> <P> In the last six months, 10 crimes were reported in the Compton courthouse and  parking lots, eight of them involving people trying to bring weapons into the  building, said Lt. Clifford Green of the Los Angeles County Safety Police  Division. The metal detectors sounded and the suspects were arrested.  </P> <P> The other two incidents were reports of car break-ins in the parking lot, Green  added.  </P> <P> The Safety Division is an agency independent of the Sheriff's Department that  oversees security at all courthouses in the county.  </P> <P> Green said Compton's "is perhaps one of the best secured courthouses in the  county" and added: "You are relatively safe inside the building. What's  happening outside is just like any other area. There's no difference between  Compton and South Central, Long Beach and Paramount."  </P> <P> Compton Council Member Maxcy D. Filer agreed: "There's crime in every city.  Crime doesn't stop at Paramount's corner or at Compton's corner."  </P> <P> The storefront courthouse is expected to cost Paramount $15,000 to $20,000,  according to Patrick West, Paramount's deputy city manager. The county will  provide and pay for the staff.  </P> <P> Revenues from a traffic school in the courthouse will be shared by the school,  the city and the shopping center landlord.  </P> <P> Some residents would prefer to use the Municipal Court in Bellflower. Of the  six communities served by the Lakewood sheriff's substation, Paramount is the  only one in Compton's district. Bellflower, Lakewood, Cerritos, Hawaiian  Gardens and Artesia are all served by the Los Cerritos court in Bellflower.  </P> <P> West said Paramount officials asked the county to move their cases to the  Bellflower court several years ago; the request was denied.  </P> <P> Some residents hope that the new branch of Compton Municipal Court will  eventually handle criminal cases as well as traffic violations.  </P> <P> Resident Jenny Lacayo said: "Anything is an improvement. I hope it (the  storefront court) grows, possibly expands. . . . Who knows? Maybe someday we  can have our own court."  </P></p>

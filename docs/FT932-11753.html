A cross-party committee of MPs could examine potential trustees to see if they were suitable. The paper emphasises that the central issue is the BBC's independence must be strengthened, and that politicians must not be allowed to control it. Labour also proposes a new viewers' and listeners' council to provide a more direct voice for licence-fee payers.

Output  value of products for civilian use turned out by all military  industrial enterprises in the province approached 1.5 billion  yuan, accounting for 75.2 percent of the total output value of  these enterprises, or an increase of 12 percent over that of the  previous year. Output value of products for civilian use turned  out by aeronautics and astronautics industrial enterprises in  the province accounted for 97 percent of their total output  value. This enable these enterprises to change deficits into  profits. In the transfer process, aeronautics and astronautics  industrial enterprises took full advantage of their numerous  talents and technologies to develop products for civilian use  and readjust their product structure in line with the principles  of having a high starting point, high standards, high quality,  and high added value, thus initially giving rise to a number of  enterprises that combine the production of military products  with the production of civilian products. Last year, relatively  good progress was made in the project of producing 70,000  mini-buses annually by Harbin Airplane Manufacturing Company as  jointly planned by the province and Harbin city. In the first  half of this year, various production lines of this company will  be put sequentially under test operation and production. Thus  far, civilian products turned out by Harbin Airplane  Manufacturing Company and (Dongan) Engine Manufacturing Company  have accounted for 98 percent and 94 percent of their total  respectively. The follow-up projects transferred to produce  civilian products have also been linked in a relatively good  manner. Sixteen projects, including the heavy-duty vehicles for  desert use, engineering machines, and tank trucks, have been put  under construction respectively, and some 190 million yuan of  funds have been put in place.    New headway has also been made in popularizing new  technologies for producing civilian products. Twenty-five new  civilian products, including the 20-foot container self-loading  and self-unloading trailer and high-energy igniting coil, passed  appraisal last year to gain some 20 million yuan in value. Last  year, military industrial enterprises also positively supported  the development of tertiary industry and opened their tertiary  industrial enterprises to the public. Last year, all military  industrial enterprises in the province built 400 new enterprises  oriented to developing tertiary industry, and 6,700 workers were  hired. Most of the guest rooms, hospitals, special railway  lines, and unused warehouses and plant houses of these  enterprises have been oriented to the market and been open to  the public on a paid basis. There has been a good situation of  equally promoting commerce, service, and communications in the  military industrial enterprises, and of vigorously developing  the tertiary industry.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westpac running out of time to get its act together - The difficulties still facing the troubled Australian bank after the latest upheavals WESTPAC, Australia's biggest bank, is not known for its sense of irony. But there must have been a few wry grins in the bank's Sydney headquarters on Wednesday when National Australia Bank (NAB) announced it had completed precautionary checks on the books of Bank of New Zealand. The announcement confirmed NAB will proceed with its proposed NZDollars 1.48bn (Dollars 796m) acquisition of BNZ, which will propel it past Westpac as Australia's biggest bank in terms of global assets. Westpac directors, meanwhile, were wondering how many of them would have to fall on their swords to satisfy the markets' lust for boardroom blood. Westpac has a special place in Australian banking history as the country's oldest bank. But it has paid a heavier price than the other leading banks for the ill-considered dash for growth in which they indulged in the mid to late 1980s. Westpac's problems came to a head in May, when it wrote off ADollars 2.65bn (Dollars 1.91bn) against bad debts, of which ADollars 2.1bn reflected a revaluation of its ADollars 6.3bn property portfolio. The write-offs left the bank with pre-tax losses of ADollars 2.2bn for the six months to March, compared with profits of ADollars 313m a year earlier. Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, expected the substantial write-off to ease investors' fears about Westpac's exposure to corporate failures and the weak property market. At the same time, Mr Conroy sought to strengthen the bank's balance sheet by raising ADollars 1.2bn through a 3-for-10 rights issue at ADollars 3 per share. However, the rights issue merely compounded Westpac's difficulties. Executives watched in horror as the bank's share price slid from ADollars 3.87 on the day it was announced to ADollars 2.99 on the day it closed. Not surprisingly, the issue fell ADollars 880m short of target after investors took up rights to only 111m of 405m shares on offer, leaving CS First Boston and its sub-underwriters to take up the shortfall. On a wider front, Westpac has been taking a public relations beating as Australian newspapers and television stations have relentlessly pursued allegations of fraud by bank officials in connection with a controversial foreign exchange loans scheme which left many borrowers heavily indebted after the Australian dollar collapsed in the late 1980s. Westpac strongly denies criminal activity by any of its staff in relation to foreign loans. But the bank has also been identified by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption as one of a number of banks and insurance companies which illegally trafficked in confidential government information on customers. Against this background, Mr Conroy admitted earlier this week that the bank was aware of concern among institutional investors about the composition of the board. But until mid-morning yesterday, both Mr Conroy and Sir Eric Neal, chairman, resolutely refused to say whether resignations could be expected. Sir Eric, deputy chairman since 1987 and chairman since 1990, was the main target for a dissident shareholders' group led by Mr Gavin Solomon, a Sydney solicitor, which has gained credibility as Westpac's problems have worsened. The group also sought the departure of Sir Neil Currie, a director since 1987 and deputy chairman since 1991, and several other long-serving directors. However, there was no pressure for the departure of Mr Conroy. In the event, the board surprised the markets by announcing the resignation of five directors, a third of the total, including both Sir Eric and Sir Neil. Westpac shares rose 1 cent on the announcement, to close at ADollars 2.86. However, few observers expect a significant improvement in the short term because of the large volume of shares overhanging the market and continuing worries about the bank's exposure to the deteriorating commercial property market. Mr Conroy has forecast improved profits in the second half, and conceded that the markets will need to see at least three successive good half-year results from Westpac before the crisis of confidence in the bank can be said to be over. However, analysts say there is still a chance that Westpac may be forced into further large write-offs. Mr Scott Hawker, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in Sydney, says: 'There is a view emerging that while Westpac was conservative in May when it made those big write-offs, market conditions have undoubtedly deteriorated since then. 'There is at least a chance (of further major write-offs) because they will look very bad, having said they have taken all the pain, if ANZ or another bank comes out with further write-offs. At the least, Westpac's solid level of provisioning will have to continue. There is little room for them to cut back.' Mr John Uhrig, who replaces Sir Eric as chairman, had little to say about future strategy yesterday, preferring to concentrate his fire on the media, which many Westpac officials blame for precipitating the crisis. Mr Uhrig also had no answer to awkward questions about why other long-serving directors were remaining on the board. However, Mr Uhrig has built a solid reputation as chairman of CRA, the largely British-owned mining group, and the consensus among analysts was that he and Mr Conroy should be able to convince investors that enough blood has been shed to demonstrate the board's contrition for past mistakes. That will not be good enough for Mr Solomon, who made clear that he would continue his campaign for a vote on the continued incumbency of all directors at the next annual meeting, due in January. However, he is unlikely to persuade the institutions who own most of Westpac's shares to support a further upheaval. The only other bright spot for Westpac is that federal government regulations prevent any other financial institution mounting a takeover attempt to take advantage of its weakness. But that will change if, as expected, the conservative opposition parties win the next federal election, due by mid-1993. If that happens, NAB may be sorely tempted to double its asset base by bidding for its erstwhile big brother. Which gives Westpac about a year to get its house in order.</p>

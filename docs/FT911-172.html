			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Discontinued activities behind loss at Cronite LOSSES arising from discontinued businesses, two of which were placed into administrative receivership, resulted in Cronite Group, the Birmingham-based industrial holding company, plunging into loss at the interim stage. For the six months to March 31, the group posted a loss before tax of Pounds 2.21m compared with a previous profit of Pounds 781,000. The deficit stemmed from a trading loss of Pounds 1.88m at four businesses which the group has discontinued. Cronite Alloys, which recycles stainless steel, and Abtex, which makes fire extinguishers, were placed into administrative receivership at the request of the company. The move came after it emerged that Alloys had a shortfall in expected income of about Pounds 400,000 while the value of certain of its stocks had been overstated in management accounts. The group also decided that Abtex, where it discovered thefts approaching Pounds 1m, could not be returned to profitability without greater financial resources than it had envisaged. Mr Jim Butler, chairman, said efforts were being concentrated on a capital reconstruction programme for which the group hoped to come up with proposals by the year end. The other businesses being discontinued were Hy Tech Machining and North American Cronite. Trading profits of the businesses being continued, which include Cronite Castings and Atkinson, a manufacturer of fabrications, fell to Pounds 327,000 (Pounds 1.48m) with the group being hit by difficult conditions in the UK and the high value of sterling which hindered exports. Turnover amounting to Pounds 22.57m comprised Pounds 11.94m from continued businesses and Pounds 10.64m from discontinued operations.</p>

During an informal meeting with foreign  journalists he said the Colombian Government does not welcome  the fight between the prosecutor general and U.S. Attorney  General Janet Reno.    Attorney General Arrieta rejected what the prosecutor  general  said in what represents a struggle for power that goes beyond  Colombia's borders. In the meeting Arrieta said that the  Colombian Government does not agree with the prosecutor  general's position or academic views concerning his U.S.  counterpart, Janet Reno.    Nevertheless, he said Reno's noncompromising attitude  encourages solidarity with the prosecutor general, which was not  advisable for the Colombian Government because it is concerned  that this fight obstructs the surrender process.    Immediately after the meeting an ASSOCIATED PRESS report  said: Arrieta stated his concern that drug traffickers might  fish in troubled waters if the confrontation continues.</p>

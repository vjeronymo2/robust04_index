			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Elections in Russia: Tatars resist Moscow's brand of democracy - Tatarstan adopted its own constitution a year ago and rejects Russia's attempts at centralised control The Republic of Tatarstan is at the centre of the debate within Russia on the form of its new constitution. The constitution, which will be voted on by referendum on Sunday, at the same time as the parliamentary elections, is of as much import as the parliament itself, and designed to last much longer. Tatarstan - the historic home of the Tatars, who in the Middle Ages controlled much of European Russia - adopted its own constitution a little over a year ago. This proclaims the republic as 'sovereign', deigning to say, once, that it is 'associated' with Russia. Professor Vadim Tumanov, a senior member of the Institute of State and Law and one of the experts who helped to draw up the present draft Russian constitution, says that Tatarstan's constitution breaches international norms for a federal state in two important ways. First, by giving Tatars citizenship of Russia but refusing reciprocal citizenship to Russians, he said, and second, by accepting only those Russian laws which are approved by its own parliament. A long period of sporadic negotiations followed the adoption of this essentially separatist document, but left the main constitutional problems untouched. Then came the banning of the Russian parliament in September, and the suppression of its revolt on October 3 and 4. 'Yeltsin could have turned to the regions and republics for support and agreement. Instead, he chose to issue a centralist constitution for a unitary state. The people about him call themselves democrats but their attitude to the regions reveals their true nature,' says Mr Vassily Likhachev, the vice-president of Tatarstan, who was in Moscow recently. Tatarstan's president, Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, himself went to Moscow on November 3 to try to gain some constitutional compromises, but was rebuffed. However, the Tatar authorities are cautious men, schooled in the politics of the Communist party - in which nearly all of them were leading figures - which emphasises above all the necessity to recognise power when they see it. Theirs is the route of sullen, not overt, opposition - certainly not that taken by the other extreme dissenter from Russian statehood, Chechnya, where President Dzhokar Dudayev has banned both elections and the referendum on his territory. Instead, Mr Shamiyev has said he will not vote: Mr Likhachev will be on holiday; and the mayor of Kazan, Mr Kamil Iskhakov - tipped to be the next Tatar prime minister - 'doubts' he will vote. Thus the election preparations take place in something of a vacuum. The authorities are keen to point out the apathy and lack of interest. Among those standing in single-member constituencies or on party lists for the State Duma, or lower house, are those who have carried on the rather isolated business of opposing Tatarstan's drive to 'sovereignty' over the past three years. They work in a rather threatening atmosphere. Mr Dmitri Fomin, a candidate in the industrial centre of Naberezhnye Chelny, shows a leaflet. It is put out by the 'Special Headquarters against the Russian Referendum', which threatens 'the fate of traitors and provocateurs' to all those - candidates, election officers and voters - who take part in the referendum. The newspaper of the 'Sovereignty' bloc of nationalist parties says that to take part in the elections 'is a betrayal of the state interests of our fatherland'. President Shamiyev and his fellow leaders are convinced that the feeling of pride in and support for Tatarstan's sovereignty has increased, not lessened  -though the republic's 4m population numbers only a few more Tatars than Russians, and inter-marriage is very common. Mr Iskhakov, the Kazan mayor, says that people rejoice in their citizenship because of the chaos and wild prices they see in Russia. The leaders bridle when it is suggested that they are going slow on economic reform: Mr Shamiyev insists that 'the steady way to reform has proven itself here, as shock therapy has been shown to fail in Russia'. Privatisation is going ahead (though not yet of shops and small businesses): the republic's most precious property, the Tatneft oil corporation which produces some 22m tonnes of oil a year, is now being privatised - though a controlling golden share, will stay with the government. 'We say to all serious investors - come and talk to us, we will do a deal,' says Mr Marat Almukhametev, a department head at the State Property Committee offices 'But they must be serious. What's the point of selling off to speculators and crooks, like they are doing in Russia. Why repeat their mistakes?' The impression is of a leadership which may indeed avoid some of the more egregious mistakes of reform, but which is attempting to hold back the tide. The turnout for the elections and the referendum probably will be low: it was little over 20 per cent for the referendum in April, when the country voted on trust in the Russian president. This will allow the republic's leadership to point to a large majority of abstentions from the Russian political process, which they will use to bolster their own power.</p>

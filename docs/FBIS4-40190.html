			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed feature under the "At First Hand" rubric: "Is </F> There Opposition Within the Defense Ministry?"]    [Text] In recent months a number of publications have used  various conversations behind the scenes or in the corridors of  power, chance details, and sometimes even outright rumor and  gossip to constantly raise the subject of official and personal  relationships in the top military leadership. Conclusions have  been drawn about the alleged existence of serious differences  between the defense minister, his deputies, and other members of  the Russian Defense Ministry Collegium. From time to time  either one general or another will be dubbed an open or secret  opposition figure by the press....    Well, official -- much less, personal -- relationships, and  at such high level, are a very delicate matter. It has always  been considered inappropriate to make certain aspects of them  public. But since things are now reaching the point where this  problem is being intensively given essentially political  overtones, we need nonetheless to make things clear.    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Editorial Office asked a number of  Defense Ministry leaders and members of the Defense Ministry  Collegium to answer the following questions:    1. How do you assess the current state of official and  personal relationships among the leading staff of the Armed  Forces, and the atmosphere at Defense Ministry Collegium  sessions and in general when highly important decisions on  issues of the Armed Forces' life and activity are being made?    2. What is your attitude to articles -- including those  about you personally -- which claim that relations within the  Armed Forces are now complex and contradictory, and that there  is a kind of split and an interpersonal struggle under way?    Andrey Kokoshin, first deputy defense minister:    1-2. There is a businesslike, constructive relationship  within the Defense Ministry leadership. Not least I can note  with satisfaction the equable, comradely relations with Army  General P.S. Grachev, defense minister.    Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed  Forces  General Staff and first deputy defense minister:    1. I cannot say what official and personal relationships  within the Defense Ministry leading staff were like in years  gone by. But I can state with complete authority that the  current atmosphere at the Defense Ministry can be expressed in  two words -- "working condition." Let me explain what I mean by  this. The most important decisions on the issues of Armed  Forces reform and their activity and everyday life are not at  all reached in secret or behind the scenes -- as is sometimes  claimed in the mass media. Also groundless are the claims that  all the recent decisions on Armed Forces reform have been  unexpected and have come out of the blue for most Defense  Ministry leaders.    In confirmation of that I would cite a very recent incident.  Literally the other day we were reporting our proposals to the  defense minister on optimizing the organizational and staffing  structure of the Armed Forces' central apparatus. In  particular, this report clarified the list of posts taking  account of existing realities. The preparatory work was done  with the involvement of the commanders in chief of the branches  of service, commanders of combat arms, and so forth. There were  no behind-the-scenes games or intrigues. A representative of  the Russian Federation Presidential Staff also took part in the  work. This is important too -- it is yet more evidence of the  growing civil control over the Armed Forces' activity.    A detailed report was made, analyzing why a certain decision  was being made. The defense minister supported our proposals.  Incidentally, as part of my job as chief of the General Staff I  report to the minister highly important documents prepared by  the General Staff. Some 95 percent of these documents -- maybe  an even higher percentage -- are adopted on first submission.  This too, I think, is typical of the level of working relations  within the Defense Ministry. And it is nothing to do with me  personally. It is a question of the prestige of the General  Staff, which has highly professional officers and generals  working for it. It is thanks to their supreme responsibility!  For some reason I find it easy talking with my boss, the  defense minister.    As for Defense Ministry Collegium sessions -- first and  foremost, I should mention the openness between Collegium  members. There are plenty of examples of issues being worked out  at deputy minister or branch of service commander in chief level  and then being reported to the Collegium as an initiative. I do  not recall a single instance when the minister rejected our  proposals.    2. I think that it is clear from my response to the first  question that the press reports to the effect that people in the  Defense Ministry take no account of the opinion of the chief of  the General Staff are without any real foundation. I consider  such articles an attempt to split the leading staff of the Armed  Forces. What is the objective? It is, I think, to create a  climate of distrust between us and, as a result, to get us  involved in a political struggle on the side of various forces.  Just look at what these articles are about.... They alleged  that First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin  had "not become part of the military collective." That "Afghan"  generals oppose the others and, moreover, that there is fierce  confrontation between certain groupings within the Defense  Ministry. But what is typical is that nobody knows about such  groupings -- they simply do not exist.    Now to the rumors which are also being put about in the  press  claiming that there is a strained relationship between the  defense minister and the chief of the General Staff. All lies!  Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev and I are not personal friends, but  we have a good working relationship. And that is the most  important thing when it comes to doing to the job.    Colonel General Boris Gromov, deputy defense minister:    1. There has indeed been some talk of late about serious  differences among the Russian Armed Forces leadership. What can  I say? To my mind, relations between the defense minister, his  deputies, and the commanders in chief -- in other words, the  Collegium members -- are now just the way they should be.  Businesslike and calm. All our complex problems -- and we have  no easy ones -- are being resolved.    As a rule, everyone gets to speak at Collegium sessions. As  far as I am concerned, I express my opinion to the extent I  consider necessary. There are no restrictions here. I think  that this will be confirmed by the fact that there is always an  atmosphere at the sessions that makes it possible to discuss and  resolve any issues calmly and professionally. The defense  minister's attitude to all Collegium members is very equable,  businesslike, and -- I would particularly like to emphasize this  -- respectful. This too, you will understand, makes it possible  for everyone to say what they consider needs saying and to  discuss important problems without any reservations -- just as  their experience and their own assessments of the state of  affairs prompt them to.    All the more so as I have things to recall. As commander of  Kiev Military District, I had to attend the USSR Defense  Ministry Collegium. When I was appointed first deputy defense  minister, I naturally took part in the work of the Union MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Collegium. The atmosphere at our  sessions, if compared with those days, is considerably more  democratic. And there are simply no advance instructions or any  kind of pressure about how to speak or what to say.    It is logical to ask whether this happens outside the  auditorium. We have normal relationships which allow us -- both  individually and jointly -- to carry out our official duties  normally. In short, there is nothing between Collegium members  of the kind that has been reported in the mass media -- no  hostility and no covert opposition to the minister.    2. There have been lots of articles about me, and, clearly,  there will continue to be. I try not to comment on them. I  think that anyone with a definite experience of life, a man of  dignity and honor, and a man of some humor must ultimately take  that attitude to articles about him personally. It is another  matter when state interests are affected. I recall that I won a  court case when Colonel Vilen Martirosyan, my colleague in the  former Union corps of deputies and now a "genuine Ukrainian,"  called me a possible military dictator in a Kiev newspaper in  1990.    If you take other articles, also written, as a rule, on the  basis of rumor (I consider that articles about relationships  within the Russian Federation Defense Ministry fall into  precisely this category), then, of course, you would like to  respond, not least in the press. But refuting fabrications and  rumors is an ignoble task, and sometimes unnecessary.  Nonetheless, the "bearers of the truth" cannot be dissuaded.  They will continue their petty intrigues. One thing is  reassuring -- there are far fewer of these people than there are  of those who understand the position of the person talking or  writing. And time will sort everything out.    Army General Konstantin Kobets, Russian Federation chief  military inspector and deputy defense minister:    1. I would like to note straightaway that there has never  been an instance when the Defense Ministry Collegium failed to  reach any decision unanimously. Of course, there are disputed  points. We receive in advance all the issues which it is  planned to examine at the Collegium, and, naturally, we study  them carefully. The opinions of the deputy ministers and  commanders in chief are always taken into account. I repeat --  always! If we fail to reach a unified decision, a working group  of experts from all Armed Forces branches of services has to be  set up. All the "pros" and "cons" are taken into account. And  only after this is the matter put to the Collegium session.    Respecting a different opinion is a typical feature of the  defense minister's and one that I would particularly note. And  this has become the rule for our relations at Collegium  sessions. But if a decision is made, it has to be implemented.  There can be no excuses or reservations about it.    On the whole, I believe that the Defense Ministry in its  work  professes the following main principle: We are all in the same  boat and we are all working to the "commander's plan" -- that  person being the supreme commander in chief or the defense  minister, depending on the importance of the issue. But I would  also like to say something about personal relationships. Our  families often meet up outside of work -- on holidays, for  instance. I think that this says a lot too.    2. Articles about allegedly strained relations between  Defense Ministry leaders primarily surprise me rather than  evoking hostility. Because there is not a grain of truth in  them. Where does all this gossip come from? So I would say to  journalists -- don't use random, unchecked information. Don't  cheat your readers!    Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of the  Ground Forces:    1. It would be wrong to say that each member of the Defense  Ministry Collegium cannot have his own opinion. After all, we  prepare in advance for the discussion of the matters at issue,  and we prepare seriously. It is normal that everyone should  have their own opinion. I think that the defense minister is  quite right to listen to his deputies and commanders in chief.  I do not recall his ever saying "That's enough!" to someone,  even if he disagrees with him. Or that he takes the view that  he has formed his own opinion and that yours does not interest  him.... All proposals are listened to attentively.    I am sure that the atmosphere at the Collegium should be  like  this. It is all the more absurd to claim that if some Collegium  member has his own view of a specific problem, he becomes an  opponent of the minister or, moreover, moves into opposition....  We have a normal working atmosphere. I personally do not know  of any overt or covert opposition. So why are there constantly  articles in the press about this? So as to set us Collegium  members against each other? To sow distrust among us? A lack  of trust in the minister on our part, and in us on his.  Incidentally, one thing is absolutely clear. All such articles  are aimed one way or the other at creating an unhealthy  atmosphere around the Armed Forces.    The fact that once the Collegium has adopted a decision, the  decree needs to be strictly monitored is another matter. We  have been insufficiently demanding in this area [imenno zdes u  nas prinizhen spros]. Clearly, that is the fault of the  Collegium secretary, who has failed to provide timely  information to the minister, and it is our fault -- us Collegium  members. Previously adopted decisions can be forgotten about  amid our ongoing work. That is something that should be  criticized.    2. My opinion is this. Criticism of the Army has entered a  new phase, if I can put it that way. In the Gorbachev era  attacks were sanctioned from on high so as to ensure that the  people had no doubt about the Union leadership's attitude toward  the Armed Forces. And the USSR president himself set the tone.  The people, as a result, started to lose faith in the Army's  prestige. False premises typical of Gorbachev (talking, for  instance, about cutting back some divisions, he sometimes tried  to add: "I've taken the trough away from a few generals") were  picked up on from below. Everyone knows what this led to.    Now, in my view, the attacks on the Armed Forces are  connected with attempts by various political forces and parties  to sow discord among the Defense Ministry leadership and to  pressure the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Collegium and  assert their own influence in military circles. Everyone knows  that in our difficult time the Armed Forces are the only stable  organism in the state. The Army can do a very great deal to  strengthen Russian statehood. But certain politicians are  simply uninterested in this. For them one slogan is acceptable  -- the worse, the better. That is where the current criticism  comes from. All kinds of rumors and fables get into the press  by whatever means. For instance, I was struck by an article in  KOMMERSANT-DAILY to the effect that Semenov is in opposition to  the defense minister. But what is typical is that nobody,  including the writer, could explain where this information came  form. "Somebody told me, I heard it somewhere" -- those are not  arguments. That is why I have the reaction to these articles  that I have.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: On a flight of fruity fancy Sir, Dr Michael McGannon, in his article on avoiding jet-lag (Management, February 19), is no doubt scientifically correct, but I have a simpler solution. I order a fruit diet. The day before the flight I eat a lot of vegetables. On the flight I eat nothing but fruit (despite the additions they put on my tray) and drink nothing but fruit juices or water or weak black tea. On arrival, I am not at all tired. I am talking about long flights. Next day I eat less than usual and am ready for anything. My daughter once didn't like the meals and just drank fruit juice. She was amazed how well she felt on arrival. Sarah Myint, 52 Windsor Terrace, South Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE3 1YL</p>

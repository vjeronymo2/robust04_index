			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MULTIPLE-AIRPORT STUDY IS SCRAPPED FOR NOW;  </P> <P> AVIATION: SANDAG COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW JOINT MILITARY-CIVILIAN USE OF MIRAMAR  NAVAL AIR STATION INSTEAD.  </P> <P> The San Diego Assn. of Governments declined Friday to commission a $400,000  study of a "multiple airport" solution for crowded Lindbergh Field, returning  the issue to subcommittees for reconsideration.  </P> <P> Sandag's board of directors also added a wrinkle to the continuing attempt to  relocate the airport when it instructed the committees to consider another  alternative, the joint military-civilian use of Miramar Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> The instructions came after six South Bay officials asked that the joint-use  option "be seriously studied" by the Sandag committee investigating the best  location for a new airport.  </P> <P> "It's something that has been looked at, in my opinion, in a very cursory way  in the past," said Chula Vista Mayor Greg Cox, a Sandag board member.  </P> <P> Earlier in its yearlong study, the committee ruled out joint military-civilian  use of Miramar because airspace above the sprawling Navy base would be  congested and speed differences between military and civilian aircraft might  pose a hazard, said Jack Koerper, Sandag's special projects director.  </P> <P> The committee has narrowed relocation options to sole civilian use of Miramar,  a new facility on land east of Miramar and a binational airport on Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> However, joint use could be reconsidered on the assumption that Lindbergh would  remain open, reducing the demand on Miramar, Koerper said Friday.  </P> <P> The six politicians believe that joint use at Miramar was never given serious  consideration because of political problems posed by the Navy, which is opposed  to any civilian use of Miramar.  </P> <P> In what amounted to a declaration of the political will to take on the Navy,  the politicians stated in their letter to Sandag that "a realistic solution  requires -- at minimum -- full consideration of NAS Miramar."  </P> <P> The letter was signed by U.S. Rep. Jim Bates, D-San Diego; State Sen. Wadie  Deddeh, D-Bonita; State Rep. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista; San Diego City  Councilman Bob Filner; County Supervisor Brian Bilbray and Cox. Also signing  the letter was Tom Carroll of the Airline Pilots Assn.  </P> <P> Cmdr. Douglas Mann, an advisory Sandag member, repeated Friday that the Navy  opposes joint use of Miramar under any circumstances.  </P> <P> Filner and fellow Councilman Ron Roberts also have called for study of a  "multiple airport" option that would parcel out among four airports the 35  million passengers expected here by next century. As envisioned, the major  facilities would be at Lindbergh and at an expanded Brown Field in the South  Bay, with Montgomery Field and McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad picking up  commuter traffic.  </P> <P> Sandag's Airport Advisory Policy Committee on Thursday had agreed to examine  the option, a process that would have added $400,000 and another year to the  relocation study, which already has lasted a year.  </P> <P> However, Filner complained that the criteria built into the study would result  in its automatic rejection, a point repeated Friday by the city's  representative to Sandag, Councilman Ed Struiksma.  </P> <P> At Struiksma's urging, the matter was returned to the two subcommittees for  further consideration.  </P></p>

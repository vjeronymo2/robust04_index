			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts fall as traders switch into bunds UK government bond prices fell almost 2 points yesterday after investors switched out of gilts into bunds. One trader attributed the volatility to the thin volume of trading. The December long gilt future fell 1 31/32 to around 100 15/32 in late trading, and the spread over bunds widened out to about 123, from 105 in the morning. There were market rumours that US hedge funds had placed large sell orders yesterday. Talk that gilts had fallen on increased worries over inflation after prime minister Mr John Major had promised tax cuts was dismissed. US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as the dollar bounced back from Wednesday's lows. Late in the session the 30-year government bond was down 3/16 at 95 15/32 , yielding 7.842 per cent. The two-year note rose  1/32 to 99 19/32 , yielding 7.707 per cent. Data released by the Commerce Department showed the index of leading economic indicators up 0.3 per cent for November, slightly over most economists' projections. Bond prices received some support from a rising dollar, which bounced back from Wednesday's lows against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen. German government bonds slipped in line with Treasuries, and the March bund futures contract on Liffe fell by around 0.96 on the day to 88.79 in late trading.</p>

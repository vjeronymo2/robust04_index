			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has acknowledged it  was Israel's objection that led senior PLO official Nabil Sha'th  to put off his visit to Jerusalem. Appearing before the Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Peres said Israel would  not negotiate with the Palestinians on the next stage until it  was sure that the Gaza-Jericho arrangement is working. As David  Ze'ev reports from the Knesset, the meeting was dominated by a  bitter verbal clash between the foreign minister and the Likud's  Beni Begin.    [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] The talk at the Foreign Affairs  and Defense Committee was not infighting within Labor, but a  bitter confrontation between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and  Likud committee member Beni Begin. On the heels of the recent  disclosure of the letter written by the foreign minister on  Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem, Begin said it was not the  only time Peres had hidden the facts, and the Likud Knesset  member accused the foreign minister of purposely deceiving the  Knesset. Peres retorted: First you carry out terrorism in the  Knesset plenum, now you want to do it in the committee. Begin  called Peres a big talker. Peres later called Begin a  professional slanderer. And so the personal insults went on and  on. A Knesset official at the closed meeting who relayed the  dialogue said most committee members were in a state of shock  and that Foreign Minister Peres commented at the end of the  meeting that he was shocked, saying this kind of meeting is  unprecedented.    On more mundane affairs, Peres acknowledged to reporters  later that Israel's objection was the reason senior PLO official  Nabil Sha'th was not visiting Jerusalem though Peres would not  elaborate on whether Israel would stop Chairman Yasir 'Arafat  from coming to the city.    [Peres] I am content with the decision of Nabil Sha'th. We  were not approached by 'Arafat, so there is no need to take any  steps.    [Ze'ev] Peres confirmed that Israel wants to ensure that the  Gaza-Jericho arrangement with the Palestinians is working first  before negotiations start on the next stage. On Syria, the  foreign minister said the delay of the trip to the region by  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher did not mean that the  negotiations have stopped or failed.    [Peres] I think that the secretary feels that he should have  more meat in his basket from the Syrian side before he makes the  next move, so it takes another few weeks, but by no means can  one conclude that the negotiations have stopped or failed.    [Ze'ev] They go on, he said. In every negotiation you have  the ups and downs, and even interruptions. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Likud, NRP [National Religious Party], Tzomet,  and YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel] have submitted  motions of no confidence in the government that will be debated  by the Knesset on 2 May.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the Likud explains  its motion by what it terms the government's inability to  protect the state's vital interests and to conduct negotiations  wisely and responsibly.    The joint no-confidence motion of Tzomet and the NRP cites  what it terms the government's inadequate struggle against  terror.    The YI'UD's motion of no confidence was instigated by the  prime minister's remarks on Golan settlements evacuation.    Coalition Chairman Eli Dayan has said in reaction that the  conduct of the opposition, which exploits terrorist attacks for  antigovernment incitement, reflects an absence of national  responsibility.</p>

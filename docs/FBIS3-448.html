Addressing a media conference, Mr Molefe said the ANC would  support the intensification of mass action in Bophuthatswana to  ensure free political activity. "Bophuthatswana should be  blockaded as a non-military step to force the homeland  government to stop political persecution," he said. "The ANC  election offices in the homeland were bombed on Monday as part  of the campaign of harassment against the organisation including  disruptions of voter education meetings."    Mr Molefe, the ANC premier nominee for the North Western  Region which includes Bophuthatswana, called on State President  F W de Klerk to act more firmly against the homeland and take  away its powers. He suggested steps to force the homeland to  allow political activity, including:     -  transitional executive council intervention;    -  the independent electoral commission erect polling booths in  the area;    -  blockading the homeland to prevent entry of South African  goods;    -  stopping the annual budget allocation to the homeland; and,    -  cutting financial loans to Bophuthatswana.       Mr Molefe said tourists should be discouraged from going to  the homeland, although he admitted the move would hurt the  economy and lead to a loss of jobs, but added it was more  important to stop tyranny.</p>

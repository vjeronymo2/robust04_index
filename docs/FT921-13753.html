			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Senior executives claimed to have no misgivings when headhunting meets psychological testing in the cause of finding the right candidate (1) Sir, The article, 'Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted'' (Tuesday, January 7), disturbs me because: it overstates the usefulness of psychological tests used in isolation; it misrepresents the small group of headhunters concerned with finding people for top jobs; it portrays headhunters and occupational psychologists as competitors rather than providers of complementary services. Using psychological tests as though they can 'scientifically' predict job success the way a tailor measures for a suit, fosters a false sense of scientific confidence. Tests have a place, but only as a small part of the assessment process. The paper reported a survey of 365 search consultancies. It must have spanned the good and the bad. Only about 20 headhunting firms can properly be described as operating at the most senior levels. Headhunters are reportedly reluctant to work with fully qualified occupational psychologists, because they fear losing control of the contract. This may be true of bad search consultants trying to pass off a weak candidate, but respectable search consultants know that satisfied clients return with repeat assignments. Headhunters and psychologists have complementary skills. Headhunters know how much the market is paying for people with specific skills, they can find out which managers are most favoured by their peers and they can sell new jobs to candidates who would not reply to advertised vacancies. Psychologists can make finer discriminations between candidates and companies. They can go further than saying 'this is a good candidate', and identify how a candidate would undertake the job and fit into the organisation. Recommendations from a psychologist's assessment include how the company can best support a candidate in terms of supervision, shifting the structure of the client company, or adjusting the specifics of the job to be filled in other ways.

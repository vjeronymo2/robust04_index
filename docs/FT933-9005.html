			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Hard questions for Germany THE INSISTENCE of the Bundesbank on acknowledging responsibility only for price stability in Germany, to the exclusion of wider European considerations, has led some commentators to ask whether Germany has now broken free of the double inhibition imposed on it as a nation-state by the second world war and the cold war, and must from now on be expected to prefer its national interests to those of Europe. The facts do not justify such an alarmist question. In matters monetary the Germans, and more especially the Bundesbank, have never been inhibited about putting national interests first. Their defence is that by weakening the D-Mark they would do no service to Europe. Better suspend or relax the ERM for a time than allow the European ship to drag its German anchor. As for the broader issues, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his government are clearly sincere in believing that the upset is only temporary, that Phase Two of monetary union can and must still start on January 1 next year with the creation of the European Monetary Institute, and that Phase Three, the single currency, can still happen in 1999, even if 1997 is now less likely. They remain adamant that the EMI must be located in Frankfurt, and that the single currency can be joined only by countries that meet the full Maastricht criteria. But there is nothing new about either of those demands. On the second there has even been a hint of greater flexibility from the Bundesbank president himself, who has remarked publicly that the figure of 60 per cent of GDP for government debt - which Belgium, in particular, would have great difficulty in meeting - is an arbitrary one. This suggests a genuine German desire that the Emu timetable remain feasible for at least a hard core of countries. Present discontents All such reasoning presupposes that the present discontents are essentially temporary, and that 'normality', in the sense of a fiscally responsible Germany whose central bank does not need to throttle back inflation with high interest rates, will soon be restored. The cuts in unemployment and social benefits on which the government agreed yesterday go some way to support that hypothesis. But they are not enough in themselves to answer the question. Is the ballooning of public expenditure caused by unification an aberration, or will it rather be the previous 30 years that come to be seen as historically exceptional: a period when the ambitions of the German state were contained by abnormal circumstances, and German strength could express itself only in the form of a large trade surplus and a strong currency? Responsibilities Quite apart from uncertainty about the time it will take to turn the east German economy round, Germany also faces expectations and responsibilities in central and eastern Europe which its elite will not wish to evade, but which its electorate will not wish to finance by any permanent lowering of their own material expectations. At the same time, Germany's ability to maintain its position as a leading world industrial power is by no means assured. The German ambassador in Italy and former head of the foreign ministry planning staff, Mr Konrad Seitz, has recently drawn attention to his country's backwardness, in comparison to the US and Japan, in developing the new industries born of the revolutions in information and genetic technology. (The point is valid, alas, not only for Germany but for Europe as a whole.) It is thus quite imaginable that Germany will not rapidly recover its fiscal balance, but will find itself saddled with a structural budget deficit for reasons similar, if on a smaller scale, to those that have afflicted the US. If that happens, either the Bundesbank will continue to maintain interest rates at a level which makes Phase Two of Maastricht unsustainable for other European economies with less inflationary pressure, or its hold on monetary policy will be broken by a revision of priorities in German society at large. Either way the Maastricht route to Emu, which in essence is a gradual agglutination of other currencies to a rock-solid D-Mark, would become untenable. A great deal hangs on the nature, as well as the timing, of the German recovery.</p>

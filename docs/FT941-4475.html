			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Bundesbank rate cut pledge The explosion in German money supply in January is not a fundamental obstacle to further cuts in German interest rates, senior Bundesbank officials said yesterday - remarks apparently designed to calm the nerves of unsteady financial markets. The Bundesbank would stick to its anti-inflation course, said Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank president, but this was not inconsistent with further falls in money market and capital market interest rates. Two other members of the Bundesbank council stressed that the 20.6 per cent increase in M3 broad money supply in January was an aberration and that the central bank would continue with its exceedingly cautious programme of interest rate cuts. The January M3 data, released last week, far exceeded economists' most pessimistic predictions and deeply unsettled financial markets despite the Bundesbank's explanation of the special factors that lay behind the strong rise.</p>

Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique last year  viciously incited confrontation between the North and the South  and tried to provoke a war, availing itself of the  anti-socialist moves of the international reactionaries to  stifle the DPRK, the author of the article says:    Upon the publication of the 10-point programme of the great  unity of the whole nation, we sent letters calling for  reunification in the 1990s through concerted efforts of the  nation to the authorities, representatives of the political  parties and organisations and personages of all strata of South  Korea. The South Korean puppets, however, did not convey the  letters to the addressees, totally froze North-South dialogues  which had continued during the preceding military dictatorship  and barred a North-South reunification soccer game and a  reunification concert.    The Kim Yong-sam group not only persistently opposed our  sincere offers for promoting national harmony and unity but also  resumed, in league with outside forces, the "Team Spirit"  nuclear war exercises which had been suspended toward the end of  the rule of the "sixth republic". After the "Team Spirit"  nuclear war exercises, it staged war manoeuvres such as  "Ssangyong", "Ulchi", "Ulchi Focus Lens", "Foal Eagle" and  "Hwarang" in succession.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam in combat uniform of the puppet  Army  frequented frontline units and fields of military drill near the  Military Demarcation Line, inciting confrontation and war.  Worse still, he flew to the United States and entreated his  masters to "exercise a powerful influence" and establish "an  international cooperation system," crying over "suspicion of  nuclear development" by the DPRK.    The whole nation clearly sees that with the traitor Kim  Yong-sam left alone, harmony and unity between the North and the  South cannot be achieved nor can peace and peaceful  reunification of the country be realised but nconfrontation and  war between the fellow countrymen will be inevitable.    The South Korean puppet clique will face a stern judgement  by  history and the people.</p>

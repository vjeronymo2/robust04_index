			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSIST REMOVED, MAKING TRIPLE-DOUBLE FROM QUADRUPLE-DOUBLE FOR OLAJUWON  </P> <P> Houston center Akeem Olajuwon will not be credited with a rare quadruple-double  in a game against Golden State, NBA vice president Rod Thorn ruled Monday.  </P> <P> Olajuwon, who had 29 points, 18 rebounds and 11 blocked shots in a 129-109  victory on Saturday, was originally credited with nine assists in the initial  postgame box score.  </P> <P> After members of the Rocket staff reviewed video tapes of the game, they  spotted what they thought was an uncredited assist for Olajuwon with less than  six minutes remaining in the first quarter on Buck Johnson's basket. The assist  total was changed to 10.  </P> <P> Thorn said after reviewing the footage of the play in question, an assist  should not have been awarded.  </P></p>

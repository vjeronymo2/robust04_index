			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Gulf war costs put at Pounds 2,345m MR Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons yesterday that the latest estimate of the additional military cost of the Gulf conflict, spread over several years, was Pounds 2,345m. By the end of March the Export Credits Guarantee Department had paid Pounds 499m of claims arising from the situation in the Gulf in 1990-91 and which had yet to be recovered. Mr Portillo said that a further Pounds 160m of claims on Iraq had yet to be examined, and other departments had incurred minor costs. The 'bulk of these costs' had been offset by the cash contributions from other governments totalling Pounds 2,049m.</p>

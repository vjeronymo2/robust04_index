			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Grachev's Threats Leveled Against Estonia Are </F> Completely Out of Line"]    [Text] It appears to be hard for Russian Minister of  Defense Pavel Grachev to remember that Estonia is once again an  independent nation and a member of the United Nations, the CSCE,  and the Council of Europe. Grachev is still prepared to threaten  to send additional troops to Estonia very quickly if "the  situation changes."    By a change in the situation Grachev apparently means a  possible worsening of the status of Russians living in Estonia  if the negotiations between the two countries end in a deadlock.  The threat of sending more troops may be intended as a last  resort. The chief way of stepping up the pressure appears to be  keeping the slightly less than 2,500 Russian soldiers who are  still in Estonia in that country until the problem of the status  of the retired Soviet Army officers is resolved.    Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has made an effort to appear  to be more conciliatory and denies that the two issues are  officially linked with one another. All the same, an unofficial  connection does exist. Nor is this the first time either that  Grachev has given voice to more hawklike interpretations of  Russian policy than Kozyrev or President Boris Yeltsin.  Unfortunately, in light of past experience, this does not give  us the right to underestimate the importance of the content of  the defense minister's statements. Grachev's stance just seems  to be getting firmer.    The threat Grachev leveled against Estonia "in passing" got  President Lennart Meri to cut short his trip abroad. Outwardly,  this seems to be an undue overdramatization of the situation,  but it also reflects the increasingly more tense atmosphere of  the negotiations between Estonia and Russia.    The Estonians are indignant with the West because it, along  with the leaders of the United States, Germany, Great Britain,  and Sweden, strongly pressured Latvia into accepting an  agreement negotiated with Russia, an agreement the signing of  which had been postponed on several occasions. The agreement  ensures that those Russian soldiers remaining in Latvia will be  repatriated by the end of August, but, in the opinion of the  Estonians, it contains completely unreasonable concessions to  Russia.    Latvia agreed to guarantee residence permits to over 20,000  retired former Soviet Army officers. They may also retain their  homes, but Russia will pay their pensions. For perfectly good  reasons, Estonia fears that Russia will demand that it consent  to a similar agreement. And worse yet, Estonia fears that the  West will assume the same position. In Estonia's opinion, this  is an impossible demand.    At least at this point, Estonia appears to be sticking to  its  guns. The negotiations have become practically deadlocked.  Estonia is relying on the fact that pressure from the West will  in any case force Russia to repatriate the remaining soldiers by  the target deadline, the end of August. Estonia is, of course,  right in maintaining that concessions cannot be required of it  to remove foreign troops from the country.    However, it may be assumed that Estonia takes a serious view  of the problems arising with regard to the status of the Russian  population residing in the country. Among them is the dispute  over the status of retired Russian officers. Russia must make  compromises with its demands, but Estonia too is going to have  to be willing to make some concessions. Inflexibility will only  stir up Moscow's hawks.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLEISCHMAN ON ABORTION  </P> <P> Fleischman cites test-tube babies as irrefutable proof that "life" begins the  moment an egg is fertilized, and that destroying a fertilized egg amounts to  killing a person. This, of course, is tantamount to calling every doctor a  killer when he discards those eggs fertilized in-vitro that are surplus and  therefore not used for implant.  </P> <P> The same shoddy logic -- cleverly disguised as a nonpartisan dissertation --  goes into the "circular reasoning" of using the conclusion of the argument as  its premise.  </P> <P> To top it all off, the author is identified not as the pro-life activist she  is, but as "an attorney with a special interest in reproduction issues as a  function of civil liberties and human rights."  </P> <P> Giving such prominent exposure -- even in the Opinion Section -- to this kind  of sophistry and implying that the author is a civil libertarian -- a term  associated with the pro-choice movement -- comes awfully close to willful  deception.  </P> <P> V.F.

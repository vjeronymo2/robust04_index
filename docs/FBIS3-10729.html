Figueroa commented: "I consider him a very important (U.S.)  Government official. I also believe his visit is a sign that  the U.S. Government favors the search for a significant  commercial relationship with Chile, either through a free trade  agreement or Chile's acceptance as a NAFTA member, which are,  precisely, the subjects we are going to discuss here with the  secretary."    Figueroa held a lengthy working meeting at the Diplomatic  Academy with the outgoing and incoming Foreign Ministry director  generals. [passage omitted]    The meeting's purpose, according to Figueroa, was to review  all the ministry's tasks, exchange opinions regarding the  ministry's general guidelines, and to discuss specific subjects.    Carlos Figueroa said some of the specific subjects raised  during the meeting were Chile's bilateral policy and its  relationship with neighboring countries and the European Union,  as well as the rapprochement with Mercosur [Common Market of the  South].</p>

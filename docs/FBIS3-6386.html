Foreign Minister Prasong says the meeting -- to be  held in Honolulu, Hawaii, during 18-19 March -- will be regarded  as a consultation, not a negotiation. Finance Minister Tharin  Nimmanhemin will represent Thailand at the meeting. [passage  omitted]    Minister Prasong says the United States has proposed the  setting up of a business convention center in Asia and the  Pacific, if APEC countries will select two business people to  attend the business conference as proposed by the United States.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has entrusted the Board of  Trade of Thailand and the Federation of Thai Industries to  select qualified persons to take part in the business conference.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM's action follows precedent of his predecessors - Robert Rice examines the context for John Major's defamation case MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday became the fourth prime minister this century to sue for defamation. Mr Harold - now Lord - Wilson embarked on several libel actions during his time in Number 10. In 1968 he received 'appropriate' damages plus costs in an agreed settlement of a libel action against the US publishers of the International Herald Tribune about an article which 'reported and repeated untrue rumours about Mr Wilson's personal life'. Mr Wilson also successfully sued pop group The Move in 1967 over a postcard publicising a new record. It showed a drawing of Mr Wilson sitting on a bed naked. During the 1951 general election campaign, Sir Winston Churchill issued a writ against the Daily Mirror over a front page story headlined 'Whose Finger on the Trigger?' which Sir Winston claimed implied he was a warmonger. The action was settled out of court for a sum of about Pounds 100,000. After the first world war, Lloyd-George sued successfully over newspaper allegations that he was offering honours for sale. Libel lawyers were not surprised by Mr Major's decision to sue New Statesman &amp; Society and Scallywag, describing it as a defensive move. Mr Richard Shillito, a partner of London solicitors Oswald Hickson Collier, said: 'The effect of issuing a writ is to serve notice on the rest of the world that they repeat the allegations in substance at their peril.' But there was surprise that the prime minister had chosen as his lawyers Biddle &amp; Co. Mr David Hooper, the firm's senior libel lawyer, acted for newspapers against the Conservative government during the Spycatcher affair. Most lawyers said they did not expect the matter to go to trial. Mr Shillito said it was difficult to see how the magazines could defend the action. He expected the matter to be settled out of court. Mr Peter Carter-Ruck, a defamation lawyer, said there seemed to be only two points to decide about the New Statesman &amp; Society article. Was it defamatory and if it was, was it fair comment on a matter of public interest? The magazines appeared to be on very difficult ground, he said. New Statesman &amp; Society's lawyers Bindman &amp; Co indicated that it would defend the action on the basis that the article was not defamatory. If the case does reach court, Mr Major would be entitled to give evidence on his own behalf. If he chose not to, the magazines could subpoena him and Miss Clare Latimer, the woman named in the magazines. But if the magazines subpoenaed the prime minister, he would become their witness and could not then be cross-examined by their counsel. There is no limit in theory to the damages the prime minister could be awarded by a jury, although the Court of Appeal now has the power to reassess a jury award without a retrial. Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Conservative MP for Billericay, who was awarded Pounds 150,000 by a jury for a libel by an Essex businessman, recently had that award reduced to Pounds 50,000 after consideration by the Appeal Court. If for political reasons Mr Major did not want to be seen to be putting the New Statesman &amp; Society out of business by pursuing an action for damages which the magazine could not afford to pay, he could opt to have his action dealt with by binding arbitration. Both parties would have to agree to this process. Mr Justice Popplewell was recently awarded Pounds 7,500 through this process after he was libelled by Today newspaper. Arbitration would only be an appropriate conclusion, however, if the magazine accepted that the article was defamatory.</p>

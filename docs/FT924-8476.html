			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Clarke denies knowledge of any policy to supply arms to Iraq THE following account is highlights of an interview with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, on the BBC World at One programme yesterday. Mr Clarke was asked by the reporter Mr Roger Currell why he had signed a certificate apparently aimed at restricting the information available. KC: Well, it's completely news to me that anything in these documents has had any effect on the outcome of the trial. I woke up this morning to find the Public Immunity Certificate being cited in a case which from my reading of the newspapers had turned on the evidence given by Alan Clark. I did sign a Public Immunity Certificate as I many times have after consulting with my lawyers about the documents that we had and we made the usual claim for public interest immunity for those categories of documents that aren't disclosed to the courts. I certainly didn't seek any immunity in order to conceal from the courts the truth and I think this confused case has been reported in rather an extraordinary fashion this morning. I have personally had nothing ever to do with sales of weapons to the Iraqis and I haven't sought immunity for any documents simply on the basis that they might prejudice a prosecution or be helpful to the defence. I wouldn't dream of signing any such certificate. Q: Did these papers not cover what was going on behind the scenes, involving arms which were being sold to Iraq, the government's policy over that, the embargo that was supposed to be in place? KC: Well, quite honestly as we now talk I can't remember. I didn't ban them on that basis. All I sought to withhold from the court was that category of document which governments always seek to withhold from the court, including for example, advice to ministers, and may well also have included, for example, things relating to the work of the security services which governments have always held back . . . All I know is I did not sign any certificate authorising the withholding of documents because they were embarrassing to the government. Q: But it is being suggested that the government was trying to cover up its secret policy which was to allow certain arms to be sold to Iraq in spite of the embargo. KC: Speaking for myself I know of no such secret policy. I was never involved in any such secret policy. I have never signed any certificate seeking to conceal any policy of the government. Q: Do you accept, then, that as a result of this case it has now been shown that the government was conniving to allow arms to be exported to Iraq when it was publicly saying that there was an embargo. KC: Well, I don't because I have not been following the progress of the case. I have been reading this morning's newspapers which seem to be implying that, but I know of no such policy and I don't believe that there was such a policy. But, certainly, I have no involvement in that kind of thing myself and I do not believe the vast majority of the members of the government could answer that question. Q: It's being suggested that even John Major may have misled the Commons. KC: No, no, no, I can't answer. With the greatest respect, you're asking things about which I know nothing. You're asking me about the dafter allegations in this morning's newspapers. One thing I can say, I see the cabinet's meant to have decided all kinds of things which I know perfectly well the cabinet never did. I've never taken part in any discussions on this kind of thing. I think it's highly unlikely John Major ever has either.</p>

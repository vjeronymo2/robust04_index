			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HERRICK DISSATISFIED WITH BIG HART WIN  </P> <P> Not many coaches would be discouraged after their team scored 95 points and  posted a 21-point victory for its fifth win in seven games.  </P> <P> Hart High Coach Greg Herrick was anything but thrilled, however, after the  Indians struggled at times during a 95-74 win over an outmatched Verdugo Hills  team Wednesday in the Bosco Tech tournament.  </P> <P> Hart will meet Venice at 8 tonight in the championship quarterfinals.  </P> <P> "We're winning, but I'm upset because I know what we're capable of doing,"  Herrick said.  </P> <P> Hart (5-2) led by as many as 19 points in the first half behind 17 points from  6-foot-6 senior center Chad Fotheringham.  </P> <P> But the scrappy Verdugo Hills team pulled within 66-56 on Scott Boudreaux's  free throw with seven minutes left.  </P> <P> Hart fell back on its considerable height advantage and aggressive full-court  pressure to outscore Verdugo Hills, 12-2, and extend its lead to 78-58 on  Renato Rivas' layin with 5:01 left.  </P> <P> "We played in spurts," Herrick said. "We'd play well for a while, then get real  sloppy in our execution."  </P> <P> But it's difficult to blame the Indians for lackluster play. After all, when  they looked over at Verdugo Hills' pregame drills, they saw only seven players  -- and none taller than 6-1.  </P> <P> Hart had a roster full of talent, including three starters taller than 6-4.  </P> <P> "It's tough to motivate them in that kind of a situation," Herrick said.  </P> <P> Fotheringham scored a game-high 22 points, Marty Downen scored 19, and Rivas  scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half.  </P> <P> Micah Ohlman had 12 points, including three three-point baskets, before fouling  out early in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Kent Purser scored 19 points to lead five Verdugo Hills' players in double  figures. Tuyen Tran and Boudreaux each had 13 and Dan La and Joey Letscher  scored 12 apiece.

University scored with  seven minutes left in the game to earn the tie. L.A. Baptist 2, Cabrillo 2 --  Dan Stepper and Todd Cohen scored goals in a nonleague match at L. A. Baptist  (6-0-2).

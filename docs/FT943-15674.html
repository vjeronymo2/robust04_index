			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Eight charged inbiggest Swiss bribery scandal Switzerland's biggest-ever corruption scandal moved closer to resolution this week as formal charges were laid against eight people, including a prominent magazine publisher. The scandal centres on Mr Raphael Huber, the canton of Zurich's former restaurant and bar inspector, who is alleged to have taken some SFr2.4m (Pounds 1.15m) in bribes from permit applicants over a 10-year period to 1991. Mr Huber has been charged with 25 counts of receiving bribes and abuse of office. Three well-known Zurich restaurateurs, Mr Rudolf Bindella, Mr Hugo Holenstein and Mr Alfred Tschanz, have been charged with bribing him. Mr Beat Curti, publisher of the respected weekly news magazine Weltwoche, was also charged with bribing Mr Huber. Mr Curti, who owns a supermarket chain, acknowledged having paid SFr110,000 to Mr Huber between 1986 and 1989 but insisted this involved legitimate payments for business advice. Mr Emil Frei, the prosecutor, said 30 other people were under investigation. When the story of Mr Huber's alleged large-scale bribe-taking came to light in late 1991, it shocked a country where the honesty of public officials has always been taken for granted. Until then, no one seemed concerned that the cantonal regulations gave the restaurant and bar inspectors immense discretionary power to decide whether permits should be issued. Among other things, these regulations said that an applicant had to prove to the inspector that there was 'a need' for the establishment. According to Mr Frei, Mr Huber established a reign of fear in the Zurich restaurant and bar trade during the booming 1980s. Sometimes, it is alleged, he took payments in the form of loans. At other times, supplicants were encouraged to buy pictures painted by his deceased father at excessive prices. Although he was earning only a modest salary, Mr Huber managed to maintain two flats in Zurich and build up a 90-hectare estate in Chianti in Italy, complete with vineyard and artificial lake. If convicted, Mr Huber would face a sentence of up to five years in prison. The case is expected to come to trial early next year. Meanwhile, the cantonal government has just put into effect new regulations governing restaurant and bar licences.</p>

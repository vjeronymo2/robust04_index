			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P wins right to retain notes on Pan Am A US judge ruled yesterday that Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency, would not have to turn over to creditors of Pan Am, the defunct US airline, information the agency had gathered about a bid in 1992 to fund a reorganisation of Pan Am by rival carrier Delta Air Lines. Lawyers representing Pan Am's creditors had issued a subpoena to Standard &amp; Poor's demanding it hand over the information, which they said was needed for a lawsuit Pan Am had filed against Delta for withdrawing from the reorganisation plan. Standard &amp; Poor's compiled the information on Delta from meetings, correspondence and other communications with the airline, and had intended to use it to evaluate how Delta would be affected by its funding of a planned reorganisation of Pan Am. Yesterday's decision overturns an earlier ruling by a bankruptcy court that had compelled Standard &amp; Poor's to give the information to lawyers of Pan Am's creditors. That decision was made on the grounds that the ratings agency was not a news organisation gathering the information for purposes of journalism, and therefore not protected by the right to free speech guaranteed in the US constitution. However, district court judge Ms Loretta Preska of Manhattan ruled that Standard &amp; Poor's was entitled to the constitutional protections enjoyed by news organisations.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Long View: Emerging optimists ONE AFTER another, new emerging markets funds are being launched. They make up one of the hottest investment sectors of the moment, and some of the closed-end funds are selling at above their underlying asset value, a sure sign of excess demand. In the short run there are danger signals evident here. The new money is usually being channelled into small and illiquid stock markets around the world (although one or two 'emerging' markets are becoming quite large: Hong Kong's market capitalisation is bigger than Italy's, Mexico is bigger than Belgium). In a small market place a flood of incoming money will effectively create its own capital gains for a while, but it is bound to push prices above their sustainable value, creating the inevitability of a shakeout. It rarely pays an investor to chase a fashion, even if the fundamental case is a good one; a better opportunity will be presented to the buyer who waits patiently, although he may need to be brave enough to invest under the shadow of revolution, earthquake or financial scandal. Certainly, August was a good month for the fringe markets. You could have made 26 per cent in dollar terms during the month in Turkey and 23 per cent in Indonesia. On the other hand, in Venezuela . . . but let's not discuss Venezuela. If markets emerge strongly enough they can join the big league. Not so long ago Tokyo was an emerging market. Little more than 30 years ago shares in promising little companies like Sony and Toyota could be picked up on price-earnings ratios in the low single figures. Now Tokyo is the second-biggest market in the world (having been the biggest at its peak in the late 1980s) but Japanese equities sell on extraordinarily expensive ratings and the Japanese economic growth rate has slowed to 1 per cent. Here we have the point, because emerging markets are about growth. The developed world will be lucky to show a growth rate of 1.5 per cent in 1993, but in the first half of the year the real GNP of China is estimated to have grown by 14 per cent year-on-year and its industrial production by 25 per cent (admittedly, rates which are near to overheating). For decades most developing countries have been growing faster than the OECD members. But now the developed world is slowing down while many of the newly industrialising countries appear to be accelerating, largely because of the spread of free markets and the transfer of technology. In fact the inability of the US and Western Europe to cope with the new low-cost competition explains, at least in part, the sluggishness of their economies and the deflationary phase which they are experiencing, as their labour forces are priced out of many sectors which are open to international competition. There is plenty here for emerging market bulls to get their teeth into. The right investment strategy in these conditions, they say, is to buy bonds in the developed countries and equities in the emerging markets. The bonds will yield a profit from the unexpected collapse in Western inflation rates (and therefore in interest rates) while the Third World equity portfolios will be plugged into the exhilarating 6 per cent a year growth curves in south-east Asia and Latin America. It certainly looked a good story this week as the US Treasury bond bull market was further extended, whereas Western stock markets faltered. However, a week is a short time in terms of a global strategy. You have to make several brave additional assumptions, not the least being that foreign investors will be permitted to make, and eventually take, a long-term profit in the fast-growing Third World. It is a lot easier to put the money in than to transfer it out again. We have, after all, been here before. Eighty years ago, just ahead of the outbreak of the First World War, British investors often devoted half their portfolios to the exciting emerging markets of the time. To the extent that the capital was invested in North America they did well, but Latin America was a different story, as was Eastern Europe. Many of today's international investors, especially those in the US, are calculating that the Latin American countries are a reformed bunch (although Brazilian inflation at over 30 per cent a month is as bad as ever). But the buyers of Latin American bonds learnt an expensive lesson in the nineteenth century, and the same grim fate befell the naive international banks in the 1970s. In some cultures, believe it or not, repaying foreign debts is not regarded as very important. Today's investors in Argentina, Brazil or Peru are seeking safety in equities rather than bonds, but will they really fare any better? History does provide some positive messages. First the US, and then Japan several generations later, achieved the transition from an emerging economy to the status of a large, wealthy and stable nation with a secure framework of law and financial market regulation. Candidates for a similar transition include China, Russia, India, Brazil and Indonesia. If you were the manager of a pension fund with a time horizon for your pension liabilities of 40 years or more you would want to take into account the possibility that one of these, like Japan, might grow within such a period to represent a quarter or more of the global stock market. Such reasoning lies behind decisions such as that of the Dutch bakery industry pension fund, which sounds a highly cautious institution to me, to invest possibly over Dollars 50m in Asian equities. The potential returns are certainly much higher than they are in dull old Europe. But whether retired Dutch bakers will benefit in the 21st century is another matter. Certainly I would choose Asia rather than Latin America. But the ride could prove rather exciting. Emerging markets should be looked on to provide the cream rather than the basic crust.</p>

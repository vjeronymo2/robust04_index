			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand chief quits MR Jan Erik Langangen has resigned as president of Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, Reuter reports from Oslo. Mr Per Terje Vold, vice-president of the life insurance division, is taking over. 'The board of Uni Storebrand has this afternoon accepted Jan Erik Langangen's wish to resign as company president with immediate effect,' Uni Storebrand said. Mr Langangen has been criticised for letting Uni Storebrand buy 28 per cent of Swedish insurer Forsakrings AB Skandia and trying to force it into a Nordic Co-operation Pact. This plan has so far failed and it is not clear what Uni Storebrand will do with its stake in Skandia.</p>

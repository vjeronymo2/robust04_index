			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia expects Asian beef boost Australian beef exports to North Asia could almost double over the next four years, as a result of trade liberalisation, the government-owned Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, forecast this week. Abare suggested that exports to Japan and South Korea could rise to 580,000 tonnes in 1998-99, from 344,000 tonnes in 1992-93. The increased exports should underpin prices and could take the cattle herd and beef production back to the record levels seen in the 1970s, the forecaster suggested.</p>

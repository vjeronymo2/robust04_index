			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (AFP)--Deng Xiaoping is alive and  kicking and has become an avid football fan, one of his sons  said here Tuesday. Deng Pufang again rejected suggestions that  China's 89-year-old paramount leader was close to death at a  press conference to support the Far East and South Pacific  Disabled Games. "I really deeply regret all these rumors. He is  in very good health. He enjoys the normal life of a retired  person," said Deng Pufang, president of the Chinese Federation  for the Disabled. "As the weather becomes warmer and warmer, he  can go for walks. It is good for his health," the son added.    In recent weeks, rumours that Deng Xiaoping is dead or dying  have swept world financial markets. They have been denied by his  family and the foreign ministry, but the last time he was seen  was on television in February he had to be helped to walk.    One of his daughter's, Deng Lin, said on April 28 her father  was resting in Beijing.    Deng Xiaoping has always been known to be a keen bridge  player. But his son said that the Chinese leader was now a keen  armchair football fan. "As this summer there will be a lot of  matches like the World Cup, I am sure he will be interested in  watching," said Deng Pufang.    Deng Pufang was himself crippled when attacked during the  Cultural Revolution, which is why he is now head of the Chinese  federation for the disabled. The Far East and South Pacific  Disabled Games will be held in Beijing from September 4 to  September 10.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: France Rather like an old dog which cannot learn new tricks, the French government continues to adhere to an exchange rate mechanism which effectively no longer exists. Yesterday's minimal cut in the overnight lending rate to 9.75 per cent emphasises the government's continued adherence to the ancien regime. The government now appears to confront two options with only one outcome: either it cuts interest rates and the franc depreciates as returns on holding the currency decline; or it does not cut interest rates and the franc depreciates because investors worry about the damage to the underlying economy. Over the short term, the government may persist with high rates to replenish its depleted foreign reserves. But the reluctance to cut perhaps also reflects the government's psychological shock. French politicians have no recent experience of managing a floating franc. Mr Balladur now needs to invent a new policy. Politically, it would be acutely embarrassing for him to allow the franc to fall sharply. Overseas investors who have already bid up the Paris equity and bond markets are taking substantial interest rate cuts for granted and may grow queasy about delay. But interest rates are only a part of the equation. A lower cost of borrowing may boost corporate profits but will have little effect on consumers worried about jobs. With unemployment at 11.6 per cent and rising, French demand may remain weak for longer than the equity market fondly imagines.</p>

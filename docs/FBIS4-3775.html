			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station reporter Zhang Xiuzhen based in Hong </F> Kong; from the "News" program]    [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch, said on 22 April: The Hong Kong Government ought  to undertake the responsibility to solve the current housing  problem in Hong Kong.    He made the above remark when commenting on the Sino-British  Committee's land approval plan for this year at the inauguration  of of a new term of officials of the (Shunde) Association.    He said: The drastic increase in Hong Kong's housing prices  is not the problem of land supply alone. China has basically  consented to this year's land approval plan, which includes a  marked increase in the portion of land for commercial and  residential use.    He said: The increased land supply is only the first step.  The Hong Kong Government should work out specific overall  arrangements for properly using land approved for use in the  future.    He added: In fact, many lots to be used for building  residential and public housing do not require examination and  approval by the Sino-British Land Committee. It is the  responsibility of the British Hong Kong Government to solve the  housing problem in Hong Kong.</p>

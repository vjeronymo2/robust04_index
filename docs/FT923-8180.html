			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Police explain loss of SA massacre tape A SOUTH African police sergeant yesterday described the operational error that lead to the erasure of 13 hours of tape recorded radio calls on the afternoon and night of the June 17 Boipatong massacre. The Goldstone judicial commission investigating the massacre was told that taping equipment used by the area's internal stability unit had been operated incorrectly since its installation in March this year. Sergeant Ilse O'Reilly, the officer in charge of the operations control room, told the commission that this was discovered only after the massacre, in which 42 people were killed. Sergeant O'Reilly said that the machine used ordinary commercial tapes, but was able to record on only one side. Material was erased if the tape was turned over. The day after the massacre, she told the commission, she had turned the tapes in the machine over. As a result, all conversations between about 2 pm on June 17 and 3 am on June 18 had been erased. Meanwhile the government has responded to criticism of police treatment of people in their custody, announcing the appointment of six inspectors to monitor an investigate conditions under which people were held. The move follows allegations by a leading pathologist that police brutality had accounted for the deaths of scores of prisoners. Since the claim was made a fortnight ago, eight people have died in custody. A further meeting between the government and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) is expected to take place next week.</p>

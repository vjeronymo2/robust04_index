			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ems-Chemie cautious in spite of 13% advance EMS-CHEMIE, the Swiss speciality chemicals group headed by Mr Christoph Blocher, has reported a 13 per cent rise in operating profits in the first eight months of the year to SFr61m (Dollars 43.3m). However, the group forecast only that operating profits in the full year 'should reach at least last year's level'. Operating profit last year was SFr92m. EMS, which sells a large volume of speciality chemicals to the automotive industry, said it assumed that its environment would continue to be difficult. The recession in Germany, its most important market, was likely to last longer than in other countries, it said. Sales in the first eight months were down 4 per cent to SFr554m, and the group said full year sales could be slightly below last year's SFr896m.</p>

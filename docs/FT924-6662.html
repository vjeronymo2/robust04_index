			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US, EC claim 'progress' on oilseeds deal TRADE NEGOTIATORS from the US and European Community ended crucial talks in Washington last night, with both sides claiming to have made 'very good progress'. The discussions were aimed at averting a transatlantic trade war over European oilseed subsidies and at reviving stalled Uruguay Round talks on world trade liberalisation. Officials said that the US-EC talks would continue at a later date, though it was not disclosed when. The two sides are negotiating under a deadline, as US punitive sanctions against some European goods are due to come into force on December 5 in retaliation for European subsidies to oilseeds farmers. In a brief but upbeat statement both sides insisted that 'very good progress' had been made in the talks, which began on Wednesday night. Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, said: 'We are very close together and we are going to continue to work. We will meet again as soon as possible. We have to gather some other data.' Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, said: 'We have had a good consultation which contributed to finding solutions to points we still have to settle between us.' Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's agriculture commissioner, said: 'We are almost at an agreement.' Earlier, after Wednesday night's session, the sides said they had been far apart on critical issues. Differences included: A significant gap between proposed US and EC ceilings on oilseeds production; Whether or not oilseeds grown for industrial use on set-aside land should be included in the deal; EC refusal to accept a formal or binding enforcement mechanism to ensure corrective action and compensation if EC farmers overshoot output ceilings. As the two sides resumed talks yesterday, Mrs Hills said she wanted above all to be able to announce agreement by the time talks ended last night. Meanwhile, tempers flared elsewhere. Some 300 French farmers burned the US flag and hurled fireworks over police lines barring them from the US embassy in Paris. Twenty police were injured in the clash, intended to put pressure on the EC 'not to allow the US to step on our feet and sacrifice European and French agriculture'. In Washington, Mr Steve Yoder, American Soyabean Association president, and a leading lobbyist against the EC oilseeds regime, said he was 'disgusted' by the French farmers. France would not be mollified by any US concessions in the non-farm aspects of the Gatt talks into accepting what it saw as a bad farm trade deal, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French agriculture minister, said. Despite the demonstrations in Paris, President Francois Mitterrand is keeping his counsel on whether to invoke a last-resort veto of an agreement in Washington. 'This (the Gatt) is one of the hardest dossiers I have had to deal with since 1951,' he was quoted as telling his cabinet. Mr Mitterrand clearly fears an EC crisis if he vetoes a Gatt deal, and a domestic crisis if he does not. Mr Soisson said yesterday an eventual French veto in the EC Council of Ministers was for the president to decide. Mr Soisson said that while France wanted progress in the Gatt areas of services, market access and copyright protection, it would not be bought off by concessions here. 'The agricultural chapter must be improved, and the whole book be made readable,' he added. France would not agree to a rushed Gatt agreement, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Fear of Electoral Defeat Sweeping Center Party"] </F>   [Text] The big winner in the last parliamentary elections,  the Center Party, has drifted into a back-against-the-wall  position with only one more year before elections. The Esko  Aho-led Center Party lost the local elections of 1992 and  suffered a bitter defeat in the presidential elections.  According to a recent poll, the Center Party is supported by  only 17.5 percent of the electorate, which is the same level as  during the Johannes Virolainen era. The Center Party is also  being ravaged by tension within, above all by the presidential  candidacies of Keijo Korhonen and Eeva Kuuskoski.    Center Party leadership is fully aware of the panic sweeping  their party. How could it not be, for the dirty laundry from the  presidential election is now starting to be sorted out in  various places. Name lists are being collected in Kainuu for the  support of Keijo Korhonen, while at the same time, some people  are calling for the dismissal of both Korhonen and Kuuskoski  from the party. Prime Minister Aho has himself called together  strategy meetings of those close to him, at which the focus has  been on how to avert a disaster in the parliamentary elections.    In 1991 the Center Party achieved an almost dreamlike  victory: almost 25 percent of all votes and 15 new seats in the  Eduskunta. If its support levels do not start to rise from the  present levels, all of these new Eduskunta seats will be lost.  The fear of electoral defeat is not unfounded. Having the  responsibility of governing during a recession and the  monetaristic economic policy are devastating the party. This was  apparent already in the local elections when Center Party  support dropped over 7 percent from the parliamentary election  level. This development was historical, for the number of votes  gathered by the party had increased only when compared to the  1950 local elections. Center Party support in opinion polls is  now being upheld only by the very core element of the party.    Aho has not publicly shown any signs of concern, at least  not  for the time being. He believes that the Center Party can  prevail when it will show that the country's finances were put  in order under its leadership. Aho, in fact, awaited the  emergence of the first fruits already in the presidential  elections and was disappointed when Elizabeth Rehn was not  elected president after all. The sentiment was genuine, for he,  along with all of the governing parties, clearly supported Rehn  so as to shore up support for their governing position. Their  support was even more definite than it had been for their own  parties' candidates in the first round of the presidential  election.    The presidential election result was a blow to Aho also for  the reason that Martti Ahtisaari of the SDP (Social Democratic  Party) was the winner. If the SDP gains a historical victory in  next year's election, as the opinion polls seem to indicate, the  Center Party will be at the mercy of its old nemesis. The SDP  will then determine who they will accept into the cabinet. The  very idea of it is like a horrible nightmare in Center Party  eyes.    Aho need not fear for the sake of his own position yet at  the  party's convention next summer, even though cabinet member Seppo  Kaariainen is giving him Vayrynen-like threatening warnings.  Kaariainen's speech about a "rye bread policy" is anything but  according to Aho policy. The warnings from this team of two are,  however, merely the establishment of a stand at this point, and  not an open challenge.    Gaining a tolerable defeat in the elections is important for  Aho. Otherwise his position will become tenuous in the face of  attacks by Vayrynen and Kaariainen. But how can Aho get an  honorable result in the parliamentary elections when economic  growth will not yet cut into unemployment, and when the taxing  of wages remains extremely tight? A favorable balance of trade  will not win elections. About the only way available to Aho is  to spend a lot of money in the areas where the Center Party has  support. As shocking as it may sound, the distribution of money  is already happening at full speed. It commenced last week under  the prime minister's stewardship in the first budget amendment.</p>

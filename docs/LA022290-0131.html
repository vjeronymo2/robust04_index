			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> SANDINISTAS PULL LEVERS OF STATE POWER TO WOO VOTES  </P> <P> When the National Opposition Union closed its electoral campaign here last  weekend, hundreds of Managua-bound supporters were stranded in the city of  Masaya. The state-owned trains they were awaiting had been diverted without  warning to Leon, scene of that day's rally of the ruling Sandinista Party.  </P> <P> Nor did the huge sound system rented for the opposition gathering get to  Managua. Trucked from Costa Rica, it remained impounded at the border for a  fourth straight day, awaiting clearance by Sandinista customs officials.  </P> <P> In an all-out drive for reelection, President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista  government has pulled countless levers of state power to overwhelm its  challengers in every way a campaign can be conducted -- from fund-raising to  media exposure to crowd turnout.  </P> <P> But, in a country torn by guerrilla war and lacking a tradition of free  elections, the contentious six-month campaign for Sunday's election has  surprised international observers and opposition parties by its relatively  peaceful and open atmosphere.  </P> <P> The Sandinistas flexed their organizational muscle by mobilizing 200,000 to  300,000 supporters in buses, jeeps, dump trucks, trains and army vehicles to a  festive demonstration along Managua's lake front Wednesday. The flow of  humanity paralyzed the city of 1 million and made the ruling party's final  rally at least five times bigger than the one staged by the opposition last  Sunday.  </P> <P> "They say that the people are mobilized because we pay them or threaten them,"  Ortega told the crowd, which was also treated to fireworks, go-go dancers and  brass bands. "Those who assert this have received millions of dollars from the  North American government, which has not succeeded in buying the conscience of  our people."  </P> <P> By law, politicking was prohibited after midnight Wednesday. And, under a  directive by the government's Supreme Electoral Council aimed at preventing  violence, all parties are to keep demonstrators off the streets until midnight  Sunday, six hours after the polls close.  </P> <P> The campaign has been marked by hundreds of peaceful rallies drawing large and  enthusiastic crowds, mostly for Ortega and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,  presidential candidate of the U.S.-backed opposition union known as UNO. Just  one was marred by violence, a Dec. 10 clash between UNO and Sandinista  militants that left one man dead at a UNO rally in Masatepe.  </P> <P> Some leaders of the 14-party coalition have complained of a "silent campaign"  of Sandinista intimidation against their candidates and poll-watchers.  Chamorro's chief strategist, Alfredo Cesar, charged Wednesday that the  Sandinistas have abused their control of the media, public transport and the  state bureaucracy to wage a "tremendously unfair campaign."  </P> <P> Such grievances have been echoed by the Bush Administration throughout the  campaign as a basis for questioning whether free and fair elections are  possible here.  </P> <P> While reporting extensively on these complaints, both official observer  missions, from the United Nations and the Organization of American States, have  presented a more favorable picture of the campaign.  </P> <P> "The difficulties that have arisen for the most part have been overcome," the  OAS secretary general, Joao Baena Soares, concluded in a pre-election report  issued Wednesday. "It is expected that the elections will take place in a  climate that permits citizens to choose freely."  </P> <P> All assessments of the campaign agree that the Sandinistas, who fought their  way to power a decade ago and turned their guerrilla army into a powerful  political machine, hold the incumbent's edge over a fragile and emerging  opposition. But several disparities raise the question of fairness:  </P> <P>  -- News broadcasts on the state television monopoly gave far more time to  Ortega than his challengers. The state-owned Voice of Nicaragua radio network  stretched the limits of objectivity by offering prizes such as cars and houses  to listeners who correctly predict Ortega's margin of victory. Under criticism  from observer groups, the government expanded free TV time set aside for debate  among candidates. Baena Soares' report said television news coverage was more  balanced at the end of the campaign but still gave the Sandinistas more time.  </P> <P>  -- Army trucks and other state-owned vehicles were routinely used to transport  people to Ortega rallies, while government buildings were festooned with red  and black Sandinista banners and wall paintings, in violation of the electoral  law.  </P> <P> "They fly the Sandinista flag from an army barracks near my office," said  Guillermo Selva, an opposition member of the electoral council that is assigned  to enforce the law. "I asked the army 20 times to remove it, but they just  ignored me."  </P> <P> Baena Soares said the government had shrugged off such appeals, even those made  formally by the council. Nor has the government produced the receipts to back  its claim that the Sandinista Party rents its trucks from the government.  </P> <P> Even so, he said in an interview, "the use of public facilities (by the  government party) happens to some degree in every country. It's not a threat to  this election."  </P> <P>  -- The Sandinistas outspent the opposition while delaying delivery, through  the Central Bank, of $3.3 million voted by the U.S. Congress to help Chamorro  offset the Sandinistas' advantages. Those funds reached her coalition in late  January, more than a month after they were deposited here -- a delay caused, in  part, by UNO's failure to legally register an institute receiving part of the  money.  </P> <P> While the $3.3 million made up the bulk of UNO's campaign budget, the  Sandinistas reported spending $6.4 million, including $3 million in materials  and $419,000 in cash donated from sympathizers abroad and the rest in corporate  and individual contributions at home. UNO's estimate of Sandinista expenses  runs up to $12 million.  </P> <P> Mariano Fiallos, president of the electoral council, noted that UNO fared  relatively well compared to the other eight opposition parties, none of which  received more than $250,000.  </P> <P>  -- Sixty-eight candidates for the National Assembly and 243 candidates for  municipal councils resigned during the campaign. Most represented UNO, which  claimed they were threatened by state security police and other Sandinista  militants with loss of their lives, jobs or property.  </P> <P> Baena Soares endorsed the finding of an earlier U.N. investigation that such  cases did not suggest a pattern of intimidation centrally planned by the  Sandinista government but rather were the work of local party members. He said  his investigation was hampered by the failure of opposition parties to offer  evidence of intimidation in most of the cases.  </P> <P> "It's fair to say that there is a wide discrepancy between the prevalence of  these charges and the production of any evidence of such actual intimidation,"  said former U.S. Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson, head of the U.N. mission  watching the elections.  </P> <P> Noting that U.S.-backed Contras have attacked and killed at least four  Sandinista campaign workers, Baena Soares branded the rebels as "the principal  form of electoral violence."  </P> <P> Despite claims that its poll watchers were threatened, UNO reported this week  that it had fielded poll watchers for all but seven of the nation's 4,391  polling stations, a critical step in monitoring the vote.  </P> <P> Some observer groups are more critical than the U.N. and OAS missions of the  Sandinistas' campaign conduct. But all observers agree that the election itself  will have enough safeguards and international scrutiny to ensure a relatively  fair count.  </P> <P> "I do not feel the campaign has gone well," said Allen Weinstein, head of the  Washington-based Center for Democracy observer group. "But if I felt the  campaign were so badly flawed that it wouldn't matter what happened on election  day, I'd strike my tent and go home."  </P> <P> Opposition parties have reached the same conclusion. Because the main U.S.-  backed anti-Sandinista coalition spoiled the 1984 election by pulling out, it  is a notable event in Nicaragua's violent history that the contending forces  are staying in this time.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 30 April editorial: "Strengthen </F> Good-Neighborliness and Friendship and Promote Mutually  Beneficial Cooperation"]    [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- During the warm spring  when flowers are in full bloom, Li Peng, premier of the State  Council, paid an official goodwill visit, by invitation, to  Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan,  Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, bringing with him the Chinese people's  profound friendship. His visit was a complete success, having  attained the goals of enhancing understanding, developing  cooperation, and promoting good- neighborliness and friendship.  We would like to offer our warm congratulations.    Premier Li Peng's five-nation tour was an event of profound  significance in the history of China's relations with those  countries. During the visit, Premier Li Peng held several  rounds of friendly and sincere talks and meetings with the  leaders of the five countries, during which they conducted  businesslike and realistic discussions on further developing  bilateral relations. Relevant departments on both sides signed  approximately 20 agreements or letters of intent. Premier Li  Peng also had an in-depth exchange of views with the leaders of  the five countries on regional and international issues of  common interest, reaching a broad consensus in this respect.    Premier Li Peng's visit marked a new stage of development  for  China's friendly relations and cooperation with the five  countries. Premier Li Peng and the leaders of the five countries  shared the view that maintaining good-neighborly and friendly  relations over the long term would benefit not only the peoples  of their respective countries, but also stability and  development in the region. China and the five countries are  complementary to each other in the economic realm, and there are  broad prospects for strengthening cooperation based on equality  and mutual benefit. Both sides indicated that they would adopt  positive and feasible measures to further enrich the substance,  improve the quality, and expand the scope of mutually beneficial  cooperation, particularly referring to measures aimed at  encouraging entrepreneurs on both sides to increase contacts and  develop various forms of multilevel economic cooperation and  trade. The entrepreneurs traveling with Premier Li Peng  concluded a set of agreements or letters of intent on  cooperation with their counterparts in the four Central Asian  countries. They also explored ways to further develop economic  cooperation and trade.    Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev signed a  Sino-Kazakh  border agreement, which was a major event of historic  significance for relations between the two countries. We firmly  believe that the Sino-Kazakh border extending more than 1,700 km  will become a bond of friendly cooperation and common  prosperity. Both Premier Li Peng and President Akayev said they  would assume a positive attitude toward resolving the border  issue between China and the Republic of Kyrgyzstan through  friendly consultation and negotiations at an early date.    Special emphasis should be placed on the fact that Premier  Li  Peng delivered an important speech in Tashkent, the capital of  Uzbekistan, in which he systematically and comprehensively set  forth a four-point basic policy for developing China's relations  with the Central Asian countries. The speech elicited positive  response and favorable comment. Remaining on friendly terms for  generations represents the common aspiration of the Chinese and  Central Asian peoples, and is entirely consistent with their  fundamental interests. China attaches great importance to  developing friendly relations with the Central Asian countries;  respects their independence and sovereignty, the choice of  social systems and development paths made by their peoples in  keeping with their national conditions, and the foreign policies  they pursue; and appreciates their efforts to develop relations  with their neighbors and other countries. China abides by the  principles of equality and mutual benefit, will develop economic  cooperation and trade with the Central Asian countries to  promote common prosperity, and will make due contributions to  building a new "Silk Road." China sincerely hopes for stability  and development in the Central Asian countries and region. A  stable and prosperous Central Asia is in the long- term  interests of Central Asian countries, and is closely related to  peace and development in Asia and even in the world at large.  We believe that with the passage of time, the four-point basic  policy enunciated by Premier Li Peng will demonstrate strong  vitality.    Since China and Mongolia normalized their relations in 1989,  their relations have experienced new developments. During  Premier Li Peng's visit to Mongolia, China and Mongolia signed a  treaty of friendship and cooperation, an important hallmark of  the development of relations between the two countries. The  leaders of China and Mongolia expressed the identical view that  the two countries should constantly consolidate and develop  good-neighborly and friendly cooperation on the basis of the  five principles of peaceful coexistence.    Developing relations with neighboring and adjacent countries  is a very important part of China's independent foreign policy  of peace. Regardless of what may happen in the world, China's  policy of good-neighborly and friendly relations will never  change, and China will always be a good friend and neighbor who  can be trusted by adjacent countries. We firmly believe that  through the joint efforts of China and the five countries, the  results of Premier Li Peng's visit will surely be consolidated  and expanded. China's good-neighborly, friendly, and mutually  beneficial cooperation with adjacent countries is bound to be  filled with even greater vim and vigor.</p>

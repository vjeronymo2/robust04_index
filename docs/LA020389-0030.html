			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN SEEKS NEW WORLD INFLUENCE;  </P> <P> TELLS U.S. IT WANTS GREATER SAY IN GLOBAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS, ECONOMY  </P> <P> Japan served notice Thursday that it wants to play a new, broader role in  international affairs and management of the world economy, a consequence of its  growing economic strength and increasing status as a global power.  </P> <P> The message, delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in a meeting  with President Bush, is that Japan wants more say as the Bush Administration  develops its policies toward the Soviet Union, aid to Latin America and the  economic integration of Europe.  </P> <P> The tone of the Japanese approach, reinforced more bluntly in a series of  briefings for reporters by senior Japanese officials, was decidedly assertive,  with clear signs that Tokyo expects to become a far more equal partner on  global issues than it has been in the past.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Forceful Than Expected  </P> <P> Bush Administration strategists conceded that they were somewhat surprised by  the intensity of the message. Tokyo had provided some advance notice of what  Takeshita would say but the tone of the Japanese demands was more forceful than  some had expected.  </P> <P> "They see an Administration that is reviewing its policies . . . across the  board. They see Europe moving toward integration. They are saying they want to  be dealt in -- they want to be consulted," a State Department official said.  </P> <P> In the 2 1/2-hour session, which marked Bush's first meeting as President with  any foreign leader, Takeshita declared repeatedly that the United States and  Japan should cooperate on more equal footing on "joint endeavors in order to  create a better world."  </P> <P> In particular, Takeshita told Bush that Japan wants the United States to  consult far more closely with Tokyo as the United States and the Soviet Union  move forward in their efforts to improve their relations. At the moment, Japan  appears to be much more skeptical of the degree of change in the Soviet Union  under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev than is the United States.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Japanese issued a sterner-than-usual demand that the  United States reduce its federal budget deficit, which many analysts believe is  straining the world economy. Tokyo is said to be growing increasingly impatient  with progress on that front.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said there also are indications that Japan is prepared to begin  picking up substantially more of the price tag for economic and political aid  around the world -- including such areas as the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and  Central America.  </P> <P> Bush and other officials appeared prepared to encourage Japan to take on a  wider role -- within limits. The President acknowledged after the meeting that  Washington agrees with "the importance of frequent consultations at all levels  on international issues."  </P> <P> And aides quoted the President as assuring Takeshita that the United States is  "not pulling back" from its security obligations in Asia, such as maintaining  the U.S. military presence in South Korea and the Philippines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Months of Hints on Role  </P> <P> The new, more assertive Japanese posture follows 18 months of hints that the  Japanese want to take on a political role in global affairs that is more  commensurate with their economic power -- a push that Takeshita as prime  minister has made a personal quest.  </P> <P> At a conference of Southeast Asian nations in December, 1987, Takeshita  suggested that Japan plans to help guide the economic development of the rest  of Asia.  </P> <P> And at last summer's seven-nation economic summit, the Japanese produced their  own proposal for resolving the Third World debt problem, challenging the plan  the United States had offered two years previously. Before that, Tokyo had been  passive, content merely to follow the U.S. lead.  </P> <P> But the push for more clout abroad also is being viewed as an effort by  Takeshita to bolster his growing political weakness at home in the face of his  administration's recent stock market scandal and dissatisfaction over its tax  reform initiative.  </P> <P> The Yomiuri Shimbun, a Tokyo newspaper, reported Thursday that popular support  for Takeshita's government had plummeted to a low of 27.4% -- an unusually poor  showing. Some fear that the prime minister's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is  beginning to lose its grip.  </P> <P> Takeshita is to fly to California tonight and is scheduled to pay a farewell  visit Monday to former President Ronald Reagan before returning home.  </P> <P> Takeshita's early visit here, partly designed to overcome his increasing  unpopularity at home, was supposed to have taken place Jan. 6 but was postponed  because of the then-growing prospect that Emperor Hirohito might die. Hirohito  died Jan. 7.  </P> <P> To underscore the importance that the United States places on its relationship  with Japan, Bush has announced that he will travel to Tokyo later this month  for Hirohito's state funeral, a gesture that was actively sought by the  Japanese. Bush also plans to stop in China and South Korea on the trip.  </P> <P> For all his demands for a wider role, Takeshita took pains to assure Bush that  Tokyo is not about to challenge U.S. leadership in global affairs.  </P> <P> "There is no country that can replace the U.S. in the Free World," he said. "We  want the United States to be strong."  </P> <P> He said that Japan hopes to be America's "most reliable" partner in world  affairs.  </P> <P> Japan has been moving steadily in recent months to step up its influence in  world affairs. Earlier this month, Tokyo announced that, partly because of U.S.  insistence, it again will increase its defense budget so that it can pay more  of the costs of Washington's international peacekeeping burden.  </P> <P> And just last week, the Japanese unveiled plans to expand their foreign aid,  enough to make Japan the world's largest provider of economic aid to developing  countries by fiscal 1990, which begins April 1.  </P> <P> Japan also has taken major steps to stimulate demand at home and to open its  markets to more imports, including manufactured goods from the United States.  And it has helped the United States and West Germany to keep the value of the  dollar low enough so the U.S. trade deficit can be reduced.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Bush publicly acknowledged Japan's efforts in all three areas, and  pledged that the United States will push to reduce its budget deficit in the  coming fiscal year.  </P> <P> Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama is expected to press the United  States on the budget issue at a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of  Seven industrial countries here today. Besides the United States and Japan, the  other seven nations are West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost of Peacekeeping Forces  </P> <P> Another role Japan has discussed is to help finance international peacekeeping  forces -- not only within Asia but elsewhere. Tokyo has begun to support the  multinational forces in the Sinai Peninsula and has offered to fund a  peacekeeping unit in Cambodia.  </P> <P> But the global scope that Japan sketched out Thursday extends far beyond the  confines of Asia or international peacekeeping forces. The Japanese also listed  trade, global debt, the environment and science and technology as issues in  which they want to become involved.  </P></p>

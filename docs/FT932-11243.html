			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Missiles industry locks on new course: The move to joint ventures in Europe's arms sector THE rationalisation of Europe's defence industry yesterday gathered speed with confirmation that British Aerospace and Matra of France are in advanced negotiations to merge their guided weapons activities into a joint company. At last September's Farnborough Air Show, Mr Noel Forgeard, head of the Matra conglomerate's core defence and space activities, was insisting that 'in the missiles business, something has to be done'. At the time, Matra had started talks with BAe about a possible link of their respective guided weapons activities. This led to the proposal to form a joint company with annual sales of more than Pounds 1bn and employing 8,000 people. It would be big enough to compete against larger US missiles manufacturers. 'It is impossible to avoid a restructuring of the missile industry in Europe in the face of what has happened in the US where they are regrouping into gigantic companies,' a Matra official said yesterday. The Cold War spawned more companies in Europe and the US making missiles or systems for missiles than could survive in an age of diminishing government defence budgets. In the US, a reshuffle of the industry has begun in earnest, with Loral's takeover of the former LTV group's guided weapons activities and the sale of General Dynamics' powerful missiles division to Hughes Aircraft, part of General Motors. Hughes and Raytheon, makers of the Patriot, the ground-to-air defence missile used in the Gulf war, are in a class of their own by sheer size, setting a challenge to medium-sized manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic. Cross-border collaboration on a variety of weapons in Europe, designed to pool expertise and meet the high cost of developing new systems, has proved only a partial solution. Agreements have often proved fragile and contentious, with too many collaborative ventures competing for a shrinking market. In the late 1980s, BAe and Matra became increasingly aware of the need to forge more stable cross-border partnerships with other European manufacturers through joint venture companies and equity links. BAe, which launched a sweeping restructuring of its Dynamics missiles division in 1988, first attempted to forge an Anglo-French missiles merger in 1989 with Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled defence group. The merger of BAe's and Thomson-CSF's missiles activities would have created Europe's biggest guided weapons company called Eurodynamics. But the deal collapsed after negotiations were delayed for more than a year by monopoly investigations. BAe sees Matra providing a new opportunity to forge an Anglo-French missiles merger. The original plan was to build on a takeover of BAe's space activities by Matra Marconi Space, a joint venture between Matra and GEC-Marconi of the UK. But the two sides could not agree on a price and the takeover fell through. That did not prevent the two companies continuing and intensifying discussions on the missiles front. For Matra, BAe offered a chance to establish a joint venture company which could be widened to embrace other French, British and German companies. Through a joint venture company with BAe, Matra sees an opportunity to take a leading part in a much-mooted reorganisation of the industry in France, possibly including Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace and defence arm of Daimler-Benz. Matra, which otherwise risked playing a secondary role to Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF in the current French plans to rationalise its missiles industry, will considerably strengthen its negotiating position if it quickly finalises an agreement with BAe. Both BAe and Matra said yesterday that their products were largely complementary, with BAe strong in air-to-air missiles and Matra in ground-to-air weapons. The main conflict of interest between Matra and BAe is in medium-range air-to-air missiles: the French company's Mica and a new 'fire-and-forget' version of BAe's Sky Flash. In January, Mr John Weston, managing director of BAe's defence activities, confirmed he was looking for strategic partners: 'Quite obviously there are some significant international movements at the moment in the consolidation of the industry. If we can find the right joint ventures, with the right sort of financial structure that suits everybody's shareholders, then yes, we are open for joint ventures.' But a BAe-Matra agreement could set the stage for even broader rationalisation of the UK guided weapons industry. Matra has already raised the possibility of further 'vertical integration' which might include GEC-Marconi, the traditional supplier of guided systems for BAe missiles. GEC-Marconi has its own whole-system missile business, a secretive venture it bought from Ferranti International, with a lucrative contract for Abu Dhabi. But its ambitions to evolve into a leading prime contractor for guided weapons have so far failed to bear fruit.

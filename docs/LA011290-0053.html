			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MISS DAISY' CAST SKILLFULLY AVOIDS PITFALLS OF SCRIPT  </P> <P> Morgan Freeman's performances this year in "Lean on Me," "Johnny Handsome,"  and, now, "Driving Miss Daisy," have been among the best reasons to go to the  movies. (He's also in "Glory," the Civil War drama opening today.) Freeman has  an infuriating habit of being extraordinary even in mediocre movies; his  presence, alas, makes them must-sees.  </P> <P> "Driving Miss Daisy," (at selected San Diego County theaters), directed by  Bruce Beresford and adapted by Alfred Uhry from his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1987  play, isn't mediocre. It's musty and schematic, though, with a measured pace  that's meant to incur our respect. This is "quality" theater transferred  relatively intact to the screen.  </P> <P> The central relationship is between Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy), a cranky  Atlanta widow and Hoke (Freeman), the chauffeur hired by Daisy's son Boolie  (Dan Aykroyd) to keep her from plowing her brand-new '48 Packard into the  neighbor's flower beds. The film takes us through 25 years of winsome acrimony  between these two. Their mellowing relationship is meant to mirror the growth  of civil rights in the South. Daisy is Jewish, and so the movie is structured  as a tale of two outcasts bonded by their stubborn pride.  </P> <P> It is to everybody's credit that the stubbornness never gets mushed into  sentimentality, at least not overtly. Freeman and Tandy have their own  performer's pride, and that transfers to their characters. Tandy, in  particular, is almost astringent in her denial of easy emotion. When something  heartfelt occurs in this movie, you accept it without too much squirming. The  disciplined yet intuitive way in which these actors connect is a model of  ensemble performance.  </P> <P> One of the film's pleasant oddities is that Hoke and Daisy seem to look younger  as they grow older. Bickering brings out their human contours; it gets their  spirit up. Hoke plays a canny game with Daisy; he does her bidding without  lapsing into servility.  </P> <P> It would have been easy for Freeman to distance himself from this character by  cuing us with modern attitudes. Instead, he accepts Hoke's subservience as a  characteristic of the man's innate graciousness. Daisy is, in fact, subservient  to him, but he never throws her helplessness back at her. The shadow play  between Hoke and Daisy is immensely subtle, even though the film is structured  as a series of mini-revelations about the nature of interracial brotherhood.  The actors know those lessons don't come easily.  </P> <P> The predictability of "Driving Miss Daisy" (rated PG) derives from the play's  tone of civic uplift. The tensions between Hoke and Daisy exist only to be  resolved. Their 25-year communion is more than a personal triumph; it is  intended as a moral triumph as well. This may be too much baggage for such a  frail vehicle, and the occasional bulletins from the front -- like the bombing  of the local synagogue or a speech by Martin Luther King -- don't seem to be  taking place in Hoke and Daisy's shuttered universe.  </P> <P> Since Uhry bothered to "open up" the play, he should have opened up the cast of  characters a bit more, too. The sequences in which Hoke talks with his friends,  or with Daisy's maid, Idella (Esther Rolle), are revelatory. We can see how he  drops his guard with them, how he moves freer, talks more animatedly. There's  more of an edge to his sequences with Idella, in fact, than with Daisy, and  that's largely because in those moments Uhry isn't pushing his customary  principled restraint.  </P> <P> Rolle's role is small, but it's a major performance. The same indignities that  Hoke has braced himself against all his life have all but destroyed her. But  Idella isn't anybody's mammy, and her sass gives the movie a much-needed jolt  of rage.  </P> <P> It's the sort of rage that would be out of place in Hoke's life, or in  Freeman's performance. I hope nobody chooses to jump on Freeman's work here as  a species of Uncle Tom-ism. By staying within the modest restraints of the  role, Freeman does justice to Hoke's circumstances. The performance is not an  apologia, it's a tribute. Freeman recognizes the heroism of a man who creates a  life for himself based on kindness in an unkind world.  </P> <P> "DRIVING MISS DAISY"  </P> <P> A Warner Brothers release.

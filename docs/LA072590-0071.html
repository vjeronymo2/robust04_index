			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> 11 PICK UP PAPERS FOR COUNCIL ELECTION  </P> <P> Three open City Council seats for November's municipal elections have drawn  heavy interest, with 11 people taking out candidate papers since the filing  period opened last week.  </P> <P> Candidates to date include incumbents Norman P. Murray and Victoria C. Jaffe.  </P> <P> "I think this kind of interest is terrific," said Councilman Robert A. Curtis,  who is not up for reelection. "It's an indication that Mission Viejo residents  are very interested in their local government and how to improve it."  </P> <P> In addition to the two incumbents, others picking up filing papers include Ray  Carolin, Sue Withrow, Marilyn MacDougall, Ed Kearns, Sharon Cody, Alan Gallup,  Joe Lowe and Gary Manley. Mayor Christian W. Keena said he probably will not  run for council again and has not taken out papers.  </P> <P> Martin Schiesl, who also took out papers last week, apparently changed his mind  about running and has returned them, members of the city clerk's office said.  </P> <P> The large turnout has been in part attributed to the community anger raised by  last February's failed attempt to recall Councilman Robert A. Curtis.  </P> <P> The recall effort had the support of all three officials now up for reelection.  And although it also received $350,000 from a single developer, it failed by  approximately 70% to 30%.  </P> <P> Curtis declined on Monday to say if he will be working against the City Council  incumbents.  </P> <P> However, commenting on the sharp divisiveness that has marked council politics  since the city's incorporation two years ago, Curtis said the council is  "fragmented and polarized. We need a cleansing election so voters can determine  what direction they want the city to go." FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

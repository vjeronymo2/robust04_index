			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: My hidden relatives FROM 1985 I lived with a woman as common law man and wife. She died recently intestate. There are no blood relatives alive. Should a step sibling materialise what is my legal position as regards the disposal of her house and possessions? If the deceased left no relatives of the whole blood, the rules of intestacy specified in the Administration of Estates Act 1925 and the Intestates' Estates act 1952 allow brothers and sisters of the half blood or, failing them, uncles and aunts of the half blood to inherit. If anyone in either class were found, they would (together with all others in the same class) inherit all the estate, equally between them if there is more than one. If diligent enquiry produces no one in either class, the Crown will take the estate, but you can make a claim to an ex gratia provision for yourself from the Treasury Solicitors' Bona Vacantia department, it is usually sympathetic. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The 1993 state budget has recorded a  surplus exceeding one billion crowns. Marie Ruzickova is in the  studio with the details.    [Ruzickova] The finance minister [Ivan Kocarnik] said that  total revenue, which amounted to 358 billion crowns, meant that  the budget's revenue of has been fulfilled by 100.8 percent.  Expenditure, amounting to almost 357 billion crowns, was  fulfilled by 100.5 percent.    The Czech Republic is the only country, of those that are  undergoing the process of transformation, that recorded a budget  surplus. Minister Kocarnik thinks this result is a success.    [Begin Kocarnik recording] I regard this result as a  success,  as a further successful step of transformation in the Czech  Republic, which has brought a positive contribution to the  overall stabilization of prices, countered inflation, and  contributed to achieving the basic objectives we set out for  ourselves for the year 1993 [end recording].    [Ruzickova] The budget surplus could have been higher by  another 4.6 billion crowns. This sum is the credit we gave to  Slovakia in clearing transactions. According to Minister  Kocarnik, both sides are considering changes in the  [Czech-Slovak] Payments Agreement. These changes would mean a  gradual abolition of the so called "old bloc" [stary blok] and a  possible widening of the exchange rate margin from 5 to 10  percent. No increase of marginal credit [mezni uver] is  envisaged for the time being.    On talks of the Czech-Slovak property commission, Ivan  Kocarnik said that this commission should meet in a foreseeable  future and outline the final solution to outstanding problems.</p>

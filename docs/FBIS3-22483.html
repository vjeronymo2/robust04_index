Commissioner of prisons Mr. George Chiyabi confirmed the  outbreak but was not aware of the number of deaths at the prison.    But infected inmates told the TIMES yesterday two people  died  on Tuesday night and two last week.    One of the inmates who claimed he had been denied a chance  to  go to Kitwe Central Hospital for treatment said a number of his  colleagues had been attacked by the disease.    Another inmate, Rabson Lupandulo, said the outbreak was a  result of poor prison conditions and bad diet.    Congestion in the cells had contributed to the epidemic  which  has ravaged the prison for almost two weeks.    [Passage omitted]</p>

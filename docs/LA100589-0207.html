			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TO PLAY O.C. SATURDAY;  </P> <P> PREVIN RETURNING AS GUEST CONDUCTOR AFTER BITTER FAREWELL  </P> <P> The past is present for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. After all the changes of  the last six months, it is Andre Previn, the controversial ex-music director,  who opens the season tonight at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and who will  bring the orchestra to the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Saturday  night.  </P> <P> The schedule, of course, was set long before Previn's sudden, bitter  resignation in April and his replacement in August by Esa-Pekka Salonen. He cut  much of the workload he would have carried as music director, including his two  weeks at Hollywood Bowl this summer. But he will still lead the orchestra in  seven weeks of concerts this season, including the first three.  </P> <P> Tuesday, Previn faced the Philharmonic for the first time since his last  concert on April 30. There was, he reported, no awkwardness to the reunion.  </P> <P> "Musicians aren't like that," Previn said. "I felt they were terribly glad to  see me. I had a very nice time, and so did the orchestra."  </P> <P> Orchestra members and other observers also found little hint of tension in the  rehearsal -- which is more than can be said for the Philharmonic management,  which barred reporters from the rehearsal. (Previn, in resigning, stated: "In  the current structure of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it has become obvious to  me that there is no room for a music director.")  </P> <P> "It was a nice rehearsal," said cellist Gloria Lum. "It felt very normal, very  nice and very comfortable. We're used to him. We know what to expect."  </P> <P> When Previn entered, musicians reported, they gave him a round of applause. He  quipped "What's new?" and proceeded to rehearse.  </P> <P> "It was an excellent rehearsal," said violinist Guido Lamell. "I believe it  reflects the things he told us when he left us. He said things had gotten in  the way of his first priority -- to make music. . . . He didn't say anything  like that today."  </P> <P> The orchestra, Lamell added, was generally in "an upbeat mood. It's also the  first day of school -- everybody's happy on the first day of school."  </P> <P> The subject matter was Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. Previn said that, in its  subtlety, the work presented a challenge to the orchestra "after 10 weeks of  playing outdoors," a challenge that the musicians accepted.  </P> <P> Lum concurred. "It's a change for the whole orchestra, just being back inside  the Music Center for one thing, after the Bowl all summer. And it's nice to be  thinking of finer points of music again, because at the Bowl you don't."  </P> <P> Wednesday, Previn and the players turned to Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony.  Previn, in his 3 1/2 years as music director, also opened the previous two  seasons with Shostakovich on the program, something of which he seemed unaware.  </P> <P> "Have I really?" he asked, when questioned about this propensity to begin the  season with Shostakovich. "I suppose he's getting to be the great man of the  20th-Century symphony. The Fourth is a great work, and it's never been done  here. It's certainly not ingratiating -- it's an ice-cold thing, fairly  despondent but glorious to perform."  </P> <P> Previn said that he didn't think there should necessarily be anything different  about a program just because it was the first in the season, other than that it  should feature the orchestra alone, without the distraction of outside  soloists. The soloists for Previn's next programs are members of the  Philharmonic, concertmaster Sidney Weiss and clarinetist Lorin Levee.  </P> <P> Many of the Philharmonic programs this season feature in-house soloists, and  Previn has included several of those in his assignments. "I wanted to make sure  I kept most of the weeks with orchestra soloists," he said. "I wanted the  pleasure of working with those colleagues." Previn will also play piano with  orchestra members in a Brahms program opening the Philharmonic Chamber Music  Society season at Gindi Auditorium on Oct. 16.  </P> <P> Though the orchestra's role in, and feelings about, Previn's departure have  been ambiguous, the players reached after the Tuesday rehearsal returned the  compliment. Whatever regrets there were about the way the situation developed,  all expressed respect for Previn as a musician.  </P> <P> "The circumstances (Tuesday) also reflected a larger truth: Orchestras expect  different things from their music director than they do from a guest," Lamell  said. "I think the orchestra is nicer to a guest conductor than to a music  director, and we were nicer to Andre today than we were when he was music  director.  </P> <P> "It goes both ways. I was reflecting back on his last words to us, when he said  various obstacles had arisen, and I think there were obstacles between him and  the orchestra also, and those obstacles were gone."  </P> <P> For his part, Previn is eager to put the acrimony behind him. "I can't say I  don't regret it happened, but I've gone on."  </P> <P> After his resignation, he went immediately on to a busy summer in Europe. He  conducted the Berlin Philharmonic -- to which he will return in 1990 and 1991  -- and the Vienna Philharmonic, with which he is recording a Richard Strauss  cycle for Telarc Records.  </P> <P> As principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic, Previn led that orchestra in  a Beethoven series in London. With the Royal Philharmonic, he is recording the  Beethoven Symphonies, with all completed but Nos. 1 and 3.  </P> <P> Previn is also busy with a television project called "Mozart on Tour." He is  co-writing and narrating -- in English and German -- 13 one-hour programs, each  built around a different Mozart piano concerto (with soloists including Alicia  de Larrocha, Radu Lupu, Murray Perahia and Previn himself), and shot in a  different city.  </P> <P> The production is by Hellthaler International in association with KCET. The PBS  station will package seven of the episodes for the United States, tentatively  to air locally in June and July of 1991, the bicentennial of Mozart's death.  </P> <P> From here, Previn goes on to a European tour with the Vienna Philharmonic,  which he will also take to Japan in 1991. He returns to Los Angeles for two  weeks of concerts in both January and April.  </P> <P> His April repertory is based on music he will be recording then with the  Philharmonic, Dvorak's "New World" Symphony and Mahler's Fourth Symphony. After  that, his recording work will be with other orchestras.  </P> <P> "I mean, what would be the point" of recording with the Philharmonic? he asked.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Barbara Isenberg contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Zedillo sports his pro-market credentials: Party papers over antipathy as able economist assumes the PRI mantle President Carlos Salinas has selected a bright, pro-market economist to succeed the late Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling party. Mr Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who this week became the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, is considered by many as the most intelligent member of the government. From a humble background, he earned a doctorate in economics from Yale University, became a top central bank official in his twenties, budget minister at 36, and four years later, education minister. The party faithful, however, view Mr Zedillo as dry and politically inept, and deeply resent his nomination. Unlike Mr Colosio, Mr Zedillo does not easily bridge the gulf between party traditionalists and foreign-trained economists who have run the administrative side of the Mexican government for the past decade. Mr Zedillo has never run for elective office, and often appears ill at ease in party functions. 'Mr Zedillo is a cold man, calculating and hard in his decisions and, despite his background, is far from possessing political and social sensitivity,' wrote the columnist Francisco Cardenas Cruz in yesterday's El Universal. Even allowing for the mourning that has followed Mr Colosio's murder, the reception afforded Mr Zedillo in the PRI after his nomination was remarkably cold. 'If they had waited another 24 hours they could not have done this. The PRI would have chosen its own candidate,' said one PRI official who, like many others, bemoaned the imposition of a candidate by President Salinas, and lack of internal democracy. Mr Zedillo, nevertheless, is the strong favourite to win this August's elections. The PRI has been in power for 65 years, has previously united around unpopular candidates, and is well ahead of the opposition in opinion polls. Mr Zedillo was the only eligible candidate certain to preserve and deepen the economic and social reforms of the past six years. Because of his impeccable pedigree as a pro-market economist, Mr Zedillo enjoys broad support from the domestic and foreign business community, and from the US government. If elected, Mr Zedillo is likely to ensure that the same group that has run Mexico for the past six years will remain in power for another six years. Mr Zedillo's close friends and allies include Mr Jose Cordoba, the president's powerful chief of staff, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the trade minister, Mr Miguel Mancera, the central bank governor, and Mr Guillermo Ortiz, deputy finance minister. Under Mexico's constitution no presidential candidates can have worked in government for six months before the election. This stipulation ruled out potential rivals to Mr Zedillo, such as Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister. Although criticised for political failings, Mr Zedillo has proved himself an able administrator while in government. He succeeded in cutting the budget deficit in the early 1990s, and more recently persuaded unions to accept the decentralisation of education policy. 'His contribution to economic reform was fundamental. He controlled spending and brought about a structural reform of public finances,' says Mr Ortiz, the deputy finance minister. Despite such accolades, Mr Zedillo is best known nationally for his farcical attempt to publish new history textbooks. These books revised Mexico's nationalist view of its history, and created a storm from both the left and right. Mr Zedillo had to recall the books and substitutes have not yet been made available. Although the PRI had been lobbying and pressing for the candidacy of Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, its party president, Mr Salinas calculated that after Mr Colosio's assassination, officials would finally put party unity before personal ambition. President Salinas seems to have calculated correctly. Mr Ortiz Arana pledged his loyalty to Mr Zedillo, so did Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in Chiapas, and other party members promised to toe the line. Mr Zedillo also has the advantage of having been campaign manager of Mr Colosio, and thus in a position to claim to be his legitimate successor. In his acceptance speech Mr Zedillo mentioned Mr Colosio's name more than 30 times, and promised to endorse his programme and ideals. Mr Colosio's supporters have nowhere to turn but to Mr Zedillo. Some now say Mr Zedillo was the intellectual force behind Mr Colosio, and largely responsible for thinking up Mr Colosio's programme. 'Mr Zedillo will win the election as the heir of Mr Colosio' says Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, a columnist with Reforma newspaper. 'Mr Colosio is the only thing that is now keeping the party together.' But as Mr Zedillo delivered his acceptance speech, there remained the task of grooming him for office and turning him into a politician of the people. His delivery came across as wooden and stilted, while his wire-rimmed glasses typified his academic background. He also avoided meeting the party faithful, preferring instead to stay closeted in the PRI headquarters with his handful of close advisers.</p>

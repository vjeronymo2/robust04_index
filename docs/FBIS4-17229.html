			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking to journalists in Kiev on Thursday, the  first deputy chairman of the State Nuclear Energy Committee said  that Ukraine is ready to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power  station. Nur Nigmatulin went on to say that before this happened  more power stations would have to be built in order to make up  the deficit.    He said that Ukraine would have to commission a total of six  VVER reactors at the Khmelnitsky, Rovno and Zaporozhye nuclear  stations. This would require a total of $1.02 billion.    On 21 April the third reactor at Chernobyl was brought on  line again after the 18 April incident which registered one on  the international scale.    On 18 April, the safety system at the third reactor was  activated while power was being increased after routine repairs.  This occurred after the water level in the cooling system fell.</p>

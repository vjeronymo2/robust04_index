			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: A double enigma The progress of the period instrument ensembles of the baroque, starting from Bach and Handel, moving inexorably forwards to Mozart, until they felt confident enough even to make the occasional foray into Schumann, Mendlessohn and Brahms, was among the most important features of musical life in the 1980s. But their advance may be about to be halted. Last week a new period romantic orchestra took the stage for the first time, setting its standard flying over the music of the turn of the century, where it intends to stake out its ground. Taking the name of the New Queen's Hall Orchestra after Henry Wood's orchestra founded in 1895, it uses gut strings and narrowbore brass instruments, while promising period style generally - a feature easily assimilated from 78rpm recordings. This first concert, at St John's Smith Square on Friday, featured the strings alone, although wind and brass sections were due to join them at another event out of London the next night. The programme consisted of four favourite pieces for string orchestra, which should have made for a pleasurable but uncontroversial evening; and so the mixed feelings that it generated came as all the greater surprise. Doubts and dissatisfaction mingled here with a very real fascination as to what the performances were trying to tell us. The sound, at least, was marvellous: a blend of rich sonorities, the higher strings sweeter than usual, the lower warmly resonant, far removed from the string sound of today's orchestras and thereby justifying the enterprise. But that surely does not mean that the playing also has to be as uniformly sluggish and cumbersome as it was here. Of the four pieces, under the direction of James Judd, Vaughan Williams's Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis easily worked the best, thanks to the combination of the orchestra's tone colours and the spacious acoustic of St John's. Neither Dvorak's nor Elgar's Serenades for strings had much vitality, while Tchaikovsky's limped along with barely any passion at all. Was it the conductor, the players, the instruments, or a lack of rehearsal time? Difficult to say, although the names of the musicians printed in the programme suggest that this is an ensemble with some very experienced members, and one would not normally have expected from them the infelicities of ensemble and tuning that marred these performances. Perhaps orchestras, especially new 'old' ones, are just not born in a day. The New Queen's Hall Orchestra has shown it is more than a gimmick and one at least looks forward to its next appearance with genuine interest. * * * The following night another enigma was set to be challenged at an all-Elgar programme at the Royal Festival Hall. There has long been speculation about the so-called 'hidden' theme that Elgar claimed lies behind the Enigma Variations and one recent claimant to be the answer was tried out in public before a performance of the work on Saturday. This solution, proposed by Joseph Cooper and seconded by Dr Jerrold Northrop Moore, the Elgar scholar, suggests that Elgar's main theme is in fact a re-working of part of the slow movement of Mozart's 'Prague' Symphony. The theme bears some of the same notes and similarities in rhythm, while Elgar's love for the music of Mozart and his use of it in his early days as an exemplar towards composing large-scale musical structures are duly noted. Whether this is enough, however, to add up to Elgar's description of the hidden theme as 'another and larger theme' going through and over the whole set of variations seems highly questionable. As with the premises of the New Queen's Hall Orchestra concert, what we were being offered here was merely one possible answer to the enigma, for which in this case there is no documentary explanation. This time the performances, by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Charles Mackerras, were according to late 20th-century standards, both as to style and execution. Good playing generally, with all the brilliance of sound and ensemble that a top orchestra today can easily muster. It would certainly be a shame if the qualities that make Mackerras's Elgar so enjoyable - its vitality, clarity and quickness of response - were to become a thing of the past. Elgar's own recordings suggest there is no reason why they should.</p>

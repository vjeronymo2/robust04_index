			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Phineas Theboko on the "PM </F> Newswrap" program]    [Text] Bophuthatswana's Rooigrond Central Prison was set on  fire this afternoon as thousands of prisoners protested,  demanding to be allowed to participate in the forthcoming  democratic elections. According to the acting deputy  commissioner of the homeland's prisons services, Colonel Hennie  du Toit, no details of the damages were available as they were  still awaiting a full report. He also refused to confirm the  number of prisoners involved in the protest.    Rooigrond Central Prison is the biggest prison in  Bophuthatswana, which accommodated former political prisoners  involved in the 1988 abortive coup as well as death row awaiting  prisoners. Today's violence in the former homeland was the  second incident within a period of two weeks following the  gutting down of Mafikeng prison in Mmabatho recently. Damages  estimated at 100,000 [rand] were caused when prisoners went on  rampage setting the prison on fire, demanding to be allowed to  vote. The co-administrator for Bophuthatswana, Mr. Job Mokgoro,  addressed protesting prisoners last week in an attempt to calm  down the situation.</p>

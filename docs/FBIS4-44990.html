			<p>CSO     [Text] Economic Service. The consolidation of ministries,  of which much is being said these days in agricultural circles,  was one of the subjects we discussed in our interview with Dr.  'Isa Kalantari, minister of agriculture. In this discussion many  issues became clear to us, as economic writers. We did not know  that one-third of the ministers in Vietnam's Government deal  with agricultural issues. We did not know, for example, that New  Zealand, whose agriculture and animal husbandry are famous, has  done careful scientific planning to establish a separate  ministry for each agricultural field, and after it achieves its  goal they dissolve that ministry and then start anew in another  field.    Fortunately, Dr. Kalantari knows no fatigue, and in speaking  with him one can discuss every agricultural subject. Whenever  the subject is progress and development, his face is cheerful,  and whenever he feels that a danger threatens Iran's  agriculture, sadness and sorrow are evident on his face.    In this interview we came to the conclusion that if any kind  of change or consolidation were done without expert study and  research in agriculture, which covers one-third of the nation's  economy, it would be a national crime. Iran's farmers had four  ministries at one time, at one time they had three, at one time  they had two, and at one time they had one, and these baseless  changes have transformed Iran from a food exporter to one of the  region's main food importers.    Below you will read the second part of the interview with  Dr.  Kalantari.    [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! If you are willing, let us digress  from  the main subject and talk about the consolidation of ministries.  As you know, the Majles has approved the consolidation of the  Ministry of Industries, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, and  the Ministry of Mines and Metals, and it is said that it is also  studying consolidation of the Ministry of Agriculture and the  Ministry of Construction Jihad. What is your view on this?    [Kalantari] Well, whatever is "the law" must be implemented.    [ABRAR] Yes. There is no doubt about this. However, we are  asking you this question not as a minister of agriculture, but  as Dr. 'Isa Kalantari, a real person, a man whose studies and  executive occupations have had to do with the nation's  agriculture for more than a decade. We are asking the Dr.  Kalantari who has seen many of the nations that have  agricultural industries, and who has close familiarity with the  way they work.    [Kalantari] Well, we must ask what is the goal of doing  this?  If the goal is to have one organization responsible for the  agricultural sector, we must sit and see what this will  accomplish for our agriculture. I say this not as the minister  of agriculture, but as someone who at least has the right to  express an opinion on this matter, someone with 13 to 14 years  experience in agricultural executive work and who has  familiarity with the nation's problems, and who knows what our  problems are in the agricultural sector.    [ABRAR] Yes, in view of the things you mentioned, we wanted  to know, what views have you put forward in the meetings to make  decisions on this important matter.    [Kalantari] Not in this matter, but even in the matter of  food industries, which you mentioned previously, we are mostly  observers. They do not even ask us in what part of the country a  certain food industry should be located.    For example, it is possible that they will give an agreement  in principle in a certain region to a food industry that is not  a part of our system of cultivation at all.    [ABRAR] Do you mean that these kinds of decisions are made  without even coordinating it with you?    [Kalantari] Yes, these decisions are made without  coordination with us.    [ABRAR] In view of the close similarity of the work of the  Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Construction Jihad,  in your view what organizations from your ministry should be  attached to the Ministry of the Construction Jihad, and which  ones from the Ministry of the Construction Jihad should be added  to your ministry?    [Kalantari] I do not see many organizations that should be  removed from these two ministries. The development of food  industries should have a role in both of these ministries.    [ABRAR] Is the development of food industries now under the  mantle of the Ministry of Industries?    [Kalantari] Yes. I am not saying that we should be in charge  of the executive activity, but views must ultimately be given.  Of course, in general the goals must be to improve the  agricultural situation. This executive officer or that executive  officer is not personally important to me.    [ABRAR] Is there no communication among the ministries? For  example, in the production of agricultural machinery, aren't  "needs" taken into account, with production done on the basis of  needs?    [Kalantari] Sometimes needs are taken into account and  sometimes they are not.    [ABRAR] Meaning that these communications are not maintained  constantly between the ministries?    [Kalantari] These communications are very little. When they  wish to do so, they establish them, when they do not wish to do  so, they do not.    [ABRAR] How necessary are these communications?    [Kalantari] They are absolutely necessary!    [ABRAR] Is this discussed in the Council of Ministers as a  problem?    [Kalantari] Of course, it has been discussed, and it was  decided that a review would be done of the government  organizations.    [ABRAR] What is your personal opinion about the  consolidation  of the two ministries?    [Kalantari] In my personal view, not only would this  consolidation be of no benefit to the country, but as a solution  to several small problems, it will create larger problems. In  the area of production, we are now nearing the leaps we desire  to make. We are preparing infrastructure. We will suddenly be  faced with a huge expansion with which we will be absolutely  unable to deal. I think that if one ministry comes into  existence, the official in charge of it will not have the  ability to think, nor will he have the ability to monitor the  situation. This is a greater task than you think.    [ABRAR] Especially when in agricultural matters producers  are  absolutely affiliated with the government, they are absolutely  supported by the government.    [Kalantari] This is really the main problem. If our  agricultural producers were like the industrial producer where  there is overall management, they would all be literate and  their producing units would be big. In this case we would not  have subsidies where the government would have to intervene.    [ABRAR] At a time when our country needs to do more to  improve its agricultural lands, we hear officials saying that  billions of tumans worth of the nation's pastures, soil and  forests are on the verge of destruction. For example, they say  that 64 percent of the nation's soil resources remain unused.  What is the government doing? Why don't you do something?    [Kalantari] In view of the nature of our country, natural  resources must be a separate matter. There should be a separate  ministry for that. I believe that if we want to preserve our  water and soil, for the next 30 to 40 years we must rebuild our  natural resources in a mobilized and revolutionary way.    [ABRAR] By mobilized and revolutionary, do you mean outside  administrative limits?    [Kalantari] Yes, outside the administrative bureaucracy.  That  is, all the nation's resources, when idle, should be mobilized  to preserve natural resources.    I mean all forces, even military forces in peacetime. Even  during summer vacations, students should be used for this  national mobilization, which is very vital.    [ABRAR] Have you presented this idea anywhere?    [Kalantari] It has been presented again and again, but we  have yet to reach a conclusion. What I am saying is that to  improve the agricultural situation the two existing ministries  are not enough.    [ABRAR] You are now emphasizing work on natural resources.  Will a transfer of activity, such as transferring from the  Ministry of the Construction Jihad to the Ministry of  Agriculture, be useful for accomplishing this?    [Kalantari] Of course it depends on what decision is made.  Transferring will not help at all. For example, it will make no  difference to transfer activity from the Ministry of the  Construction Jihad to the Ministry of Agriculture. The issue is  that more attention should be given to natural resources. The  ability to work must be increased.    [ABRAR] Other than natural resources, what other areas need  more attention?    [Kalantari] The next problem is rural development.    [ABRAR] In view of these problems, in view of the fact that  there are 60,000 rural areas in the country, don't you think  that if the Ministry of the Construction Jihad were closer it  would be more useful to the Ministry of Agriculture?    [Kalantari] No, this still needs work. Rural development  must  be done.    [ABRAR] Rural development is being done now. Is there mutual  cooperation?    [Kalantari] Perhaps there is not a lot of need for  cooperation. An executive officer can work on it, but there are  few resources and little attention. More attention must be given  to the nation's rural development, water and soil. This is a  vast task.    I really don't know, in view of the vastness of the task,  what those people who want to have one ministry in the  agricultural sector are thinking about.    [ABRAR] I think this idea is in its early stages. It is  still  at the level of murmurs, talk, and study.    [Kalantari] No, a special commission has also been formed.  However, this is a dangerous decision. It is a decision that  will definitely bring our problems up to 100, yet the benefits  probably won't even come to 10.    [ABRAR] Apparently they are considering manpower adjustment  and reducing costs. They are thinking of reducing the number of  buildings and other things...    [Kalantari] You have put your finger on an interesting  point.  Those who favor consolidation are thinking for example that if  two ministries become one, there will be seven or eight fewer  deputy ministers, 30 to 40 fewer general managers and five to  six fewer consultants.    [ABRAR] Yes, it is just so. There will be reductions here.    [Kalantari] Yes, there might be a total of 200 fewer people.  On the other hand, what would be lost? The respected Majles  deputies and other officials who will be deciding must consider  what return we will get for the country on an tuman we invest in  these circumstances, and what will the return be under the new  conditions?    We employ thousands of people in the agricultural sector. We  must also meet our needs in the training, research,  infrastructure, and other sectors. Definitely, if we want to  have an active agricultural sector, we will not reduce manpower,  we will increase it. These increases will take place in the  specialist sectors, for our agriculture must necessarily move in  that direction. Apart from that, if manpower is reduced by 200  people, they will be employed elsewhere.    [ABRAR] What about the administrative buildings? Won't we  save in this area?    [Kalantari] It is even possible that 10 to 15 buildings will  be added, with a possible value of 2 billion or 10 billion  tumans, but what will we be losing? The losses will be in the  hundreds of billions of tumans. Economic, social, and scientific  accounting, writing and adding and subtraction must be done, and  then a decision must be made.    Of course, whatever decision the respected Majles makes will  be implemented. However, I think that neither now nor in the  next 10 to 20 years should we be thinking of reducing the size  of the organizations in the agricultural sector. Ultimately, we  will have to expand it.    Agriculture has a role in one-third of the nation's economy.    We must give more attention, much, much more attention to  it.    [ABRAR] There have been many changes in the administration  of  the agricultural sector in our country. Sometimes these changes  have been damaging. During one period the agricultural sector  had four ministries (the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry  of Agriculture and Consumer Materials, the Ministry of Natural  Resources, and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs);  it had three during one period (the Ministry of Agriculture, the  Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Cooperatives  and Rural Affairs); during one period it had two ministries (the  Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Ministry  of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs); and during one period it had  one ministry (the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development).    Several years after the revolution responsibilities were  divided with the establishment of the Ministry of the  Construction Jihad, and now that the responsibilities have been  divided, and now that after several years these two ministries  have become established, they are thinking of change again.    The question, though, is won't our agriculture be damaged by  all this change? In your view, as a person who is educated and  is a specialist in this field and who has worked in the  agricultural sector for 12 to 13 years in various capacities,  does our agricultural sector need several ministries? I have  heard that in some some countries they have four or five active  ministries in the agricultural sector. There is even a country  like New Zealand, which creates a ministry in a specific field  such as fisheries for 20 to 25 years, and then converts this  ministry to function under another ministry (agriculture) after  activating that field, and they establish another ministry in  another field.    [Kalantari] I think our agriculture needs more than two  ministries. I think there should now be one organization  responsible for rural development, another responsible for the  nation's natural resources, and another responsible for the  nation's agriculture. This need will exist for our country for  the next 20 to 30 years.</p>

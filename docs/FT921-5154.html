			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / India cuts support to public sector The Indian government is cutting financial support to the public sector  - once the keystone of Indian socialism - more rapidly than official policy pronouncements suggest, David Housego reports from New Delhi. The administration of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is seeking, however, to minimise job losses that could lead to a confrontation with labour. He told parliament yesterday that as of now 'not a single worker has been thrown out of employment.' His statement came as the Janata Dal and left-wing parties called for a national strike to protest against what they call 'an anti-poor' budget. Senior officials disclosed yesterday that the government's net contribution towards capital spending by the public sector - steel, railways, fertilisers and other state-owned industries will drop next year by 16 per cent to Rs35.3bn (Pounds 768m). As a result the government's net share of capital spending by the public sector will have fallen to 9.6 per cent from 18.5 per cent only four years ago.</p>

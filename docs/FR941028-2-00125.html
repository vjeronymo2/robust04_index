			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=50 g=1 f=1 --> SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=41 g=1 f=1 -->  <RINDOCK>[Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34885/October 24, 1994] </RINDOCK> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 --> Customer Service Plan of the Securities and Exchange Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to Executive Order 12862 issued as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vice President's National Performance Review, the Securities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exchange Commission (SEC) developed a customer service plan. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of the plan is to enhance investor protection through an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved investor education effort and a redirection of resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to augment the SEC's responsiveness to investor concerns and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints. The plan submitted to the Vice President on September  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8, 1994 was modified slightly on October 24, 1994. The modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SEC is responsible for protecting investors through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement of the federal securities laws and oversight and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation of the securities markets. Individual and institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors have trillions of dollars invested in securities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mutual funds in the United States and abroad. While the SEC does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not approve or guarantee any investments, it is responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring that securities issuers provide full disclosure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material information to investors and that markets adhere to fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investors deal directly with the SEC through its Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consumer Affairs, which is responsible for processing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responding to inquiries and complaint letters from the public. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal 1993, the SEC received over 34,700 investor complaints and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inquiries. Although the SEC has no authority to provide legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representation to investors, the SEC may request information from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brokerage firms and securities exchanges regarding particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems. The SEC obtains invaluable leads from investors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 18% of investigations each year have resulted, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least in part, from investor complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general public also deals directly with the SEC through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its Public Reference Rooms located in Washington, D.C., New York  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> City, and Chicago. These facilities maintain a library of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporate filings, Commission releases, and other documents for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use by the public. The SEC staff provide assistance to the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in locating and obtaining information and in using the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic filing system, known as EDGAR. In fiscal 1993, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities had nearly 45,000 visitors requesting nearly 63,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents and microfiche, and over 121,000 telephone inquiries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its role of supervising the public securities markets, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEC processes and reviews the filings of more than 13,000 entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are required to file prospectuses, annual and quarterly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, proxy statements and other informational documents. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also acts on the rule filings of the various stock exchanges and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-regulatory organizations. Efficiency is paramount for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time-sensitive filings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of its diverse customer base and the importance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its work to investors and the financial markets, efficient and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective customer service is a top priority at the SEC. The SEC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has undertaken several initiatives to improve its ``user-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> friendliness'' and to educate investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Mutual Fund Surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

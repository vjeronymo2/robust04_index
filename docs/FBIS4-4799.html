			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The International  Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco)  published a statement on March 25 concerning the grave situation  prevailing in the Korean peninsula.    The United States not only broke up the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks but is openly threatening to resume "Team  Spirit" joint military exercises, deploy Patriot missiles and  beef up the U.S. forces in South Korea, the statement said, and  continued:    A grave situation is now prevailing on the Korean peninsula  due to such provocative moves of the United States.    The Cilreco condemns such dangerous moves of the United  States that pose a threat to peace and security in Asia and the  rest of the world, and calls upon the world's peaceloving forces  to turn out for the relaxation of the tensions on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

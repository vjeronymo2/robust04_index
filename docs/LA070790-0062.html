			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERIAN REBELS SEIZE PORT NEAR DOE'S MANSION  </P> <P> Rebels firing heavy artillery attacked the port of Monrovia and fought a sea  battle Friday near the fortified mansion where Liberian President Samuel K. Doe  is trying to cling to power with a crumbling army.  </P> <P> Guerrillas moved in to the port, less than 2 miles from Doe's Atlantic beach  fortress, telling soldiers to surrender, residents said.  </P> <P> "Don't die for Doe," rebels told the demoralized and disorganized troops.  </P> <P> One witness said he later saw three carloads of soldiers, dressed in civilian  clothes, returning to central Monrovia, a city on a peninsula joined to the  port by two bridges.  </P> <P> Plumes of smoke from explosions rose from the city outskirts, and automatic  rifle and artillery fire echoed across the besieged capital from dawn until  noon.  </P> <P> A rebel fishing trawler fired at a coast guard cutter about 5 miles offshore.  The trawler, which hijacked a shipload of rice for the rebels Sunday, then gave  chase, firing again before disappearing over the horizon.  </P> <P> The United States, which has offered to evacuate Doe, supplied water to his  mansion under heavy Marine guard. Four American vehicles, with black tinted  windows, escorted a water tanker to the mansion, a witness said.  </P> <P> The rebels, who invaded from Ivory Coast six months ago, now control all land  routes out of the capital.  </P> <P> Doe, who seized power in 1980, has declined a U.S. offer to help him leave  Liberia as rebels led by his former associate, Charles Taylor, tighten their  grip on Monrovia.  </P> <P> Doe has offered to resign, on condition that his safety and that of his  minority Krahn tribe is guaranteed.  </P> <P> Washington has a task force of 2,300 Marines and four Navy ships off the coast  to evacuate foreigners if necessary.  </P> <P> Monrovia's 500,000 people spent much of Friday searching for food and carrying  buckets of water from dwindling wells. The capital has been without water for  nine days and without electricity for a week.  </P> <P> Most shops and markets have been closed since Monday and some people have been  begging for food, or foraging for leaves to eat from waste ground.  </P></p>

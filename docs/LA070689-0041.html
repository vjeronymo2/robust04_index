			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET'S EAT OUT: EMPRESS PAVILION: A NEW DIRECTION IN CHINATOWN  </P> <P> The opening of the Empress Pavilion shows that big things are happening in  Chinatown. And this restaurant is really big. It can seat 600 for dim sum, has  14 kitchen chefs, two barbecue chefs and a dim sum crew of 15.  </P> <P> Carts laden with tempting snacks roll through the huge room from 9 a.m. (8 a.m.  on weekends) until mid-afternoon. Then it's time to prepare for dinner, which  is no small project considering the 175-item menu.  </P> <P> For years, a market called Yee Sing Chong and a parking lot occupied this site.  They've been replaced by the bulky, brand new Bamboo Plaza, which includes a  parking structure, a market that opened last week, spaces promised to several  eating places and, on the second level, the Empress Pavilion.  </P> <P> The restaurant departs from the old Chinatown tradition of ornate carvings,  gilt dragons and red plush. It's a serene room with clean, simple lines, pale,  pink-tinged walls, a burgundy print carpet and touches of aqua in the recessed  ceiling and chairs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A New Direction  </P> <P> The kitchen goes in new directions too. Witness such dim sum as shrimp mousse  wrapped in fine strands of potato and then deep-fried so that it looks like a  tiny curly porcupine. Or shrimp in a translucent wrapper with a thick band of  mashed taro around its waist, like a life preserver. Or a morsel of beef  wrapped in a thin sheet of pineapple. Or shrimp rolled in mango and accompanied  by thick, sweet, yellow mayonnaise.  </P> <P> Most of these ideas work well. But the chunk of beef in pineapple was too heavy  for the delicate, salad-like presentation. And thin slices of veal wrapped  around enoki mushrooms were dry and chewy rather than "tender," as the menu  promised. The veal appears in a list of "gourmet selections" on the dinner  menu. A companion dish, sauteed prawns with honey-glazed walnuts, succeeds or  fails depending upon whether one likes the surprising sauce -- mayonnaise  blended with Thousand Island dressing.  </P> <P> An appetizer in a similar vein, served at the restaurant's grand opening party  last week, featured mayonnaise-coated shrimp belted with a longan and impaled  on a pick with a strawberry slice. This combination of meat and fruit is summer  food. There will be sturdier fare in winter.  </P> <P> The Empress Pavilion is a serious, Hong Kong-style restaurant, aiming at top  level food and service. Executive chef Yiu Leung worked in Hong Kong for 20  years. Manager Jimmy P. Y. Chiu was once assistant manager at the Jade Garden  in Star House, Hong Kong, a restaurant that also yielded the chief prep chef,  Wing Kai So.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rich-Tasting Catfish  </P> <P> The kitchen can turn out superlative food. At dinner one night, we had a clay  pot of rich-tasting catfish with toasty whole garlic cloves, stir-fried  asparagus as perfect as it was simple, and wonderful braised E-Fu noodles that  were embellished only with straw mushrooms and thin yellow Chinese chives.  </P> <P> My Chinese companions liked the poached chicken with Chinese ham, although the  meat was a bit sturdy, as one might expect from an American-bred bird. And the  shark's fin soup with crab would have been excellent if the crab hadn't added  an unwelcome strong flavor. We followed that with large scallops stuffed with  shrimp mousse that were presented one to a customer.  </P> <P> But my heart belongs to the dim sum. There are at least 60 varieties, and  they're as good, sometimes better, than those in Hong Kong. Here, fried  water-chestnut cakes are sweet and fresh. When I had them in Hong Kong  recently, they tasted of everything else that had been cooked in the oil.  </P> <P> The familiar barbecued pork buns, shrimp dumplings, beef balls and egg tarts  are available. If you're willing to advance beyond these, try a thick rice  noodle that is embedded with dried shrimp and green onions, fried until  slightly crusty and topped with hoisin sauce and sesame seeds. Bird's nest  dumplings come in a bowl of velvety broth. Chiu Chow-style fun gor, a steamed  dumpling, contains preserved vegetable, meat and tiny shrimp. And stuffed  squash is glorious when it is bright green mo gwa cut into circles, filled with  shrimp, pork and mushrooms and topped with dried scallops, cilantro and a bit  of salted egg yolk.  </P> <P> The dim sum menu includes several rice and noodle dishes. The top-of-the-line  Empress Pavilion pan-fried noodles are covered with shrimp, fish, squid and  scallops, each beautifully succulent. The popular Singapore-style,  curry-flavored, fried rice noodles become Fukien-style rice noodles when the  curry powder is eliminated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bowlful of Tofu  </P> <P> Then there are the sweets, among them hot tapioca pudding flavored with  coconut; cool, fruit-topped mango pudding; a steamed cake with glaringly yellow  egg filling, and an absolutely marvelous bowlful of hot fresh tofu in brown  sugar syrup.  </P> <P> At night, double-boiled milk pudding turns into Chinese-style creme brulee,  even though this airy concoction of egg whites, milk, syrup and ginger juice  has no browned sugar crust. Perhaps the name change is aimed at customers new  to Chinese food, who will also appreciate the two set dinners that end with  fortune cookies and the explanation of moo shu pork as "burrito a la Chinois."  </P> <P> Prices range from modest ($1.60, $2.20 and $3.00 per order of dim sum and $4.95  for many of the noodle dishes at lunch) to expensive for luxury foods such as  braised superior sharks fin ($40 a bowl). Other dinner prices are reasonable  considering the upscale thrust of this restaurant. A number of seafood dishes,  including deep-fried oysters, rock cod fillet with crab meat sauce and fried  squid with garlic pepper, are $6.50 and sweet and sour pork is only $5.50. The  set dinners, served for two or more, are $9.80 and $12.80 and include soup,  appetizers, one entree per person, dessert, rice, the fortune cookies and tea.  </P> <P>  Empress Pavilion, 988 N.

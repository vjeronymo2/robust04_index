			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Tourism Dr. Mamduh al-Biltaji, </F> by Sa'id Shalash in Cairo; date not given--first two paragraphs  are AL-MAJALLAH introduction]    [Text] When Egypt's political leadership selected Dr.  Mamduh al-Biltaji, the Public Information Authority chairman, to  be appointed minister of tourism in Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's latest  cabinet, some people wondered about the connection with tourism  of a man who has spent his entire life in the information field.  For tourism to be successful, it has to be managed by an  economist. Those who hold this opinion are justified, especially  since Dr. al-Biltaji has assumed responsibility of the Ministry  of Tourism after one of the most successful ministers of Dr.  'Atif Sidqi's cabinet, namely Minister Fu'ad Sultan who was able  to realize for Egypt a revenue of $2.5 billion from tourism in  1992. Minister Sultan encouraged the private sector to invest in  tourism, thus giving it a great boost. He was also the first man  to call for specialization in the tourism sector. Sultan is a  well-known banker who is acknowledged for his capability.    What many do not know is that the new minister of tourism  has  a doctorate in economics and another in political science. With  his experience in information, Dr. al-Biltaji has mastered the  art of dealing with domestic and foreign media people as a  result of long years of work (17 years) that have tied him to  these people. Such a man is needed now, especially since  Egyptian tourism is experiencing a deep crisis that has reduced  tourism revenues from $2.5 billion to $2.1 billion. This crisis  has resulted from the terrorist acts that have been perpetrated  in Egypt. The Western media has played a major role in  exaggerating these acts. As a consequence, tourism firms have  excluded Egypt from their program for this year. However, there  is an $42-million plan to make up for these losses, according to  Dr. al-Biltaji. Following is the text of the interview:    [Shalash] Since you assumed responsibility of the Egyptian  Ministry of Tourism, you have been declaring that this ministry  seeks to turn tourism into the locomotive pulling Egypt's  development and that you will enhance tourism, which has been in  a crisis as a result of two consecutive blows: the Kuwait  liberation war and the terrorist acts of the fall and winter of  1992--acts which persist to this day. So, how do you envision  accomplishing these goals, and how will tourism become the  development locomotive in a country with a population of 60  million people?    [al-Biltaji] When I said that tourism is the locomotive that  pulls development in Egypt, I was fully aware of what I was  saying. I still say the same thing and I work for its  implementation. I mean by this that tourism isn't just a  railroad car in the development train but the locomotive that  pulls the entire train, without replacing any of its cars. The  foreign currency revenue basket is supplied by three elements,  namely: the Suez Canal, remittances from expatriate workers, and  tourism. Tourism possesses characteristics that make it eligible  to outdistance and surpass other small elements of foreign  revenue, because tourism is an immediately exportable product.  Consequently, the element of time is, in this case, immediately  embodied economically and financially. In other words, I can  export tourism immediately, because the product is ready. This  is the first thing.    Second, tourism, remittances from expatriate Egyptians, Suez  Canal revenues, and oil revenues constitute altogether the four  elements of which the big-four assembly consists. The difference  is that tourism is not depletable, has no ceiling, and isn't  susceptible to labor market fluctuations.    Third, tourism is a labor-intensive industry, meaning that  one tourist creates work opportunities for 1.7 citizens. There  is also the so-called tourism multiplier. This multiplier is a  very large group of industries and crafts that develop and grow  the more active tourism becomes.    Tourism isn't just hotels, restaurants, airplane tickets,  and  buses, but also an integrated number of industries: moquette,  rugs, chinaware, bed covers, tables, spare parts, soap, and  detergents. This means laborers, carpenters, boatmen, smelters,  plumbers, machinists, drivers, cooks, and employees.    [Shalash] What are the true losses that have emanated from  the crisis Egyptian tourism is experiencing?    [al-Biltaji] Last year, 1993, we lost $1.5 billion. In 1992,  revenues were $2.5 billion. Perhaps the serious nature of the  terrorist acts and their reverberations in the Western media  have intensified the crisis of Egyptian tourism and resulted in  a big drop in the demand for Egyptian tourist sites. This crisis  has motivated some tour organizers and international tourist  firms to exclude Egypt from their marketing programs. If demand  continues to be low, Egypt will continue to be excluded from  international marketing programs (group tours), and this would  harbor serious harbingers of future demand, and even of future  investment in the Egyptian tourism sector. Subsequently, the  other sectors tied to the tourism sector, such as vocational,  industrial, commercial, and banking activities, will also be  affected.    [Shalash] What is your plan to boost tourism in the coming  phase under the canopy of attacks that continue to be committed  against tourists in Upper Egypt?    [al-Biltaji] Terrorist acts against tourists are few if  compared with other countries where similar incidents occur. To  date, only three tourists have been hurt. I blame the Western  media, but not all of them, for the way they describe the  incidents. I have actually met with foreign reporters in Egypt  and explained to them the dimensions of what has happened. There  is a demand on the international media to make the scoop and to  be the front runner in reporting developments. If information  isn't supplied to the media, they will gather it from any source  that may misinterpret the information and may misdirect it.  Every media person has an urgent need for information, and one  can either provide him with the information or he will gather it  any way he can.    The plan to boost tourism that we have drafted for 1994 is  based on increasing demand and on promoting the investment and  development opportunities in our tourist areas. The plan also  offers projects in these area to likely investors all over the  world, meaning that it promotes the demand side and exerts  efforts for the supply side in the tourism equation. The plan  devotes concerted attention to boosting demand in six major  international markets that export tourists to Egypt, namely the  United States, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan [no sixth  market mentioned].    [Shalash] What is this plan's total budget?    [al-Biltaji] It is estimated at $42 million.    [Shalash] How will this sum be secured?    [al-Biltaji] From the state's public treasury, the Tourism  Fund, and the private tourism sector. The government has  actually agreed to supply the full sum, and implementation of  the plan has already started. By the end of 1994, the plan seeks  to achieve the peak revenue of 1992, i.e., $2.1 billion instead  of the $1.3 billion achieved in 1993.    [Shalash] What will be the focus of activity in the targeted  markets?    [al-Biltaji] To amend Egypt's image; to put terrorist acts  within their correct context and dimensions; to appeal to the  consumer directly through television and through specialized and  unspecialized major press and news agencies; to strengthen the  bond with conventional channels of distribution, such as tour  organizers, travel agents, incentive-offering houses, conference  organizers, and airline associations and companies; to enhance  the standard of materials used to boost sales; to implement a  program to market the Egyptian tourist product; to utilize the  system of tourist convoys; to participate in international  conferences; to draft a well-studied program to invite leaders  in the field of tourism; and to establish a mechanism for  periodic followup.    [Shalash] Where does Arab tourism fall on the Egyptian  tourism-boosting map? Has Arab tourism been affected by the  latest terrorist acts, and has the Arab media performed the same  role performed by some Western media?    [al-Biltaji] The Arab market has its special characteristic  and it is an important market in exporting tourists to Egypt.  The plan takes into account the need to exert concerted efforts  in this market, using the proper instruments, such as tourist  convoys and host programs. The plan also takes into account  intensified contacts with official and professional circles and  increased reliance on the satellite television channel and on  Egyptian radio and press. At the same time, the plan disregards  some high-cost promotion instruments, such as television  commercials, press advertisements, and tourism-promotion  offices. This is why we have decided to shut down the Egyptian  Tourism Office in Kuwait.    Arab tourism to Egypt represents 40 percent of the  international tourist traffic coming into our country. The  effect on Arab tourism has been slight when compared to the drop  in other markets.    The Egyptian minister asserted that the importance of Arab  tourism to Egypt surpasses economic and social considerations.  Tourism is a main element that bolsters solidarity and  understanding, and "we urge Egyptian citizens to go for tourism  in the Arab countries, because an Arab tourist in Egypt and an  Egyptian tourist in the Arab world is a citizen primarily. An  Arab tourist in Egypt is a first-class citizen and a tourist who  comes to his history and his environment and who deals with a  society that favors and welcomes him.    As for the Arab media, they have been committed to the truth  since the start of the terrorist acts, except for a few. I meet  with Arab reporters in Cairo, and I have been tied to them by  good relations, since I was head of the Information Authority  throughout recent years.    [Shalash] You have signed an agreement with Israel and  Turkey  to establish the East Mediterranean Tourism Organization. But  there are fears that Israel will deal a blow to Egyptian tourism  in particular. Fears abound these days among ordinary Egyptians  that Israel has had a role in the latest developments [terrorist  acts], especially since the success of ASTA [American Society of  Travel Agents] 1992 and Egypt's excellent rise on the world's  tourism map have disturbed many of the region's tourist  countries?    [al-Biltaji] There is absolutely no fear of cooperation with  Israel in this regard, because Egypt's tourism resources are  unrivaled. Egypt possesses one-third of the world's antiquities,  and it possesses natural elements, such as sun, air, shores, and  hospitable people, that are rarely found in another country.    [Shalash] What is tourism's position in the political  leadership's mind?    [al-Biltaji] President Mubarak devotes great attention to  tourism, and he goes personally to tourist sites in Luxor and  the Red Sea to encourage greatly tourism investors visiting  Egypt.    [Shalash] Tourism development activity in new tourist sites  was at the peak of success prior to 1993. Has investment and  development activity declined by the same degree as tourist  numbers and tourism revenues?    [al-Biltaji] Investment activity hasn't been affected by the  latest developments. The government has issued a number of laws  and regulations that ensure that the wheel of development keeps  on turning and that encourage the private sector to participate  effectively in this area. Incentives include free foreign  exchange transactions and unrestricted remittance of profits to  the outside world; the right of non-Egyptians to fully own  investment projects; tax exemptions for profits emanating from  tourist project expansions; and exemption from the proportionate  revenue tax, from registration, documentation, and announcement  fees for all contracts connected with the project. The  incentives also include the levying of a uniform customs fee  amounting to 5 percent of the value of goods and equipment  imported for a project. Moreover, the incentives make it  impermissible to seize or confiscate the assets of investment  firms and give these firms the right to re-export their full  capital.    The above incentives come on top of other facilities, such  as  sale and lease to investors at token prices, the investor's  freedom to determine the price of his services and his profits  without intervention by the government, and the easy and prompt  acquisition of approvals and permits for tourist projects.    [Shalash] The Ministry of Aviation has been separated from  the Ministry of Tourism in the latest Cabinet. The Civil  Aviation Authority has been placed under the control of the  Ministry of Transport; Cairo Airport and Air Egypt have been  placed under Cabinet control. Moreover, tourist companies and  hotels have, under the canopy of the new specialization laws,  been placed under the control of the public business sector.  Will this result in lack of coordination between these sectors,  even though they all serve the same thing, namely tourism, or is  there coordination among you?    [al-Biltaji] Coordination is extant and ongoing. We all  cooperate for what is in the interest of Egypt and its  prosperity. When a problem develops, we do actually form a joint  aviation-tourism committee to examine it.    [Shalash] Give me an example.    [al-Biltaji] There is the "chartered" flights problem that  developed recently when the Civil Aviation Authority refused to  permit tourist-carrying "chartered" flights to land in  al-Ghardaqah on the grounds that laws don't empower it to permit  such landings. I intervened immediately and the flights were  permitted to land because the interest of tourism comes first.  The committee we formed of the Ministry of Tourism, the Aviation  Authority, and Air Egypt drafted rules to regulate "chartered"  flight activity in a way that ensures the national company's  right, i.e., Air Egypt's right, and the rights of the Egyptian  and foreign private sector companies. I believe in the policy of  open skies.    [Shalash] It seems from this interview that you are more  optimistic than you should.    [al-Biltaji] Yes, I am optimistic. Egyptian tourism activity  will regain its normal rates soon.</p>

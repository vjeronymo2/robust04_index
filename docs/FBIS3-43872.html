However, Mr Botha  warned at the end of a one day visit to the tiny mountain  kingdom South Africa would not recognise any Lesotho government  which came to power by force. Pretoria would bring such a  government to its knees, he told a press conference before  jetting out. "We will make it impossible for such a government  to survive," he said. "We will close the border." Mr Botha was  confident a new South African Government would also not  recognise a Lesotho Government which came to power by a coup.    He was leaving the enclave confident, however, that the  critical situation had been defused. He had received a  commitment from the two opposing defence force factions which  clashed on Friday that they would negotiate a truce.    The cause of the clash supposedly was a demand by the rebel  group for a doubling of army salaries. But Lesotho and SA  [South African] Government officials told SAPA on Saturday it  appeared the dissidents had political grievances, and were  preparing for a possible coup.    The ruling Basotholand Congress Party swept to power in  March  last year, ousting [words indistinct] on on Friday, but said the  pilots and their aircraft were being looked for. They are  expected to return soon to Lesotho. SAPA was informed four  helicopters landed in Ladybrand across the border in the Orange  Free State. The reason for the pilots' [words indistinct] that  their commander, Lt-Col Patrick Matare [name as received], was  injured in Friday's clash and they feared the rebel soldiers  were after them too.    Mr Botha said he had been assured Col Matare was in a  satisfactory condition in hospital in the capital, and there was  no need to accept a SA Government offer to have him treated in  Bloemfontein. The commander, who was still being held hostage  by the rebels on Saturday afternoon, was reportedly shot in the  shoulder. A civilian doctor operated on him.    Mr Botha first met separately with all the parties involved,  including the two army factions, before bringing them together  face- to-face.    The minister and his hosts were at pains to point out he had  been invited to Lesotho to assist and was not "barging in". "I  did not come here to preach," he said, pointing out South Africa  had its own problems with violence. He said his basic message  to the parties was the region could ill-afford more  confrontation if it wanted to attract foreign investment. Any  problems in Lesotho could also affect the highlands water  project.    He had also pointed out the Lesotho Government, like South  Africa's, did not have the money to increase salaries  willy-nilly.    "The future of Africa and the world will depend very heavily  on economic development," Mr Botha said. He added he had urged  the soldiers to tackle the "real enemy" -- the social upliftment  of Lesotho's people.</p>

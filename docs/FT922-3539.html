			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Rebuke for Brazil over forced labour THE International Labour Organisation yesterday issued an unusually stern rebuke to Brazil for failure to implement laws against forced labour, AP reports from Geneva. A special ILO committee urged the Brazilian government to step up its efforts 'to end the existence of appalling labour conditions', cited in a damning report on the extent of what is often near-slavery. The report said thousands of men, women and young children were forced to work in mines and on the land in Brazil, facing punishment and even death if they try to escape. The ILO's Committee on the Application of Standards said it recognised the problems in enforcing labour laws in remote parts of the country, but said the government should do more to stop the violations and punish the guilty. Officials said the use of the word 'appalling' in the committee's conclusions was exceptionally strong. Mr Ken Thomas, trade union spokesman on the committee, described the situation in Brazil as an 'international disgrace.' The report detailed allegations that Brazilians hired to work arrive at their destination, often thousands of miles from home, to find they have been charged for transportation and that the wages are lower than promised.</p>

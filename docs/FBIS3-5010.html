Australia believes that, being closer to the region,  it has developed a greater awareness of these sensitivities and  that it has "some perspectives on this that might be usefully  conveyed" to Washington.    They will be conveyed to a U.S. delegation led by Secretary  of State Warren Christopher and Under Secretary of Defence Frank  Wisner, who are due in Canberra Monday for bilateral  discussions. Warren [Christopher] will leave Wednesday for  meetings in Beijing and Tokyo after a day and a half of talks  with the Australian delegation led by Foreign Minister Gareth  Evans and Defence Minister Robert Ray.    It is Australia's first ministerial meeting with senior  officials of the Clinton administration following postponement  of a talks originally scheduled for Cairns last July. "It's an  imporant opportunity for us to reaffirm the alliance ties and  for us to have an influence on US policy development," an  Australian official told a media briefing here.    "One of our objectives is to bolster US perceptions of  Australia as an active participant in the region, a responsible  player and an ideas generator for the region." Australia will  take the opportunity to impress upon its closest ally and  largest trading partner after Japan the view that it should work  to sustain what is seen as a well respected role as a regional  force for stability.    "For that to be sustained I think the US has got to show an  awareness of regional concerns and regional sensitivities,  something we feel that we in Australia have developed a little  more of in recent years," said the official. Australia would not  lecture the United States, but wanted to indicate its view that  Washington is still needed and wanted as a major player in the  region.    Canberra is also keen on the eve of Christopher's visit to  Tokyo to see an early settlement of the US-Japan trade dispute  over the trade imbalance favouring Japan. Australia did not take  sides and supported Washington in its efforts to open Japanese  markets further and bring Japan more into the sort of trading  patterns that exist elsewhere. But the official added that  Australia also shared Japanese concerns about the imposition of  quantitative indicators in particular market sectors. Canberra's  view is that if Japan opens its markets in particular areas they  should be open to all countries, not just the United States, and  if their dispute cannot be resolved it might be referred to the  GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).    Canberra will also raise the issue of renewal by Washington  of its Most Favoured Nations (MFN) trading status in China,  which is dependent on a judgment about human rights. "There are  also questions of sanctions that the US has in place against  high technology exports because China has refused to commit  itself to the missile technology control regime guidelines,  something which affects us," the official said. Australia had  human rights concerns with China, but did not tie them to trade,  the official said, commenting: "In essence we are singing from  the same songbook, but we don't have a linkage with trade."</p>

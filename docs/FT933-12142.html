			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / A different way to tame the tiger: Sluggish growth is speeding the pace of change in South Korean labour relations It was a scene reminiscent of the days of military dictatorship in the 1980s: riot police last week massed outside Hyundai Motor, ready to suppress a strike declared illegal by the South Korean government. At another Hyundai plant, 1,000 police dismantled barricades erected by workers staging a sit-in in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest five trade union leaders. This police action, however, was ordered not by the military but by a new civilian government, which had promised labour reforms, including improvements in workers' rights and non-interference by the state in wage negotiations, when it took power five months ago. Although the crackdown might suggest South Korea is entering another period of acrimonious labour relations, the 52 days of strife at Hyundai, the country's largest industrial conglomerate, stand out against a background of generally improving labour relations. The government's strong-arm tactics paid quick dividends. Hours after it ordered the Hyundai Motor workers to suspend their action, labour and management reached a compromise settlement that was narrowly approved by the workforce of 29,500 on Friday. The eight other Hyundai companies on strike are expected to resume work soon. Even with the Hyundai dispute, South Korea's strike record has improved sharply this year. Strikes have fallen by almost 50 per cent to about 100 so far this year. More than 60 per cent of wage negotiations among the country's 5,500 biggest companies have already been concluded - faster than in 1992. And pay increases among big companies are lower, with an average rise of 4.77 per cent against 6.92 per cent in 1992. This is the result of an unprecedented wage agreement reached in April between the Korean Employers' Federation and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, which established guidelines for pay rises of between 4.7 per cent and 8.9 per cent. General wage levels, reflecting sharper increases among small companies, are expected to grow 11 per cent this year against 15.2 per cent in 1992 and an average 16.4 per cent a year since 1987. The double-digit wage growth of recent years means South Korea now has the highest wages on the Asian mainland, and is losing market share to low-cost producers in China and south-east Asia. In addition, some Korean companies are moving production facilities to other Asian countries to take advantage of cheaper labour costs. While manufacturing wages have more than doubled since 1987, productivity has lagged behind, rising 60 per cent. The improvement in labour relations thus bodes well for a government struggling to restore competitiveness and revive a sluggish economy. South Korea recorded its slowest growth in 12 years in 1992 at 4.7 per cent. Estimated growth of 5.7 per cent this year, although impressive by western standards, is among the lowest in Asia. Unemployment, although modest at 2.8 per cent, is creeping up, raising concerns about job security. 'Korean workers realise they can no longer ask for the sky in terms of wages because it undermines their job prospects,' explained Mr Stephen Marvin, head of research at Jardine Fleming, the stockbrokers, in Seoul. 'A record number of bankruptcies last year have added to their worries.' A fall in the inflation rate to 5 per cent against the double-digit rates of recent years is also persuading workers to accept lower pay increases. The dispute at Hyundai, the nation's leading industrial exporter, had spoilt this otherwise bright picture. But the strikes that affected almost a third of Hyundai's 34 subsidiaries, including its main auto and shipbuilding units, have taken a heavy toll. The Bank of Korea estimates that the dispute has cut the GNP growth rate by 0.17 percentage points and export growth by 0.32 per cent. This, according to the central bank, is the main reason why the GNP growth rate this year will fall short of the government's 6 per cent target. The dispute cost Dollars 283m in lost exports, exceeding the Dollars 260m in total exports lost to stoppages in 1992, according to the government. Hyundai has suffered sales losses of Won595.5bn, about 10 per cent of its projected turnover for 1993. Lost production resulting from the strike reached Won1,234bn, including Won475bn in lost business among its subcontractors. Yet some observers believe the government, in raising the prospect of labour reforms, is itself partly to blame for the industrial action at Hyundai. 'The government raised workers' expections too high when it proposed several labour reforms this spring. These reforms became part of the Hyundai workers' demands to management,' explained Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of the Daewoo Research Institute. Mr Rhee In-je, the new labour minister and a former dissident lawyer, had suggested that workers receive partial pay during strikes, and be given a greater say in management and hiring policy. The government backed away from the labour reform proposals when it appeared they were becoming a contentious issue at Hyundai and other companies. The Hyundai workers, however, did not strike for these reforms alone. They also sought average wage increases of 16 per cent, against the company offer of 4.7 per cent, a shorter working week of 40 hours and benefits such as housing subsidies. Under the final agreement, the workers accepted the company's pay offer in exchange for increased fringe benefits, while dropping demands for union involvement in decision-making. Although the government's decision to rely on a show of force to curtail the Hyundai strike was embarrassing for President Kim Young-sam, he accused the Hyundai workers of making 'selfish' demands, which threatened to derail his economic recovery programme. 'With its intervention at Hyundai, the government has shown that it places a higher priority on economic recovery than labour reform,' said Mr Lee Keunmo, head of research at Barings Securities in Seoul. 'But this does not mean that labour reform is dead, although the pace of its implementation has been slowed,' he added. 'The greater involvement of labour in management decisions, for example, will come naturally, since the government wants to reduce family ownership of the chaebol (Korean conglomerates) by promoting share ownership among the workforce. This should reduce strikes in the future as workers identify their interests with the company.' And there are signs Mr Kim will try to make amends with the unions by making Hyundai an early target for reform, reducing the management powers of Hyundai's owners, the Chung family. Mr Kim has been engaged in a political feud with Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, since the two were rivals in last year's presidential election. 'The biggest ramification of the strike may be on the future management of Hyundai. The government is righteously angry at Hyundai for letting the labour situation get out of control and it blames its owners for the labour problems there,' says Mr Marvin. 'We could see the government compelling Hyundai to allow a greater management role for labour.' What looked like a defeat for labour last week at Hyundai may yet turn out to be a victory.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH KOREA: MORE SETTLED ON THE LABOUR FRONT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of labour   disputes             3,617  1,873  1,616    322    234    235     97* Wage growth in   nominal % terms       10.1   15.5   21.1   18.8   17.5   15.2   11.0** Wage growth in   real terms             7.1    8.4   15.4   10.2    8.2    9.0    6.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * As at July 20 ** Estimated Source: Ministry of Labour, Jarding Fleming  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

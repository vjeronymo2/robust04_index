			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Anger over Portillo attack on foreign corruption Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday launched an attack on foreign corruption, which threatened to embroil the party in another damaging row. After delivering the speech to students in Southampton, Mr Portillo later said he had made a mistake in 'grossly exaggerating' the corrupt practices which take place abroad. But his comments infuriated some Conservative backbenchers who questioned Mr Portillo's judgment in making a controversial speech in the wake of the prime minister's call for party unity. Mr Robert Hicks, a pro-European, said: 'This is ridiculous. I wonder if he lives in the real world. Where is the evidence in our community partners that such practices exist.' Another senior Conservative MP said: 'Mr Portillo's comments are a severe embarrassment to the government and Mr John Major.' Mr Portillo told Southampton students: 'If any of you have got an A level it is because you have worked at it; go to any other country and when you have got an A level you have bought it'. He went on to say: 'When you go into business you will win contracts because you are good at what you do. 'Go to a number of other countries and you would win contracts because your cousin was a minister or because you have lined the pocket of some public official.' Treasury officials said Mr Portillo did not intend for the remarks to come out in the way they did. Mr Portillo later said: 'I realised shortly afterwards that I had exaggerated and made a mistake. The point I was trying to make is that Britain's standards in public life compare favourably with the best in the world.' His comments follow his last speech lauding British institutions. Downing Street then blocked a plan by the chief secretary for a further speech emphasising his Euro-sceptic credentials. Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said Mr Major should sack Mr Portillo for his 'outrageous' comments.</p>

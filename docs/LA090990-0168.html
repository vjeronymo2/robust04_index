			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EAST L. A. COMEBACK SHOCKS PIERCE  </P> <P> Santiago Alvarez hit Kevin Owens with a 17-yard touchdown pass with 1 minute 30  seconds to play, lifting East Los Angeles College to an improbable 32-31  nonconference win over host Pierce on Saturday night.  </P> <P> Holding a seemingly comfortable 31-20 lead with seven minutes remaining, Pierce  watched helplessly as Alvarez completed his third and fourth touchdown passes  of the game to lead the Huskies to victory.  </P> <P> Alvarez, a freshman who passed for 4,019 yards last season at Franklin High,  completed 29 of 44 passes for 371 yards against Pierce.  </P> <P> After the final touchdown, Pierce got the ball back two times. On the first  possession, quarterback Jamie Grossman was intercepted at the East L.A.  nine-yard line and on the second series, Derek Chernow's 42-yard field-goal  attempt was blocked as time ran out.  </P> <P> The Pierce loss put a damper on freshman LaShante Parker's collegiate debut.  </P> <P> Parker, a standout at Palmdale High last season, gained 117 yards in 19 carries  and scored Pierce's first two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Brahmas jumped to a 13-0 lead in the game's first 3 1/2 minutes before  wilting down the stretch.  </P> <P> Parker returned the opening kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown and, after the  Brahmas forced East L.A. to punt, Pierce drove 83 yards in four plays for  another score.  </P> <P> Parker went the final 31 yards on a draw play, but it was tight end Scott  Wheeler's 49-yard reception and run that keyed the drive.  </P> <P> In what would be a rare sight, Chernow converted a point after. Pierce missed  four of five conversion attempts (three kicks, two two-point attempts) and it  came back to haunt the Brahmas.  </P> <P> Pierce took a 25-7 lead on Grossman's 22-yard touchdown pass to Jay Rich with  37 seconds left in the half, then put on a clinic on how not to play defense.  </P> <P> Pinned on their own 23-yard line, the Huskies proceeded to march 77 yards in  five plays. Pierce aided the East L.A. drive with a personal foul after a  15-yard run by Larry Espinosa, then gave up two touchdowns in the last 12  seconds, although only one of them counted.  </P> <P> The first score came on a first-down play from the Pierce 26. Alvarez completed  a pass to Carl Gilliam at the 12-yard line, and Gilliam bounced off Brahma  defensive back Carlton Bowen and waltzed into the end zone as time expired. A  personal foul nullified the score, however.  </P> <P> No matter: Alvarez connected on a 45-yard Hail Mary pass to Owens on the next  play.  </P></p>

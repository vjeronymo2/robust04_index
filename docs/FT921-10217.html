			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Trans-Natal up 3% at halfway TRANS-NATAL, the coal producer in the Gencor group of South Africa, raised operating income by 3 per cent to R108.4m (Dollars 38.5m) in the first half to December following increased export volumes and reduced costs. This represents a stabilisation of the group's performance following the closure in January 1991 by Escom, the national power utility, of the Camden and Komati power stations, which were two of Trans-Natal's main customers. This lead to operating profits dropping to R75m in June 1991 from R105.4m in December 1990, and sales tonnage dropping to 13.4m tonnes from 14.1m tonnes. Although coal sold in the first half remained at 13.3m tonnes, the product mix changed substantially. Thus sales to Escom dropped by nearly 20 per cent to 4.9m tonnes but sales to other local users rose 7 per cent to 2.9m tonnes. Exports, which account for 67 per cent of revenues, rose to 5.5m tonnes from 5.3m tonnes.</p>

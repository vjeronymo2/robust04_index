He said the U.S. move for early deployment of Patriot  missiles in South Korea is, in part, aimed at putting pressure  on North Korea to come to an agreement with the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    If the North Korean nuclear problem is solved at an early  date, the anti-missile missiles could be deployed in Japan  instead, the official said.    He said U.S. President Clinton has not given final approval  for the deployment of Patriot missiles, but is expected to  approve it sooner or later.    "The South Korean government agrees to the deployment in  principle and the interceptor missiles will be deployed at the  bases of U.S. forces here in March or April at the latest," the  official said.    He said the 36 Patriot missiles to be deployed here are for  protection of strategic points of U.S. forces in South Korea  rather than for defense of densely populated areas including  Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area.    Deployment of Patriots on the Korean Peninsula is the first  step in establishing the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system,  which the U.S. government is pushing for on a long-term basis.    Washington confirmed Wednesday it was considering deployment  of Patriot missiles in South Korea to defend its ally against  North Korean attack.    Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, requested  deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to prepare against  Scud missile attacks by North Korea.</p>

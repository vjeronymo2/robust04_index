			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1000 GMT on 23 April on the Vesti newscast carries a  video report by correspondent A. Sladkov on the Black Sea Fleet  issue. Sladkov says: "The Ukrainian town of Sevastopol and the  Russian naval base there remains the stumbling block in  resolving the issue of the final division of the Black Sea  Fleet. Moscow insists on Sevastopol for Russia's main Black Sea  base and rejects the idea of moving to Donuzlav. Moreover,  Russia will not accept the alternative of having both fleets  based in Sevastopol."    The video then shows Russian Defense Minister Grachev, who  says: "We cannot drive thousands of families out of one town,  remove them from their homes, and settle them in different  towns--now without homes. We must think about people. We must  think about the pensioners, who, as members of the Black Sea  Fleet, defended our homeland. We do not have the right just to  cast them aside."    The video then shows interviews with people walking by on  the  street.    Sladkov notes that the population's mood is pro-Russian but  does not want hostility. However, he says, "the Crimean leader  is more radical."    The video shows Crimean President Meshkov addressing a  demonstration: "As president of the Republic of Crimea I  consider it impermissible to have the headquarters of the  Ukrainian fleet on the same territory, in the same republic.  For us it will be constant source of tension, a source of  conflict and confrontation."</p>

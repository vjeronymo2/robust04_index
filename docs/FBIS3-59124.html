			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The German Bundesbank  recorded record profits in 1993. Its gross income increased to  almost 21.4 billion German marks [DM]. The figure is shown in a  weekly report dated 31 December 1993, which lists the amount of  DM21.368 billion under the heading "other equity and  liabilities." Alongside other liabilities, accruals, and  deferred income, this figure also contains the profit accrued in  1993.    Experts assume that Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel  will  receive about DM18 billion "at the final count" from Frankfurt.  In 1992, a total of around DM13.1 billion of Bundesbank net  profits, amounting to DM14.7 billion, went into government  coffers, while in 1991 the federal finance minister received  exactly DM14.5 billion out of Bundesbank profits of DM15.2  million. Waigel has included DM7 billion of the 1993 Bundesbank  profits in the federal budget. Any extra must be used to repay  debts. The Bundesbank's results for the year are determined by  the Central Bank Council and officially announced, as is  customary, in April.    The Bundesbank's most important source of income in 1993  remained interest from loan transactions with domestic banks.  Although official interest rates did go down sharply during the  course of 1993, this was largely offset by the expansion in the  volume of refinancing. As the U.S. dollar, the Bundesbank's  most important reserve currency, recovered greatly in 1993 from  its historical low in 1992 of DM 1.3870, there is no need to  write off funds in this area either.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Life insurance The steady bonus rates announced by life insurers this week look like a pause for breath in an otherwise downward trend. Unlike their counterparts at pension funds, life company actuaries do not dismiss 1993's investment returns as an aberration. The savage bonus cuts of the last two years are not therefore being repeated. With long-term interest rates so low, though, such heady investment returns are unlikely to be sustained. Payouts on 10-year policies could thus decline sharply as the strong investment returns of the mid-1980s drop out of bonus calculations. But the pace of decline may vary between life companies more than in the past. Insurers which switched investments in favour of gilts - often because weak solvency demanded a less risky investment strategy - have done well from the switch so far. With long gilt yields now at a 25-year low, though, a high weighting in bonds may be more of a drag on investment performance. Companies with stronger solvency may also be more likely to maintain payouts where possible. Full disclosure of commissions and expenses - proposals for which were released by the Securities and Investments Board yesterday - should increase competition and may drive investors towards other forms of long-term saving. The mis-selling of personal pensions uncovered in the final months of last year can only be bad for business, while the market for mortgage endowments remains depressed. Life insurers with financial muscles will have a strong incentive to flex them.</p>

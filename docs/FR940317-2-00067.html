This program is authorized under Section 776(a), (previously section 788A), title VII of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility and Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Awards are made to accredited public and nonprofit private entities and schools and academic health science centers in meeting the costs of projects_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

Each project must define a geographic region and identify the types of providers to be targeted for training within that region. Thus, the focus in FY 1994 will continue to be on clinical education of primary care providers in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas. Consistent with this emphasis is the requirement that a minimum of two-thirds of the Federal funds provided must be expended to provide education to primary care providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and dental hygienists). In addition, at least 50 percent of project funds must be expended for training activities in high AIDS incidence Metropolitan Statistical Areas identified prior to the competitive awards of high AIDS incidence MSAs identified for funding through the ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each ETC must provide or perform the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Clinical training of primary care physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurse practitioners, and dental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hygienists;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Training of other health professionals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as mental health care providers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case managers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An updated needs-assessment of the education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and training needs of the primary care providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the proposed service area which is linked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the allocation of Federal funds;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Training in risk assessment, prevention, early  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervention, and treatment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Development of primary/tertiary care linkages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> networking;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Outreach to minorities, including involvement of minority providers, minority professional organizations, and minority health care delivery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Linkages to ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT, titles I, II,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III, and IV funded health services programs and the Hemophilia and Pediatric/Family HIV Health Care Demonstration Programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Linkage to PHS funded migrant (Sec. 329(a)(1)) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community health (Sec. 330(a)) centers, health care for the homeless programs (Sec. 340) State and local health agencies and health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities involved in providing care for HIV infected individuals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Linkage with substance abuse programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Collaboration with health professions organizations in the proposed region;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Networking with other community agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrate on filling the gaps in training;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Dissemination of state-of-the-art information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and educational materials in concert with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PHS agencies, using mechanisms such as hotlines;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Program assessment and data collection on program and trainees which can be used for regional and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national evaluative purposes; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Plan for future non-Federal funding of project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

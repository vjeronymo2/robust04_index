			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Cash trading quiet ONE-MONTH money ended slightly softer in the sterling cash markets yesterday, as traders anticipated smaller shortages in forthcoming weeks. But the market was quiet, and closing figures in the cash and futures markets ended mostly unchanged. Yet more hints that a cut in base rates is unlikely over the summer led to a quiet market. In a speech to the annual dinner of the CBI on Tuesday night, the chancellor of the exchequer said that Britain should aim to match Japan's inflation performance if it wants to be 'a first-rank commercial power'. That was compounded by the Bank of England's statement in its quarterly bulletin that the Maastricht criteria relating to inflation and interest rates will be met by 'a continuation of the present counter-inflationary stance of policy'. As a result, period rates were mostly unchanged. One-month money ended the day at 10 per cent, down  1/16 on the previous day's close. But three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, remained unchanged at 10 per cent. On the sterling futures market, there was also little change. The June short sterling contract closed at 89.98, up one tick on the day after very low volume. That closing price suggests that three-month LIBOR in a month's time will be at 10.02 per cent. In its money market operations, the Bank of England found that players were again unwilling to offer paper. With a bank holiday weekend approaching, the market is probably waiting until tomorrow to take up the shortage in the hope of pushing the overnight rate down over a three-day weekend. The Bank purchased Pounds 30m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 11m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 100m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 267m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 35m of Band-2 bills at 9 7/8 per cent. It offered late assistance of Pounds 610m. In Germany, the Bundesbank drained DM4.2bn from the banking system with yesterday's repurchase agreements. It allocated DM29.7bn of 27-day funds, mostly at 9.65 per cent, and DM9.6bn of 56-day money, mostly at 9.65 per cent.</p>

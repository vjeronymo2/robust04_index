			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: MFI Mr Derek Hunt, chairman of MFI, the furniture group, saw his pay packet cut by 75 per cent last year, because of the absence of a Pounds 1.3m management bonus on flotation. His pay fell from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 400,000, according to the annual report. The decline masked a 35 per cent increase in salary and benefits partly because of an Pounds 85,000 performance bonus. Mr Hunt's salary and benefits, including the performance pay-off, increased from Pounds 271,000 to Pounds 367,000. Pension payments rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 33,000. MFI reported pro forma pre-tax profits more than doubled, from Pounds 40.2m to Pounds 87.8m, on sales 9 per cent ahead at Pounds 659.4m, for the 53 weeks to April 30.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: GE plans share buy-back worth Dollars 5bn over two years General Electric, the US conglomerate, is to buy back up to Dollars 5bn of its shares over the next two years. This brings total buy-backs announced this year by US corporations to a record Dollars 65bn, according to the Wall Street firm Securities Data. The previous record was set in 1989 with Dollars 62bn. Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman, said 'we have concluded that GE stock today represents the best investment we can make'. The company has not bought in stock since 1992, having spent Dollars 5bn in the period 1989-92. The programme originally announced in 1989 envisaged purchases of up to Dollars 10bn. Large buy-backs have accelerated in recent weeks, from companies such as Merck, Chrysler and Walt Disney. However, the largest of the year was Dollars 6bn from Philip Morris, the tobacco company, announced in August. Mr Welch said the company's strong cash generation allowed it to continue its capital investment programme, make complementary acquisitions and fund share repurchases. Moody's, the debt rating agency, yesterday confirmed its triple A rating on GE's debt. The company has gross borrowings of Dollars 5.9bn and cash of Dollars 3.7bn. GE also said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 14 per cent to 41 cents a share. The company had lifted its dividend every year since 1975, it said. The previous increase was 13 per cent last December. This year, GE has suffered losses estimated at Dollars 1.5bn on Kidder Peabody, its stockbroking subsidiary, which was hit by alleged fraud and is now being sold off. However, its third-quarter profits were a record Dollars 1.37bn net, a rise of 13 per cent. Mr Welch said he expected the buy-back programme to increase the rate of growth in the company's earnings per share and its return on equity. GE shares rose Dollars 1 1/4 to close at Dollars 50.</p>

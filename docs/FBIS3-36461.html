In his opinion, numbers for the Armed  Forces as set out in the defense law--1.5 million by 1995--are  insufficient to carry out the tasks of guaranteeing the state's  security.    Pavel Grachev confirmed the military department's policy of  recruitment on contract. Contract soldiers, the minister said,  will be recruited mainly for the fighting units and not for the  administrative or quartermasters' services. In 1993, 93,000  contract soldiers were recruited in 1993. The plan is to  recruit 150,000-160,000 contract soldiers in 1994.    The defense minister also spoke of the proposed  reorganization of educational work in the Army. Its focus will  move from the center to the level of companies, battalions, and  regiments. There are specific proposals for regiments to have a  deputy commander responsible for educational work, a lawyer,  psychologist, and a sociologist.</p>

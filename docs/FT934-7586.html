			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: MPs will scrutinise MI5 and GCHQ - Secret services THE government is taking another step towards more open government by submitting the intelligence services for the first time to parliamentary scrutiny. According to Foreign Office officials, the Intelligence Services Bill announced in the speech yesterday is still being fine-tuned before its expected introduction in the House of Lords later this month. But there is now agreement that it should contain a provision for a parliamentary committee responsible for oversight and accountability of MI5, the Secret Intelligence Service, M16, and GCHQ, the government's intelligence-gathering communications centre. Parliamentary scrutiny is widely viewed as the most controversial aspect of the new bill. It also places the SIS and GCHQ on a statutory footing - as M15 was in the Security Service Act 1989. The bill will enable all three intelligence services to be investigated by complaints tribunals outside parliament. But the government has decided to test parliamentary opinion as to whether it should go further in meeting the recommendation of the Commons home affairs committee last year that it should be entrusted with scrutinising the activities of all three intelligence services. The government had earlier aired the suggestion that the supervising committee - whether extra-parliamentary or parliamentary - should be made up of privy councillors. However, MPs have argued that the inclusion of privy councillors who have sworn allegiance to the crown would dilute the critical function of the committee and turn it into a creature of government. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is also understood to be facing pressure from within his own party and intelligence officers who believe that the open-government policy may already have gone too far. Sir Ivan Lawrence, Tory chairman of last session's Commons home affairs committee, said last night: 'I was against opening up the intelligence services in the first place . . . I think you have more to lose than to gain by it.' The intelligence services fear that the government's policy of bringing them increasingly into the public eye risks compromising the security of individuals. Over the past year, the names of all three heads of the intelligence agencies have been published by the government, and the head of M15, Mrs Stella Rimmington, has allowed herself to be photographed. It emerged last night that one of the main speakers in the Lords on the Intelligence Services Bill will be Baroness Park, who retired from a senior SIS post in 1980.</p>

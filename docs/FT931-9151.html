			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Private training for RAF pilots THE RAF and the Royal Navy are to hand over responsibility for initial pilot training to the private-sector Hunting group, under a contract announced yesterday. Hunting won against seven other bidders, including British Aerospace. The contract, for five years with an option for a further five, is expected to be worth more than Pounds 20m over the full period. The company will own and operate trainer aircraft at Topcliffe, near Thirsk in North Yorkshire. The privately operated joint squadron will handle all student pilots for the two services, other than those who come through university air squadrons. This will involve about 130 students a year. Hunting will provide a fleet of about 20 T-67M Mark II Firefly aircraft, made by the Yorkshire company Slingsby Aviation, which will replace Chipmunk and Bulldog trainers.</p>

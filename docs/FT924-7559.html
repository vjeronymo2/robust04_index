			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Leading Article: China's reformer ZHU RONGJI, who arrived in London yesterday for a tour of Britain and Scandinavia, has a reputation as a trouble-shooter who handles serious problems sensitively. He will need these skills as, just promoted to the standing committee of China's Politburo, he leads the first significant mission to the west after the beginning of a new and difficult phase in Beijing's foreign relations. Uncertainties have been created by two events beyond China's control: the election of Governor Bill Clinton, who promises as US president to take a tougher line linking trade privileges to China's human rights performance; and the proposals by Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, on broadening democracy ahead of China's resumption of sovereignty over the territory in 1997. The continued development of market-oriented prosperity in China lies at the heart of both. It is also Zhu's responsibility since, as vice-premier and head of the Economic and Trade Office - a new body which parallels Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry - he is the chief executive of Deng Xiaoping's economic reform programme. The stakes for Zhu are high: previous pretenders to the mantle of 88-year-old Deng have fallen by the wayside. Renewed impetus for reform this year has brought double-digit economic growth and a renewed influx of foreign investment, but has raised fears of inflation and overheating. There is an even greater need to reform state industries, cut down bureaucracy, and break the 'iron rice bowl' while softening the blow for possibly millions of redundant workers. These are Zhu's main tasks as the attempt to create a 'socialist market economy' - capitalism under authoritarian one-party rule - enters its most challenging stage. Withdrawal of Most Favoured Nation trade status by the US - congressional pressure for which was resisted by President Bush - would strike at China's exports, making it a less attractive place to invest and undermining the domestic position of reformers such as Zhu. He and his colleagues need to canvass support abroad for the view that growing economic freedom is the best way forward. Western governments should continue to accept that view, fostering trade and investment while insisting on better performance on human rights. The approach of constructive engagement, to which Britain has subscribed, should encourage China to talk sensibly about the chief issue currently dividing them: Hong Kong. Zhu's visit offers an opportunity - particularly since Mr Patten will also be in London - for quiet mending of the rift caused by Mr Patten's proposals and the virulent reaction to them in Beijing. China has failed to show that Mr Patten's limited suggestions break previous agreements. An unstable Hong Kong would undermine the southern powerhouse of Chinese growth. It is in China's interest to begin discussions to head off such dangers.</p>

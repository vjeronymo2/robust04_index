			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Fears on future location of European central bank the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - warned yesterday that the IRA's weekend bomb blast could undermine London's chances of being chosen as the home for the future European central bank. London is one of the cities vying to be home for a future European central bank when monetary union is achieved. Expressing concern at the damage caused by the explosion, Sir William said: 'I would have thought when Europe is deciding where its central bank is going to be, which may not be imminent, security and transport are difficulties which are going to count against London when many other things should be favouring London.' However, Sir William said London would remain a leading financial centre and is still the favoured home city for the Hongkong Bank's parent company, which is moving its headquarters to London after buying Midland Bank for Pounds 3.9bn last year. Mr Claus-Werner Bertram, managing director of Deutsche Bank AG, said the blast would not deter international financiers. 'There is not even a discussion about it. We have to be in this city. There is no question of us moving out.' Relocating from the Square Mile - the heart of the financial district - to another business centre such as Canary Wharf in London's redeveloped Docklands area, was no solution, Mr Bertram said. He said the bombers would just follow. In Zurich officials at Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) underlined their commitment to London. In the US Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, said: 'It's obviously a tragedy and a matter of great concern. But I don't believe it will have any impact on the importance of London as a financial centre.' Mr Bernard Poignant, director of BNP Capital Markets in London, and a board member of BNP France, said: 'If the risks increase we will increase our security.' He added that to pull out would just encourage terrorism. Mr Richard Spiegelberg, Merrill Lynch Europe's director of corporate communications, said: 'There is so much going for London as a financial centre. It will take more than a couple of bombs to shake that commitment.'</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Toyota denies finalising Dollars 46m stake in Indonesia's Astra TOYOTA MOTOR of Japan has denied agreeing to buy into Astra International, Indonesia's main vehicle manufacturer. The denial followed an announcement by Astra on Friday - restated yesterday  -that Toyota is to acquire about 4 per cent of the company in a deal worth about USDollars 46m. Toyota said yesterday: 'It is not a fact that we have agreed to the investment as cited by Astra' - although approaches made by Astra were under consideration. It added: 'We will do what is necessary to ensure that our relationship (with Astra) will be successful.' Last year, Astra, which has a 54 per cent market share of vehicle sales in Indonesia, sold 142,824 units, with Toyota models accounting for 53 per cent of the company's sales. Astra intends to bring in a consortium of foreign shareholders following a decision by the Soeryadjaya family, which owns 76 per cent of Astra, to sell down its holding to raise finance for its troubled Summa Group. Brokers estimate the family must raise over Dollars 350m. Astra, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 1.2bn, is reported also to have held talks with General Electric of the US and Temasek of Singapore. Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusomo, chairman of Astra, said Toyota would acquire 16 per cent of the shares to be sold by the Soeryadjayas - a 4 per cent stake. Astra said yesterday it would name other international shareholders this month and details of the deals by December. Last week, Astra announced a 67 per cent fall in net profits for the first half.</p>

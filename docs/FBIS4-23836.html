			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The SUN RAY, in its editorial, is worried about the  political situation in Nigeria and says the annulled 12 June  presidential election result, which is the bone of contention  for the pro-democracy agitators, should be resolved in the  interest of the nation. It however says the government of  General Sani Abacha is doing something in that regard through  the forthcoming national constitutional conference. The SUN RAY  appeals to the Federal Government to resist any temptation that  will make it arrest more members of the pro-democracy groups,  particularly Nadeco [National Democratic Coalition] leaders,  unless it has concrete evidence of criminal activities against  them. According to the SUN RAY, mere opposition to government's  views about events in Nigeria should not be enough reason.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Albanian President Sali Berisha held a meeting with  Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova. Both  presidents assessed as very fruitful and useful the meeting of  Mr. Rugova with President Clinton and the talks he held at the  Department of State. They pointed out that these talks are a  clear expression of a proper understanding of the necessity to  solve the problem of Kosova on the part of President Clinton's  administration.    The difficult situation of the Albanians in Kosova and the  situation in the region were at the focus of the Berisha-Rugova  meeting. Both presidents expressed full support for NATO's  decision on the ultimatum and are of the opinion that the  recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by the  United States contributes to the stability in the south of the  Balkans.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ron Shachner, leader of Mt. Hebron Council, </F> by Nadav  Ha'etzni; date and place not given]    [Excerpts] In recent weeks Ron Shachner, the head of the  Mt. Hebron Council, has become conspicuous because of two  apparently contradictory statements. On the one hand, he  publicly condemned the attacks on innocent Arabs in the context  of "revenge activities" by the settlers. One the other hand, his  name and military rank--lieutenant colonel (res.)--appeared  among the 47 signatories of the first petition that defined the  settlement evacuation order as clearly illegal.    As deputy commander of a reserve infantry brigade, doing  half of a job in the army since he is not mobilized, Shachner  has been and will always be close to the establishment. It was  difficult to draw provocative statements out of him that would  contribute much to a journalist's stories. But in light of  recent developments, Shachner has also changed his tune.  Speaking to him in his office, what is particulary demonstrated  is the sense of an internal rending within the public and the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. In the course of the interview, he  was required to summarize details because of the group of orders  close to his brigade. Simultaneously he described scenarios  capable of leading in the near term to a confrontation between  the deputy brigade commander and those of his soldiers who  listen to orders of the Rabin government.    "There is a terrible dilemma here," Shachner opens up. "I  am a citizen and a soldier in the IDF and for me Israel is a  sacred value. But I see before my eyes the Zionist enterprise  is tottering, the state is falling from its values and  everything sacred. In addition, the government is leading us  toward a security disaster not taking recommendations from the  IDF and about to abandon the residents of Judaea, Samaria, and  Gaza to the Palestinian police. We have excellent relations  with the army, but the government is passing over the red lines  and is liable to place me and my friends in the army on both  sides of the barricade."    "What we all fear most is civil war. But there are things,  from my viewpoint, which go beyond the red line. For example,  the evacuation of settlements. I have no doubt that the  government is planning this evacuation and I, as a commander in  the IDF, previously determined that this is an illegal and  unethical order. The evacuation of the camps puts me in a  quandry because I think a soldier must do all he can not to  participate, for example, in the evacuation of camps in Gaza and  Jericho."    As a member of the Yesha council administration and chairman  of its security committee, Shachner is in charge of planning all  their future activities, which will be published this week. For  example, the establishment of the "Hashomer" organization to  guard the settlements and preparations for the "multiplier  operation," by which the settlements are supposed to take  control of adjoining state lands. A heavy odor of confrontation  and building an alternative to the IDF arose from these plans.    Ron Shachner sought to lessen the sting of his words: "The  goal of the "multiplier operation" is to show concern that state  lands will be preserved for the settlements and on this issue we  are stubborn. We will go outside the fences and control the  land that was planned for the settlements and is important for  their defense.  [Shachner] Regarding "Hashomer," the original idea was to join  the population from throughout the country that would come and  assist Yesha. Beyond this, such things as patrols on the roads  likewise have still not been decided. It depends on what  actually develops in the area. We are continuing to the the IDF  as responsible. We also know that the demand that the IDF  transfer security is probable. But it is no secret that those  conducting the negotiations are insistent on the IDF  establishing minimal terms."    [Ha'etzni] For example?    [Shachner] The IDF must ensure a security belt flanking the  axes and to retain a minimal capability of pursuing attackers  and frustrating their attacks in the area. It is known that  those conducting the negotiations have already caved in on this  issue. We are very concerned. There are severe signs that the  government will not accept security recommendations, is not  bringing in new senior officers, and is about to create a  situation of abandonment.    [Ha'etzni] On what are you relying?    [Shachner] For example, the subject of weapons and control  over them. We asked senior officer in private conversations how  they would control 15,000 weapons that are about to be  distributed to the Palestinians. We did not receive an answer,  only a very grave expression. They told us in essence that they  don't know. Today, there is state control over all weapons. In  a short time they will deliver huge quantities of rifles without  any ability to follow their being stolen or delivered to hostile  elements.    [Ha'etzni] However, we're not hearing expressions like these  from the military leaders, just the opposite.    [Shachner] I am receiving from senior military elements a  feeling of confusion, concern, and dissatisfaction. They are  not kept up-to-date and do not know what will happen tomorrow.  I'll give you an example. We sat in a small forum made up of  four members with the chief of staff. We asked him, for  example, if after autonomy is established in Qalqiliyah, he  receives information about a group of terrorists setting up a  Katyusha opposite Kfar Sava and getting ready to fire, will the  IDF go into Qalqiliyah to prevent this? I didn't get an answer.  If there were one or two generals alive today placing their  rank on the table and saying: We cannot ourselves accept the  responsibility, on these terms, for what would destabilize the  state system. To my sorrow, this still has not happened, but I  think that this will indeed happen soon. [passage omitted]    [Shachner] If the Government of Israel doesn't understand  what is about to happen vis-a-vis the Palestinian police, it  doesn't understand anything. It is clear that there will be an  explosion. I won't open fire just like that, but I won't listen  to a Palestinian policeman. If he forceably detains me, I will  oppose him with force, and if he draws his weapon, I'll draw  mine. How can one nurture the blindness given what is  happening? What other proof does the government need? Look, the  Fatah hawks have already said they are renewing their attacks;  Faysal al-Husayni talks about returning to the rifle; the rebel  commander in Lebanon announced that he has infiltrated his men  into the Palestine police force. And one of their penitents (as  much as he was able) in Gaza fired at soldiers. So what do they  expect us to do? We live here and we will continue to live here  and defend ourselves.    [Ha'etzni] Are there others who are hoarding weapons such as  has been ascribed to Rabbi Toledano?    [Shachner] I think it's forbidden to break the law. We have  enough legal weapons and today we have no need to hoard.  However, dealing with the Palestinian police force will be  different. What is particularly bothersome are the signals from  our government. The police have already confiscated weapons  from the residents without justification. Shahal is also trying  to set up a police force here whose primary purpose is to pursue  us. Similarly, a grave situation is being created as I  described. In these circumstances such as these, the acquisition  of personal weapons for self-defense is legitimate.    [Ha'etzni] Where does all this lead?    [Shachner] Look, I condemned and am condemning attacks on  innocent Arabs. We are not predators like they are and we have  no need to act like that. But I warn the Israeli Government:  they caused this situation. "The Committee for Road Security"  does not exist. The government created this. The outburst that  followed the murder of Mizrahi is an uprising that springs from  a feeling of abandonment. If the government doesn't understand  this and continues on its current path, this phenomenon will  grow worse and lead to anarchy. In the face of Palestinian  police force, the psychological barriers that we have today will  disappear.</p>

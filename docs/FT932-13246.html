			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Top Spanish banks stay ahead BANCO SANTANDER and Banco Popular, the two pace-making Spanish banks, yesterday released first-quarter results that maintained their positions at the top of the domestic profits table. Santander raised its quarterly profit to Pta22.3bn (Dollars 191m), an increase of 8.1 per cent on the the first quarter of 1992, and Popular posted a post-tax income of Pta13.7bn, 6.1 per cent up on last year. Both banks reported a very positive operating profit performance that was ahead of most forecasts. Santander declared Pta33.5bn, an increase of 15.5 per cent on the first quarter of last year, and Popular raised its operating income by 16.5 per cent to Pta31bn. Mr Emilio Botin, Santander chairman, said the results had been due to the bank's growing international business. He said the domestic market was 'in a difficult situation because of the economic recession'. The bank has an extensive network in Latin America, where it has built up its corporate banking activities in Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, and is the main shareholder of the US bank First Fidelity. Popular's balance sheet reflected the reduction of cash coefficient requirements under new Bank of Spain guidelines, as well as the bank's proven moderation over credits and its austere control of costs. Endesa, Spain's partially-privatised electricity group, is to pay Pta27bn for a stake of approximately 2 per cent in Germany's RWE utility.</p>

During Choe's unofficial courtesy call to the Chinese  leader, the Korean business tycoon proposed the joint-venture  refining plant as part of projects to promote substantial  economic cooperation between the two countries and received  positive support from Jiang. Choe, who was visiting China on a  five-day schedule, became the first foreign businessman to  exclusively meet with the top Chinese leader, the sources said.    Under the proposed plan, Sunkyong will tie up with Sinopec,  China's state-run petrochemical company, and municipal  government of Shenzhen to build the $1.5-billion refining plant  in the free-trade city along China's southern coast, under the  equity participation ratio of 40-30-30. Formal signing for the  contract will likely be made during President Kim Yong-sam's  visit to China between March 26-30, they said.    When materialized, the 100,000 barrel-per-day plant will  mark  the biggest joint project between the two countries in terms of  investment amount. Korea's daily refining capacity now totals  16.7 million barrels. A Sunkyong Group official said the oil  plant is part of its grand overseas investment program, aimed at  relocating the conglomerate's vertically-integrated  petrochemical sector to China and other Southeast Asian nations.    The nation's fifth-largest industrial conglomerate also  plans  to participate in oil exploration project in China's No. 23 oil  mining zone along the East China Sea, build polyester chip and  acetate factories in Shantou, and operate mobile  telecommunication service network for China's three northeastern  provinces, the official said. It already has been operating a  solar cell battery factory in Shenzhen and a video tape plant  with annual production capacity of 18 million tapes in Fujian  Province, he said.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Moslems halt UN evacuation of Srebrenica LOCAL Moslem authorities yesterday again prevented a United Nations relief convoy, which reached the besieged eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica with food and medicines, from evacuating refug ees. The trucks were turned away empty despite approval for the evacuation from Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, and Moslem leaders in nearby Tuzla, where thousands of refugees have already been taken. UN High Commissioner for Refugees officials say they want to evacuate another 15,000 people from Srebrenica, whose population has swollen to 60,000 after an influx of refugees from surrounding areas occupied by the Serbs. In Sarajevo, meanwhile, Bosnian military commanders yesterday boycotted a top level meeting with their Serb and Croat counterparts on the first anniversary of the siege of Sarajevo, in protest against the continuing Serb offensive in the Srebrenica region. General Sefer Halilovic, the commander of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, said he could not participate in such a meeting amid 'the unbelievable continuation of the aggression in Srebrenica'. However, delegations from the Bosnian Croatian Defence Force, the Bosnian Serb Army, the rump Yugoslav army and the Croatian army all turned up as promised and the meeting went ahead without the top Moslem commanders. But General Ratko Mladic, the top Bosnian Serb commander, did not personally attend. UN officials have billed the talks as a vital step towards an overall settlement of the Bosnian conflict on the basis of the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen, the international mediators. However, Gen Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in Bosnia, played down the significance of the meeting. He said the problem of Srebrenica was the most important item on the agenda of yesterday's talks. There were more promising developments in Geneva, where Croatia and rebel Serbs from the self-styled Serbian republic of Krajina, signed a ceasefire accord yesterday ending two months of conflict in the disputed Krajina enclave. But Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, the 'foreign minister' of Krajina, said the agreement would not come into effect unless Serb deputies approved it at a special session next Saturday. Under the agreement, Croatian forces would withdraw behind a 1992 ceasefire line, which they overran in January to reclaim positions they claim as vital to the Croatian economy. The Serbs, for their part, would return heavy weapons to UN control, and ethnically mixed 'pink zones', previously policed by the Serbs, would also be placed under the control of the UN Protection Force. In Rome, Italy said it would take command of an international patrol on the River Danube to prevent oil and other strategic goods from reaching Serbia.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC WARNINGS ORDERED ON JOB;  </P> <P> PROP. 65: STATE APPEALS COURT RULES THAT INITIATIVE'S TOUGH REQUIREMENTS APPLY  IN WORKPLACE AS WELL. SEVEN MILLION EMPLOYEES ARE AFFECTED.  </P> <P> In a ruling that could affect about 7 million employees, a state Court of  Appeal ruled Thursday that the stringent toxic warnings required under  Proposition 65 must be issued in the California workplace.  </P> <P> The decision was hailed by lawyers for labor and environmental groups, who said  it means that workers will be alerted to the hazards of about 300 chemicals  identified as potential causes of cancer or birth defects.  </P> <P> Under less-demanding federal standards, warnings are not required for 84  substances on the state's toxics list, the lawyers said. The state law also  requires warnings at a lower level of exposure than does federal law, they  added.  </P> <P> It was the latest in a series of rulings in which the courts have rejected  contentions by state officials and ordered broad application of the sweeping  1986 initiative. In March, for example, a Sacramento Superior Court judge  invalidated a state regulation exempting foods, drugs and cosmetics from the  initiative's requirements.  </P> <P> "This removes the last major hurdle that was posed to full implementation of  Proposition 65," said Albert H. Meyerhoff of the Natural Resources Defense  Council. "This is a big victory."  </P> <P> Michael Rubin of San Francisco, a lawyer for the California AFL-CIO, said that  under the ruling, the private employers covered by the initiative will likely  be required to post toxics-warning notices in the workplace much like those  already being placed in service stations, liquor stores and other  establishments.  </P> <P> Lawyers who represented the state Occupational Safety and Health Standards  Board in the case before the court were not available. Rick Rice, a spokesman  for the state Department of Industrial Relations, said officials had not yet  decided whether to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. He  acknowledged the decision will have "significant impact" but declined further  comment.  </P> <P> The initiative requires private businesses with 10 or more employees to give  "clear and reasonable" warnings to people who might be exposed to chemicals  that could cause cancer or birth defects. According to lawyers, about 7 million  workers will be affected by that mandate.  </P> <P> The case arose in a lawsuit filed by labor and environmental groups against the  OSHA board after the board refused to apply Proposition 65 to the workplace.  </P> <P> The board said that contrary to the groups' claims, a separate initiative  passed in 1988 to restore job-safety functions of Cal/OSHA did not require such  application. The separate initiative, known as Proposition 97, required the  OSHA program to be consistent with other state job-safety laws. The board  argued that Proposition 65 was not such a law because it was not specifically  aimed at workers and contained exemptions for about 25% of the work force.  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sainsbury hit Final results from J. Sainsbury came in at the bottom end of the market range and this, together with a swathe of moderate downgrades, led the shares down. Food retail specialists' attention was also focused on the level of earnings growth the supermarket group was likely to achieve in the next 12 months. After a sharp increase in recent years, Sainsbury, in common with other supermarket groups, has shown a marked slowdown. Bears of the sector regard this as a major sea change, with food retailing in a mature stage and unlikely to repeat the recent earnings growth success. One cautious analyst concluded: 'Sainsbury shares are in for a dull time.' However, the stock still has its supporters. Mr Andrew Burnett at NatWest Securities, which reiterated its positive stance yesterday, said the company had the potential for continued growth through its dominant position and its ability to 'turn the screw on the competition'. Sainsbury shares ended 14 down at 467p in turnover of 6.7m. Most brokers brought their forecasts back to around Pounds 830m for next year.</p>

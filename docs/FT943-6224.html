			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Philippines steps up its privatisation drive: The Manila Hotel leads a list of high-value assets on offer The Philippines government has the big-ticket items on the block in its privatisation drive. The Manila Hotel, the famous landmark by Manila Bay, is now up for auction in a programme that has already raised more than 30bn pesos (Pounds 735m) for the government. The next assets to be privatised will be National Steel Corporation and National Power Corporation (Napocor). However, these may yet take some time because of disputes over who should shoulder their debt burdens and, in the case of Napocor, the division of its assets. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the state-administered employee retirement and benefits fund that owns the hotel through its Manila Hotel Corporation (MHC), yesterday announced a three-stage plan to privatise the prized asset. The move, which follows closely the successful privatisation of oil-industry leader Petron Corporation, involves: sale of 20-30 per cent of MHC to a 'strategic partner' to be selected through an open bidding in October, a stock offering of 20 per cent of MHC to GSIS members and hotel employees in December, and a public offering of 5 to 15 per cent of MHC shares of stock in January 1995. After completion of the programme, GSIS's holdings in MHC will have been reduced to 45 per cent. As in the Petron experience, the strategic partner will be relied upon to provide wide expertise and financial support for the hotel's stability and expansion. While the privatisations are only partial, they will mean that both Petron and MHC will no longer operate as state entities. They follow the sale in 1991 of 30 per cent of the Philippine National Bank and 67 per cent of Philippine Airlines in 1992. The strategic partner 'will, under a management contract, provide MHC with a global tie-up and expertise in operational capabilities in the hotel business,' Mr Cesar Sarino, GSIS president, said at the weekend. Although revenues have risen to some 600m pesos a year, the hotel's profits have slowed by about 25 per cent each year since 1991. The Manila Hotel divestment further bolsters the government's privatisation programme. The Petron sale generated a total of 21.5bn pesos (making it the largest privatisation effort in the country), of which 14.7bn pesos came from the 40 per cent holdings won by Saudi Arabian Oil Company in a public bidding. Aside from giving it the most widely dispersed ownership base among Philippine corporations, Petron's privatisation should be able to bolster its resources in the increasingly competitive industry. As a government-owned entity, Petron has had to contend with cumbersome regulations that at times curtailed efforts at expansion. For instance, in opening a new petrol station the company had to go through circuitous public biddings and government audits required of state enterprises. This explains why, in spite of Petron's overall oil market leadership, it has garnered the least share in the retail market. The procedural bottlenecks often curtailed Petron's ability to react quickly to emerging market trends. 'For Petron, its privatisation frees it from certain government regulations, thus giving it the level playing field it needs to compete effectively,' said Mr Monico Jacob, who has been retained as company president under the new ownership set-up. Petron has remained the industry leader for the past 17 years (its overall market share last year was 45 per cent) owing to its edge in sales to the industrial sector, including refining of crude petroleum for its rivals in the local industry, and its dominance of the cooking gas market. In 1993, Petron recorded total revenues of 44.94bn pesos, the most by any Philippine business organisation. Its net profits of 2.78bn pesos for the year were also the fifth largest among leading corporations. Without a change in its production capacities, however, that leadership is predicted to be eroded in the coming years as the Philippine economy grows. Recent studies have indicated that a new oil refinery being put up by its closest rival, Pilipinas Shell Petroleum, the subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch Shell group, will adversely affect Petron's profit performance once it goes into full operation. Pilipinas Shell has invested Dollars 700m (Pounds 450m) in a programme to double its refinery capacity from its present 70,000 barrels of oil per day (b/d). That will put its capacity closer to Petron's current 155,000 b/d. The third oil company in the country, Caltex Philippines, also has plans to double its 65,000 b/d refinery. Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil exporter (shipments last year were estimated at over Dollars 50bn), has not only pledged uninterrupted oil supplies (Petron gets about 90 per cent of its crude oil requirements from Middle East producers), it has also agreed to help make Petron an export refiner in south-east Asia, an activity currently dominated by Singapore. The Saudi investor is also expected to help Petron on its planned capital expenditure programme over the next five years that will require investments of some 12.18bn pesos. The bulk of these funds are intended for a hydro refining project (costing 8.58bn pesos) to expand the company's production of unleaded gasoline, and a gasoil desulphuriser facility (costing 703m pesos) for production of environment-friendly low-sulphur diesel fuel.</p>

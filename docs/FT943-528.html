			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Multi-speed EU rejected by Strasbourg The European Parliament yesterday rejected by an overwhelming majority the prospect of a multi-speed Europe, but said at the same time that if recalcitrant member states like the UK continued to block further EU integration they should be by-passed. In spite of the strong endorsement of a carefully drafted resolution, yesterday's debate highlighted the confusion and division inside the EU over the future shape and pace of integration. Yesterday's resolution was backed by the two large Socialist and Christian Democrat blocs. It addressed the ideas mooted this month by Germany's governing Christian Democrats and the French government, about a 'hard-core' of Germany, France and the Benelux countries moving faster towards economic, monetary and political integration, while their partners followed more slowly in their wake. MEPs from Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal expressed their countries' fear of exclusion, but still, in the main, backed northern MEPs' denunciation of blocking tactics by countries such as the UK. The parliament said: 'It would be inconceivable to exclude' member states ready and able to pursue integration with 'equal rights and duties'. But it warned that 'if a small minority of member states attempted to block all progress' in 1996, 'ways would have to be found of allowing member states which want to pursue their efforts to achieve European integration to still do so'. The Maastricht treaty review conference in 1996, which will decide on the extent to which the Union must tighten its links in order to bring in new east and central European states, will still see governments in the driving seat. But the Strasbourg parliament, with new powers under Maastricht, won the right to take part in the 1996 review by threatening this spring to block the current enlargement process, designed to bring the Nordic countries and Austria into the EU next year. The parliament is increasingly showing that it is willing to use its veto and vetting powers to make its views heard. The resolution, alluding to recent British government comments about a multi-speed Union, also denounced the British and Danish opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty as the root of 'dangerous speculation about an a la carte Europe', in which member states can dissociate themselves from policies they dislike. All but two of the 18 UK Conservative MEPs remaining in Strasbourg abstained, regarding the debate as 'premature', as Tory Euro-MP Brendan Donnelly put it. But amid the welter of multilingual mixed metaphors about ships and convoys, hares and tortoises, concentric circles, menus and 'variable geometry', disgust at the ability of one state to use a veto to delay decisions outweighed distaste at an elitist 'hard-core'. The former Belgian minister and liberal MEP, Mr Willy de Clercq, said that 'if one speed means standing still that cannot be'. Former French Socialist prime minister Michel Rocard dismissed much of the debate as hypocrisy, pointing out that after Maastricht there is already a two-speed Europe, but 'the mistake is to think this is permanent'. Ms Elisabeth Guigou, the former French Socialist minister for Europe, said an a la carte solution would be divisive, 'but we cannot allow one country or group of countries to block progress.' Mr Gunter Rinsche, a German Christian Democrat leader, defending his party's floating of a 'hard-core' built round the Franco-German axis, argued that the Union should use flexible formulas as the cement constructing integration.</p>

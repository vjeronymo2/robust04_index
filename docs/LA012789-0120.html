			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS, IN FIRST GAME AS NO. 1, LOSES TO MINNESOTA  </P> <P> After its long climb to the top of the hill, Illinois' fall from grace was  swift.  </P> <P> The top-ranked Illini, the last undefeated team in Division I, were knocked off  their perch by Minnesota, 69-62, Thursday night in a Big Ten Conference game at  Minneapolis.  </P> <P> "It's a tribute to our young men and how hard they worked to be No. 1,"  Illinois Coach Lou Henson said. "But (being ranked first) certainly doesn't  help you win ballgames."  </P> <P> Illinois (17-1 overall, 4-1 in the Big Ten) was playing its first game since  rising to the No. 1 spot Monday. In 1952, the last time the Illini were No. 1  during the regular season, they were beaten by DePaul in their first game after  reaching the top.  </P> <P> Minnesota (11-5, 3-3) was effective in its zone defense, especially since  Illinois lost standout point guard Kendall Gill, third in the Big Ten in  3-point shooting, with a broken foot in its last game.  </P> <P> "We beat the No. 1 team," Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins said. "Sure, they could  have played better. But I'm very, very proud of my Gophers."  </P> <P> Minnesota pulled off its second upset in 12 days, having beaten then-No. 5 Iowa  on Jan. 14.  </P> <P> Willie Burton had 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Gophers, but it was his  passing that helped turn the game Minnesota's way.  </P> <P> Burton made remarkable passes on three straight plays during a 13-0 run in the  first half that gave the Gophers a 25-11 lead.  </P> <P> "I was so high because I've never played against a No. 1 team in college,"  Burton said. "We were juiced up tonight."  </P> <P> Minnesota built its lead to 20 points with 9:56 left and held off a late  Illinois rally. Kenny Battle scored 5 points in a 10-0 run that got the Illini  within 61-59 with 5:16 left. Then Burton hit a basket, Lynch added 2 free  throws and it was over.  </P> <P> North Carolina State 88, Duke 73 -- Brian Howard scored 23 points, and the  15th-ranked Wolfpack handed the No. 8 Blue Devils their third straight defeat  in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> Duke (13-3, 3-3), mired in a slump after winning its first 13 games, played  without All-American Danny Ferry, who has been bothered by back spasms all  season.  </P> <P> North Carolina State (13-2, 4-1) had a 48-38 lead on Chucky Brown's basket with  15:39 left, but the Blue Devils rallied and surged ahead, 63-61, on Robert  Brickey's shot with 10:15 left.  </P> <P> But N.C. State turned 3 steals into baskets and pulled away.  </P> <P> Alaa Abdelnaby scored 24 points, and Brickey added 19, while Brown scored 15  for the Wolfpack.  </P> <P> Iowa 78, Wisconsin 70 -- Roy Marble got 24 points and became Iowa's all-time  leading scorer as the 12th-ranked Hawkeyes downed the Badgers in a Big Ten game  at Iowa City, Iowa.  </P> <P> Marble, a 6-foot 6-inch senior, broke the record of 1,768 points set by Greg  Stokes 4 years ago. Ed Horton added 22 points for Iowa (15-3, 2-2), which  played its first home game since Dec. 30.  </P> <P> Iowa led by 11 points at halftime and made it 53-40 on B.J. Armstrong's 3-point  shot. But Wisconsin (15-3, 3-2) scored the next 3 baskets, including a  3-pointer by Tim Locum, to get within 53-47 with 10:46 remaining.  </P> <P> Wisconsin came within 66-62 with 3:42 left, but Horton scored 3 of Iowa's next  5 points to finish off the Badgers.  </P> <P> Danny Jones scored 27 points for Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Louisville 95, So. Mississippi 76 -- Pervis Ellison scored 26 points, and the  third-ranked Cardinals trounced the Golden Eagles in a Metro Conference game at  Hattiesburg, Miss.  </P> <P> After taking a 43-39 halftime lead, Louisville (14-2, 3-0) broke it open with a  22-6 surge to open the second half and rolled to its 14th consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Louis Bates scored 17 points for Southern Mississippi (6-9, 2-3).  </P> <P> Florida State 69, South Carolina 67 -- George McCloud hit a 3-pointer with 7  seconds left to give the No. 11 Seminoles a Metro Conference victory over the  Gamecocks at Columbia, S.C.  </P> <P> South Carolina (12-4, 2-2), which took the lead on Terry Dozier's 2 free throws  with 37 seconds left, couldn't get off a shot after McCloud hit.  </P> <P> Tat Hunter scored 20 points for Florida State (15-1, 3-0).  </P> <P> Ohio State 100, Northwestern 68 -- Perry Carter scored 25 points as the No. 17  Buckeyes rolled past the Wildcats in a Big Ten game at Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> Jay Burson added 19 points, and Jerry Francis scored 11 for Ohio State (14-4,  4-2), which took a 23-4 lead and never was threatened. Northwestern is 8-9 and  1-6.  </P></p>

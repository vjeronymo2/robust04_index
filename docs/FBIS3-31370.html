			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview in two installments with Slovak Prime Minister </F> Vladimir Meciar by Jan Smolec, chief editor of REPUBLIKA; place  and date not given]  <H5>  [7 Feb pp 1, 4] </H5> <H3>  A Misunderstanding With the President Is the Last Thing We  Need </H3>   [Text] Since the end of last year, every day brings  new, often very dramatic and tangled, situations on our  political scene. Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has been  and remains the principal actor in all these episodes. Many  politicians, deputies, and, of course, journalists decided since  the beginning of the year to deal very "harshly" with him. They  do anything in their power to remove him from the political  scene. Therefore, REPUBLIKA tried for a topical interview with  the prime minister.    [Smolec] As a journalist, I would like to ask you about the  dominant topical events that are shaking our political scene.  The REPUBLIKA readers are, among other things, however, also  interested in whether you managed to rest on the brief vacation  you took at the end of last year and the beginning of this year,  and recharge the battery of your personal energy and vitality.    [Meciar] If I do not take into account meetings with Cabinet  members and talks with several other officials, I have really  had a little rest. I have even managed to get on my skis once  and to fall. There was no reporter around, but it would have  been a fantastic shot with a caption "Meciar's Fall." I met a  man there whom I very much respect--Mr. Kulang, a porter in the  High Tatras mountain range. In 1992, he celebrated our election  victory in the Tatras by carrying a record 207-kg load. I was  rambling through the streets. I met young people. One of them  recognized me. He called to his friends, "Hey, that's Meciar."  His friends turned and replied: "You are silly, Meciar is  twice as tall."    [Smolec] The independent Slovakia is also your achievement  as a statesman. In the struggle for a place in the sun, you  stand out among the many of your "fellow travelers." Those who  did not want Slovak independence are "plotting" against you now.  They predicted that the first attack against you would begin in  January. It did. When do you expect the next one?    [Meciar] The whirlwind around me never stops.  Unfortunately, there are also people who are, as you say,  "plotting" against me. I have a message for these people: "I  still have enough strength to face them."    [Smolec] Our readers are very disappointed that even the  Slovak president, who holds his post also because of you, has  stood up against you. In the New Year's address, he appealed to  the leading representatives of the parliamentary parties to  search for personalities suitable for the government. The  president is calling for a stable government that will be  trusted abroad. It is an obvious casting of doubts on the prime  minister, the government.... The readers are convinced that it  is the people close to the president who are responsible for the  conflict between the Castle and Freedom Square [seats of the  president and the prime minister (government), respectively].  After all, it is surprising, to say the least, if a Christian  Democratic Movement politician who had voted in the former  Federal Assembly against Slovak independence is responsible for  security policy at the Castle. The following postulate is  gaining in popularity among the people: The Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] won the elections, but the Castle was  won by the VPN [the former Public Against Violence movement]  members, obnoxious people, Czechoslovakists....    [Meciar] I refuse the thesis of good kings and bad advisers.  In a democracy, the chief is responsible for his advisers. It  is never the other way around--the advisers are not responsible  for the chief. There are differences between the government and  the Castle. The president pointed them out clearly on 1  January. Neither do I want to go into details, nor do we have  the time. This misunderstanding is the last thing we need. I  must, however, comment on certain aspects of this problem.  Political parties and movements are independent of the state.  A state representative has no right to interfere in the  internal affairs of these parties, even if he is the president.  The government is subject to parliamentary control but not to  the president. The president entrusts the prime minister with  the composition of a new government, but he cannot create a  situation that would lead to a change of this government. There  are also the political aspects. Not even the president can cast  doubts on the government in the international political arena  and, at the same time, interfere in its powers. There is a lot  that one can criticize in these relations, and a lot more of  what Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic, has disclosed so far.    [Smolec] You must certainly have analyzed your approach to  date. Which steps in your decisionmaking do you consider  erroneous, which do you intend to correct? To pass on the  critical comments of our readers, they do not like the fact  that, now and then, you react very impulsively. Your vigor is  well known, but you can be also very benevolent, as you were,  for instance, to the most recent visitors from Hungary (Sandor  Lezsak of the Hungarian Democratic Forum). If, by his  impertinent comments, a visitor interferes in the internal  affairs of Slovakia, he should be taken by the collar, shown the  border, and ordered never to come back. We must speak more  about the demands and rights of the Slovaks in southern Slovakia.    [Meciar] We have not made any substantial changes in the  strategy. We could have harmonized the steps in certain  critical issues differently. One example is the economic  sphere. Another question is what disposable resources we had to  make such corrections. We have made some mistakes in personnel  work, and it should be openly admitted what these mistakes  were--Knazko, Filkus, Cernak. I react only in certain specific  situations beyond the limit of endurance or the limits of  objective truth. Some people might not like the form but, for  God's sake, they cannot demand that I should be liked by  everyone.    Regarding the questions of relations between the Slovaks and  the Hungarians, I do not believe that we made a mistake. The  opposite. The government has a concept and is implementing it.  The government submitted bills to the National Council of the  Slovak Republic and kept all of its promises. If these bills  were not passed in parliament, it is not the government's  business. Proposals different from the government ones came to  parliament from the president's roundtable. That was, in  essence, the beginning of the split in the parliament. It was  forgotten that the legislative initiative belongs to the  government or a deputy, but not a roundtable.    Regarding the southern region of Slovakia, we must  corroborate that Slovakia is our common home. We are building  good relations and mutual respect among the citizens. No  assimilation of Hungarians is taking place in Slovakia, and  nothing like that is planned. The Slovaks in nationally mixed  regions must be supported just as much as the Hungarians. They  must not be worse off.    [Smolec] In his book The History of the 20th  Century, Paul Johnson considers the economic miracle of the  West the most important event of the century. Approximately 300  million people attained tremendous wealth over just 35 years.  The credit for this belongs, above all, to politicians with  authoritarian tendencies: Adenauer, de Gasperi, de Gaulle. At a  time of transition, such politicians are literally  indispensable. You indicate, by answering in all seriousness  the questions of a journalistic ignoramus with hooligan  tendencies, for instance, that you reject all authoritarian  forms of government. You even let yourself be insulted. Will  that not lead to your adversaries taking ever greater liberties?    [Meciar] In a democracy, power can be given to a single  person, but never so much that it could no longer be taken away  from that person. There have been instances of this in history.  Is there such a situation in Slovakia today? I do not think so.    Regarding communication, everyone defends himself to his  limit of jeopardy. This limit of jeopardy, then, is perceived  differently by each person, and he or she chooses the means of  protection accordingly. I do not feel threatened. Therefore, I  even talk to a journalistic ignoramus. I refuse to use violent  coercive methods to deal with political problems. It is you  journalists who should be dealing with infractions of  journalistic ethics.    [Smolec] A politician occasionally finds himself in a  situation in which he must take on what is called historic  responsibility. When have you been in such a situation?    [Meciar] I remember the situation in December 1992, when all  of the political parties, with the exception of the Slovak  National Party, refused to support us. We needed to get three  votes in the Federal Assembly in the final ballot on the demise  of the federation. They asked, "Who will take the  responsibility?" I got up then and said, "I take this  responsibility upon myself." There are times when it must be  done. I remember how the responsibility frightened even some  members of the HZDS delegation to Jihlava. In effect, they left  me all alone. I had more work with our own delegation than with  the Czech party. Under psychological pressure and with the  Czech ultimatum they retreated too far. It was necessary, then,  to take personal responsibility.    Following the emergence of the state, there was no state  structure. It was necessary to build it, and, of course, bear  the responsibility. We have now reached the stage at which this  structure is being implemented. Every state, every community,  every interest group should choose personalities capable of  representing and defending their interests. If the  personalities are removed, only the mediocre will remain. If an  authoritative decision is to be made, and if the situation  requires it, again, I will not hesitate. It is always necessary  to consider the time and the means. For a long time now, it has  not been valid that sordid means are justified by holy ends.  <H5>  [8 Feb p 4] </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  We Need Democracy Rather Than "Democratizers" </H5>   [Smolec] For how much longer will the enterprises depend  solely on the government and not on their own management?  Jefferson said that the best government is the one that governs  least.    [Meciar] The people themselves are feeling the direct  effects of the extent of the changes. Everyone feels that a  fundamental change is taking place. A gradual improvement was  assumed in 1989, and the systemic change was not expected. Let  us not forget that the change is taking place at a time of an  economic crisis, the collapse and creation of new markets, and  the collapse and creation of a new system of economic  cooperation. These are the external factors. Within society,  it is not just the emergence of the state but also the change of  economic conditions. We have inherited 89 billion [korunas] of  enterprise insolvency, a government budget deficit, inefficient  state administration, and a shortage of various operations that  are necessary for a functioning economic process. Therefore, it  is only logical that many enterprises are waiting for the state  to implement its policy. On the other hand, any policy or  change in the macrostructure is predestined to fail if it is not  accompanied by changes in the microstructure--i.e., by changes  in the community or enterprise. After all, each enterprise has  its own changes. There are changes in the management structure,  behavioral changes, and adjustments to become a competitive  enterprise of the market type, which is something completely  different from the enterprises in a centrally planned economy.  We do not have people trained for this. They are learning on  the job. That is very costly for us. The relationship between  the enterprise sphere and the economic sphere of the state must  be a balanced one.    [Smolec] History has confirmed that every society that wants  to expand its freedom must make certain that it is not done at  the expense of duties and responsibility. In our country,  unfortunately, freedom has often been confused with anarchy.    [Meciar] The freedom of action, the freedom of cognition is  always limited by the limits of the freedom of another person.  Under the pretext of freedom, numerous mistakes have been made  in showing lack of respect for other people and violating their  rights, and by increasing violence. That is not good. We need  democracy rather than "democratizers." Freedom and discipline  are natural sisters of the same mother. The respect for one's  own freedom means to respect the freedom of others.  Self-discipline is the ability to respect certain socially  accepted rules. The expressions of anarchism of the type  "Everything is allowed" and "You can do anything" are an  expression of a lower standard of political culture, ignorance  of social processes, and deformation of democracy. These  "democratizers" exist. Just see how they gloat. Their ego is  always above anyone else, and the value of their interests is  higher than the value of interests of other people.    [Smolec] With the Western style of life, unaccustomed crime,  corruption, and fear came to Slovakia. The streets are  controlled by criminals, Mafia. It is rumored that the ranks of  the incorruptible (politicians and policemen) are thinning fast.  What does the government intend to do in this respect?    [Meciar] I have appealed to the citizens with the "clean  hands" initiative. It is not a single action but rather an  entire set of measures. The institutions that are founded must  be capable of such cleanliness. It is true that precisely  because politocracy is being replaced by the financial oligarchy  and power of money that many people began to gauge the values of  life by the value of money. The koruna expresses an economic  relation, however, and not a human value. Human values should  be the dominant ones. Corruption is a serious social ailment.  It is necessary to fight it by creating a suitable social  atmosphere and legislative rules. To be frank, I must admit  that, from the vantage point of the atmosphere, we have not been  successful. You can see that I am mostly attacked precisely  from these "get-rich-quick" circles. Trying to hide it would be  useless. The extent of contacts, links of numerous politicians  to these interest spheres, is so large that I am not even  certain whether they always act of their own will.    Regarding the issue of measures, the government submitted to  the National Council of the Slovak Republic a draft of  principles of the law on conflict of interests. We will see  what the stand of the parliament will be. A new law on the  police was adopted. The financial police was established. We  are building customs offices, taxation offices, and other  institutions. The taxation offices have already begun to  actively seek and prosecute dishonest methods of getting rich.  This struggle probably cannot ever be completely won, but it is  necessary to reduce the extent of it.    [Smolec] You are not only the Slovak prime minister but  also the HZDS chairman. Certain circles in Slovakia have been  reckoning recently, both under cover and openly, that a road to  the formation of a "broad coalition government" could be opened  by splitting the HZDS, by dividing its Deputies' Club, and  subsequently selecting a "suitable" person from this movement  for the post of prime minister. Is it only wishful thinking, or  do you admit at least some basis for such speculation?    [Meciar] The attack that is currently led against me has a  somewhat different background from before. It is guided by the  idea that the HZDS without Meciar would be a less dangerous  partner in the event of elections, or, rather, it would not be  dangerous at all. It is also reckoned that the conceivable  removal of the HZDS chairman will lead to the emergence of  several factions. By its disintegration, the movement that  today represents a genuine great political power would actually  clear space for the Party of the Democratic Left, or it would  facilitate an improvement in the status of the Christian  Democrats. The notions of cooperation, when the opposition  calls "Broad coalition yes, but without Meciar" could cause a  reaction of "Broad coalition yes, but without Weiss, without  Carnogursky." Is that in order? It is sick! We cannot demand  that one movement give up its representatives in favor of  representatives of another movement.    The formation of factions in the Deputies' Club or a  division of the Deputies' Club is one of frequent topics. It is  obvious that it cannot be done from without. I am sorry that  the president is conducting great consultations in this respect  with some National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies and  recommending specific alternatives. The HZDS has remained a  viable and democratic institution. It must decide for itself  what it will do. True, the speculation is continuing.    [Smolec] In conclusion, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to  present to you a proposal or, rather, a plea of the REPUBLIKA  readers. They suggest that you and also other members of the  Cabinet regularly answer their questions. Will you comply with  this plea?    [Meciar] REPUBLIKA literally fills a great gap in our  newspaper market and its offerings. After all, there were  hardly any papers that would seek objectivity. REPUBLIKA has  reached, in this respect, not only awareness but also the  journalistic culture. Therefore, I will be glad to take the  opportunity and be the first to answer the readers' questions.  Moreover, I am convinced that other members of the Cabinet will  be glad to accept the offer of cooperation with REPUBLIKA.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   EDITOR IN CHIEF's NOTE: As you see, dear readers, while we  were copying the interview and preparing it for publication, new  and even more dramatic events accumulated. Take the opportunity  provided by the prime minister's promise and send your questions  on current topical issues to the address of the REPUBLIKA  editorial office as soon as possible.</p>

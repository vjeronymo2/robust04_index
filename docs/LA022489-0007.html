			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITTERING  </P> <P> I have long been troubled by the litter and garbage that lines the city streets  and highways of California.  </P> <P> Last November, my husband and I drove across the southern United States. I was  embarrassed as a California resident to note we found the highways and cities  streets all across the country to be almost litter free. Even in depressed  areas of large cities the streets were cleaner than our suburban areas.  </P> <P> These cities also suffer, as we do, with a proliferation of fast-food  restaurants, which I have found in walking my neighborhood streets, to be the  single largest cause of the greatest amount of wayside trash. I'm sure if all  of these towns, cities and states can practice a better means of eliminating  litter, certainly California can also.  </P> <P> Let us begin with each of us not littering with even a cigarette butt and  insisting on the enforcement of litter laws by our law enforcement agencies. We  insult ourselves by littering. This is the only world we have to live in, let's  not bury ourselves in trash.  </P> <P> MRS. CEIL SORENSEN  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

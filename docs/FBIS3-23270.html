			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Roni Shaqed] </F>   [Text] The triangle of death -- that is what the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] calls the area whose base is formed by a  line between Gaza and Hebron and whose apex is the Ramalla  district. This is the arena in which the five death squads of  'Az a-din Elqasem, the military arm of Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], operate. Since the signing of the Declaration of  Principles by the PLO and Israel, the organization has murdered  12 Israelis inside the triangle.    The five squads are composed of just 15 wanted men. Six of  them, who operate on the West Bank, are residents of the Gaza  Strip. Five others live in Hebron, two escaped four months ago  from Dahariya Prison, and Ramalla is home to three of them,  including 'Abd Almon'am abu-Hamir, who killed General Security  Services [GSS] Coordinator No'am Cohen. The most wanted of the  15 is 'Ali 'A'etzi, a resident of Kafr Bani Hasan, not far from  Ari'el. Security officials announced this week that they believe  that 'A'etzi and two other wanted men were the ones who murdered  Tzipi Sason last weekend.    'Ali 'A'etzi, 30, has been active in the ranks of 'Az a-din  Elqasem since the summer of 1992. With two of his accomplices,  he staged an attack on an IDF unit at the Dir-Balut junction  last August. His comrades were killed but he managed to get  away. During the incident, Tomar David, of Kibbutz Manera, and  Lev Pisahov, of Beit-She'an, were also killed. The GSS has been  on his tail ever since.    'A'etzi has managed to evade a number of attempts to capture  him, each in the nick of time. He joined up with a cell of Gaza  residents with whom he has taken refuge most often in the  Ramalla area -- in the homes of sympathizers, in mosques and in  apartments rented by Hamas for that purpose. From time to time,  on the basis of orders from Hamas' military command, he arms  himself and goes out to kill, as he did last Friday on the  Cross-Samaria highway.    The security agencies stated this week that they believe  that  Hamas will step up its terror attacks in the coming weeks.  Preliminary signs have been seen recently in Hebron: wanted men  of 'Az a-din Elqasem issued flyers, used loudspeakers and posted  notices on walls declaring its intention to carry out a major  attack and calling on the people of the city to collect food in  anticipation of an extended curfew to follow.    Security officials believe that the latest attacks,  especially the murder of a GSS agent, have raised the standing  of the wanted men and Hamas in the territories. That fact  heightens fears that they will attempt to translate the momentum  of success into further terrorist actions.    The mass phenomenon of wanted men that characterized the  intifadah for the previous two to three years no longer exists  in the territories. At the peak of the intifadah, there were  some 500 wanted men on the West Bank, most of them unarmed. They  won widespread public sympathy and fearlessly went about in the  villages and the streets of the refugee camps. The residents  gave them shelter and refuge; most of them were street leaders.    Today, the IDF is engaged in a war against a well-defined  and  compact group. For the most part, it is the men of 'Az a-din  Elqasem. Generally speaking, Fatah's wanted men on the West Bank  receive a lower degree of attention.    Lt. Col. Nimrod, commander of the Ramalla region, says, "Our  primary task right now throughout Judea and Samaria is catching  the wanted men. Liquidating them is the only thing that will  bring real security to the area."    The men wanted in the territories up until two years ago  were  small fry compared to the small group on which the security  forces are now concentrating. They are all cut from the same  cloth. The group's members are imbued with an extreme form of  Islamic religious faith. They kill to fulfill religious  commandments and are ready to sacrifice themselves. Islam  promises them that such actions--including suicide  missions--will grant them the key to eternal life in Paradise.    The makeup of the cells--both in Gaza and on the West  Bank--makes them extremely dangerous. The Gazans are more  radical and more daring. In general, they also are more skilled  in executing operations. The six wanted Gazans are disciples of  'Imad 'A'aqel, the commander of 'Az a-din Elqasem's cadres who  was killed in Gaza about three months ago, and see themselves as  carrying on for him. Their trigger fingers are lighter.    As members of Hamas' military arm, the wanted men of 'Az  a-din Elqasem coordinate their actions with the movement's  military commands and other armed bands. The commands see that  they have money, weapons, guidance and other logistical  support--such as automobiles and safe houses or contact men and  helpers.    The 15 wanted men operate in small squads of three to four  terrorists each. As a general matter, they do not stay long in  any one hide-out. They shift from area to area, usually from one  part to another of the Gaza-Hebron-Ramalla triangle. They  generally travel in stolen Israeli automobiles bearing yellow  Israeli license plates.    It is known from a number of sources that the terrorists  often have stuck on their stolen cars stickers proclaiming  slogans associated with the settlers, such as: "The people are  with the Golan." On many occasions, they have walked the streets  wearing skull caps or wigs on their heads.    Each of the wanted men apparently has a forged identity  card.  Usually, the card belongs to a Hamas supporter, the original  holder's photo has been removed and the wanted man's picture  affixed in its place. Some of the wanted men have more than one  false identity card, some have Israeli identity cards provided  by residents of east Jerusalem.    Thanks to the stolen cars and the identity cards, they roam  the roads. Their guns are always close at hand in case of a  problem at one of the checkpoints. To prevent surprises, they  are careful to travel with assistance from helpers and contact  men, who usually travel the route that the wanted men plan to  take and make sure it is free of patrols, checkpoints and other  IDF activities. Only then do the terrorists set out.    They usually travel with protection. Helpers drive ahead of  the wanted men to warn of any possible danger or provide  assistance as needed. The wanted men sometimes travel by taxi or  bus. Such trips are usually considered safe in areas far from  their homes where they are not known and unlikely to be  identified.    The wanted men generally shuttle between the Gaza Strip and  the West Bank. The trip is made through various ruses. The main  problem is getting past the Gaza checkpoint. Entry into the Gaza  Strip is usually easier because the Israelis are more careful  with exit inspections. Reports reveal that in a number of  instances, wanted Gazans operating in the West Bank have managed  to get past the Erez checkpoint with their weapons hidden among  crates of vegetables.    They find hiding places--leased apartments, a room with an  activist in the organization, a room in a mosque or even a cave  for a night's sleep--through contact men. These helpers are  usually Hamas members among the students or the religious  establishment. In January, a squad of four wanted men headed by  Amjad Abu Halaf, one of Hamas' commanders in Hebron, was wiped  out in a student room in the city. The house where they hid out  was located near the student dormitories and leased from its  owners by students from the university in Hebron.    One wanted man hid out in one of the villages in the Ramalla  area in the house of an old woman. She got money from Hamas for  helping a "student" without knowing his true identity.    Arms are not their biggest problem. It became clear this  week  that a single Kalashnikov is enough to slaughter six Israelis.  Each Hamas wanted man has a personal weapon--usually a pistol,  hand grenades or a "Karl Gustav" or Uzi sub-machine gun.  Operational weapons--the Kalashnikov and the M-16, which are  used for murder missions--are distributed among the squads  according to plans drawn up by the command and in coordination  with the planning of the murder.    Ballistics tests have also revealed that an M-16 rifle held  by Hamas cells has periodically gone back and forth between the  Gaza Strip and the West Bank and been used in a plethora of  terrorist attacks. The Galilon rifle that was the personal  weapon of 'Imad 'A'aqel was seized three weeks ago after a  shoot-out in Palestine Square in which one of the Hamas wanted  men was killed.    Ballistics testing of the Galilon established that it was  used in a large number of attacks in the Hebron area and the  Gaza Strip. Bullets from it killed, to name just some, Lt. Col.  Me'ir Mintz and three Druze Border Patrol officers, Wafa Asad,  Ibrahim Shibel, and Mofa Abu-Shaykh.    Kalashnikovs, M-16's or Galils in working order are very  difficult to obtain even in Gaza. The price of a rifle generally  runs from 6,000 to 8,000 dinars (about 20,000 shekels). As a  result, these rifles are not used as personal weapons by the  squad members but left in caches between attacks.    IDF operations against the wanted men are based mainly on  information and intelligence supplied by GSS coordinators. Such  information can be obtained only through agents, in other words,  collaborators. 'Abd Almona'im Alhamid Naji, the murderer of  No'am Cohen, was such an agent. Over the years, he carried on a  long affair with Hamas; now he is the GSS's number-one target.  The newspaper ELIZATONA published at Bir Zeit University printed  a photograph of 'Abd Almona'im on the front page as a "hero."    Every soldier beginning service in the territories these  days  receives a page with 15 pictures of faces under the heading:  "Wanted Hamas Men in Judea and Samaria." The photo of 'Abd  Almona'im appears in the first row. The troops are requested to  memorize the names, descriptions, and other identifying marks of  the fugitives for future identification.    Lt. Col. Nimrod: "We're putting a lot of time into  operations  designed to create contact with the wanted men. We close off  areas without warning and stop suspicious cars at random."    "As part of this activity, we've formed closer ties to the  police. The specifications of every car suspected of being  stolen are immediately turned over to the police, who can get  them from the computer within minutes."    The IDF's relentless pursuit is breathing down hard on the  band of wanted men. Their homes are searched at night by the  GSS. Pressure is put on their families to turn them in.  Residents known as Hamas sympathizers are subjected to constant  visits. Periodic searches are also made in mosques. On top of  all that, undercover units have increased their activity.    The small number of wanted men, their ability to get by  under  difficult circumstances and their superb knowledge of the  terrain hinder the vast manhunt for them. But they too, not just  the IDF and the GSS, know that their days are numbered.</p>

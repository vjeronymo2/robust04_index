			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Hoechst profits up 16% at three months Pre-tax profits at Hoechst, one of Germany's big three chemicals groups, rose 16 per cent in the first three months of this year, climbing by DM70m to DM506m (Dollars 295.90m). Although the figures served to underscore the growing optimism in the European chemicals sector as the industry pulls out of cyclical recession, Hoechst warned that growth in profits for the full year would be restrained despite the encouraging start to the year. Hoechst, which suffered a 42 per cent drop in pre-tax profits last year, said profits in the quarter benefited from growth in sales volumes in markets outside Germany as well as the impact of cost-cutting. But the company said it would have to bear the costs this year of further restructuring. Last year restructuring charges amounted to DM1bn; the group has cut 12,000 jobs in the past three years and plans to cut 8,000 more in 1994 and 1995. It said business was likely to improve and that profits would increase despite the restructuring costs. The business environment was steadily becoming more favourable to the company's activities, it said, but recovery in Germany was very restrained. The muted optimism contrasts with Bayer which said last month that earnings this year would probably increase by 20 per cent.</p>

Iran's </F> Deposition"]    [Text] Pakistan's decision to not pursue a vote on its  resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on 9  March regarding the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir  was at the request of the friendly countries of Iran and China.  Iran assured Pakistan that India would permit a delegation of  the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] member countries to  visit occupied Kashmir so as to assess the human rights  violations there. The Pakistani delegation's spokesman cited  the Indian pledge as the reason for the decision to not seek a  vote on the resolution. On the very next day after the  deferment of the resolution, India's Minister of State for  External Affairs Salman Khurshid and External Affairs Minister  Dinesh Singh claimed that India had made no commitment to  provide an opportunity to the delegation of Islamic countries to  visit occupied Kashmir and that Pakistan unconditionally  deferred the vote on the resolution.    These statements by the Indian authorities have badly  affected the position of Pakistan, as the Indian external  affairs minister had rejected Pakistan's assertions. At this  juncture, political and media circles in Pakistan urged the  government to present a correct picture of the situation and say  whether India had really made any such commitment. In response  to this, Foreign Secretary Shahryar Khan said Pakistan has  documentary evidence of India's promise to let the ICO  delegation visit occupied Kashmir. Now, on arrival at  Islamabad, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's  special emissary and Deputy Foreign Minister Ala-ed-Din  Borujerdi has said in categorical terms that India promised Iran  and China that it would allow envoys from Islamic countries to  visit occupied Kashmir. The categorical announcement of the  Iranian guest is enough to make it clear that Pakistan's  assertion is right and that of India is wrong.    Definitely, Iran and China would have been surprised and  anguished over the Indian statements, but certainly no one in  Pakistan would be surprised about the Indian attitude. We are  quite familiar with India's record and have experienced its  numerous silly tricks. India's tendency has always been to make  promises when it comes under pressure on any problem, but when  it is relieved of that pressure, it fudges on the promises. We  experienced two instances of this, in 1948-49 and in 1962.  Coming under pressure from mojahedin in 1948-49, the Indian  Government promised to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir and  confirmed this in international fora. Soon after that, India  reneged on that promise. When India had to embrace defeat at  every step during its war with China in 1962 on the border  question, it expressed its readiness to hold talks with Pakistan  on the Kashmir issue and also held six rounds of foreign  minister-level talks under international pressure. As far as  the outcome of the talks are concerned, India was not prepared  to budge from its stubborn posture. The war on the border  question was over by then and India was out of danger.    When Pakistan moved a resolution on the Kashmir issue at  the UN General Assembly a few months ago, India, through the  mediation of mutual friends, extended an invitation to Pakistan  for talks on the Kashmir situation on the condition that  Pakistan withdraw its resolution. Pakistan accepted the offer  so as to make it clear to the world that it never refuses to  hold talks. As a result, bilateral talks were held at the  beginning of January. Even then, India maintained its unpleasant  tradition and refused to adopt any reasonable position.  Therefore, Pakistan was constrained to move its resolution at  the UN Human Rights Commission.    The latest announcement of Ala-ed-Din Borujerdi has once  again revealed India's falsehood and made it clear that it does  not honor pledges made at international fora. This statement by  the Iranian deputy foreign minister has once again put the ball  in India's court, and now India should either allow the ICO  delegation to visit Kashmir or become a liar before Iran and  China in particular and the international community in general.  India also made the flamboyant claim that it does not want to  conceal the situation in occupied Kashmir from the eyes of the  world, and has granted permission to visit to the ambassadors of  European countries first and to those of neutral countries  thereafter. The foreign diplomats who visited the state,  however, while considering the Indian claim regarding the  situation in occupied Kashmir, have said that they were not  allowed to tour the state freely. The 10 envoys of the  delegation were virtual prisoners in the hands of the Indian  administration. They were not allowed to meet people freely nor  were they allowed access to the areas of their choice. Those  who wanted to meet the envoys were not allowed to enter the  Government Guest House. The diplomats said that wherever they  went they encountered strong official security, and those who  met them said without mincing words that they do not want to  stay with India and that they either want total independence or  annexation to Pakistan. This account of the diplomats after  their visit makes it clear that a powerful struggle continues in  Kashmir for escape from the bondage of India, and India is not  willing to permit foreign observers to take stock of the  situation there. If the internal situation bars India from  permitting the ICO delegation to review the situation in the  state despite its latest pledge, the people of Pakistan can  fully understand it. It is the duty of the Government of  Pakistan to continuously raise the Kashmir issue at  international fora and follow India closely. It is the moral  responsibility of Iran and China to ask India to let the ICO  delegation visit the state as promised. To a great extent, the  statement of the Iranian deputy foreign minister has disproved  the propaganda by the opposition in Pakistan against the  government's deferment of the resolution.</p>

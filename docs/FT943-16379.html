			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: 'Glib and irresponsible talk' leads the debate on cause and effect - David Goodhart weighs the contributors' arguments on the reasons for and costs of unemployment Sir Michael Perry, joint chairman of Unilever, recently said that 'glib talk about full employment is alarmingly irresponsible'. Most of the contributors to the TUC debate are 'irresponsible' in that they believe full employment is possible, albeit hard to achieve. Most of the writers who address the causes of unemployment point to the economic 'shocks' of the 1970s and early 1980s - notably the sharp rises in oil prices - as well as the strains caused by structural change which have led to job losses in traditional industries and a reduction in demand for unskilled workers. Some papers, such as that by Mr Chris Freeman of Sussex University, stress the effect of information technology, while that by Mr Richard Freeman of Harvard University examines competition from low-cost countries. Mr Freeman concludes that globalisation has had an impact on some unskilled workers - but not as great as some people believe. Ms Christine Greenhalgh and Ms Mary Gregory from, respectively, St Peter's and St Hilda's colleges, Oxford, emphasise the loss of industrial capacity and skills which creates a large group of long-term unemployed people who are not re-absorbed into the jobs market even during periods of recovery. Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research says that full employment in the 1950s and 1960s was not the result of the government intervention to finance extra spending, nor flexibility in market mechanisms which were considerably more rigid than today. What characterised the period was a condition of persistently high, and at times excess, demand. Mr Britton suggests that what prevented wages and prices from rising faster was the continued regulation of credit, foreign exchange and investment, but also 'responsibility and public spirit' as a restraint on inflationary pressure. On the costs of unemployment, Mr David Piachaud of the London School of Economics finds that the number of people living in poverty as a result of unemployment tripled between 1979 and 1991 to more than 2m. According to census studies unemployment raises the chance that a man will die in the next decade by one-third, and by 50 per cent for those in middle age. Mr Piachaud also finds a clear correlation between unemployment and both crime and racism. Combining social security benefits and taxes forgone, the cost of unemployment to the exchequer is put at Pounds 26bn per year, or more than Pounds 9,000 per unemployed person. This is equivalent to unemployment imposing a tax of 10 pence on basic rate income tax. But none of the writers defines in any detail what full employment might be. Several imply that, with fewer 'jobs for life' and a more competitive economy, short-term unemployment might even rise. Mr Richard Layard of the London School of Economics comes close to saying that full employment is the absence of long-term unemployment - defined as people who have been unemployed for more than one year. Most agree that growth is not enough to create full employment, and nobody supports protectionism or restrictions on the use of technology. Mr John Philpott of the Employment Policy Institute says that 'supply-side problems would seem to contribute more to unemployment in 1994 than was the case in 1944'. But that does not mean that either training or deregulation is the answer. Britain's labour market seems to reflect the worst of both the US and the European systems, according to Mr Philpott. This means more relatively poor people in work but also implies a high level of unemployment and welfare dependency. The most concrete proposals come from Mr Richard Layard and Mr Dennis Snower of Birkbeck College, London University. Both favour big subsidies to employers to take on the long-term unemployed. Ms Patricia Hewitt of the Institute of Public Policy Research, and Mr Paul Ormerod, of the University of Manchester, call for more innovative ways of sharing work around, but Mr Philpott warns that changing the pattern of work will not in itself expand its volume. Several ideas for reforming the benefit system are floated, including a lump-sum 'Back to Work' payment. But Mr Britton concludes that society gave up full employment because the cost in terms of other objectives was too high. He warns that returning to it now will be costly - in terms of extra taxes or public expenditure forgone - and will require a shift towards more social solidarity.</p>

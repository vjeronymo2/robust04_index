			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AKIRA': HIGH-TECH HOKUM FROM JAPAN  </P> <P> "Akira" (at the Westside Pavilion), a Japanese animated feature based on  Katsuhiro Otomo's popular comic books about a teen-age motorcycle gang, is a  compendium of the worst cliches of Japanese animation -- two hours of chases,  laser attacks, machine-gun battles, spilled stage blood, computer-animated  backgrounds and hokey dialogue.  </P> <P> Buried in the morass is a story of sorts, but anyone who isn't well-grounded in  the Akira comics, which are set in post-apocalypse Tokyo, circa AD 2030, will  be hopelessly lost by the end of the first half-hour.  </P> <P> Otomo, who wrote and directed the movie, has told interviewers that he set out  to "make a film that would be a jumble of images, instead of just showing the  highlights of each scene," and on that score, he succeeded. "Akira" is a jumble  of high-tech visuals that will appeal only to hard-core Japanese animation  fans. Viewers in search of a coherent narrative or polished animation should  look elsewhere.

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FUNDAMENTALS OF LEARNING  </P> <P> "Decades of research and reform have not altered the fundamental facts of  teaching," writes Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder. "The task of  universal, public, elementary education is still usually being conducted by a  woman alone in a little room."  </P> <P> The fundamental facts about teaching and education were not changed by this  week's education summit of President Bush and the nation's governors at Thomas  Jefferson's University of Virginia. But it was historic nonetheless, in its  advocacy for those women and men teaching "alone in a little room," and in the  national goals finally set for a country that spends a greater percentage of  its gross national product on education than Japan but has less to show for it.  </P> <P> The bad news about U.S. education is familiar by now: American high schools  graduate 700,000 functional illiterates every year; more than 4 million  students drop out each year; European and Asian students consistently outrank  Americans in international math and science examinations.  </P> <P> But it is not true, as some in Washington would have you believe, that the 29%  increase in education spending by state and local governments (and a small  decrease in the federal share) in the last several years has made no  difference. The National Assessment of Educational Progress has found recent  improvements in the reading ability of elementary school students. Since 1984  in California, the percentage of students scoring above average on the  Scholastic Achievement Tests has risen 28% for verbal and 32% for math; the  overall scores for minority students have increased; and there has been a 92%  jump in the rate of high school seniors passing the Advanced Placement exam for  college.  </P> <P> One of the goals set at the summit -- to promote early childhood development --  is an acknowledgement that educators already know that reaching a child early  can make a dramatic difference. Head Start, a preschool program for low-income  children, has proved effective in offsetting later social and learning  problems. In spite of the Administration's nervousness about increased federal  education spending, money spent on the programs with fine track records, such  as Head Start, is money prudently spent. Right now, Head Start is only reaching  one out of the five children who need it. Although the federal government  accounts for only 9% of education funding, its role should not be undervalued:  the federal government pays for two-thirds of the nation's remedial education  programs.  </P> <P> The answers do not lie with government alone. Already, the private sector has  taken action to better prepare young people for the changing and increasingly  technical job market. On-the-job reading and math programs help undereducated  workers. And in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Atlanta,  Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Houston and Miami, adopt-a-class programs for the  low-income but high-achieving are thriving. Promoted by the National Urban  League and supported by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., they serve as examples of  enlightened self-interest.  </P> <P> As he returns from the summit, Gov. George Deukmejian needs to send out a  message that he is willing to champion and sign measures that will help reach  the literacy goals agreed upon at the summit. Removing California's dubious  distinction as having some of the nation's most overcrowded classrooms would be  a start. Such a step would help enhance the chances that more bright, committed  people want to enter that "little room" to teach children whose minds ideally  are nurtured long before they first enter a classroom.  </P></p>

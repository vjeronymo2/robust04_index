			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Observer: Votez bleu The Socialist Group in the European Parliament - which recently announced via some fine posters and postcards that Napoleon and Charlemagne would have voted Yes in Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht - have now brought their campaign efforts a bit more up to date. They have taken out an access code on France's high-tech, on-line Minitel service, which is available to all telephone subscribers. So all those punching 'Vote Oui' into their Minitel handset will get a crisp and graphic explanation of why they should indeed vote Yes on Sunday; 4,000 callers have so far availed themselves of this clarification. And as a spoiling tactic, the Socialists also booked the 'Vote Non' code so as to keep one jump ahead of the motley rejectionist front in the Maastricht campaign. The smirk on their faces acquired a slightly pink hue, however, when it was discovered that the simple 'Oui' access code gains callers entry to a distinctly bluer, though equally graphic area - one of Minitel's porn services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO)  compiled its 1994 [as published] JETRO white paper on 20  December. According to the white paper's chapter on investment,  the world's direct foreign investment (on the basis of  international balance of payments) for 1992 decreased by 14.2  percent over the previous year to $158 billion two years in a  row due to an investment drop in Japan and Europe where the  economy has been sluggish.    Japan's direct foreign investment (on the basis of  international balance of payments) drastically dropped by 43.9  percent from the previous year to $17.2 billion. Japan, which  had enjoyed first place in direct foreign investment for three  years since 1989, sharply slid to the fourth place. Meanwhile,  the United States, which positively invested in Latin America  and Asia, ranked first for the first time in six years since  1986. U.S. direct foreign investment (on the same basis)  increased by 19.5 percent to $34.7 billion in 1992.    Among the reasons cited by JETRO for the decrease in Japan's  direct foreign investment are: 1) the financial condition of  companies has worsened following the collapse of the so-called  bubble economy; 2) profitability of investment has deteriorated  in Europe and America; and 3) Asian NIES (newly industrializing  economies) are losing their advantages as a production base  because of a sharp increase in wages.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Chile warms up to agricultural exporting - Food products are now accounting for 29 per cent of the country's overseas earnings Chile's new democratic president, Mr Eduardo Frei, whose coalition government assumed power last Friday, has inherited an agricultural industry with a growth record that few can match. Expanding farm production and a dramatic increase in overseas sales of food products, which now account for 29 per cent of export earnings, have made a big contribution to the country's economic growth, which has averaged almost 7.5 per cent over the past three years. Since 1986 exports derived from agriculture, horticulture and forestry have risen from a little more than USDollars 1bn a year to almost USDollars 3bn, the greatest expansions being in fruit and timber products. Most agricultural production takes place in the Central Valley which stretches 240km north and 950km south of the capital, Santiago. The climate in the area is Mediterranean and snow melt from the vast Andes range of mountains provides more water for irrigation than Chilean farmers are ever likely to need. Soil quality is mainly good and productivity, already generally high, is improving as new technology is introduced. Average wages are low, generally not much more than USDollars 3,000 a year. These factors add up to a potent agri-economic force, always assuming that inflation, currently 12.2 per cent a year, can be controlled and that labour remains cheap. 'Chilean businessmen are very ambitious,' says Mr Juan Figueroa, the outgoing minister of agriculture, who looks back on his period as minister with satisfaction. 'We set out,' he says, 'to increase production and productivity; to increase profits to benefit all, including those on low incomes; and to improve environmental protection. We have been successful as far as we can tell.' Needless to say the Sociedad Nacional de Agricultura, the Chilean farmers' union, does not Mr Figueroa's achievements in quite such a favourable light. Mr Raul Garcia, the secretary general of the union, points out that the growth of agricultural production has slowed during the last couple of years. He lists a variety of reasons: farmers' profits are too low because of subsidies in other countries and the lack of them in Chile; the low value of the Chilean peso restricts export profits; and the Chilean government has allowed the dumping of farm products from other countries, such as wheat flour from Argentina, which undermines prices for Chilean farmers. This combination of factors means that many of Chile's army of small farms are not viable, the secretary general says. He argues that the government should design a programme for rationalising these small properties and assisting the individuals concerned to move to other activities. Nevertheless Mr Figueroa's 'ambitious businessmen' are showing what can be done in spite of the problems. Mr Manuel Aritzia, whose family has built an enormous poultry production and processing business, is a case in point. The production side of the business consists of 530 houses, each accommodating 22,000 chickens for meat, together with all the breeding hens, originally from North American stock, to make the company totally integrated and self-contained. Another 33 houses forms the basis of what could become a turkey enterprise of similar scale. The company also mills and mixes the 24,000 tonnes of feed the poultry consume each month and then, perhaps less acceptably to British taste, feeds much of the chicken droppings to beef cattle running on the 15,000 hectares of land the family owns. The company also processes every bird it produces, tailoring each carcass, cut, kebab or whatever to the market for which it is destined. Aritzia products are exported to every continent. Chile's leading fruit exporting company is David del Curtis. Dealing in the entire range of fruit from apples and pears to grapes kiwi fruit, the company grows 20 per cent of what it exports and buys the rest from about 1,000 Chilean growers. But it is only interested in export quality produce. Any fruit supplied to it which does not meet the standards required (and these vary from market to market in nightmarish detail) is wholesaled on the domestic market for what it will fetch and the grower paid accordingly. The company has an annual turnover of USDollars 100m. And then of course there is the wine. Chilean wine makers have a tradition, not for vintage special years, but for consistency. In order to achieve this they blend the production of different vineyards and even different years. Having been brought up in the European school of wine appreciation I was ready to criticise this 'supermarket' approach. But hard as I tried  - and I researched the matter most conscientiously - I was unable to find a red or a white that I could classify as less than excellent. Like the rest of Chilean produce it is good already but is, I predict, likely to become an even bigger force to be reckoned with.</p>

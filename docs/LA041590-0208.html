			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> I think Feinstein has sufficient political experience, progressive and  pragmatic policies, mental toughness, charisma, candidness and sensitivity to  impress and win over Southern California voters.  </P> <P> It would be a nice change of pace to have a woman in the governor's office,  which up to now has been an exclusive all-males' club.  </P> <P> Some criticize Feinstein because she has high-class tastes. But what's wrong  with a governor who is sophisticated and has a degree of culture, especially  since it doesn't prevent her from identifying with and helping minority groups?  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

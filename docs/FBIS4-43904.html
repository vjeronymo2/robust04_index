			<p>BFN     [Text] Halle (DPA) -- The Presidium of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] on Tuesday [21 June] met in  Halle to prepare for the extraordinary SPD congress. Headed by  SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, the party leaders want to set the  final course for the one-day congress on Wednesday.    Before the meeting, leading Social Democrats expressed the  conviction that the party congress will put the SPD on the  offensive again after the defeat at the European elections.  Chairman Scharping, who is to be officially elected as the  SPD's candidate for the chancellor's office in Halle, will be  strengthened for entering the conflict with Chancellor Helmut  Kohl, SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen. "I expect the  party congress to give a strong signal that we accept the  challenges and dare a new beginning for a policy of reforms and  renewal." The European election is over; the struggle for the  majority in the Federal Government is starting only now.    The party leadership also expects with excitement  Scharping's  speech on Wednesday, with which he wants to motivate the SPD  again for the struggle for the change in government in Bonn. In  addition to Scharping's election, the approximately 500  delegates intend to adopt a government program. If the party  leadership has its way, a coalition debate will be avoided at  any cost, even though delegates have announced motions for an  alliance with the Greens.    After the Presidium meeting, the Executive Committee and the  Party Council will meet in Halle in the afternoon. In the  evening, the SPD top politicians plan to intervene in the  Landtag election campaign in Saxony-Anhalt by holding several  rallies. A new parliament will be elected there next Sunday.</p>

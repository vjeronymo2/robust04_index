			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Xin (7115 2450)] </F>   [Text] Canberra, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- Australian Prime  Minister Keating told visiting Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten  in their talks this afternoon that he wishes to see the  continued prosperity and stability of Hong Kong in the  transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.    In a phone interview with XINHUA, a spokesman for Keating  said that during the talks, the prime minister stressed that  Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is important to Australia.  The spokesman said: The talks between Keating and Patten  focused on reinforcing bilateral economic relations and trade,  Hong Kong's role in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,  and regional security.    Australia has close economic ties with Hong Kong. Hong Kong  is among Australia's top eight trading partners. Australia's  investment in Hong Kong rose 23 percent last year, approaching  $1.8 billion.    Patten started his week-long official visit here on 13  January. Although he claimed that the main purpose of his visit  is to reinforce bilateral economic ties, in a speech he gave  last evening and in his conversations with press circles, he  went to great lengths to publicize his "constitutional reform  package" in an attempt to win Australia's support.    Keating has said publicly that his government is not  interested in Patten's "constitutional reform package."    Leaders of Overseas Chinese organizations and business  circles in Australia have issued statements one after another in  recent days which said that Patten and the stuff he is trying to  promote in Hong Kong are not welcome in the Chinese community in  Australia.</p>

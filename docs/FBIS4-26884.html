			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Xia: "Employee Rights Get Boost From Labour Chief"] </F>   [Text] Shijiazhuang -- Workers' rights must be guaranteed  as their enterprises develop under a modern corporate system, a  leading labour official said over the weekend.    Workers will remain "the masters of State-owned enterprises"  when they are converted into limited-liability companies, said  Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions (ACTFU). Their rights to participate in the firms'  management should not be deprived, Yang added.    "It is a misunderstanding that the system of employees'  congress--a proven effective way for workers to be involved in  management supervision--belongs only to the planned economy and  is not suitable to the modern enterprise system," Yang said.    Employee enthusiasm and creativity are necessary components  of the switch from state-owned firms to corporations. This  ensures greater profits and leads to top value of State assets.  <H5>  Congress </H5>   The employees' congress, therefore, has an even more  important role to play, he said.    "The employees' congress should not be replaced by the board  of directors," Yang said. "The two should coexist in  corporations."    Congresses are the governing body of enterprises, elected by  its workers. All important decisions, including managerial  appointments and enterprise plans, should be submitted to  employees' congresses for approval, Yang said.    Labour relations within state firms will undergo great  changes when the corporate system is introduced. Workers now  need to sign labour contracts with their enterprises.    The contracts should guarantee that workers enjoy rational  pay, work hours, safety, insurance and welfare, he said.    In contract-signing, negotiations should be carried out  between the trade unions on behalf of workers and the board of  directors. Disputes which cannot be resolved through  negotiations should be settled according to relevant laws, Yang  said.    Wei Jianxing, chairman of ACFTU, also stressed workers'  rights in decisionmaking must be guaranteed when the firm's  management mechanism is transformed.    At the ACTFU four-day conference, which ended yesterday,  representatives from more than 20 state enterprises also  exchanged their experiences in promoting trade unions and  individual workers in carrying out reforms.</p>

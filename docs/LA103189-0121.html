			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT CLAIMS EPA FAILS TO ENFORCE CLEAN WATER ACT  </P> <P> Two leading watchdog groups filed suit in federal court Monday, charging that  the Environmental Protection Agency allows more than a billion pounds of toxic  contaminants to pollute the nation's waterways and sewage treatment facilities  annually by failing to enforce the Clean Water Act.  </P> <P> Currently, the EPA provides strict controls over 24 major industries and 126  toxic pollutants. In the suit, the National Resources Defense Council and  Public Citizen contend that at least a dozen industries and hundreds of  pollutants escape scrutiny.  </P> <P> "There are gaping loopholes in the EPA's regulatory scheme," said Eric  Glitzenstein, an attorney for Public Citizen. "The list of 126 priority  pollutants was never intended to be exclusive. Thus, many of the rules do not  control the full range of dangerous pollutants."  </P> <P> EPA statistics from 1987 -- the most recently compiled -- show that California  ranks second among states in releasing toxic contaminants into sewage plants  and fifth in emissions into rivers, lakes and coastal waters.  </P> <P> An EPA spokeswoman said that the agency is complying with the Clean Water Act  and has reduced the release of toxics by about 800 million pounds every year.  </P></p>

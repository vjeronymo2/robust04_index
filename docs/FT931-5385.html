			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Companies cut back on recruitment JAPANESE companies are scaling back recruitment in an attempt to cut costs and adjust to leaner times. Japan Air Lines yesterday said it would defer hiring 375 stewardesses for five months. Seibu Department Store, a leading retailer, plans to halve its recruiting next year from about 439 in fiscal 1993. Toyota, the leading car maker, has for the first time in five years stopped hiring full- time production workers outside the usual recruiting period. There is growing public and government concern about the cancellations and their effect on society. The Ministry of Labour said this week it would propose amending part of the Employment Security Law to require companies planning to cancel promised employment to graduates to notify public job security agencies and school authorities. The companies themselves would be publicly identified. Fourteen companies have so far cancelled the hiring of 211 graduates who had been told that they would be hired from April. Japanese law has no provision for punishing violators of the gentleman's agreement known as naitei, by which graduates are promised employment at companies and are themselves more or less committed to that promise. The ministry hopes to introduce its new measure by the end of the month after receiving a report from its advisory council. Japanese companies are reluctant to make employees redundant, as such moves are frowned upon by society, and cancelling recruitment plans is one of the few options available to them to cut employment costs. However, the government has become concerned about the social impact of such moves, and the ministry has publicly asked corporations not to cut their workforces drastically in an attempt to cut costs. JAL said that it had decided to postpone hiring the stewardesses because the number of flights it will have during the period will be less than planned as a result its restructuring programme. By September, the airline says, it should be able to hire new recruits as other stewardesses retire.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Ukraine to introduce special exchange rate for foreign investors UKRAINE will introduce a special exchange rate for foreign investors wishing to take advantage of its ambitious privatisation plans, Mr Volodymyr Lanovyj, the republic's minister for property and entrepreneurship said in London yesterday. A new law on foreign investment will be approved by the Ukrainian parliament next month, he said at the start of a visit to potential UK investors and City institutions. Foreigners will not initially be allowed to purchase land but will be able to lease land for up to 90 years and have property rights over buildings and fixtures. The right for foreigners to own property could be included in the legislation within the next two or three years, he added. Ukraine is being advised on privatisation by Hambros merchant bank, whose executive director, Sir Michael Butler, has been advising the new government on financial and economic affairs. Ukraine hopes to privatise 65 per cent of its nearly 10,000 large and medium-sized enterprises over the next five years. It is adopting a Czechoslovak-style voucher privatisation scheme under which all Ukrainians, including children, will be entitled to free vouchers transferable into shares. Up to 40 per cent of assets will be disposed of in this way. The state will hold the remaining 60 per cent of shares until they can be sold to foreign or domestic investors. The government hopes to privatise 250 large enterprises this year, during which it also hopes to privatise 80 per cent of shops and small enterprises. The complex nature of large-scale privatisation programmes has delayed similar rapid privatisation plans in central Europe, however.</p>

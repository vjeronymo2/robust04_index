			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Fourth win bolsters hopes of long careers AS THE new junior ministers enter their departments for their first full day in office today many are looking forward to long ministerial careers. The fourth Conservative general election victory has reinforced the belief among some former Tory backbenchers that they should not tolerate obstruction from the Sir Humphreys of the Civil Service. While some of those in the re-shuffle have spent almost their entire careers in politics, others will bring business experience to bear. As long ago as last year a few had considered 'management tactics' for their first days in a department. One said that though it was usual for junior ministers to go to the permanent secretary's office to be briefed on arrival, he would insist that the permanent secretary came to his office for the initial discussion. He would also insist on senior officials always calling him by his ministerial title rather than his first name, and would not allow meetings to be put in his diary without his consent. Prospective ministers are acutely aware of the danger of becoming bogged down in minutiae, losing contact with the parliamentary party and lacking time to think strategically. Alongside the standard ploy of being particularly difficult and demanding in the first few weeks, at least one other aspiring minister had in mind a more detailed campaign for ensuring he got a grip on his department. This involved identifying the most indiscreet member of his private office - usually made up of youngish high-flyers  - and finding out which were the dullest and worst areas of the department. Armed with this information, he would, within the next few months, provoke a row with the least satisfactory officials, and secure their transfer to a backwater. 'Pour encourager les autres,' he said with a smile. These are plans made before seeing the reality of the red boxes of government papers. Even once they are familiar with their duties, new ministers may be surprised at the volume of relatively unimportant but reasonably urgent decisions they have to take. The number of unforeseen engagements filling their days, and the briefings and draft speeches involved, can also come as a shock. After all, politicians have entered their ministries with brave words before. Even if destined for long and successful careers, their time in any junior post may be no more than about 18 months. According to a recent report by Professor Richard Rose of the University of Strathclyde, frequent reshuffles made many ministers 'toddlers rather than veterans' in their departmental responsibilities. The study said ministers' short terms in office encouraged them to concentrate on topics that offered short-term popularity and hampered their ability to direct government - but did make them good political ambassadors for their departments. Yesterday's appointees have been warned.</p>

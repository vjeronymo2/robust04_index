			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [DIE WELT report: "North Rhine-Westphalia: Mafia Causes </F> DM102-Million Damage"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- Drugs, pimping, and gunrunning are  the focal points of organized crime in North Rhine-Westphalia.  This is demonstrated by the "1993 situation report on organized  crime," that was presented yesterday by Interior Minister  Herbert Schnoor (Social Democratic Party of Germany) in  Duesseldorf.    According to Schnoor, in 87 investigation proceedings the  police exposed 5,589 individual offenses last year. The damage  is estimated at more than 102 million German marks [DM].    Schnoor announced that North Rhine-Westphalia will double  the  number of offices for combating organized crime before the end  of the year. Organized crime harbors a "tremendous danger  potential" and has to be combated by all the means of the  rule-of-law state.    According to Schnoor, of 2,115 identified persons who are  suspected of crimes, 58 percent come from Germany and 42 percent  from abroad. There are leads to 33 states in Europe, Asia, and  North and South America. "No field is so international as  organized crime," Schnoor said. In one of the proceedings the  suspects came from 13 different countries.    The largest group of perpetrators comprised 412 persons;  four  other proceedings were aimed against groups with more than 100  persons. The greatest success: German and Dutch investigators  broke up a drug ring that produced so-called Ecstasy tablets  with a market value of at least DM250 million for the entire  European and North American market.    According to the minister, the police have already achieved  initial successes as a result of the money-laundering law that  came into force in late November. Last year, 158 suspicious  money transactions were reported by financial institutions to  the land office of criminal investigation. In 115 cases the  suspicion of money-laundering was confirmed, he said.</p>

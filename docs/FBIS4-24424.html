			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ji Hongkeng (6060 3126 6342); from the special </F> column: "China's March Toward Economic Efficiency"]    [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- In the past, people  used to say Shanghai people were astute but somewhat unwise. It  is different now. We can get some idea of this by viewing  Shanghai's use of foreign capital.    The strategic policy known as "one head, three centers"  (aimed at building Shanghai into one of the world's economic,  banking, and trade centers by relying on the development of the  Pudong New District as the head or driving force) is bringing  about earth- shaking changes in Shanghai. The Shanghai people  have stood up, they have widened their horizon, and naturally  they have demonstrated their skills and become much wiser.  <H5>  "Optimization" and "Stressing Eugenics" </H5>   On the matter of utilizing foreign capital, whether to  recklessly go after quotas and quantity and to integrate  "quantity" with "quality" or to pay more attention to quality --  this is a problem that has not been satisfactorily solved until  now. The practice of seeking quick results, rushing headlong  into mass action, and never rejecting offers is very common  today. As a result, "what has been picked up and placed into  the basket" was not necessarily a "vegetable."    What is astute and wise about Shanghai is that its people  pay  attention to efficiency. The rate of success in forming joint  ventures was high, and the economic results were good. Among  the nearly 4,000 foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai, more  than 80 percent are making profits. Last year, their exports  were worth $1.61 billion, accounting for 22 percent of the  municipality's total export volume. Last year, the (Hezhong  Kaili) Air Conditioning Equipment Company's per-capita profit  (after tax) was 50 yuan, making it an outstanding enterprise.  The joint venture partner is the transnational (Kaili)  Corporation of the United States, which has been known as "the  father of central air conditioning." Its American deputy  director boasted that the joint venture is the most successful  enterprise the corporation has invested.    The Shanghai Caohejing New Technology Development Zone has  paid attention to the size of investment projects. More than  120 foreign-funded enterprises have been established in this  zone, with the rate of success reaching 95 percent. It has  developed into an industrial park with microelectronics as the  forerunner, followed by industries employing new technologies,  such as computers, optical fiber communications, biological  engineering, new materials, electronic parts and elements,  industrial automation instruments and meters, and the space and  aviation industry. A large number of well-known transnational  corporations have established plants in the zone, and 16 of them  were investment projects with more than $10 million each. Last  year, 82 foreign-funded enterprises went into production. Their  per-capita income was 340,000 yuan; per-capita tax and profit,  77,000 yuan; and per-capita foreign exchange earnings, 26,500  yuan. In this zone, the Shanghai (Fukesibolo) Company, a  Sino-U.S. joint venture, manufactures industrial "brains" --  instruments, meters, and systems for controlling and managing  industrial processes. Its automation control systems have been  used by the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The company made  profits in its second year after going into production, with  profits surging to a peak in 1991. Between 1991-1993, the  foreign joint venture partner made more than $4 million. A boss  of the foreign joint venture's mother company said jokingly,  when he met general manager Wang Zhenfeng in Singapore: "Hey,  we are millionaires!"    In Shanghai, veteran experts said that selecting the correct  investment project is very important, adding, to select the  right investment project, it is better to have less than too  many. In using foreign capital, it is necessary to pay  attention to "optimization" and "eugenics." This is because if  a problem occurs in the fetus of the mother, economic efficiency  is out of the question. They said: Foreign businessmen have  come to make money, but we have to choose the moneymaker who  will benefit China. This is called mutual benefit.    To accept offers uncritically is not wise. A responsible  person of the State Council Special Economic Zone Affairs Office  in charge of foreign investments said: In using foreign  capital, we should take the initiative and avoid being passive.  We should not accept all offers. Instead, we should strive for  projects that we need.    Many economically efficient joint ventures in Shanghai  constantly import advanced technologies; some even set such a  condition in the joint venture contracts. This is a wise policy.    A one-time deal with respect to importing technology is not  to our advantage, let alone importing what is abandoned by  others. Modern science and technology are subject to fast  updating. To make our enterprises economically efficient and  win in competition, we must not overlook the dynamic import of  technology.    What do we mean by dynamic import? It means that the  imported technology should be like a river with constantly  running water: After an imported project is put into operation,  it continues to receive updated versions of the technology from  its foreign provider. In this way, the product will be  maintained at an advanced technological level and have  competitive power in the international market for a long time.    The automatic control system at Shanghai's Baoshan Iron and  Steel Corporation is a new product just developed in the United  States and supplied by a Sino-American joint venture in Shanghai  -- the (Foxboro) Company. How could the company obtain the  product so fast? It is because the company has a constant  supply of the latest American technologies. According to the  company, to import a product dynamically is like eating, and you  should chew one in your mouth, hold another in your hand, and  set eyes on a third; otherwise, the imported product will be  unpopular and even lose its market.    The Sino-German Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation [SVWC]  imported the technology for the Santana sedan. According to the  contract, the German partner is obligated to help the  corporation develop new car models. With the constant increase  in the proportion of parts produced by our country, for the  first time, our sedan industry has the ability to follow  advanced foreign technology and to develop new car models. Now,  SVWC has begun to develop a new model. So far, the SVWC has  produced more than 200,000 sedans which sell very well. It  plans to produce 200,000 cars this year. When the new model is  developed, SVWC will become even stronger.    The strong win and the weak fail. Old products and  technology inevitably have no competitive market power. When  using foreign capital, and particularly when using it in running  high-technology industries, it is necessary to regard dynamic  import as an important part of the cooperation.  <H5>  Enlightenment From the Investment by Transnational Companies </H5>   The comrades in Shanghai told me that 27 of the world's top  100 transnational industrial companies have come to invest in  Shanghai, and others are discussing investment projects with us.  In the New Pudong District, 30 joint ventures, cooperative  enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises have  investment from transnational companies. Large transnational  companies, with combined functions of investment, trading, and  banking, is the major form of modern production in the present  world. They have more and more become the principal part of the  world's economic activities. In cooperation with them, we can  benefit from their large-scale and systematic operation.    The United Nations has rated the Shanghai Bell Telephone  Equipment Manufacturing Company, a famous Sino-Belgian joint  venture, as one of the top 10 best joint ventures for the fourth  consecutive time. All its 1994 products have been pre-sold.  (Mauriel), an old member of the board of directors on the  Belgian side, arrived in Shanghai in April; it was his 100th  visit to China. Well-known in Belgium for being a representative  of the Sino-Belgian joint venture "Shanghai Bell" founded 11  years ago, he is frequently invited to give lectures here and  there, and he takes pride in his role. Since "Shanghai Bell"  tided over some difficulties in the initial stage, its major  product, the Sino-Belgian digital program-controlled telephone  exchange system (of the world's technological level of the late  eighties), has been selected by the state as an exceptional  piece of equipment and rated a universal product up to (ARCAT)  [a er ka te 7093 1422 0595 3676] international standards. The  product can compete with its counterparts produced by other  companies in the world in terms of both quality and price.  Shanghai Bell's products account for more than one third of all  program-controlled telephone exchanges currently used in China,  and the users of the company's products are all over China.  Shanghai Bell has exported complete sets of hardware and  software. It is buying land in Pudong for the construction of a  larger and technologically more advanced production base.    It is very necessary to attract more powerful consortiums  and  transnational companies to cooperate with us. It is because  they are capable of working on high-technology, new-technology,  and large-scale projects, as well as capital-, technology-, and  knowledge-intensive projects. They are more dependable in terms  of capital funds and they can play a remarkable demonstration  role. Of Shanghai's economically efficient large and medium  backbone enterprises, the top five with the highest per-worker  profit earnings are enterprises funded with transnational  investment. Cooperation with transnational companies meets our  needs in terms of substitutes for imports, industrial policy,  and industrial structure. Transnational companies invest in a  wide range of areas, including banking, trading, guesthouses,  real estate, and infrastructure. One bird can attract 100 more  birds; so, a large transnational company's investment usually  inspires other relevant companies and trades to invest in China.  Transnational companies are law-abiding, more trustworthy in  contract fulfillment, and work according to international  practices.    Our use of foreign capital is progressing from lower to  higher levels, and from the labor-intensive stage to the  technology- and knowledge-intensive stage. So far, China has  approved the establishment of over 180,000 joint ventures,  cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises.  The absolute figures show that only a small number are large  projects, but the large projects involve a large sum of  investment. In Shanghai, there are 472 enterprises each funded  with an investment of over $10 million. They account for only 6  percent of the total number of foreign-funded enterprises, but  their investment accounts for 65 percent of the total  investment. In addition, all of them are advanced-type  enterprises.    In the use of foreign capital during the initial stage of  opening up, we paid more attention to importing single items.  With the change in the situation, we need more systematic  imports because a system's force is greater than the combined  total of several single items. According to a Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Ministry International Economic Cooperation  Institute researcher, who is well-versed in transnational  companies, the characteristics of transnational companies are  systematic operation and investment by combining industry with  science and trade and by involving more than one industry and  one trade. Transnational investments have enlightened us.    Calculating "Grade Differences"    Some say we should not be content with using foreign capital  on small-scale projects, while others call for concrete analyses  to replace the "sparrow warfare" and "guerrilla warfare"  tactics. For regions that have made some headway in inducing  foreign capital, it is correct not to rest content with  small-scale foreign-funded projects. However, as regions have  developed unevenly, most transnational corporations have  invested in major coastal cities and other regions with better  infrastructure. For a greater number of regions, should they  carry out small, medium, or large foreign- funded projects?  Even major cities do not use foreign capital entirely on large  projects. Therefore, we should not neglect the use of foreign  capital on small and medium projects, which should be carried  out selectively and on the condition of mutual benefit. Foreign  capital must not be induced to our disadvantage and, much more,  to the detriment of our spiritual civilization.    As far as foreign capital use is concerned, the issue of  phased transfer and technological "grade differences" merits our  thought. Special economic zones and major cities are golden  regions, where we should concentrate on high-grade projects in  line with the investment trend and conducive to the readjustment  of production structure; primary and labor-intensive and  semifinished products manufacturing projects should be  transferred to other regions. We should do some economic  calculations of the "grade differences."    Shanghai Bell Vice President Li Dalai remarked: "We do not  want to promote small and comprehensive projects, but will  concentrate on software. Some domestic enterprises have their  machine tools lying idle. We intend to reinvigorate them by  moving them to other regions. We may even set up some research  institutes in the hinterland, with headquarters in the coastal  region and the same wages and living conditions as those of the  coastal region. The environment there [the hinterland] is peace  and quiet and good for doing research." His remarks reflect the  demand for the coastal region to move out to and bring along the  hinterland as well as for foreign-funded enterprises to raise  their rate of domestic production.    It is time for special economic zones and some major coastal  cities to transfer step-by-step labor-intensive enterprises to  other regions and to increase the value of golden regions  themselves by increasing contacts with leading and transnational  corporations having high-grade technologies and substantial  strength.    China vis-a-vis the world and vice versa shows that the  changing global economic structure has provided us with many  development opportunities. We should adopt a strategic vision  and improve the work of using foreign capital with astute and  wise thought.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETE WILSON IN SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> I guess politics makes strange bedfellows, but then again, maybe not.  </P> <P> I was really torn between the two candidates for governor because I couldn't  figure out who was worse.  </P> <P> But then when Dianne Feinstein reneged on her vow to stop campaigning if Wilson  returned to Washington and put crib notes on her hand before a debate, my  decision was made.  </P> <P> And when I saw her "chubby friend" (as Wilson called him, which was really a  low shot) with her, the old saying "birds of a feather flock together" came to  mind. After all, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) is a proven liar and cheat.  </P> <P> What we need now is a limit on congressional terms and a line veto for the  President so these little "pork barrel" items that are tossed into bills, which  are completely unrelated, could be eliminated. Maybe, just maybe.  </P> <P> LYNN SPEAR MERLES  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

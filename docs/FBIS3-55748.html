			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kiev </F> on 11 January]    [Text] The highest level meeting of NATO member states in  Brussels has adopted the Partnership for Peace program. This  document includes an appeal to former members of the Warsaw Pact  and other European countries to participate in the program. The  appeal of NATO member countries has been adopted at a difficult  time, when some parts of the continent are sowing the seeds of  conflict, and the majority of Central and East European  countries are alarmed by the lack of structural mechanisms for  security in this region.    Ukraine believes that the proposal of NATO countries to  implement the Partnership for Peace program is a timely and  broad-minded step in the right direction which will enable all  interested countries to begin practical work on concrete  political and military cooperation with NATO. Ukraine sees  great interest in the development of such cooperation, and will  cooperate with NATO and its member countries to the full extent  within the framework of the Partnership for Peace program.  Ukraine embraces with understanding the NATO initiative, which  does not draw new lines of partition in Europe, while leaving  the door to NATO open and serving as an instrument to gradually  expand the organization eastward. Ukraine thinks that NATO is  able to play a serious role in developing a reliable and  all-embracing system of European security; Ukraine is ready to  make a considerable contribution to the development of new  architecture of security. The active participation of Ukraine  in the "Partnership for Peace" program will assist in this  process.</p>

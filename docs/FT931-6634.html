			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Disruption after blast could cost New York billions NEW YORK City faces multi-billion dollar losses as a result of the bomb that rocked the World Trade Center on Friday, with the 110-storey twin towers remaining closed to their thousands of office workers for at least a week. But commodity exchanges will re-open for business today in their usual venue in one of the smaller buildings of the complex. The FBI confirmed that a bomb in an underground car park 'definitely' caused the blast, but it was not known who planted it. Five people were killed and more than 1,000 injured as the ceiling collapsed on to an underground train station and as smoke billowed through the twin towers, the second highest buildings in the world. Mr Mario Cuomo, the New York state governor, said: 'The guess around the world must be that this is terrorist-related,' adding: 'You have to prepare for the worst.' New York FBI chief James Fox said: 'It certainly could be anyone. A lot of people have been laid off recently. It could be drug dealers upset with the US government, could be terrorists, could be any one of those.' The towers suffered no structural damage, but would be closed for 'in excess of a week' for repairs, according to Mr Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority, which operates the complex. Some disruption is likely for all financial firms based in the complex. Some of those unable to return to the twin towers today have sought temporary premises or may route business through their offices in other cities. Mr Brezenoff said the nine-story building that houses the commodity exchanges, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, would re-open today. 'The exchanges asked for 3-4 hours a day, and they will get that and possibly more,' he said. There had earlier been concern that world oil trading might be affected by any disruption to futures trading on Nymex. Insurance analysts said the closure of the towers would be regarded by the insurance industry as a 'catastrophic event'. Some estimates suggest that the economic impact on the city, from lost business, could run to more than Dollars 1bn a day. Mr Raymond Kelly, New York City's Police Commissioner, said about 40 calls had been logged claiming responsibility for the explosion, but declined to discuss details.</p>

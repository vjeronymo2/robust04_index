			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> GOING PLACES;  </P> <P> THE WARBIRDS ARE COMING!  </P> <P> ONLY SIX OF THE 24 remaining P-38 Lightning pursuit planes -- 10,000 were built  for World War II -- are still flying. One of these P-38s can be viewed, as can  60 other vintage aircraft and historic aeronautical items, at the Museum of  Flying, adjacent to the Santa Monica Airport, through Friday.  </P> <P> There's a Supermarine Spitfire Mark IX and a North American P-51 Mustang, as  well as scale models of missiles, a mock-up of the Mercury space capsule and  antique air-show posters. This superb warbird and vintage-aircraft collection  has been put on display because next Saturday and Sunday the entire lot will be  auctioned off in the largest such sale of pre-1948 aircraft ever held. Entry to  this world-class event is $250; if that sounds steep, you may not want to pay  the expected $1.5 million for the P-38.  </P> <P> Museum of Flying, 2772 Donald Douglas Loop North, Santa Monica; (213) 392-6392.  </P> <P> MARGERY L. SCHWARTZ  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Two service bulletins that describe inspections of the wings. (These two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service bulletins were made mandatory by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The Task Group has also recommended, for mandatory modification, the actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 53&hyph;230, Revision 1, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 12, 1993. The FAA has reviewed and approved this service bulletin, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes procedures for installation of doublers and clips at the intersections of upper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longerons/intercostals and fuselage frames between longerons 10L and 10R at various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overwing stations between Y=484.000 and Y=851.000, as applicable, depending upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> series of the airplane. Accomplishment of these modifications would terminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections required by AD 88&hyph;24&hyph;08 R2, amendment 39&hyph;6469 (55 FR 1002, January 11,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990), which requires external eddy current inspection to detect cracking of the fuselage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skin and certain longerons, internal visual inspections of certain longerons, and repair of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any findings of cracking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require additional structural modifications and inspections. The actions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be accomplished in accordance with the document described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> There are approximately 892 Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the affected design in the worldwide fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA estimates that 568 Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03. The requirements of that AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were estimated to take approximately 946 work hours to accomplish, at a current average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost for required modification kits was estimated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be $15,140 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated that the total cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes would be $38,152,560, or $67,170 per airplane, over the initial 4-year time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarization, or tool acquisition.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA estimates that a total of 511 Model DC&hyph;9 and C&hyph;9 (military) series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by the new requirements specified in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD. The new additional requirements proposed by this AD action would take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 638 additional work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost an additional $37,027 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these figures, the total additional cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators is estimated to be $36,851,787, or $72,117 per airplane, over a 4-year time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarization, and tool acquisition.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> There are approximately 1,090 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA estimates that 173 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes of U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03. The requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that AD were estimated to take approximately 47 work hours to accomplish, at a current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost for required modification kits was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be $752 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total cost impact of AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 on U.S. operators of Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes would be $577,301, or $3,337 per airplane, over the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarization, or tool acquisition.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA estimates that a total of 615 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MD&hyph;88 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by the new requirements specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposed AD. This increase in the number of affected airplanes is due to various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons, including transfer of ownership and the fact that additional airplanes have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulated time-in-service since the issuance of AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 and have reached the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold for modification/inspection. The new additional requirements proposed by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD action would take approximately 13 additional work hours per airplane to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional $943 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total additional cost impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,019,670, or $1,658 per airplane,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over a 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set-up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished the currently required or the newly proposed requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this AD action; however, it can reasonably be assumed that a majority of affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators have already initiated the inspections and structural modifications required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03 [retained in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this AD] and many may have already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiated the additional inspections and structural modifications proposed in this new AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. However, in actual practice, these actions for the most part would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

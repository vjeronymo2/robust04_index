			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alana Gandra in Rio de Janeiro] </F>   [Text] The Brazilian Congress has approved the government's  request for authorization to send peacekeeping troops to  Mozambique. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim discussed the issue  with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and only budget,  technical, and military logistical matters have yet to be  resolved with the United Nations. Amorim said:    [Begin recording] In any case, the UN secretary general  again  conveyed to me that he is interested. We are now discussing  budget, technical, and even military logistical matters with the  United Nations, i.e. whether we will be sending a battalion or a  company. A battalion consists of 700 men, while a company  consists of more than 200 men. We will probably be sending a  battalion to Mozambique. [end recording]    The cost of sending an Army battalion stands at  approximately  $40 million, which will be reimbursed by the United Nations.</p>

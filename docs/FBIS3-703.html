			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Congolese National Army, which claims to be the  military wing of the radical opposition, has threatened to  launch an armed struggle to, as it says, reinstitute the rule of  law and democratization in Zaire -- in fact, the former Zaire,  which it plans to call the Democratic Republic of Congo. These  plans were contained in a communique signed by General (Molanda  Jean), who says that the Zairian opposition has armed men who  are ready to militarily defend the institutional order of the  Sovereign National Conference.    It will be recalled that recently Jacques Matanda, an  Executive Committee member of the Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition, announced his party's intention to lead an armed  struggle in Zaire to overthrow President Mobutu. He said at the  time that he had fighters based in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and  Angola.</p>

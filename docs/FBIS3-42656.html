			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lidiya Timofeyeva under the rubric "Political </F> Portrait in a Setting": "A `Rebellious' Governor in a Rebellious  Country"]    [Text] Eduard Rossel is a prominent figure. He is the  former governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast who sought to create the  Urals Republic, leader of the nonpolitical movement Revival of  the Urals, and a member of the Federation Council.  <H5>  Sverdlovsk Would Not Be Swayed by Tears, Either </H5>   This man could say: "I made myself." He was born in the  infamous year 1937, having already lost his father. His father  was wasted one month before the son's arrival on the absurd and  terrifying charge of "not being one of us." He was not "one of  us" because he was a joiner, a cabinet-maker, headed a  variety-show band, and "wore a Polish suit," and finally, just  because he was a "Volga German." At age four the boy ended up an  orphan, but with a living mother who was exiled to the north  without correspondence privileges. He was a vagrant from 1942 to  1947. The war, the one woe shared by the entire people and the  entire country, "helped" him to not become a thief or die. His  mother found him in Verkhnekamsk through the all-Union search  service.    Having been hopelessly late for everything good early in  life, he made up for this with a persistence and ambition that  turned out to be characteristic. At the age of 21 he graduated  high school. He tossed the handbook "Where To Go To Study" at  random, and it opened to the letter "S." He was not expected  anywhere, but Sverdlovsk had so many institutes! He opted for  the mining institute.    The gifted student began to write his candidate dissertation  even before defending his diploma. However, his scientific  career was not to be for the most mundane reason, although he  was retained as a junior research associate: There was no money  to support his wife and daughter. To be sure, he would yet  defend the dissertation and become a candidate of technical  sciences. At that time, he went to Nizhniy Tagil where he began  his climb, not skipping a single step: from foreman to chief of  the Sreduralstroy territorial construction association. He built  dozens of unique enterprises within strikingly short periods of  just one year. When one of these enterprises was being  commissioned, Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the oblast at the  time, deeply touched, took off a golden alarm wristwatch which  had, in turn, been given to Yeltsin as a birthday gift  by...Leonid Ilich himself, and gave it Rossel.    They also began to value Rossel in the Urals as a good  regional-level leader when he was elected oblast executive  committee chairman in 1990 and soon also chairman of the oblast  soviet. This combination of positions was authorized for  Sverdlovsk Oblast on an experimental basis. In 1991 Rossel was  appointed head of the administration by a presidential edict. He  got a difficult place to manage. When Rossel assumed this  position, grain stocks in the oblast were sufficient for only 10  days. Later, there was enough for one day. Desperate appeals to  officials in Moscow accomplished nothing. One night he got on a  plane and flew to Almaty, to Nazarbayev. Kazakhstan agreed to  provide grain in exchange for metal, timber, and pipes. However,  Rossel had to break all the contracts.... A new misfortune soon  occurred--the banks stopped paying out cash. Gaydar helped  Rossel as best he could. However, the catastrophe struck the  entire country, and other ways out had to be sought. They made  an arrangement with Perm, which had ready cash but no butter or  mayonnaise....    Even then the shrewd Rossel understood that he could not  expect favors from on high. On one hand, the resources of the  country were dwindling; on the other hand, the burden of power  oppressed the center, and it began to delegate power down a drop  at a time. In the process the center wasted no opportunity to  show the "provincials" who was in charge in the house by signing  or failing to sign "authorization" papers. However, the much  desired decrees concerning the oblast, which had been arranged  with a lot of difficulty, had ceased to carry any weight. There  was no force that could make these papers with the state emblem  "work."  <H5>  `We Are Pragmatists, Not Separatists' </H5>   Rossel says: "Self-dependence is a trait of my character. I  was assigned a certain volume of work, and from that moment on  the supervisor ceased to exist for me. I was responsible for the  work from beginning to end, and I always did it, no matter what  this cost me."    You cannot call him a romantic. He is intelligent, prudent,  and pragmatic. He is a man with a lot of willpower. His are the  strong shoulders of a skier, all-rounder, volleyball player....  He likes combinations including many moves, such as in chess and  Russian checkers, in which he has respectable ratings.  Generally, he is a fighter. Having pondered his position and the  situation in the country, he resolved to take the next step.    In 1991 his team developed a statute of real power in the  oblast to supplement the Federation Treaty and submitted it to  the Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet rejected the statute.  Rossel then secured a meeting with the president and showed him  a draft edict on an economic experiment. He tried to persuade  Boris Yeltsin that if the experiment worked out, it would be  possible to expand it to include other regions without a loss.  The president approved the idea and called Viktor Chernomyrdin  right away. He was supportive, too. The old pattern of making  the rounds of offices and collecting endorsements for the edict  began. As a result, there were 18 rejections instead of the 18  necessary endorsements. What was to be done? Rossel gathered a  narrow circle of like-minded people and argued that the final  step remained: to create a republic. After all, under the  Constitution in effect at the time, one had to have status in  order to obtain rights, and in order to get status, one needed  to be called a republic because oblasts had virtually no rights.  "We had one chance in 100. I understood that my venture could  end in my being relieved. However, we acted solely within the  law."    According to the old Constitution, they first polled the  population and held a session of the oblast soviet.  Subsequently, they proclaimed the republic in July 1993 and  adopted a declaration. A draft Constitution was developed, which  they used as the basis and published in the press. The people  responded. Rossel received more than 1,000 remarks which were  considered by a special constitutional commission. Finally, the  Constitution of the Urals Republic was ultimately adopted, and  at the same time a law on elections was approved at a session of  the oblast soviet according to which an election of the  legislative assembly and governor of the Urals Republic was to  be held on 12 December.    At this point, Moscow choked with wrath. First, a fax was  received on 9 November on the oblast soviet being dispersed; an  envoy urgently flew to Yekaterinburg to keep an eye on the  actions of "separatists." At equal time intervals, the official  who arrived reported to the center what was happening, and said  that Rossel did not intend to disband the oblast soviet but, on  the contrary, had signed a decree on protection for deputies  left without a job following the presidential edict. The  following day, a second fax message came on Rossel being  relieved for "exceeding state authority."    It is an irony of fate that the Sverdlovsk candidate for  deputy of Russia Boris Yeltsin wrote in his election program in  1990: "Following a referendum, self-governing socioeconomic  territories and regions may be formed within the RSFSR. Their  rights will be set forth in the new Constitution of the RSFSR."  In turn, Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the Goskomnats  [abbreviation as published; State Committee on Federation and  Nationality Affairs], who as recently July had stated that it  was necessary to relieve Rossel from his position, on  familiarizing himself with Rossel's proposals became an active  proponent of the idea of economic federalism, making it the  banner of his party and the campaign for elections to the State  Duma.    This begs the question: Whom did the officials from Moscow  hurt more? Indeed, Eduard Ergartovich was relieved from the  position of governor. However, at a meeting of the council of  the Association for Economic Cooperation Between Oblasts and  Republics of the Urals Region immediately following Moscow's  decision, he was elected president of this association. This  indicates the opinion of the leaders of five oblasts and two  republics of Russia. Could the officials have hurt themselves  the most? After all, having closed down this experiment, they  will soon be unable to distribute anything themselves; after  all, production is continuing to fall. However, most importantly  they have hurt the residents of the Urals who did not intend to  sail away from Russia in their boat but, on the contrary,  intended to live together with everyone, but producing goods  intelligently and strengthening relations that multiply our  common wealth.  <H6>  *** </H6>   Appeals and letters seeking that the edict concerning Rossel  be canceled are still being sent to the president. I for one  recalled one episode from his life. He writes "German" in the  box "nationality" in questionnaires. This was what his parents  wrote, as well as his forefathers, who ended up in Russia under  Catherine II. In terms of his way of life, upbringing, and  religion, he is Orthodox, baptized, and Russian. Recently  Jacques Attali, former president of the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development, tried to open his eyes to the  mystery of his stock, telling him that Germans do not have such  a last name, but that this was the last name of the 27-year-old  Rossel, a military figure of the Paris Commune, who was shot  after the revolution was defeated. The Rossel dynasty hastily  left Paris, going to Germany.    It is hard to say whether this is a legend or the truth.  Something else is striking: Each nation is prepared to consider  a talented man its own--Pushkin with his African blood, and  Lermontov with his admixture of Scottish clans. So, the French  want to "appropriate" our Rossel, too. It is ridiculous.... We  need him ourselves.</p>

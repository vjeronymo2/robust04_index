			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Outlook for jobs worsens: Biggest monthly fall on record in manufacturing; Unemployment rate higher than EC average; Currency turmoil hits optimism THE RISE last month of 32,200 in the jobless total overshadowed other gloomy developments in the labour market. Yesterday's detailed figures from the Department of Employment included a string of other statistics which, taken together, suggest that the outlook is worsening. In the manufacturing sector alone, the number in work fell by 51,000, the biggest monthly fall on record. Employment in that sector has now fallen by 238,000 since August last year compared with a drop of 378,000 in 1990. The peak in manufacturing employment was in June 1971 when it was 8.6m. The latest fall has reduced the total to 4.42m. The male unemployment rate rose sharply last month. While the overall rate rose to 10.1 per cent - the first time the rate has exceeded 10 per cent since June 1987 - the rate of male unemployment reached 13.4 per cent, the highest since May 1986. Female unemployment rose to 668,100 from 661,700, a rate of 5.5 per cent. According to the latest international comparisons of unemployment compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the unemployment rate in the UK in August was 10 per cent. This is higher than the EC average of 9.5 per cent. Vacancies at Jobcentres, which account for about a third of all vacancies, fell 11,900 last month to 95,000, the lowest figure since 1981. Falls in the level tend to precede rises in unemployment, so the 11 per cent drop in just one month suggest further big rises in unemployment are likely. Equally worrying is an indication that the trend growth rate in unemployment is accelerating. In the six months to September, the average rise in the seasonally adjusted total of people out of work and claiming benefit rose by 31,800, compared with an average rise of 27,700 in the six months to August. The only bright spot was on pay, with figures showing that the underlying increase in average earnings in the year to August was 5.75 per cent compared with 6 per cent in the year to July, the lowest rate of increase for 25 years. The number of people unemployed and claiming benefit rose last month in every region except Ulster. The biggest increases were in the south-east and East Anglia.</p>

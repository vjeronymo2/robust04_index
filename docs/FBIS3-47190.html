			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago] </F>   [Text] Washington, 24 Dec -- There has been increasing  criticism of Japanese bureaucrats from senior U.S. Government  officials. While this is seen to be due to impatience with the  deadlock in Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, it is also  believed that statements by Japanese bureaucrats portraying the  recent change in the U.S. position as "a concession to Japan"  have enraged the U.S. officials. Such a war of words "does more  harm than good" to the framework talks. Industry leaders in  both countries are annoyed that "bureaucratic friction has  surpassed actual Japan-U.S. economic friction in intensity; this  is aggravating the problem."    Recently, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor and  Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president (concurrently  vice chairman of the National Economic Council), criticized  Japanese bureaucrats in public, mainly for: 1) distorting U.S.  proposals in the framework talks when presenting them to  Japanese Government leaders and the Japanese people, and  creating a "mistaken impression"; and 2) stopping the Japanese  political and industrial sectors from taking steps to open  markets, ease regulations, and reduce income tax.    Senior U.S. officials are particularly annoyed that the  Japanese counterargument which claims "the United States is  obsessed with market share targets, and is forcing managed trade  on Japan" has received international support, and has even given  rise to criticism of the government in the United States. In  any case, the Japanese argument is not entirely a distortion of  facts.    In the beginning, the Clinton administration had indeed made  repeated statements which showed a preoccupation with market  share targets. It is only in the past month, when reaching an  agreement in the framework talks before the Japan-U.S. summit  meeting in February has become the priority task, that remarks  to the effect that "we are not obsessed about market share  targets" became prominent.    The truth is, the U.S. Government is extremely anxious that  this recent shift of position may be taken as "a concession to  Japan," and subjected to criticism in Congress. That is the  reason why U.S. officials have criticized Japanese bureaucrats  in public despite the possible adverse effects on the framework  talks.</p>

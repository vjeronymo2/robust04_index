			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Saudi refinery contracts run up against delays The incomplete takeover of Petromin, the Saudia Arabian government's former domestic crude refining and marketing agency, is adding to difficulties over the supply and pricing of reduced crude and heavy fuel oil feedstock from Saudi Aramco's Yanbu refinery. It is also aggravating delays behind the formal award to Chiyoda Petrostar of a Dollars 248m (Pounds 162m) turnkey contract to build the kingdom's second - and much-needed - Lube refinery. Chiyoda Petrostar is the Saudi affiliate of Japan's Chiyoda Corporation. Industry sources say that Saudi Aramco has still not completed details of its takeover of all Petromin's refining operations. Petromin, which was absorbed into the Saudi Arabian Marketing and Refining Company (Samarec), was itself taken over by Saudi Aramco in 1993. 'These problems are aggravating the already sensitive talks on the price of feedstock and of return streams, the elements of unused base oil which would be returned by Luberef to Saudi Aramco,' industry sources said. The client, Petromin Lubricating Oil Refinery Company (Luberef), a 70/30 joint venture between Petromin and Mobil Corporation, had been expected to award the contract last April. Luberef already owns and operates one refinery producing 1.8m barrels a year of base oil, which blenders, including Petrolube, another Saudi-Mobil joint venture, break down to produce engine oils, anti-freeze, and transmission and hydraulic fluids. Domestic consumption of lubricants is now some 2.2m barrels a year, and the kingdom, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, is now having to import base oils. Domestic demand is rising at a rate of between 3 and 4 per cent a year. The new 2m barrel-a-year Lube refinery would cover growing domestic consumption as well as enable Saudi Arabia to export base oils for the next 15 years. Luberef's general manager, Mr Wolf Ziedler, said that there were still arrangements to be finalised before the project could go ahead, including pricing and supply of feedstock, dealings with contractors and with government authorities. The value of Degassed gas feedstock is calculated according to formulas of market prices for crude plus processed oil by barrel and by tonne. Residual problems from some Petromin operations add to the pricing difficulties. Without future cashflow gurantees and a pricing formula showing evidence of these satisfactory to the client, commercial banks would be reluctant to finance the plant's construction. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and/or the Saudi Industrial Development Fund could provide a portion of the funding. Equity finance from the joint venture partners, plus commercial bank loans, would make up the balance.</p>

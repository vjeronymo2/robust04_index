			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Deutsche to tighten ties with Morgan Grenfell Deutsche Bank is to attempt to strengthen co-operation with its merchant banking subsidiary Morgan Grenfell in a move that could lead to the integration of their investment banking operations in several years' time. Deutsche is likely to announce later this month changes in its relationship with Morgan, which it acquired five years ago. It will also try to combine and bolster its European equity broking activities. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche's managing board, said yesterday that attempts to build up its equity operations would not require a formal change in its agreement with Morgan. He said there would be 'no dramatic changes to what we are doing in London', and that Deutsche was 'particularly happy' with its arrangements with Morgan. 'No fantastic announcements will be made', he said. However, a working group of four members of Deutsche's managing board, including Mr John Craven, Morgan's chairman, believes that the merchant banks should work more closely with Deutsche. The review of investment banking carried out by the group is likely to lead to a statement that Deutsche is strengthening its equity distribution in London and wants closer links with Morgan's advisory activities. Deutsche's board is likely to say that Morgan's merchant banking and advisory operations could eventually be brought together with its own under a single management, but this could take about five years. Five of Morgan's eight activities - asset management, Channel Islands Trust operations, emerging markets debt and equity trading, development capital and treasury, will be unaffected by the initial changes. Its equity distribution and project finance activities in Asia are likely to be more closely integrated with Deutsche's activity in the region, although stopping short of a full merger. Corporate advisory and equity underwriting in Europe, as well as project and export finance advice will be linked more closely with Deutsche. Senior directors want to deliver an integrated range of services and products to large companies ranging from corporate finance to lending and foreign exchange and derivatives.</p>

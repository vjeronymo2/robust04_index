Zhu, who is in Japan on a  nine-day visit, disclosed the plan at his meeting with heads of  firms with business relations with Sanwa Bank, officials of the  Osaka-based bank said.    Zhu, who is also head of the People's Bank of Japan, the  central bank, added, however, that prices of farm products will  be raised to encourage farmers. "All steps are in line with  price reforms to create market-driven economy, which will be  completed by the end of this year," he said.    He admitted that leaving prices to market forces would lead  to double-digit inflation this year, but said inflation will  slow to single figures next year.    Zhu is to leave Japan on Thursday.</p>

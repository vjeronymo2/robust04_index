			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: GPA plans further asset-backed issues GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is planning two more asset-backed securitisation issues within the next few months. Mr Maurice Foley, GPA chief executive, speaking yesterday at the Financial Times conference on World Aerospace and Air Transport, said the company intended to launch a second Aircraft Lease Portfolio Securitisation (Alps) fund 'early in the autumn'. The fund would have a value of about Dollars 750m. A third fund would follow by March 1993. These two issues follow the ground-breaking Dollars 500m Alps issue by the Irish company in June this year. Citibank is the sole lead bank for the next Alps, having been joint lead bank with Lehman Brothers with the first. The next issue would be structured 'very much like the first Alps,' said Citibank. Alps 1 was made up of five tranches: two public offerings consisting of Dollars 208.4m fixed-rate bonds and Dollars 104.2m floating-rate notes, a Dollars 70.4m private placement and two tranches of subordinated debt. Mr Foley said that such instruments would help solve a capital shortage in the airline industry. They 'offer airlines the opportunity to uncouple from dependence on bank debt . . . and widen the investor base to those who might not otherwise invest in airlines'.</p>

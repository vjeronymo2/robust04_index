Generally, equity options may be traded until the close of business on the last business day before expiration, which is generally the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For customers, an exercise instruction is a notice delivered to a member organization to exercise an option. For a clearing member, options specialist, or competitive options trader (as defined in NYSE rules), an exercise instruction is a notice to The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised pursuant to the OCC's exercise-by-exercise procedure (``OCC Rule 805''), or not to exercise an option that otherwise would automatically be exercised pursuant to OCC Rule 805. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 14. The OCC has separate rules regarding the cut-off time by which exercise notices must be delivered to the OCC by the clearing members. The proposed rule change does not in any way affect the rules of the OCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In most cases, exercise instructions are transmitted to Exchange clearing members electronically through the Clearing Management and Control System (``C/MACS''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 780 also does not apply to expiring index options. See NYSE Rule 780, Supplementary Material .10(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Presently, it is a violation of Rule 780 for clearing members to accept instructions after the Exercise Cut-Off Time except in reliance on one of the above exceptions. Because exercise instructions are submitted to the clearing members and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly through the Exchange, it is difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 780. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the Exercise Cut-Off Time serves an important investor protection function. Specifically, the Exercise Cut-Off Time protects holders of short positions in equity options from unanticipated events occurring after the close of the market. As the Commission has previously stated, if expiring equity options were allowed to be exercised after the Exercise Cut-Off Time for reasons other than the exceptions set forth above, the Commission believes that options writers could be unfairly disadvantaged with respect to options holders by not having the same opportunity to react to such unanticipated events. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19589 (March 10, 1983), 48 FR 11196 (March 16, 1983). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to enhance the ability of the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 780 for expiring equity option, the proposed rule change would alter the existing exercise instruction procedures by requiring that final exercise decisions also be submitted to the Exchange. The clearing members would still be responsible for delivering exercise notices to the OCC, <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  however, the proposed rule change would allow the Exchange to accurately document when each exercise instruction was received by a member organization or clearing member, or delivered by a clearing member to the OCC. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  The Exercise Cut-Off Time will still be 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date. Pursuant to the proposal, however, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) take no action and allow exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805; <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  or (2) the member organization may submit a contrary exercise advice ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advices would be submitted by a member organization either: (1) at a place designated for that purpose by any national options exchange of which the member organization is a member and where the option is listed; or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  In those instances where OCC Rule 80-5 has been waived by the OCC, <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  the proposal requires that a Contrary Exercise Advice be submitted prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time by member organizations wishing to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised in the absence of such a waiver, or not to exercise an option that would be automatically exercised in the absence of such a waiver. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  The applicable price of the underlying security in such instances shall be the last sale price in the primary market for the underlying security, except as OCC Rule 805(l) otherwise provides. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exercise instructions will still be submitted to clearing members, however, the requirements for this process will be determined by each clearing member, in accordance with the OCC's rules. This process will no longer be governed by the NYSE's rules. Pursuant to the OCC's rules, equity options expire at 12:00 a.m. on the third Saturday of the expiration month. As explained earlier, the OCC has its own rules as to the latest time by which clearing members must submit exercise notices to the OCC. These rules are separate from the Exchange's Exercise Cut-Off Time and are not affected by the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change also makes it clear that reporting of final exercise decisions as contemplated by the revised rules does not serve to substitute as the effective exercise notice to OCC for the exercise or non-exercise of expiring options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> OCC Rule 805 provides for automatic exercise of in-the-money options at expiration without the submissions of an exercise notice to the OCC if the price of the security underlying the option is at or above a certain price (for calls) or at or below a certain price (for puts); and the non-exercise of an option at expiration if the price of the security underlying the option does not satisfy such price levels. See OCC Rule 805. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Even though this may be accomplished by submitting exercise decisions directly to the Exchange, the more likely manner of accomplishing this will be to submit the exercise decisions to the Exchange through C/MACS. Due to the burden that would be placed on members of having to manually process every exercise decision for delivery directly to the Exchange, the procedures and rules being approved herein will not be implemented by the NYSE until the OCC submits a written representation to the Commission that C/MACS has been modified as necessary, fully tested, and ready to go on-line, to allow members to submit exercise decisions to the Exchange through C/MACS. This process is expected to be completed in time for the November 1994 expirations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This could happen where an underlying security is not traded on its primary market on the trading day immediately preceding an expiration date and, as a result, the OCC determines not to fix a closing price for that security.

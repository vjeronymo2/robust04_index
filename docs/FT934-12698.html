			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Poland's coalition selects cabinet POLAND'S coalition partners last night agreed on a cabinet only hours before its formal presentation today to President Lech Walesa. Five hours of tense negotiations between the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) saw Mr Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister and PSL leader, drop his nominee for privatisation minister in favour of Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, a banker from the SLD free market wing. Earlier in the day Mr Pawlak had unveiled a list without consulting the SLD and giving his party control of more economic ministries than his coalition partners had previously agreed to accept. The new ministers are expected to be sworn in by Mr Walesa today. However, the coalition will have to win a vote of confidence within two weeks in parliament where they control two-thirds of the seats following last month's election. Mr Marek Borowski, a former internal trade minister from the SLD, will be finance minister and deputy premier responsible for the economy; Mr Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, also an SLD supporter, is to be justice minister and deputy premier responsible for social policy; Mr Alexander Luczak from the PSL will be education minister and deputy premier responsible for defence, internal and foreign affairs; Mr Andrzej Milczanowski remains interior minister; Mr Andrzej Olechowski becomes foreign minister; and Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk gets defence.</p>

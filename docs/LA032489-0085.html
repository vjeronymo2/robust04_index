			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CURVE HANGS -- PIRATES SLIP PAST BANNING, 9-8  </P> <P> It was an opportunity Joe Miller couldn't pass. Besides, he was overdue and  sorely in need of self-redemption.  </P> <P> Sensing victory, the San Pedro right fielder drilled a one-out double to right  that scored Brian Schiazzano and lifted the host Pirates to a 9-8 Pacific  League victory over Banning on Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> Banning right-hander Mike Busby's first two fastballs had Miller behind 0-2 in  the count, but he hung a high curve on the next pitch and Miller poked it into  right center and Schiazzano galloped home with the winning run.  </P> <P> "I just had to come through," said Miller, who was 0 for 7 in two games against  Banning to that point and helped Banning score two runs in the sixth when he  slipped and let Jimmy Gonzalez's hit roll to the fence for a triple.  </P> <P> "I had a strong feeling he'd be throwing me a curve and I choked up on the bat  and put my mind on hitting the ball."  </P> <P> San Pedro improved to 3-1 in league play and 5-4 overall, while Banning fell to  3-1 and 6-3.  </P> <P> The Pirates jumped to a 3-0 first-inning lead and led 4-1 after three innings  before Banning started chipping away. The Pilots scored two runs in each of the  fourth, fifth and sixth innings, and their solo run in the top of the seventh  gave them a short-lived advantage.  </P> <P> Shortstop Jesse Espinoza drove in Eric Fierro with a fielder's choice in the  third, and Busby's two-run homer to left pulled Banning's to 4-3 in the fourth  inning.  </P> <P> The Pilots claimed the lead the next inning when San Pedro pitcher Gerard  Castenada threw wildly to third base on Gonzalez's bunt, allowing Julian Pardo  to score. One out later Ralph Nuno singled home Espinoza.  </P> <P> Two runs in the sixth allowed Banning to take a 7-4 lead. The Pilots had two  men on when Gonzalez hit a soft fly down the right-field line. Miller ran it  down but slipped before he reached the ball and it bounded away as Espinoza and  Raul Diaz crossed the plate easily.  </P> <P> San Pedro climbed back with a four-run sixth that began with singles by  Schiazzano and Matt Rasband.  </P> <P> Gonzalez replaced Busby after Schiazzano's hit but was ineffective. After  Rasband's single, he induced Miller to fly to deep right but walked the next  three batters, one intentionally, as San Pedro tied the game, 7-7. Busby came  in again, this time in relief, but the first man he faced, Glenn Merrick, drove  home Castenada with a sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Banning wasted no time tying the game in the top of the seventh. Busby's double  to the base of the left field wall scored Chico Limas, who had opened the frame  with a sharp single. Fierro then walked. Eric Boysen relieved Castenada and  recorded the final two outs of the inning to leave the game tied, 8-8, going  into the seventh.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week Banning beat San Pedro, 5-4, but this time the Pirates had  the home field advantage.  </P> <P> "When we came in here I felt I'd be happy with a split," said Banning Coach Syl  Saavedra, who watched his team commit seven errors in the contest. "And when we  were down three runs, I still thought a split would be OK.  </P> <P> "But we came back and took the lead and then go ahead and lose. No, I'm not  happy with the split anymore. There's just something about playing at San  Pedro. Something strange always seems to happen."  </P> <P> Boysen (1-0) earned the win, while Busby was saddled with the loss to fall to  2-2.  </P> <P> Banning outhit San Pedro, 12-8, as Fierro, Diaz, Espinoza and Busby knocked out  two hits apiece.  </P> <P> San Pedro catcher Dale Johnson was three for four, and shortstop Ken Stapleton  collected two hits.  </P></p>

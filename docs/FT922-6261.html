			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: A child of the streets turns upwardly mobile THE contracting-out culture is spreading far beyond services such as refuse collection and street cleaning. Competitive tendering will extend across the public services over the next few years into housing, care of the elderly, health and education. It will also reach the Civil Service. Services will be provided increasingly by independent organisations under contract to councils, government departments, health authorities and other public bodies. There will be opportunities for the private and voluntary sectors to take over provision of services previously performed by public monopolies. Compulsory competitive tendering in local government is already due to be extended beyond direct services to the public such as cleaning, catering and vehicle maintenance. Core town-hall functions such as architecture, planning and the collection of local taxes are being considered for contracting out under legislation passed in the last parliament. Contracting out such white-collar services presents an extra challenge because defining and enforcing the quality of service is more complicated than with emptying dustbins or mowing grass. Officials at the environment department are considering more than 500 responses to a consultative paper. The extension of contracting out may have to wait until councils have introduced internal trading accounts which will make the costs of different functions more transparent. Bidding is likely to involve the sort of two-stage process developed for auctioning ITV contracts in which bidders must first prove that they can reach a quality threshold before their bids are considered. The government is also keen for councils to contract out management of their housing stock to housing associations and other private-sector organisations. The introduction of community-care reforms next year will make councils responsible for purchasing care for the elderly and handicapped from a wide range of providers. Those will include the voluntary and private sectors as well as the councils' social services departments. Critics of compulsory competitive tendering claim that it has had only a limited impact because most contracts are won by council workforces. This is certainly the case, as figures from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy show. But even when the work stays in-house, the process of tendering shakes up the service. The council workforce must defeat the opposition with a bid which makes a 5 per cent rate of return on capital. This in effect turns it into a semi-independent organisation in which managers must introduce new working practices to reduce costs and improve the quality of service. A similar revolution in contracting out is under way in the National Health Service and central government. The government's reforms are turning health authorities into commissioning bodies which buy in health care from NHS hospitals, trust hospitals and even the private sector. Even in Whitehall, radical moves are under way to contract out much of the work of delivering central-government services. A white paper published in November suggested that putting Civil Service functions out to tender could save as much as 25 per cent of the cost of Pounds 20bn a year. Some government support services such as security, photocopying and cleaning have already been contracted out. But the Treasury is now considering departmental plans for contracting out a much wider range of clerical, administrative and professional functions. For example, more than one in four of the 65,000 jobs in the Inland Revenue are to be opened to 'market testing' this summer. The role of government at national and central level will change as contracting out spreads. Rather than being involved in the day-to-day management of public services, it will assume a regulatory role, guarding the public interest on matters such as service quality, prices (where there are charges) and competition. Altogether it amounts to the biggest shake-up in public services since the post-war Labour government created the modern welfare state. Whether it will succeed in delivering the improved services to which the government is committed remains to be seen.</p>

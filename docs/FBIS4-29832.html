			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of Fiji's opposition coalition, Jai Ram  Reddy, says the opposition will continue to keep a careful watch  on developments in the country's Parliament. Speaking upon the  opposition's return to Parliament after a two-day boycott, Mr.  Reddy said they ended their boycott in the interest of Fiji's  economy and the planned review of Fiji's racially biased  Constitution.    The leader of the opposition Labor Party, Mahendra Chowdury,  earlier said that it was more important to concentrate on  changing the Constitution, which currently guarantees ethnic  Fijians political dominance over Indo-Fijians.    The opposition boycott was fueled by a statement by Prime  Minister Sitiveni Rabuka that he could not guarantee against a  third and more violent coup than the two which brought him to  power in 1987.</p>

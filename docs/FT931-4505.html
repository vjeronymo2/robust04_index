			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cartel probe into WestLB influence stepped up THE Bundeskartellamt, Germany's federal cartel office, has stepped up its investigation into the scope of Westdeutsche Landesbank's influence over Touristik Union International (TUI), Europe's largest tourist operator. The Berlin-based cartel office has served an order on WestLB and a number of other German companies, seeking clarification of recent changes in the shareholding structure of Walter Kahn Verwaltungs, a holding company which owns 40.2 per cent of TUI. The move is part of the Bundeskartellamt's longstanding investigation into WestLB's role in the German travel sector. WestLB, state bank for North-Rhine Westphalia, owns a 34 per cent stake in LTU, Germany's largest charter-flight operator, and last year bought a majority stake in Thomas Cook, the UK-based travel company. The authorities are concerned that TUI may have come under the de facto management control of LTU/WestLB as a result of changes in the shareholding structure of Walter Kahn. WestLB al-ready exercises influence on TUI via its majority holding in the Horten retail group, which owns an indirect 25 per cent stake in TUI. If this were so, there would be competition implications for the German travel market, the Bundeskartellamt believes. Mr Jurgen Kiecker, Kartellamt spokesman, said the information order had been sent to the Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, state bank for Baden-Wurttemberg and also a shareholder in Walter Kahn, as well as WestLB and TUI. The move follows the cartel office's decision last December to reopen investigations into WestLB's purchase of its stake in Horten in 1991. This investigation was later blocked by the Berlin courts. WestLB said yesterday that it neither had control of TUI, nor sought to win it. Its stake in Walter Kahn was only 16.77 per cent, the bank said.</p>

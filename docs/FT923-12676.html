			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Small print that sounded the pension alarm - Malcolm Allbutt worked for a company that was taken over by Robert Maxwell. After the pension fund had also been absorbed, he read the annual report, and was horrified by what he learned . . . / Hindsight MALCOLM ALLBUTT had a terrible shock when he read through his company pension fund annual report last year. He worked for AGB, a market research company which had been taken over by Maxwell Communications Corporation the previous year. Its pension fund, of which he was still a member and into which he had contributed for 22 years, had now been incorporated with that of the main group. The report was more informative than some, and listed the top 20 investments made by the scheme. They were principally in equities. Pension funds make savings for 'widows and orphans'. Although they often invest in speculative ventures at the edges of their portfolio, the ballast is usually in large and secure companies, which have the kind of names people will recognise - the ICIs, BPs and Marks &amp; Spencers. Mr Allbutt was therefore horrified to discover that with the exception of a couple of printing companies - De La Rue and EMAP - and MCC itself, he had never heard of any of them. The portfolio seemed to be dominated by the detritus of Maxwell's worldwide acquisition spree - for example, the seventh biggest holding was in Official Airlines Guide 'C' Loan Stock. Other less familiar names - such as Agence Havas and Quebecor - turned out to be large media and printing groups. Ploughing through the list, it was possible to find out that Teva Pharmaceutical was an Israeli drug company, while IBI Holding was also a Maxwell-owned company. Euris and Marceau Investissements were both French investment vehicles which Robert Maxwell had backed in a bid for French banking giant Societe Generale. In short, the portfolio had no logic, beyond its use as a support for Maxwell's financial forays. While some of the printing groups within it were strong and reputable companies, it was still unusual for a cautious pension fund manager to concentrate holdings so narrowly in one sector. As Mr Allbutt later put it to a Commons select committee, he was 'more than a little horrified' to see where the money was going. He pointed the list out to a colleague, closer to retirement, whose reply was: 'Ah yes, but is there anything there?' At the time, this was still tongue in cheek. Mr Allbutt decided that the time had come to get out - he could not rely on this pension fund to pay him a pension. Unfortunately, the Maxwell pension funds were slow to move - one of Mr Allbutt's friends who had left the company still found that it took 18 months to receive a transfer value. The employees believe that many of these delays were deliberate. Last year, as Maxwell himself went over the side of the Lady Ghislaine, and his financial empire fast disintegrated in its wake, time was not on the side of pension fund members. In early December, Mr Allbutt received the details of what his pension transfer value would be. The next day, he was informed that the transfer value was inoperative, as the fund's assets had been frozen. He had acted as soon as he could, but still not in time. Subsequent events confirmed all his worst fears. In March this year, Clay &amp; Partners, the consulting actuaries appointed to wind up the four Maxwell pension schemes, announced that about Pounds 40m was missing from the AGB pension scheme. The scheme had access to about Pounds 20m in assets - when it should have had around Pounds 60m. So, for the time being, Mr Allbutt's contributions to that pension fund are lost. He has now had to make new arrangements, and has a considerably more secure personal pension with Scottish Widows. Could it happen again? Mr Allbutt admits that he, like most of his colleagues, had never found pensions at all interesting. Had he not been worried by Maxwell's behaviour, he would not even have checked when he did - reports of the pension scheme were advertised on company noticeboards as being available, but were not sent to members individually. He added: 'You get a lot of creatures like Maxwell who cajole and threaten people. He had the reputation of being an impetuous and irrational character. At the time, asking questions could well have put one's job on the line.' Hopes of compensation are now slender, as Mr Allbutt, although in his fifties, is near the back of the queue for compensation. If he is to have access to his savings, he says, compensation will not be 'terribly useful' unles the AGB fund is totally refilled. He is determined to maintain pressure to make sure this happens. For the time being, he takes the episode very philosophically. 'You hadn't better ask any of us what we think of Maxwell. He was a crook. But one has to live one's life.' And there is also the consolation that Maxwell's theft has provoked some long overdue action. A government-appointed committee is now considering a compensation scheme for company pensions, and is likely to force much greater disclosure of fund management activities. Even changes to trust law are possible. But for the time being, how can you best spot potential misuse of your pension fund? Mr Allbutt's experience provides many of the keys. Actuaries at Noble Lowndes suggest that you start by finding out about the trustees: Is there employee or trade union representation? Is there an independent professional trustee? Are the trustees all directors of the company? Then read all the information you are sent, which should soon reveal if something is amiss. Noble Lowndes suggests you look at the following: The latest audited accounts and report to members - particularly those from auditors and actuaries. Reports on investments. Are the top 10 investment holdings in companies in big reputable companies, or are they companies like Euris or Teva Pharmaceutical, of which you have never heard? Are significant amounts of funds invested in the employing company, or lent back to it? (This one requires careful scrutiny. AGB's scheme had money in Maxwell Communications, which was noticeable enough, but there was plenty more inward investment to be unearthed). Are investments concentrated in a small number of shares? In the case of AGB, the top 20 holdings in a fund running to tens of millions of pounds made up 65.6 per cent - not the kind of figure you will find in the ICI Pension Fund or the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust. If the actuarial valuation says the fund is in deficit, what plans are there to remedy it? Had this question been raised publicly in the Maxwell case, no convincing answer could have been forthcoming. Finally, if the trustees do not give you the information you want, contact the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (tel 071 233-8080), which can if necessary refer your complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman. The name of a solicitor with pensions knowledge can be obtained from the Association of Pension Lawyers (tel 071 628-9151). All of this may help you make an escape in time, if another fraud is being perpetrated. But all these measures are stop-gaps. Long-term change is needed. Mr Allbutt's views are clear: 'The secrecy which has surrounded pension funds can and must stop. We've got to lift the curtain to have more employee representation and proper regular communication to fund members.'</p>

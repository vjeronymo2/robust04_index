			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina met several  officials in Cairo early this morning, including Zimbabwean  Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira, Vietnamese Foreign Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam, and Arab League Secretary General Issmat 'Abd  al-Majid.    Upon arriving in Cairo last night, Robaina emphasized that  although times are not the same as 40 years ago, the Nonaligned  Movement [NAM] maintains its importance. Robaina pointed out  that NAM members have the right to be heard in the concert of  nations since the organization encompasses more than two-thirds  of mankind. He added that this right can be justified today more  than ever due to increasing international instability, the  emergence of a militarily and politically unilateral world, and  the concentration of economic power in the countries of the  North.    Robaina said: This is more than enough reason to attend a  meeting such as this, with the interest of not only establishing  positions but also putting things into motion. The meetings for  experts, who will discuss the topics to be covered by the  foreign ministers beginning tomorrow, began this morning.</p>

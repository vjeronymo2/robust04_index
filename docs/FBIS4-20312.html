			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Weixiang (0060 4850 7449), </F> Institute of Foreign Economics and Trade]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Present Status of Service  Industries in China    Since the initiation of reforms and a greater opening to the  outside, growth in the tertiary industry in China has been  advancing at a rather rapid pace. Many occupations servicing  production are undergoing rapid growth in the rising industry.  Occupations in traditional industries such as transportation,  telecommunications, finance and insurance which affect  production enterprises to a great extent have continued to  undergo healthy growth in recent years. The appreciated value of  these industries makes up about 65 percent of the total  appreciated value of China's tertiary industry, and their work  force makes up more than 50 percent of the labor force in the  tertiary industry as a whole, making it the dominant group in  the tertiary industry. New occupations in information,  consulting, advertising etc., are growing. Take advertising as  an example. Before reform and a greater openness, only several  score agencies nationwide had the right to advertise, but the  number has grown to more than 10,000 now. In conjunction with  expansions in the scope of economic activity, and new  discoveries in scientific technology, occupations in the  information and consulting fields have also begun to open up.  Increasingly, they are exerting an important effect on improving  the levels of management and decision making, raising product  effectiveness, and improving the efficiency and creativity of  scientific research.    However, because of problems in the economics management  system, lack of support in its policies, and other historical  factors, a proportionately low and backward status is created  for the tertiary industry in the national economy, together with  a lack of coordination for it with the first and second  industries. Not only is development backward in those basic  service industries such as transportation, telecommunications,  and public utilities which directly serve production needs in  cities and towns, the setup of other production services is also  unhealthy and incapable of meeting enterprise needs. Add to this  the lack of coordination between operations in the information,  consulting, finance, and insurance industries with social  development, the lack of progress in activities that safeguard  society, the lack of coordination between scientific and  educational activities with economic construction, and other  problems. For enterprises attempting to start a tertiary  industry in such a way, these factors create conditions that  penetrate deep into the industry's various sections. Moreover,  the enterprise is expected to shoulder many heavy  responsibilities such as worker housing, medical care, cultural  activities, recreation, family planning, education and jobs for  worker offspring, insurance, safety, welfare benefits etc. In  summary, the enterprise has total responsibility for the  workers' clothing, food, shelter, and other daily activities  from birth till death. Since the initiation of reforms and  openness, many enterprises have blindly established many welfare  type services atop the original base to increase worker benefits  and income.    Because of property rights and obstacles in the management  system, the tertiary industry started by enterprises has chiefly  been self service in a closed-loop operation, with no concern  for benefits to society. As the result, the market for  production services is shrunken, and socialized development of  production services is curtailed. Socialization of China's  production services, together with low commercialization, not  only causes irrational allocation of resources and serious  waste, but the way enterprises handle their own "tertiary  industry," and their own "welfare" to form a "large and  complete" or a "small and complete" entity causes them to  shoulder some heavy baggage. On one hand, because enterprises  are unable to obtain high quality production services, product  improvement is affected. On the other hand, because of a  structural cancer created by the enterprise taking on its own  burden of a "miniature society," with too many people sharing  the same pie, the enterprise's expenditures and management  responsibilities are increased, making it difficult to  concentrate on development and production, which in turn hinders  increased productivity.  <H5>  Direction Taken by China's Production Services </H5>   Production services make up an important component of the  tertiary industry, and their growth and progress follow overall  development of the tertiary industry. As the result,  accelerating development of the tertiary industry is a necessary  condition for enterprise survival, an objective requirement in  modern management. The focus of accelerated development of the  tertiary industry should be on those "cross-serving" occupations  that make up the whole economic service base found during  various stages of enterprise activity. Examples are those in  transportation, telecommunications, public utilities in cities  and towns, etc. The pace of growth in all these occupational  areas is the sole factor affecting development of the whole  tertiary industry. It is also the premise upon which stepped-up  development of the national economy at a steady pace is based.  Furthermore, it is also necessary to expend great effort to  develop those specialties such as finance, insurance,  consulting, information, and various technology services that  serve specific phases in the enterprise' production cycle.  Accelerated development of these production services is the key  to rational use of enterprise capital for efficient productivity.    To step up development of the tertiary industry, we must  step  up reforms in the present system, as well as the pace of change  in enterprise operation, to truly accomplish the separation of  the enterprise from politics and events, so that the enterprise  can truly be an independent operation that is self sufficient  and self directing.    In the first place, to adapt to requirements for developing  a  market economy, fields such as scientific research, information,  consultation etc., must be taken out from under their respective  departments to become new social services. They will then  provide production agencies with timely information on market  changes, and forecast changing trends in market needs to help  with scientific decisions and policies that must be made to  develop new technology and explore new products. Next, the  dependent "self-service structure" must be separated gradually  from the enterprise to which it is attached, and be placed in  the larger tertiary industry market under socialized management.  By doing so, the burden on the enterprise is lessened, structure  is simplified, and personnel and expenses are reduced, thereby  increasing productivity. Third, a protective social welfare net  must be established to reform the presently practiced health  care, labor protection, and retirement systems so that  enterprises can shed the responsibility of these benefits and  services that should rightly be provided by society. Fourth, the  pace of economic legislation must be stepped up, various rules  and regulations strengthened, and a societal system of  surveillance, auditing, and consulting services perfected, to  maintain economic order and enforce strict administration and  execution of the law to assure the healthy conduct of all  economic activity.    Accelerating the pace of tertiary industry development  provides the important assurance that the goal of continued  economic growth for China is realized. It is also the  precondition for establishing a socialist market economy and the  objective requirement for modern management in the information  age. At any rate, it is commonly recognized that accelerating  this industry's development is an enormous task that affects the  overall picture. In June 1992, the Central Committee of the CPC  (Communist Party of China) and the State Council issued a  resolution on accelerating the pace of development in the  tertiary industry. In his report at the 14th Plenum of the CPC,  General Secretary Jiang Zemin had emphasized that an important  indicator in a modernized economy is how a tertiary industry is  flourishing, and for this reason, we must exert great effort to  stimulate its rise. The essence of this conclusion also  illuminates the objective trend in man's development of a social  economy and changes in social structure, and clarifies the role  and effect of the tertiary industry in the modern economy.  Because the Central Committee and the government both strongly  emphasize development of the tertiary industry, many specific  policies and measures have appeared, for development of the  tertiary industry in China to be regarded in a new light. As the  focus for accelerating the pace for tertiary industry  development, the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPC  and the State Council on Accelerating the Pace of Tertiary  Industry Development" mentions occupations in four areas. They  are:    1. Occupations and services requiring low capitalization, of  high efficiency, quick returns, and high volume that are closely  related to economic development and the people's livelihood.    2. New occupations closely related to scientific and  technological progress.    3. Occupations and services that improve peasant character  and raise their standard of living, as the tertiary industry at  the rural level is presently comprised chiefly of occupations  providing services before, during and after agricultural  production.    4. Comprehensive and innovative basic services and  occupations that contribute to development of the national  economy.    Innovative services are formed from many different kinds of  specialized services. As the result, some people refer to them  as "mixed-type services," whose development accompanies the  rapid growth of many types of services just described. To adapt  to the needs of economic development, the direction and goal  taken by China's production services must 1) adapt to the  multiple facets of demand; 2) be of high quality; 3) be  consistent; and 4) lower the cost of service. To realize these  goals, the service industry must implement six changes: that is,  to be externalized, organized, mechanized, standardized,  informed, and systemized.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Arjo Wiggins chief quits over strategy MR STEPHEN WALLS, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper group, is leaving the company after losing a board-room battle over strategy. Mr Walls, known as a deal-maker, was prevented from making a substantial acquisition by AWA's board. The decision and subsequent resignation represents a significant change in direction for the group which may adopt a much more conservative management style. It also represents a victory for AWA's French minority shareholders. Mr Walls, 44, will leave the company in September. He was managing director at Plessey before the electronics group was taken over by General Electric Company and Siemens of West Germany. He is believed to have left Plessey with about Pounds 1m from his outstanding contract and share options. He was earning nearly Pounds 400,000 a year at AWA. Analysts believe Mr Walls wanted to buy a 35 per cent stake in KNP, a Dutch manufacturer of coated paper which also has substantial paper merchanting operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The deal, worth as much as Pounds 400m, was opposed by AWA's non-executive directors, which include Mr Nicholas Worms, senior partner of Maison Worms, Mr Pierre Dufournier, a former chairman of Arjomari-Prioux, and Mr Bernard Dumon, managing director of Saint-Louis. Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, was a non-executive director until 10 days ago when he resigned over 'differences of principle'. Mr Wendt said yesterday his resignation was not for public discussion. Analysts believe the acquisition of KNP would have required raising money from the market and a dilution of the French interests in the company. Worms et Cie, the French financial group, indirectly owns about 39 per cent of AWA. It holds a 38 per cent stake in St Louis, which owns 97 per cent of Arjomari-Prioux which in turn holds 39 per cent of AWA. However, French sources deny the deal would have diluted their stake. Analysts believe Mr Walls wanted to take advantage of AWA's low gearing and the present low prices commanded by paper companies which have been hit by over-capacity and demand.

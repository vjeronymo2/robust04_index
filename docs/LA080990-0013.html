			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THIEF STEALS PICKUP, GETS CARGO OF CASH  </P> <P> A thief escaped with $15,000 to $30,000 Wednesday morning when he stole a  courier service pickup that was parked at a bank.  </P> <P> At 9:07 a.m., William Hanson, a driver for Heritage Courier Services, parked  the pickup at the Bank of Commerce branch office in the 8900 block of Miramar  Road to make a deposit for a client, according to San Diego police spokesman  Dave Cohen.  </P> <P> When Hanson left the bank at 9:12, the truck was gone, Cohen said.  </P> <P> A bank employee spotted the truck shortly after noon a block away. The money,  which had been in a safe fashioned from a tool box, was gone. The safe had been  opened without force and there were no signs that the pickup's doors or  ignition had been tampered with.  </P> <P> Cohen said this led police to believe whoever stole the money had a key for the  truck and knew the safe combination. In addition to the cash, the safe  contained an undetermined number of checks.  </P> <P> Cohen said a witness saw a young, blond woman wearing light-colored clothing  open the door of the truck while it was parked in the bank parking lot. Police  have no suspects.  </P></p>

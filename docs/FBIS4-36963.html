			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Issued by the IDF Spokesman's Office] </F>   [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] unequivocally  denies the assertions made by "Human Rights Watch" in their  report claiming that IDF personnel use torture in order to  obtain confessions from Palestinian detainees.    Any means of torture or violence against detainees is  forbidden under Israeli law, and any confession extracted  against the free will of the detainee is inadmissible as  evidence. The rules of questioning which apply to military  detention facilities were approved by the Judge Advocate General  Corps, and the IDF strictly abides by these rules.    Furthermore, there exists a mechanism for the strict  supervision of military detention facilities by an advisory  committee to the Chief of the General Staff, headed by the  President of the Military Appeals Court.    These facilities are open to visits by, or are under the  supervision of, representatives of the Attorney-General, the  Military Police, lawyers representing the detainees, the Red  Cross, and other human rights organizations.    In addition, every detainee may raise complaints against the  behavior of IDF personnel carrying out questioning, and the  manner in which the confession was taken from him, when he is  brought before a judge in order to extend his detention, or  during his trial.    In cases where complaints have been raised about the methods  used during IDF questioning procedures, the complaints were  immediately investigated by the Military Police, and when  evidence corroborating the complaints was found, the suspects  were brought to trial. It should be emphasized that the number  of complaints is minimal.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Anglo-Dutch 'perfect merger' shows its faults: Raymond Snoddy analyses reasons behind the upheaval in Reed Elsevier's marriage When two world class publishing groups, Reed International of the UK and Elsevier of the Netherlands, merged last year it looked as if every eventuality had been considered. Both sides had been looking for the right partner to aid expansion in the increasingly international world of publishing. And everyone said that English and Dutch company law and organisations were so very similar, citing such historic Anglo-Dutch collaborations as Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell. The two top men - Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed International, and Mr Pierre Vinken, chairman of Elsevier - could not have been more different: Mr Davis, the polished public performer, who left school at 17 and became a marketing specialist and senior executive at the retailer J. Sainsbury; Mr Vinken, the retiring, almost introverted, but very clever neurosurgeon turned publisher. It looked as though the tricky problem of succession - and whether the British or the Dutch would sit on the top of the mountain - would solve itself. Mr Davis was then 51 and Mr Vinken 65. The Reed executive would be chief executive and Mr Vinken would be chairman, and Mr Davis would inherit the chairmanship when Mr Vinken retired two years later. Yesterday the mask dropped from the face of the perfect Anglo-Dutch merger as Mr Davis resigned, moving out of Reed Elsevier's elegant central London headquarters into a small office of his own around the corner. There was no talk of him resigning to spend more time with his family or to pursue other interests. The Reed Elsevier statement gives a true, if rather lifeless, version of the drama. The board had agreed that if Reed and Elsevier were really going to think and move as one company, there had to be a different structure. The co-chairmen would in future be responsible for strategy, management development and corporate communications, while two other members of the executive committee would be responsible for the operating businesses. According to the agreed statement put out by the company, Mr Davis decided that the proposed allocation of responsibilities 'did not enable him to play an effective role suited to his management style'. A run of meetings started with the intention of persuading Mr Davis to stay. But by the time an all-night meeting ended at 4.30am on Saturday, terms had been agreed for his departure. The dispute over structure reflects a conflict between the Anglo-Saxon model of running a company, with a strong chief executive, and the more collegiate Dutch style. The dispute was intensified because Mr Davis was very much a hands-on manager, and because he lost the right to become chairman. Mr Ian Irvine, who replaces Mr Davis as co-chairman, emphasised yesterday that to take the merger forward it was vital 'that everyone is using the same hymn sheet and all singing the same songs'. Mr Irvine suggested that the Davis management style - although he was not happy he had found the right words - was less collaborative, or less collegiate or perhaps less consensual than the other directors'. Mr Davis said yesterday: 'The last thing I wanted to do was damage the company or myself and I was in danger of doing both. I'm sad to be leaving. It's not what I hoped but I am being realistic. I hope my leaving will unblock some blockages and that the business can go forward.' The disputes over structure go back to September when the Dutch pushed for and got an important change. Mr Davis joined Mr Vinken as co-chairman and four joint chief executives replaced Mr Davis as sole chief executive. The British executive considered resigning then, but was persuaded not to by the British non-executive directors. The Dutch also pressed for the current structural change, which caused some internal controversy. Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer who now takes on the additional role of deputy chairman of Reed International, was initially sceptical. Mr Irvine and Sir Christopher Lewinton, of the engineering group TI, were convinced of the need for the change to protect the long-term interests of the merged group. One external observer points to at least one strategic issue dividing the co-chairmen. Mr Vinken, who could not be reached yesterday for comment, is believed to be more sceptical than Mr Davis about the speed at which developments in electronics will transform publishing. Another issue was Mr Vinken's apparent reluctance to retire according to the original plan. It has, however, been agreed that Mr Vinken will retire as co-chairman of Reed Elsevier in April 1995, to be succeeded by Mr Herman Bruggink who will also take over as chairman of the executive board of Elsevier. Mr Vinken is expected to become chairman of the supervisory board of Elsevier and a non-executive director of Reed Elsevier. Unions at Reed Elsevier believe the elevation of Mr Irvine and the arrival of Mr John Mellon, chief executive of Reed Publishing Europe, on the executive committee is a victory for 'the hawks' in industrial relations over the more conciliatory Mr Davis. Mr Irvine said the departure of Mr Davis was probably for the best when it became impossible to reach agreement. Mr Davis, who has sold none of his Reed Elsevier shares nor exercised any of his options, might well agree that, once the arguments became personalised, it would be easier to run the company without him. It was stressed yesterday that Reed Elsevier, which has sales in excess of Pounds 2.7bn and 25,700 employees, was trading well and that interim results due on August 11 would show 'a performance in line with budget and usefully ahead of last year'.</p>

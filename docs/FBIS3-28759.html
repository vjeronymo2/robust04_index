Condemning Ozawa's outburst as an unpardonable insult and  challenge to the Korean people, he in the statement said:    "We demand that Ozawa immediately withdraw and apologize for  his grave remarks that insulted the DPRK and the Korean people  and threatened peace and security on the Korean peninsula.    "We hope conscientious politicians including those of the  ruling party and broad Japanese people will not overlook Ozawa's  remarks but make efforts to get the Japanese authorities' Korea  policy rectified.    "The Korean citizens in Japan will in the future, too,  develop friendly relations with the Japanese people on the basis  of the idea of independence, friendship and peace."</p>

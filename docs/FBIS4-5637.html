			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia is opposing industrial  countries' efforts to link trade with labor conditions in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that will be  signed in Morocco next week.    "Indonesia, like other developing countries, is concerned  over efforts to link trade and labor, which will be  counter-productive," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters  here yesterday.    The United States and France have agreed to push for clauses  on labor conditions to be included in the planned trade  agreement, which will be finalized at a formal meeting of GATT  ambassadors at their April 12-15 meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco.    "The efforts are not productive because they are forced  while  the Marrakesh meeting is expected to merely endorse what has  thus far been achieved," Alatas said.    He said the meeting should only clean up the text of the  December agreement, instead of introducing additional clauses.  [Passage omitted]</p>

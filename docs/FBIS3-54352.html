			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jordanian Transport Minister Adib Halasah has  affirmed that the Iraqi people's steadfastness under leader  President Saddam Husayn in the face of the treacherous 30-state  aggression has thwarted the imperialist-Zionist schemes to  undermine Iraq's sovereignty and national unity.    During a meeting with the Babil deputy governor today,  Halasah indicated that stepped-up hostile conspiracies against  the march of great Iraq were the inevitable outcome of the  growth of Iraq's pan- Arab role in the efforts to rehabilitate  the Arab nation's values and principles and confront external  ambitions in the region.    The Jordanian minister visited the historical city of  Babylon  and acquainted himself with its archaeological and historical  sites.</p>

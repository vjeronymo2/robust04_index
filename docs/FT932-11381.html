			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Commission to draw up strategy for jobs creation THE European Commission is to draw up a Community-wide jobs plan to match and back the modest EC growth initiative agreed at last December's Edinburgh summit. The main object is to create a more coherent job-creation framework for what member states - who have virtually sole jurisdiction in this area  - now do, as well as to solicit ideas for dealing with growing structural unemployment. The Commission is expected to prepare a plan for June's council of social affairs ministers, after employment ministers promised their backing at an informal meeting yesterday in Copenhagen. The preliminary ideas endorsed by ministers included: greater co-operation between employment and finance ministers, and promotion of successful national measures across the EC; identifying ways to promote new jobs, new types of job, and cut labour costs; Initiatives for bringing more women into the labour force; strengthening training, for the employed as well as jobless; using the unemployed to fill in for those undergoing training. Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, told ministers that 'in many people's minds, the Community is part of the unemployment problem, rather than part of the solution'. This had to be turned around. 'We need to be seen to be putting together national actions within some common Community framework.' He has already won Commission approval to reform the EC Social Fund, which spends some Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.75bn) a year on training for the long-term and young unemployed. Under the reform, which needs the approval of the Twelve, part of these funds would be aimed at retraining workers still employed in industries which are restructuring.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Appointments: Departures Wm Low, the Scottish grocery chain, announced after the close of the market yesterday, that Colin Mitchell, md of its Supermarkets division, would leave the company after being 'unable to resolve the future role he would play in the organisation'. The timing and phrasing of the announcement has all the classic ingredients of an attempt to hush-up a boardroom row. It is believed that the forthright Mitchell clashed with James Millar, chairman and chief executive, over their areas of responsibility. Mitchell has worked at Wm Low since 1974, becoming md of supermarkets in 1990. ***** Geoffrey Primack has resigned from FROMINSTER. ***** Robert Strachan is to retire from the WARD Group. ***** Alan Styles has resigned from STAVELEY INDUSTRIES. ***** Charles Maxwell is resigning from MATTHEW CLARK. ***** Frank Carr, a director of DALEPAK FOODS, died on January 24. ***** Arthur Boanas has retired from NEWTON Investment Management. ***** Michael Towers has retired from HTV. ***** Malcolm Jardine is taking early retirement from BEAZER Technical Services at the end of April. ***** Richard Wells and Robin Cullen have resigned from WINDSOR. ***** Peter Scanlon has resigned from GESTETNER. ***** Peter Armitage and Bernard Hall have retired from API. ***** Ron Coles, group md of MIDLANDS RADIO, has resigned. ***** The Stafford, the luxury London hotel in St James's Place, has brought in Alan FitzGerald as its new general manager, after French- Canadian Denis Beaulieu moved to the United States at the end of last year. FitzGerald, a 53-year-old Irishman, spent four years as managing director of the Watergate Hotel in Washington which, like the Stafford, is owned by Cunard. When it was sold he became, briefly, resort director for the Quinta do Lago golf resort in the Algarve, before taking up the position at The Stafford. Starting off in the hotel business at 17, FitzGerald has spent most of his career at Cunard or its parent Trafalgar House. For six years he was hotel director of the Cunard line of ships, where he was among other things in charge of the renovation of the QE2 on its return from the Falkland Islands campaign. ***** The task of setting up a new government agency to handle planning appeals in England and Wales has been given to an insider. Stephen Crow, who currently heads the planning inspectorate division of the Department of the Environment, will be chief executive and chief inspector of the Planning Inspectorate when it becomes an executive agency on April 1. Crow will head the organisation which manages the work of 800 inspectors and other staff from its Bristol head-quarters. He will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the Planning Inspectorate, under the same terms as apply to more than 50 other organisations with agency status. Crow, 57, is a fellow of the Royal Town Planning Institute. He joined the Planning Inspectorate after a career in town planning at local government level, and was appointed Chief Planning Inspector in 1988.</p>

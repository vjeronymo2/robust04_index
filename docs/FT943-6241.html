			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Sardinian leads challenge to Polish TV law: A look at a media showdown in Warsaw Poland's broadcast media legislation passed last year is being put to the test this week as the authorities move against unlicensed television stations amid continuing controversy over the licences that have been granted. On Monday the police burst in on six local stations controlled by Mr Nicola Grauso, a silver-haired Sardinian media owner, and closed them down just as they were broadcasting MacGyver, an American series depicting a secret agent whose ingenuity in escaping from seemingly hopeless situations often defies belief. Angry viewers called into the stations to ask what was happening when their screens went blank. The MacGyver series, along with a diet of popular films and soap operas, has helped Polonia 1, the Grauso network in Poland, build an urban audience of between 20 and 30 per cent. 'We have 8m viewers - the biggest audience for a single commercial station in Europe,' Mr Grauso claimed yesterday, perhaps hyperbolically, as he complained about his predicament. 'I came to Poland five years ago encouraged by the statements of the government intent on attracting investors,' he added, saying he had spent Dollars 50m in the country to date. The authorities replied that they were merely implementing the law when they sent in the police. They explained that Mr Grauso's bid for a licence had failed because more than 33 per cent of the equity in the Polonia network, the upper limit under Poland's broadcast law, was in foreign hands. But there's no denying his success in building a network with a significant audience. He is said to have the support of President Lech Walesa, who is looking for allies in the media to smooth his way to a second term in presidential elections late next year. The Polonia regional stations closed are those in Warsaw, Krakow, Lublin, Szczecin, Poznan and Opole. Police said six other stations owned by Mr Grauso would be taken off the air soon. Mr Grauso said he would apply for temporary permits for his network to operate until a new round of licence allocations starts in two months' time. He added that he was discussing with Polish businessmen the possibility of selling some of his shares in Polonia. For the moment, the financial rewards are small, as the TV advertising market last year was estimated at around Dollars 170m, of which the lion's share went to state-owned TV. This sum will soon have to be distributed among the two regional networks and the 13 local stations, which are due to have their licences granted soon, in addition to state TV's two channels and PolSat, the Polish-owned company which has been granted the country's only national commercial licence. But with the Polish economy set to grow by around 5 per cent a year, the prospect of future rewards has been significant enough to tempt large companies such as Bertelsmann of Germany and Time-Warner of the US into making, thus far, unsuccessful applications and to prompt Mr Rupert Murdoch to plan satellite broadcasts into the country of five channels, including Filmnet. So far PolSat, whose national licence is still being tested in the courts by the other groups which lost out in the first round of the licensing contest, has failed to build an audience bigger than 7 per cent. The station, which is well regarded by the former communist nomenklatura as well as the Catholic church, which maintains its religious department, is opposed by President Walesa. Mr Walesa recently appointed Mr Janusz Zaorski, a former head of state radio and TV, to head the TV and Radio Council, the independent licensing body. Now Mr Walesa is looking to his nominee to do something about the PolSat licence. So far, out of the western hopefuls, only Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel, has been granted a regional licence and it hopes to get a pay service on the air in four cities by Christmas. Kinnevik AB from Sweden is involved with Wisla TV, a Polish broadcaster licensed to operate in southern Poland. Meanwhile, the lobbying will continue and the financial and political stakes are high, especially with a presidential campaign due next year.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (18): UK operators look to the east - The developing country markets are producing a growing supply of big business deals / Contract awards / Diary, FT Exporter reviews recent export contracts and developments in UK support for its exporters and provides a calendar of upcoming international trade fairs UK exporters are continuing to make their mark in hotly-contested developing country markets. Significant deals have recently been won in China, Vietnam and Africa. Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, underscores the strength of opportunity for UK exporters in China. 'The Chinese economy is growing by leaps and bounds. By the end of this century, it will be eight times bigger than it was at the start of the '80s. This matches the best performance of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.' He adds: 'Our exports to China were up by nearly 40 per cent in the first four months of this year compared with last year's performance. But there is much more out there to be won - by Britain's small and medium-sized companies as well as the big players.' Indicative of recent UK export wins in the face of stiff international competition is Taylor Woodrow International's Pounds 60m management contract for the re-development of Kowloon station in Hong Kong in a market which the company sees as a gateway into China - in a competitive bid involving six other international contractors. Bruce Russell, managing director of Taylor Woodrow International, says: 'We were competing on the strength of our management skills and know-how, not price.' Mr Russell describes the deal as a low-risk project representing part of the company's strategy of breaking into the Hong Kong market. 'We have always regarded Hong Kong as an opportunity area and a stepping stone into China,' he says. Two export strategies are being exploited. 'First, to enter as a construction adviser or design and construction partner on the back of foreign inward investments, principally in light industrial and commercial development projects,' Mr Russell says. 'Second, self-developed and financed BOOT (build-own-operate-transfer) projects relating to infrastructure developments in power, water and transportation'. Taylor Woodrow aims to conclude agreements on several additional Chinese projects in the near future. 'The Chinese authorities are proving very receptive to foreign participation. We are on a fast-track learning curve, and so are they,' says Mr Russell. Other notable successes to China in recent months include: CAD Centre, the Cambridge-based supplier of computer-aided design systems for the process plant and power industries, won orders worth Dollars 250,000 for the sale of process plant design software to four customers in the oil and chemical sectors. 'We regard China and Asia as an area of great opportunity for our products,' says managing director Bob Bishop. APV received contracts for the supply of processing equipment to China's manufacturing sector, including a Pounds 6m order for dry yeast processing equipment for a large liquor producer. Trafalgar House subsidiary Cemetics International won a Dollars 6m contract to supply equipment and field advisory services to the Shanyang Smelter sulphuric acid plant in Liaoning province. Cemetics has won 17 contracts to supply equipment to sulphuric acid plants in China since the mid-1980s. Others have registered their first successes in China. Birwelco, the Halesowen-based specialist engineering contractor to the water, process and waste industries, won - for a British company - a key engineering contract in the water treatment field in China. Working in collaboration with Yorkshire Water, which itself won a Dollars 5.5m plant and equipment supply contract, Birwelco will be involved in the design and construction of a rapid gravity filtration plant for the Daqing oilfield in Heilongjiang province in north-west China. The contract, signed with the China National Technical Import Corporation in May, is part of a Dollars 150m oilfield development project. 'China represents a completely new market for us,' says Brian Cartwright of Birwelco. 'We secured the contract against fierce international competition because we had the best and most economical tender. We are looking at other market areas including Thailand and Taiwan, where there are enormous opportunities'. The company is working on a feasibility project for a waste-powered energy plant in Taiwan in association with local state authorities and private enterprise. Elsewhere, Vietnam is unfolding as a rewarding export target. Serck Baker, the process engineering subsidiary of Meggitt, specialising in the design and supply of equipment to the oil and gas sector, won its second export contract to Vietnam in June, just weeks after the delivery of its first Vietnamese export contract. In conjunction with Sembawang of Singapore, Serck Baker will design, project manage, engineer and procure oil and gas production equipment for a major Vietnamese energy production project. The multi-million dollar deal represents Serck Baker's largest-ever export project. 'The Far East market has always been an important market for us, and continues to be,' says Jim Dawson, director of Meggitt Energy Division. 'And with the decline in North Sea development, this market becomes a great deal more significant.' Smaller companies are also demonstrating the advantages of market diversification. Carbolite, producer of laboratory furnaces, has notched up successes in Turkey, China and, more recently South Africa and India, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of its Pounds 7m annual turnover. As part of a recent Pounds 350,000 export contract, the company will supply a continuous hardening and tempering line for an Indian manufacturer of cutting strip. Norman Short, marketing director, explains: 'We look strategically at all markets where we believe export demand is going to come in the next five years. We are looking at Vietnam and are currently negotiating the appointment of a locally-based and well-equipped distributor.' Meanwhile, the defence sector, galvanised by shrinking defence budgets in maturing markets, continues to seek new ventures in the developing world. In late June, Radio Racal won a Pounds 7.5m contract for its Tacnet tactical area communications network and field telephone system from a major African customer, for use by the country's armed forces. The deal, the result of two years' negotiations, involved competitive demonstrations alongside French and Israeli manufacturers' equipment. 'This particular deal was significant in that it represented a breakthrough in ousting an incumbent competitor - a French radio company - who had been supplying the customer for several years' says Adrian Day, managing director of Racal Radio Group. 'They fought us hard, but our product and cost-effectiveness proved superior.' Earlier in June, the company won a Pounds 25m contract to supply the Republic of Korea's navy with a new command control console. It has also booked record export volumes into Latin America. 'This year our export order intake is running at twice or three times the level seen over the past five years,' says Mr Day.</p>

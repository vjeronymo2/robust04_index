			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] believes that  the establishment of transitional institutions should take  place as soon as possible. Otherwise its presence in Kigali is  pointless. This is stated in a communique of the RPF issued this  afternoon during a press conference held by the front's  president, Alexis Kanyarengwe at the Amaryambere Hotel in  Kimihurura. In the communique, read by the party's president,  the RPF gives its views on some of the problems in the setting  up of the broad-based institutions and stresses that it will not  tolerate the results of political maneuvers. Here is Colonel  Kanyarengwe.    [Begin Kanyarengwe recording] [Words indistinct] declares  that it will not at all tolerate any results reached by  political maneuvers aimed at substituting other lists of  deputies for the one initially selected in the framework of  setting up institutions on the 37th day after the date of the  signing of the Arusha peace agreement.    The RPF also declares that it does not accept the last  minute  change of heart of parties such as the Coalition for the Defense  of the Republic [CDR] which had publicly declared that it would  not take part in the transitional national assembly and  therefore had not nominated its deputies. [passage omitted]    Any authority, individuals or parties who neglect their role  in the setting up of the institutions will be responsible for  the consequences which may result from the situation. This call  is made particularly to the president of the Republic who should  be the first person to make himself available for the  swearing-in ceremonies of the deputies of the transitional  assembly and members of the government team. The pursuit of  maneuvers aimed at [word indistinct] a minority the blockade of  institutions in favor of the president of the Republic and his  party, obliges the RPF to declare to the national and  international opinions that its presence in Kigali is pointless.  [passage omitted]    Our position is clear (?and it is the following): We did not  come here to play around or to watch a play. We are here to  work, we are not here on holiday. This is in summary the  meaning of the declaration. We are here to work. If you will  allow it, we are available. If there are other intentions,  [words indistinct] what else can you reproach the RPF with, of  not having done? We are here in the capital. So why are we  here? I put this question to you journalists. What is the  purpose? To tolerate the whim of your president? No. [end  recording]</p>

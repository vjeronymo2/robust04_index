			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thirteen commenters objected to the requirement in &sect;75.562(c)(3) that indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limitation may not be used to satisfy cost-sharing or matching requirements. Many cited the new provision in OMB Circular A&hyph;110 that allows the use of unrecovered indirect costs for this purpose, with the approval of the granting agency. Commenters were concerned that this limitation would make it difficult for many competent applicants to qualify for grants that require cost-sharing or matching.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has a long-standing practice not to allow the use of unrecovered indirect costs under training grants as matching or cost-sharing. This practice was required because under a previous version of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and the Department's implementing regulations in 34 CFR Part 74, only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable costs could be used for matching or cost-sharing purposes. Since training grants are limited to an eight percent indirect cost rate, all indirect costs over that limit were considered unallowable and thus could not be used as matching or cost-sharing. The practice also had the result of maximizing the funds that support project activities, because the use of unrecovered indirect costs to meet matching or cost-sharing requirements would reduce the amount of direct cost funds being put into the project by the recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recently revised 34 CFR Part 74 to implement revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;110. The circular and Part 74 now allow institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, and hospitals that receive funds under Federal programs to use unrecovered indirect costs for matching or cost-sharing, but only with the approval of the awarding agency. In light of this change and in response to the concerns expressed by commenters, the Secretary re-examined this practice but decided not to change it because it maximizes the impact of the limited funds available for training grant programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received comments suggesting that applicants be notified as early as possible in the application process that a program is subject to the training rate or to the restricted rate based on a statutory supplement-not-supplant requirement. Commenters thought this information should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the application packages and also on the grant award notices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many programs already include this information in application packages and notices, but, in an effort to assist applicants as much as possible, the Department will do this for the other programs as well. The issue is somewhat complicated by the fact that some, but not all, grants awarded under certain programs may be training grants. In this case the Department will include in the application package and notice a statement that some grants awarded under the program could be training grants subject to the eight percent limitation on indirect costs, depending upon the type of project proposed. The Department is already taking steps to include information in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance that identifies those programs subject to the restricted rate based on the supplement-not-supplant requirement. As for placing the information on the award notices, the Department is currently redesigning its core financial systems, including the grants management system, and this information will be on award notices produced under the new system. These notification issues were not addressed in the proposed regulations and no change has been made to include them in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters thought that the Department should exclude training grants and their indirect costs from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process used by the Department to establish indirect cost rates. This would have the effect of increasing the organization's negotiated rate and would offset somewhat the loss of indirect costs under the training grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This issue was not included in the proposed regulations but will be considered by the Department during its periodic reviews of administrative procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.563&blank;Restricted Indirect Cost Rate_Programs Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter said that the restricted rates applicable to programs with the supplement-not-supplant requirement should not be applied to universities that have a negotiated indirect cost rate. They suggested that &sect;&sect;75.563 and 75.564(f) be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department applies a restricted rate only to grants made under programs that have a statutory requirement that Federal funds be used to supplement, not supplant, institutional funds. If a recipient happens to be an institution of higher education, the restricted rate must be applied_the Department has no choice on the matter because the rate implements a statutory limitation. However, as a matter of practice, the recipients of grants under these programs are predominately State educational agencies or local educational agencies; very few institutions of higher education receive grants under restricted rate programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.564&blank;Reimbursement of Indirect Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters thought the language in &sect;75.564(a) was confusing and contradicts &sect;75.564(b) and &sect;75.560(d). They thought &sect;75.564(a) should be revised to make it clear that the Department accepts the rate negotiated with an applicant's cognizant agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section addresses the issue of reimbursement of indirect costs and the opening paragraph is a general statement of the Department's policies in this area. As stated in the first sentence, there are administrative and statutory restrictions that affect the reimbursement of indirect costs under programs administered by ED. There are also situations, though infrequent, when indirect costs are not reimbursed due to a lack of funds. This usually occurs when a grantee is seeking reimbursement of indirect costs because the applicable rate was adjusted upwards during or after the performance of the grant. The Secretary agrees that the second sentence in this section is somewhat confusing and has made a change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The second sentence in &sect;75.564(a), ``The extent to which indirect costs are reimbursed is a matter for determination between the Secretary and the grantee,'' has been deleted from the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Bank hints at need for rate rise: Inflation forecast for mid-1996 falls to 2.5% but concern mounts over price pressures Interest rates will probably need to rise over the coming months to keep inflation on target, the Bank of England implied in its quarterly inflation report yesterday. The Bank said the inflation outlook had improved since its last report. Its central forecast of underlying inflation (which excludes mortgage interest payments) in mid-1996 has been reduced to 2.5 per cent, from around 3 per cent in its last forecast. The report will set the agenda for today's monthly monetary meeting between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, which will discuss interest rate policy. The two agreed to an increase in base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent after their September 7 meeting. Financial markets appeared to be buoyed yesterday by the view that the report made an imminent rise in rates less likely. The Institute of Directors said it saw no evidence of overheating in the economy to justify a further increase in rates. The government has a target range for inflation of 1-4 per cent, but the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, added the aim of reaching the lower half of the government's target range by the end of this parliament. The Bank now regards the lower half of the band as its effective target. While the Bank's forecast inflation just within the lower half of the range, it warns that its central projection 'is only the single most likely outcome. The risk of inflation being higher than the central projection is greater than the probability of it being lower'. The Bank is particularly concerned about the recent pick-up in producer price inflation, which has been fuelled by increases in raw materials prices. 'It is not clear how far price pressures will be passed down the production and retail chain,' the report said. Higher producer prices might eventually feed through into higher retail prices. The Bank also said that the rapid growth of M0, the narrow measure of the money supply, was 'cause for concern' and said that wage rises might increase faster than currently expected. Given the balance of the risks, and the lags involved between changes in interest rates and their effects on the economy, it is likely that an increase in rates will be needed during the next few months to keep inflation within the 1-2.5 per cent band. Nevertheless, financial markets felt that the reduction in the Bank's inflation forecast meant that the eventual rise in interest rates might be smaller than expected. Gilts rose sharply after the report was issued, to end the day about half a point higher. About half of the downward revision in the Bank's inflation forecast was due to the recent rise in interest rates, which will slow the growth of demand, especially in view of the high levels of debt in the personal sector. The rest of the revision was due to a combination of the recent falls in inflation, and lower-than-expected wage rises.

He indicated that the two  countries will seek to expand trade relations and that the  possibility of opening trade offices in Asuncion and Beijing  will be studied.    The foreign minister outlined the government's official  position following the first visit to Paraguay by a PRC business  delegation, headed by the president of the Chamber of Commerce  of Beijing. The PRC delegation met with local businessmen and  with directors of the Chamber of Commerce seeking to increase  bilateral trade.    Ramirez Boettner explained during a news conference: "We  maintain relations with the Republic of China, but this in no  way prevents us from maintaining private trade relations with  the PRC. A trade delegation has visited. I have met with them  to see whether trade and economic exchanges can be increased,  but no further steps will be made toward establishing diplomatic  relations."    Also on 26 January, the foreign minister received copies of  the credentials of the new ambassador of the Republic of China  (Nationalist China), Agustin Tingtsu Liu [name as published],  who will present his credentials to President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy when he returns from his visit to Ecuador and Peru.

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES' COVERAGE OF MCMARTIN CASE  </P> <P> This is in reference to David Shaw's recent news analysis that suggests The  Times' coverage of the McMartin case was biased (Part A, Jan. 19-22). I have  followed the case and its coverage closely, especially the articles by Lois  Timnick. Her coverage was not at all biased. In my view her work was an  outstanding example of the very best in objective journalism, performed under  extremely difficult conditions. In fact, it was in a class by itself compared  with most of the other coverage of this case by the media.  </P> <P> Many of us in the local medical community have been familiar with Timnick's  work ever since she came here from St. Louis with an excellent reputation as a  science writer for the Globe Democrat. In a welcome bit of creativity, The  Times assigned Timnick to an unusual beat: human behavior. As your human  behavior reporter, Timnick's work was so excellent that she gained great  credibility and respect among psychiatrists, psychologists and behavioral  scientists nationwide.  </P> <P> Timnick researched her topics in depth, quoted people with absolute accuracy,  and on controversial topics was implacably objective and even-handed. One  result was that she was given the coveted Robert T. Morse Award in 1981 by the  American Psychiatric Assn. This honor goes annually to a journalist for  outstanding work in reporting developments in our field.  </P> <P> Those who, in search of scapegoats, include Timnick on any list of biased  journalists, have failed to do their own homework. And those representing the  McMartin defense who are now lashing out in all directions, trying to make the  climate more favorable to the defendants, should hardly be given credibility as  authorities on journalistic standards. As for those Monday-morning quarterbacks  from far-off newspapers who now criticize The Times (thereby suggesting that  they could have done a better job), I would say, stow it. Day in, day out, year  in, year out, you weren't there in the McMartin case. Timnick was.  </P> <P> In Scotland, a jury can deliver one of three possible verdicts: guilty, not  guilty, and not proved. The McMartin jury, lacking the last choice, did its  duty as best it could. The aftermath of frustration and outrage has led to a  frenzy of blaming on both sides. This will run its course. Meanwhile, set the  record straight. Timnick is a distinguished journalist and one of your star  reporters. She deserves great credit for the job she did in the McMartin case.  What she really deserves is the Pulitzer Prize.  </P> <P> LOUIS JOYLON WEST, M.D.  </P> <P> Professor of Psychiatry  </P> <P> UCLA  </P></p>

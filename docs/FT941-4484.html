			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Germany's coalition faces a mauling from the jobless in year of the voter: As the SPD faces its most promising opportunity in 12 years to beat Chancellor Kohl's coalition, Quentin Peel hears what politicians in the first of 19 poll battles across the country are telling aerospace workers fighting to save their jobs At the gates of the Deutsche Aerospace plant at Lemwerder, in the bleak marshes of the Weser estuary in the north German state of Lower Saxony, several hundred bitter and baffled workers gathered this week to demonstrate their determination to save their jobs. Since last October they have mounted a permanent vigil at the gates to protest against the impending closure of the factory, where the Transall military transport aircraft is built, and Airbus aircraft serviced. The entire 1,200-strong skilled labour force is set to be sacked as part of a restructuring programme in the German aerospace industry, battered by cuts in military spending and the slump in demand for civilian aircraft such as the Airbus. Their guest of honour on the makeshift speaker's platform was Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), and the man who hopes to win the next general election on October 16 to become federal chancellor in Bonn. The trouble was that he had little firm hope to offer the workers at Lemwerder, for his own party stands for even more drastic cuts in the country's defence budget than the present liberal-conservative coalition headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'I have come here because I believe that politicians have the goddam duty to go to the very places where decisions are being taken about jobs,' he said. 'It is all very well to fly off to the Far East, like Chancellor Kohl, and lecture people about blooming landscapes. They should come and visit the places in Germany where the jobs are under threat.' It was a good line for the cameras, but it was not really what the threatened workers had come to hear. They wanted promises that a future SPD government in Bonn would provide the new orders to keep them in business. Mr Scharping could only promise to 'create a stable framework' for business to do its best. As for military spending, he admitted he wants further job cuts in the Bundeswehr, down from the present 370,000 to just 300,000. The opposition leader is treading an acutely cautious path in his long campaign to overthrow the Kohl coalition, desperately anxious not to give any hostages to fortune which may destroy his party's best chance of power since it fell from grace in 1982. 'Jobs, jobs and jobs again,' is the campaign theme of the SPD at the start of Germany's 1994 election marathon, which culminates in the general election on October 16. It is by far the greatest concern of the electorate, beyond law and order, immigration, social welfare, housing or education. Mr Scharping is concerned to show that his party not only cares, but that it has ideas about how to create new jobs. Lemwerder was a tough place to start. Mr Scharping was left in little doubt about what the failure of any rescue plan for Lemwerder might mean. 'The anger of the people is aimed against the managers, for now,' said Mr Erwin Nowak, chairman of the works council. 'But if Lemwerder is not saved, then all the big parties will certainly feel it at the general election.' This week the focus of Germany's entire political establishment is on the first poll of no less than 19, among the 5.9m electors in the state of Lower Saxony. It should give some clear indications about the spate of elections to come. The outcome of Sunday's vote is in little doubt: Mr Scharping's colleague and erstwhile rival for the SPD leadership, Mr Gerhard Schroder, looks set to be swept back to power as premier in the state parliament in Hanover. His red-green coalition, between the SPD and the Green Party, has a big lead in the opinion polls over Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Recent opinion polls give the SPD some 45 per cent support in the state, against 35 for the CDU. In 1990, the SPD won power from the CDU with 44.2 per cent to 42.0, while the Greens, with 5.5 per cent, made up the difference. The Free Democratic Party (FDP), Mr Kohl's partners in Bonn, managed 6 per cent then, but this time they are in danger of falling below the 5 per cent minimum needed to win any seats. The Greens could do a little better this time - one poll gives them 8 per cent support. If the FDP fails to make the grade, it means Mr Schroder has a chance of an absolute majority. The unknown in this election is how the extreme right-wing Republicans will perform, as well as an assortment of other citizens' movements. In the opinion polls, only 3 per cent say they will vote for the Republicans, but there is still a big proportion - around one in three  - undecided. Mr Schroder's success has been that, in spite of fears in the business community when he formed his red-green government four years ago, he has proved to be far more pragmatic than his left-wing credentials suggested. As unemployment in the state has risen towards 11 per cent - the second highest in west Germany - he has become ever more concerned to be friendly towards industry, and distance himself from the stern environmentalism of his coalition partners. Indeed, he stunned the last SPD party conference in Wiesbaden by citing Lemwerder as a case for giving defence industries a better deal. He was denounced by his party colleagues, but the message to the Lower Saxony electors was clear: for Gerhard Schroder, jobs come even before party politics. His success has left the CDU bewildered and trailing. 'He is a pure pragmatist without principles, and erratic, too,' says Mr Christian Wulff, his 34-year-old CDU challenger. 'We say red-green is unfriendly to business. Look at Lemwerder: the red-green coalition has banned military research in the state, so it has all gone to Bavaria. Now they wonder why companies like Dasa close down in Lower Saxony entirely.' Mr Wulff, who has been a staunch Christian Democrat since he was a schoolboy, has chosen a campaign poster with a huge black-and-white close-up of former Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in the background, and a modest little colour photograph of himself in front. His critics say he is deliberately trying to distance himself from Mr Kohl by identifying with the CDU's great founding father. Yet Mr Kohl is about the only real weapon he has. His style is a total contrast to that of Mr Scharping. At a rally in the sports hall of Nienburg, north of Hanover, last week, the chancellor was relaxed, fatherly, deliberately cultivating his statesman's image. He made the same speech he has been making for months, calmly ignoring his unpopularity in the polls. I am the man who delivered unification, the safe old face you can trust, he seems to say. I know all the actors on the world stage, and they trust me. Germany is going through a turbulent time, and the outside world is in turmoil. But I am unflappable and unmovable. Stick with me. It is a message which is just starting to get through to an electorate which none the less is heartily fed up with the current administration in Bonn, and says it wants a change. But it is a message which is certainly too late to save Mr Wulff from defeat in Lower Saxony. As far as Mr Schroder is concerned, he is already almost home and dry. But Mr Scharping and Mr Kohl have their eyes fixed firmly on a much more distant goal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- German elections: a marathon which could change the political landscape  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 13 Lower Saxony parliament Sunday's poll for the state's parliament is the first vote in Germany's election marathon which involves six other state parliaments, elections for local authorities in nine states, the electoral assembly (convention) to choose the next federal president in May, the poll for the European Parliament in June, and finally the general election on October 16. Lower Saxony will send the first signals for a campaign which could transform the political face of the country.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 20 Schleswig-Holstein local councils These are the first in a series of local council elections which could well see a big backlash against the traditional political parties in favour of local citizens' movements. The local authorities are responsible for most local services and have been forced by financial stringency to cut back in many areas, and raise their charges. The main round of elections coincide with the European poll on June 12, with North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, coming to the polls on October 16.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- May 23 Presidential convention The federal convention, or electoral college, in Berlin will elect a federal president to succeed President Richard von Weizsacker. The real contest is between Mr Roman Herzog, the president of the federal constitutional court, for the Christian Democratic Union, and Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, for the Social Democratic party. How the minority Free Democratic party votes will almost certainly decide the issue.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 12 European parliament These elections throughout Germany will provide the first national indicator of popular political trends. The fear of the main parties is that voters may be tempted to vote for extremist protest parties, like the extreme right-wing, nationalist Republicans, because they do not consider the poll as important as a national election. Additionally, local council polls are being held in seven states. (See March 20 above)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 26, Sept 11, 25, Oct 16 State parliaments There are six elections, five in east Germany. Again, the greatest fear is over a backlash against the traditional political parties of centre-left and centre-right, because of unhappiness over the consequences of unification and the resulting high unemployment. The exception is in the west, in Bavaria, where the conservative Christian Social Union is struggling to maintain its absolute majority in the parliament.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 16 National elections The finishing line for the exhausted campaigners and the moment of truth for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative-liberal coalition. Can he reverse what looks certain to be a string of negative results in the state and local elections, and still hang onto power in Bonn? Or will Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful SPD leader, persuade the cautious voters that his party is 'capable of government' at national as well as provincial level?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Leaking Boots Every time it seems fair to draw a line under Boots' ill-fated Pounds 900m Ward White acquisition, something else goes wrong. The further deterioration in the Do It All home improvement chain is just the latest misfortune. Given that neither WH Smith nor Boots seems sufficiently confident of a cure to pump substantial extra cash into the ailing joint venture, one wonders how long it will be before Do It All is quietly put to sleep. At Halfords the turnround is welcome, but it comes much too late for much credit to attach to Boots' management. The fond hope that Halfords can double its turnover while raising its margins fivefold also looks odd since Boots has conspicuously failed to translate the success of its chemist chain to any other retail area. Unfortunately, it is not as though things were going well in pharmaceuticals. Manoplax continues to develop complications, and it will never make substantial profits, even if it remains on the market. Without it, the company's new drugs pipeline resembles a rather leaky garden hose. The group's saving grace is the Boots the Chemist chain which continues to throw off cash at a remarkable rate. Margin growth may now be slowing, but Superdrug's attempts to portray Boots as expensive may stick. Boots is still trying to push up margins while others, such as Marks and Spencer, are passing efficiency improvements on to customers to reap volume gains. Much of that risk is reflected in Boots' discount rating to the stores sector. Still, the fear remains that the company is strategically challenged and may use its strong cash flows to go on another reckless spending spree.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  defended China's economic modernization program Thursday [24  February], saying reforms are "without major problems" despite  some symptoms of overheating.    While acknowledging foreign concerns about an overheating of  the Chinese economy given its breath-taking double-digit growth,  Zhu said he does not think the 13 percent growth of the past two  years is too rapid, although prolonging such growth could prove  difficult.    Zhu, seen as the main architect of China's ambitious  economic  reforms, said macroeconomic measures introduced last summer to  rein in money supply and restore order to an inflation-wracked  economy have stabilized prices and created an environment for  stable growth. "We haven't seen big economic ups and downs,"  Zhu said, dismissing allegations that macroeconomic controls are  failing.    Addressing Japanese business leaders at a Tokyo hotel, Zhu  denounced foreign press reports of growing social unrest due to  soaring prices as distorting reality. Although inflation in big  cities has reached 18.6 percent, the urban population actually  enjoyed better living standards as salaries increased by some 25  percent last year, he said.    Beijing is well aware of inflationary risks but does not  consider the current level of 13.4 percent as cause for concern,  Zhu said, adding the increase in money supply has been  successfully stabilized at about 20 percent.    The implementation of a comprehensive economic reform  program, including the introduction of new taxes and a single,  market-oriented foreign exchange rate system since January 1,  has been "going smoothly and without creating major problems."    Beijing will do away with its special foreign currency swap  centers from April 1, from which time foreign exchange will be  handled solely through banks, said Zhu, who also heads China's  Central Bank.    The planned transformation of China's banks into commercial  banks will have to go hand in hand with the restructuring of  unprofitable state enterprises which have depended on cheap  loans while adjusting to market transition. Zhu predicted "big  progress," however, in the privatization of the state-run sector  this year.    Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will  help gradually increase the central government's revenue share  from the present 30 percent to about 60 percent by the year 2000.    Zhu dismissed as "groundless" rumors that foreign companies  will soon be listed on the Shanghai stock exchange. Beijing is  taking a very cautious stance toward the country's fledgling  stock exchanges, closely monitoring Chinese firms to prevent an  "economic bubble" like that which occurred in Japan.    Japan-China trade, which soared by 54 percent to 39 billion  dollars last year, is nevertheless "still small," considering  the potential of China's huge market, he said. Increased  investment and trade with China could help Japan overcome its  prolonged recession and boost the competitiveness of Japanese  products, Zhu pointed out, adding he hopes trade relations  between the two countries would "reach a new level."    Zhu arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for a nine-day trip  focusing on increasing economic ties. Besides visiting a number  of prefectures to study Japan's economic and corporate  structures, the vice premier will also meet present and former  political leaders.</p>

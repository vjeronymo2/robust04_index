			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Vauxhall plants to consider ballot on industrial action VAUXHALL workers are likely to be balloted on taking industrial action short of a strike after pay talks broke up without agreement last night. Mass meetings will be held at the company's two factories - at Luton, Bedfordshire and Ellesmere Port, Cheshire - and a ballot on taking action will be held if the 9,000 workers reject the company's latest offer. The move comes after the failure to achieve a breakthrough during all-day talks between the company and officials from the TGWU general union and the AEU engineering union. Vauxhall stuck to its two-year offer of a 5 per cent pay rise from last October and an increase matching the inflation rate from year two. The company said 'other enhancements' were offered during the talks, but refused to give details. Mr Roger Butler, the AEU's chief Vauxhall negotiator, said the offer was not acceptable. 'We will recommend rejection. If the members support that, we will hold a ballot for industrial action short of a strike. 'Vauxhall is the only profitable motor manufacturer. It made Pounds 78m profit last year and our members are entitled to a share of that profit.' Southwark Council in south London says more than 100 of its white-collar staff have accepted a 5 per cent pay cut as it attempts to win contracts in competition with the private sector. The workers will suffer the cut from the beginning of June - when 400 building workers will have a two-year pay freeze imposed. Both groups will lose four days of holiday. The deal was negotiated with Nupe, the public-service union, and Ucatt, the building workers' union. According to Mr Keith Furnett, a management consultant who is advising the Labour-controlled council, it will save about Pounds 1.8m. Prices rise, Page 6; More at stake than machismo, Page 15</p>

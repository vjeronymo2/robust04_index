			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Barclays seeks tax hearing BARCLAYS Bank yesterday asked the US Supreme Court to hear its case against California's unitary taxation system despite efforts by the state to stave off a fight. The court is expected to decide next month whether to hear the case. California last week changed its tax code to address many of the bank's concerns, but the bank says this does not go far enough. Barclays argues that the state cannot be allowed to keep taxes it had collected unconstitutionally since 1977. At stake is approximately Dollars 533m (Pounds 353m) California would owe Barclays and other foreign-owned companies if the court ruled for the bank. The state could owe as much as Dollars 3.1bn if the Supreme Court extended a ruling against unitary taxation to US-owned companies. Under the unitary taxation method, California assessed taxes on a proportion of companies' world-wide income rather than on income earned in the state. After the law was amended, the US solicitor general asked the court not to hear Barclays' case, as the bank's complaints had now been met. The administration finds itself caught between a campaign promise made by President Bill Clinton to back California, and pressure from US businesses and foreign governments to uphold norms of international taxation.</p>

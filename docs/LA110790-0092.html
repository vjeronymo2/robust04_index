			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: THE HIGHWAY TO RAISING U.S. PRODUCTIVITY  </P> <P> For all its importance, the issue that may turn out to be the economic hallmark  of the 1990s -- public investment in roads and bridges, sewers and airports --  attracted little controversy in Tuesday's elections.  </P> <P> When all the returns are counted, they'll probably show that voters in many  states approved bond issues for water and sewage plants, toll roads and public  transit, housing, airports and all those other things called infrastructure.  </P> <P> That has been the trend in recent years since voters realized that  shortchanging infrastructure was false economy. Neglect has left bridges  unsafe, water mains rusting and highways buckling. Voters have been saying yes  to public works bond issues, since three people died in the 1983 collapse of a  highway bridge in Connecticut and especially since the Nimitz Freeway collapse  in last year's Bay Area earthquake.  </P> <P> That trend could accelerate in the '90s for several reasons. First, America's  public facilities continue to deteriorate, increasing the cost of fixing or  replacing them. By a conservative estimate of the Government Finance Officers  Assn. -- 12,000 state, county and municipal budget directors -- public spending  must double to almost $150 billion a year to bring facilities up to proper  standards and handle new growth.  </P> <P> But the money would be well spent, say many experts, because it would provide  America a way out of its economic doldrums. The nation has paid a higher price  than it realizes for letting infrastructure decay, says economist Alan Blinder  of Princeton University.  </P> <P> It hasn't been simply inconvenient for trucks to detour around closed bridges  or flight delays to become common at crowded airports, Blinder suggests. It has  been unproductive.  </P> <P> Real growth in output per hour -- productivity -- has fallen from 2.3% a year  in the 1950s and '60s to just about 1% a year in the past two decades. "It's no  coincidence that public investment -- aside from military spending -- has been  falling for throughout those two decades," says David Aschauer, an economist  who developed a new theory on public spending at the Federal Reserve Bank of  Chicago.  </P> <P> "Public investment in infrastructure inspires private investment," Aschauer  says. So increased public spending in this decade would revive U.S.  productivity growth, he says.  </P> <P> History is on Aschauer's side. The Interstate Highway System, begun in 1956,  gave a big boost to productivity by allowing trucks to move food and  merchandise faster, and thus to deliver goods more cheaply. The nation got more  for less: In other words, productivity rose.  </P> <P> The pattern was the same as far back as 1825, when the Erie Canal opened a way  to get Midwestern farm produce to ports on the Atlantic Ocean. Suddenly, costs  were cut dramatically.  </P> <P> Where it once cost more to ship the grain to port than to ship it across the  Atlantic, now American farmers and shippers could earn more from the trade and  whole regions blossomed with new investment.  </P> <P> That may be inspiring history, you say, but how does it apply to the 1990s?  America may repair its highways, but it won't build a new interstate system.  And we don't need a new Erie Canal.  </P> <P> No, but America will need new kinds of highways. It will need high-speed  trains, more sophisticated air traffic control systems and cars that burn clean  fuel.  </P> <P> And it will need upgraded, fiber optic cable networks for telecommunications,  if it is to be competitive in the world. "Other countries, particularly France  and Japan, have made the telecommunications infrastructure the centerpiece of  their economic planning," says William Davidson, a telecommunications expert at  the USC School of Business.  </P> <P> Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co. -- a partly government-owned  company -- will spend $210 billion to bring fiber optic cable to every major  business office by 1995 and to every home by 2000. That will expand the ability  of companies to efficiently process information, to engineer new designs and  products, and the ability of Japan's people to communicate and learn. They will  get more for less. In other words, they will enjoy rising productivity.  </P> <P> And American industry is concerned. "Technological leadership in the 21st  century will depend on the telecommunications infrastructure," Chairman George  Fisher of Motorola recently told an audience at Caltech. "And yet our response  lacks direction, our government has lost its way."  </P> <P> Fisher wasn't calling for government funding for telephone lines. Private  investment can handle that. But he was calling on government to create a  framework or, as he put it, to create a modern equivalent of the National  Weather Service set up 120 years ago this month by the federal government to  provide weather information for farmers and industry.  </P> <P> He was calling on government to support infrastructure, in other words. And as  Tuesday's election results showed, the voters are inclined to agree.  </P></p>

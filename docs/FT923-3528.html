			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / BR faces complaint of abuse of power CHARTERAIL, the private freight train operator, which is on the brink of financial collapse, has lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission alleging an abuse of monopoly power by British Rail. The complaint has been made under Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome which prohibits abuse of a dominant market position and which can lead to fines and action in national courts. Charterail ceased operations at the end of last month when it ran out of money. It said BR was to blame for charging too much for the locomotives and crew that hauled Charterail's freight trains over BR's tracks. The company says the rates charged were consistently higher than indicative prices quoted by BR when Charterail was formed. They also failed to fall as road haulage rates did. Last night Mr Robin Gisby, Charterail's managing director, said there were two main grounds for the company's complaint to the EC. He alleged that in some instances BR had refused to quote rates for new traffic, and in others had not quoted fair prices based on an objective view of their costs. Charterail's complaint appears to be aimed at putting pressure on BR to negotiate a new set of lower rates that will enable the company to go back into business. Mr Gisby said Charterail had succeeded in finding investors who were prepared to plug the company's funding gap if a viable business could be re-established. 'The missing element is the new rate structure from BR,' he said. 'We are waiting to hear from BR on what basis they are prepared to restart the operation of our trains. If it is on the same basis as it was two or three weeks, ago, the numbers will clearly not add up.' In that event, Mr Gisby said that the company would go into liquidation. Charterail's complaint to the EC is doubly embarrassing for BR because the corporation is a 22 per cent shareholder in the company. The rest is owned by a range of private-sector interests led by GKN, the industrial group. BR said it would look at any new proposals from Charterail, but its rail-freight operations were unsubsidised and it was under an obligation to cover its costs. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, yesterday predicted that two more InterCity routes - between Plymouth and Penzance and Crewe and Holyhead - would be cut. He also told delegates at the TUC Congress that privatisation was not inevitable. 'Rail privatisation will be the poll tax of this parliament,' he said.</p>

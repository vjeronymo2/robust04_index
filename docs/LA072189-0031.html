			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> AT PASEO REAL, IT'S THE FOOD THAT COUNTS  </P> <P> Go out to a restaurant for home cooking? It's not such a strange idea as long  as it's cooking we won't get at our home. But home cooking, no matter how much  we like it, usually lacks the professional constancy of preparation and the  rhythm of service we rightly expect of a restaurant.  </P> <P> Still, if what we get is exciting enough to overcome such liabilities as slow  service, wide variations in preparation and a crude setting, it's worth seeking  out.  </P> <P> This is the case at Paseo Real, a family-run shack of a place in an industrial  strip of North Hollywood. The cluttered window and multicolored sandwich sign  loudly announcing Mexican food are neither inviting nor accurate reflections of  what you'll find inside.  </P> <P> Through the door are six tables and a counter: a clean, cheery and  unself-consciously retro place that you'd hardly go to unless you knew the  cooking was special. It is.  </P> <P> At its best, the Latin-American cooking at Paseo Real is subtle, unexpected and  downright delicious.  </P> <P> There's no better example than pipian, chunks of savory pork in pumpkin seed  sauce. The pale green granular sauce at first seems bland, but almost at once  things start happening in your mouth: a tingle of chili, a taste of herb. You  may find yourself so engrossed in figuring out what it is made of that before  you do, it'll be gone.  </P> <P> On one occasion, I tried the roast pork, which was less obscure but no less  satisfying than the pipian. Marinated, garlicked and sliced thin, it was as  moist and light as could be.  </P> <P> But the greatest achievement in this basically peasant cooking was "fish in  garlic sauce," a highly sophisticated dish. Half a fresh small fish had been  fileted (mostly), cooked just to the right moment and served in a perfectly  balanced garlic-parsley-mustard sauce. It was far more rewarding than many of  the fish dishes I've had at our most stylish restaurants.  </P> <P> And when I asked the Spanish-speaking cook about the sauce, she proudly came  out of the kitchen carrying the Mayan stone mortar and pestle with which she  prepared the dish; she said it wouldn't taste the same made with anything else.  </P> <P> Because the cooking at the Paseo Real is not restaurant-rigid, dishes will vary  in taste from day to day. One day, garlic soup was dense and redolent with  garlic; another day it was agreeable but thin and underflavored. I only tried  the chicken mole once, but on that day it didn't work -- the chocolate had not  been suffused into the other ingredients. It was the only dish I haven't liked  at Paseo Real.  </P> <P> Other pleasures to be found there are carne asada a la tampiquena, marinated  beef filets, and brocheta de cameron, shrimp with bacon and green pepper en  brochette.  </P> <P> Some of the dishes come with fried plantains; if yours doesn't, be sure to  order some on the side. In fact, they are so gooey, so naturally molasses-sweet  that you'll probably want an extra order anyway. It's a rare chance to indulge  yourself.  </P> <P> Be ready to enjoy yourself at Paseo Real but keep in mind that home cooking  means slow cooking. Not only did I have to wait while my sauce was being ground  in the mortar, but others had to wait for their meals to be prepared.  </P> <P> To get the most out of the experience, you may have to let go of your concept  of time -- at least temporarily -- and keep yourself occupied watching pots  steaming on the stove. As a noted writer is purported to have said to the head  of a film studio: "Do you want it fast, or do you want it good?"  </P> <P>  Paseo Real, 5342 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood, (818) 506-9166. Open 9 a.m.  to 9 p.m. daily. Beer and wine. Cash only. Dinner for two, food only, about  $22.  </P> <P> </P></p>

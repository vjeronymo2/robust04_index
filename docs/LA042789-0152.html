			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS SABOTAGE SCHOOL ON STATE TEST  </P> <P> A group of seniors at Torrance's academically rigorous West High School  intentionally flunked the latest California Assessment Program test in an  attempt to send a message to administrators who they believe place too much  emphasis on the exam.  </P> <P> School officials said the action sent West High's ratings into a nose dive,  dropping reading scores from the 85th percentile statewide in 1987-88 to the  51st percentile this year. On the math portion, the dip was also dramatic,  falling from the 95th percentile in 1987-88 to the 71st percentile in the  current academic year.  </P> <P> The students' rebellion has once again raised questions about whether schools  are under too much pressure to bring in high California Assessment Program  scores.  </P> <P> The results are often published in newspapers and used within communities to  compare one school to the next. In addition, home buyers often consult the  scores in looking for desirable areas with good school districts.  </P> <P> At least one family from out of state "specifically selected our high school  because we have high CAP scores," West High teacher Brenda McNamara said. "That  is not unusual."  </P> <P> Last year, 50 elementary schools statewide were accused of cheating on third-  and sixth-grade California Assessment Program tests. Critics said the reason  for the cheating was pressure on schools to get high scores.  </P> <P> Several years ago, when the state was offering cash incentives for high  California Assessment Program scores, students at one Northern California  school intentionally flunked the exam in a dispute over how the money should be  spent, according to one state official.  </P> <P> Because the tests were taken anonymously, it is impossible to tell how many of  West High's 400 seniors were involved in the sabotage.  </P> <P> At the school Wednesday, student body President Kelle Price, who said she did  not intentionally fail the test, said some seniors became disgruntled when  teachers interrupted classes to prepare them for the California Assessment  Program tests. She said students also believed that administrators -- who  visited classes to stress the importance of doing well -- were too concerned  with maintaining the school's image.  </P> <P> "They said this is the test that is the school's report card . . . (and) West  is a really good school and that we all want to keep it up. I think a lot of  people resented that."  </P> <P> According to West High Principal William Bawden, the intentional flunking of  the December exam became apparent last week when West High received its scores  from the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> "We thought that it was the wrong high school . . . and then we got some rumors  that maybe some of the seniors had sabotaged the test," Bawden said.  </P> <P> He said at least one student admitted intentionally doing poorly on the exam.  The principal said a quick examination of the students' test booklets, which  the school received Wednesday, showed an unusual number of wrong answers in 18  cases, including some booklets that had no correct answers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consistent Scores  </P> <P> Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said the  "statistical blip" that resulted from the intentional failures will probably  knock West High out of the running for the state's distinguished school  program. She said the program, although not based solely on California  Assessment Program scores, uses consistent scores to measure a school's  eligibility.  </P> <P> She also said this year's low scores will hurt underclassmen at West High by  preventing an accurate comparison in future years with this year's senior  class.  </P> <P> Another state official said a relatively small number of very low scores can  skew the school average sharply.  </P> <P> Bawden said administrators believed it was necessary to encourage students to  do their best because the California Assessment Program test, which is used  only to gauge a school's performance and not that of individual students, does  not provide an incentive to excel.  </P> <P> At West High, there was much debate Wednesday about who -- if anyone -- places  too much emphasis on the tests. Bawden blamed the state Department of Education  and the press, which he said does not publish other indicators of a school's  performance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Starts at Top  </P> <P> Bill Franchini, who heads the Torrance Teachers Assn., which represents  teachers in the Torrance Unified School District, blamed it on a trickle-down  effect, saying the pressure starts with the state Department of Education and  works its way down through local school districts, principals, teachers and  eventually students.  </P> <P> "I think that they (students) are feeling like pawns in a game that is much  bigger than they are," he said.  </P></p>

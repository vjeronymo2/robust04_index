			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'COASTERS' TO BRING '50S BACK TO CLUB FOUL PLAY  </P> <P> Long known as a haven for hard rockers, the club Foul Play is taking a long  step backward tonight with two shows by the Coasters, a '50s rock 'n' roll  vocal group.  </P> <P> Actually, the trio that will sing at Foul Play is one of many groups touring  under the Coasters name. The original group is a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  inductee that coined such lighthearted hits as "Yakety Yak" and "Charley  Brown."  </P> <P> Club owner Ezra Joseph said the three Coasters who will play shows at 9 and 11  are Grady Chapman, Jerome Evans and Patrick Jackson. None is listed in rock  reference books as a member of the original group during its peak years, but  Chapman sang with the Robins, a Los Angeles vocal group that was a predecessor  of the Coasters. These Coasters are not otherwise connected to the Coasters led  by Cornelius Gunter, a '50s-vintage Coaster who was killed recently in Las  Vegas.  </P> <P> Joseph said tonight's Coasters shows foreshadows a regular series of Saturday  night oldies shows at Foul Play -- with Jackson, who lives in Huntington Beach,  helping to bring in the acts. "Patrick is going to book Saturday nights  starting April 28," Joseph said. "We'll do bands like Brenton Wood, the  Drifters and the Platters. They're all friends, and they're dying for a place  to play. It's what I like to call the expansion of the club -- less punk and  more other acts to mix in."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Joseph said, he is going to continue booking some of the hard  rock acts that have been Foul Play's bread and butter since its earlier  incarnation as Night Moves. Upcoming rock and punk dates include a slate of  longtime Night Moves regulars: Gherkin Raucous, April 1; the Weirdos, April 5;  Cadillac Tramps, April 14; Rattlesnake Shake, April 20, and Celebrity Skin,  April 21.  </P> <P>  The Coasters play tonight at 9 and 11 at Foul Play, 5902 Warner Ave.,  Huntington Beach. Tickets cost $10, with one admission good for both shows.  Information: (714) 840-6118.  </P></p>

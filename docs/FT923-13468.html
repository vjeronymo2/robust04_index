			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Russia seeks western help to break privatisation log-jam THE Russian government is turning to the west in an effort to breathe some life into its plans to privatise enterprises and industries still overwhelmingly in the hands of the state. An announcement is likely soon that a consortium of western companies and banks, led by the accountancy and consulting firm Deloitte Touche Thomatsu, will advise on different aspects of the process. The privatisation programme has become bogged down in wrangles over legislation and in disagreements within the Russian cabinet about the mode and pace of selling off the state bodies. However, decrees on privatisation and on bankruptcy are now in place, and a programme has been passed by parliament. Privatisation, seen by the government and foreign experts as the core of the reform programme, has not put down deep roots in any one of the former Soviet republics, in part because of lack of capital, but mainly because of resistance by management and workers, and government fears of unemployment. However, all large enterprises (employing more than 1,000 workers or with more than Rbs50m capital) are now obliged to submit plans by the end of October for transforming themselves into joint stock companies, with their shares initially owned by the state. Goskomimushchestvo, the Russian state property agency which is overseeing privatisation, has already prepared model plans for more than 8,000 enterprises, It is also rushing to introduce vouchers allowing Russians to take shares in the companies to be privatised. Once the plans have been approved by the local property committees, the workers and managements of the enterprises must vote on how they wish to be privatised, and what share of the assets they will take for themselves. Foreign investors will be allowed to bid for part of the assets. It is planned to extend the privatisation of shops and small enterprises, which began early this year in Russia's third largest city, Nizhny Novgorod, to other cities soon, beginning with the southern town of Volgograd. Other cities have been slow to follow the Nizhny experiment - under which shops were auctioned to the highest bidder - but a few have been cajoled into experimenting with at least small scale capitalism. The Russian government now claims it will press ahead regardless of resistance and fears, foreshadowing a prolonged struggle in industry in the second part of the year.</p>

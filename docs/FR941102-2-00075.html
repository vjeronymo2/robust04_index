The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Morrison lacked authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Washington. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was personally served on Dr. Morrison by DEA investigators on March 2, 1994. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Morrison. The Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response from Dr. Morrison or anyone purporting to represent him. Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Morrison has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter and enters his final order based on the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that on May 7, 1993, the State of Washington Department of Health Podiatric Medical Board (Podiatric Board) found that Dr. Morrison had engaged in unprofessional conduct. As a result the Podiatric Board revoked Dr. Morrison's privilege to practice podiatric medicine and surgery in the State of Washington and revoked his privilege to prescribe controlled substances. Accordingly, Dr. Morrison is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances in the State of Washington wherein he is registered with the DEA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator has consistently held that DEA cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is without State authority to handle controlled substances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nathaniel S.

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AM2446006, previously issued to John Thomas Morrison, D.P.M., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This order is effective November 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

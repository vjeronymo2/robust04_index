Brazil Foreign Minister Celso Amorim declared  Brazilian support during a lengthy exchange of views with  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany)  today. In the long run, Germany aspires to a permanent seat on  the Security Council. The talks that Amorim began at the  Bundestag this morning focused on economic, technological, and  environmental cooperation, the Foreign Ministry announced.    Both ministers stressed the "excellent state of  German-Brazilian relations." Kinkel thanked Amorim for his  support concerning the final control regulation for the  Brazilian nuclear power plants. He encouraged Brazil to "push  ahead vigorously" with the ratification of the Tlatelolco  Treaty, which provides for nuclear-free zones in Latin America  and the Caribbean. It will "facilitate and widen" technical  cooperation in the future, Kinkel stressed.</p>

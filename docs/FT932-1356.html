			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Postponement will fuel plant's costs: Implications of further public consultation for the reprocessing centre BRITISH Nuclear Fuels' estimates of the cost of delaying the start-up of the Thorp reprocessing plant have risen several times since last year, and environmental groups want a public inquiry into the environmental, economic and diplomatic issues raised by the plant. BNF puts the cost of a nine-month delay at at least Pounds 2.4m a week, hitting profits for the year to March 1993 by nearly Pounds 70m. Mr Clive Bates of Greenpeace, the pressure group, said yesterday that BNF's UK customers 'might gain from the delay, so the true cost to the UK economy could be lower than its figures suggest'. BNF originally expected Thorp, which is intended to extract reusable plutonium and uranium from used nuclear fuel, to get the go-ahead in January. Its 10-page report prepared last month bases its calculations on a hypothetical nine-month delay until September 1993. This could correspond to the timetable for a decision if the government proceeds with a further round of consultation, as appears likely. Such a delay would cut more than Pounds 90m off the total profit of Pounds 500m expected in the first 10 years, it argues. The report puts the total cost of delay over the 39 weeks at Pounds 150m. The largest part of this, Pounds 90m, is the cost of labour and maintenance for Thorp. BNF puts the cost of its 1,750-strong team - 660 contractors and 1,090 staff - at Pounds 5m a month, and the cost of steam and electricity to heat the plant at Pounds 1m a month. A further Pounds 13m is due to labour and service on the effluent treatment plants connected to Thorp. Thorp's share of the Sellafield site's overheads makes up an additional Pounds 18m, or Pounds 2m a month. BNF has also added the Pounds 11m estimated costs of extending the life of the storage ponds used to receive customers' fuel. Postponement of operations also means that payment of some customer fees would be delayed - the report puts the financing costs at Pounds 15m. Some contracts also contain a penalty clause if reprocessing is delayed, which could add Pounds 3m. However, the report assumes that BNF can claw back some Pounds 53m of this total from customers under the terms of its 'cost-pass-through' contracts, which make up about 60 per cent of its order book. It is understood that BNF has not yet opened discussions with foreign customers on whether they would accept an increase in costs because of delay. The earliest contracts signed with Thorp, including those with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the electricity generators, as well as some with Japanese utilities, are at fixed prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Positions After Parliamentary Reshuffles; </F> Changes in the National Council of the Slovak Republic Deputies'  Clubs"]    [Text] The decision by parliament to pass a vote of  no-confidence in Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar will,  possibly, still in the course of the 27th meeting of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], trigger changes  in the composition of deputies' clubs.    Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Chairman Vladimir  Meciar, who did not exercise his mandate as a deputy in view of  holding the post of Slovak prime minister, is likely to be the  first to return to the parliamentary benches. He will replace  Anna Korduliakova from Cadca, who, together with deputy Milan  Mrenko, set up the HZDS National Social Democratic Faction. The  Cadca HZDS District Presidium did not accept this initiative.    [Justice Minister] Katarina Tothova, [Labor and Social  Affairs Minister] Olga Keltosova, [Deputy Prime Minister] Jozef  Prokes, and [Deputy Prime Minister] Marian Andel also did not  exercise their mandates as deputies while executing their  [government] posts. Vladimir Mikulka from Ruzomberok, Blazena  Pavlovicova from Skalica, Miroslav Rybansky from Piestany, and  Milan Janicina from Bratislava, who subsequently joined Ludovit  Cernak's National Democratic Club, had been co-opted into the  NRSR in their stead.    At the start of the 10th electoral term [in June 1992], the  HZDS had 74 deputies in the NRSR, the Party of the Democratic  Left [SDL] 29, the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] 18, the  Slovak National Party [SNS] 15, and the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement/Coexistence [MKDH/Coexistence] coalition 14.    In the course of parliament's 10th electoral term, 19  deputies have left the HZDS Deputies' Club, one has left the SDL  Deputies' Club, and seven have left the SNS Deputies' Club. The  KDH and MKDH/Coexistence clubs have remained unchanged. Until  the NRSR meeting started, the correlation of votes between the  HZDS/SNS government coalition on the one hand and opposition  parties and independent deputies on the other was 74:76. In the  course of the 27th NRSR meeting, Imrich Mori announced that he  was leaving the HZDS, and eight signatories of the Alternative  of Political Realism [platform within the HZDS] announced that  they were leaving the HZDS Deputies' Club. This new balance of  forces apparently decided on the passage of the no-confidence  vote in the prime minister.    After the [former] Slovak Government members regain their  mandates as NRSR deputies, the HZDS will have 52 seats in  parliament and the SNS nine. The previously two independent  deputies--Ivan Hudec and Peter Brnak--have been joined by  others, following the departures from the HZDS and the SNS.  Hence, the correlation of votes should be 65:85 in favor of  independent deputies and political parties that will try, in the  coming days, to form a government with a limited term of office,  until early parliamentary elections.</p>

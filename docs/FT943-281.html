			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / OECD in race against time to fill top job The clock ran out last night on the tenure of Mr Jean-Claude Paye as secretary general of the 25-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) without member countries' ambassadors being able to agree that either he or a rival US-backed Canadian candidate should be named to a full new term. After eight hours of talks yesterday and on Wednesday failed to break the deadlock - essentially between France and the US - OECD envoys headed into a further late-night meeting, aimed simply at agreeing on a caretaker head of the organisation. Mr Paye, whose second five-year term came to an end at midnight, has two deputies - one American and one Swede - who could fill that caretaker role, until such time as the international economic think-tank chooses to restart the competition for its top job. But France has been determined to keep Mr Paye on, even on an interim basis, on the ground that the French incumbent had majority support within the organisation's 25 members, who are mainly European. Late yesterday, however, the US was still adamant that it would not accept Mr Paye staying on, even as a temporary caretaker, arguing that 10 years was enough and that it was time for the organisation to have a non-European head. It has strongly backed Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister, who also has the support of his own government and some other non-European countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Short of a major climb-down by Paris or Washington, it is increasingly likely that both Mr Paye and Mr Johnston will have to withdraw, having effectively cancelled each other out. This would leave Lord Lawson, former UK chancellor of the exchequer, as the only declared candidate left in the field. But since his support was largely confined to the UK government, others would probably throw their hats into the ring. Meanwhile, one side-effect of the OECD impasse was that the Paris-based International Energy Agency yesterday named a new director, but only on an acting basis. Mr John Ferriter is to take over as interim executive director of the IEA from Ms Helga Steeg, who is retiring after 10 years at the agency. The IEA seeks to co-ordinate energy policy among member countries, which largely overlap with the OECD. Some of them, notably France and the US, appear to be using the definitive choice of an IEA director as a weapon in the battle over the secretary-generalship of the older and more prestigious OECD.</p>

Most ethnic Koreans there were  mobilized by Japan as miners during World War II and left behind  after the war, when Russia seized the territory.    The joint team will conduct a basic survey on living  conditions and demands of the Koreans and will seek cooperation  with the Sakhalin local government and Red Cross for four days.  Seoul considers the issue of returning the Koreans a symbolic  work to resolve wrongdoings by Tokyo in the early 20th century.    "Most Koreans who want to return to Korea are those who went  there during World War II and now are aging. So we are to seek  an early solution to the issue," a Foreign Ministry official  said.    The South Korean delegation, headed by Sin Kak-su, chief of  the Northeast Asia division of the Foreign Ministry, include  officials from the prime minister's office, Health and Social  Affairs Ministry and Korea National Red Cross, while the  Japanese team will comprise Foreign Ministry and Red Cross  officials.    Russia will send observers from the Foreign Ministry and  State Committee on National Problems.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Letter: Psychology and City fraud Sir, In your leader, 'From fraud to farce' (July 17), you say, with reference to the Roskill report's recommendation of trying City fraud cases before a judge and expert lay assessors (rather than a traditional jury), that expert assessors, namely 'lawyers, accountants and City practitioners of one kind or another . . . ' would be less than human if they did not 'identify more closely with City people in the dock than a jury would be inclined to do'. I suggest, with respect, that this statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of human psychology. Expert assessors would, I am convinced, approach this task with a healthy wish to see the City's reputation upheld and enhanced, tempered (on breaches of a technical nature) by feelings of 'there for the grace of God . . .' Their judgment would not be confused by a plethora of facts and issues (to which they would be no strangers) nor by irrelevancies or special pleading. They would know what was right and what was wrong, identifying more closely with what was objectively right than with personalities. Test the issue this way: if you were a defendant in a City fraud case, would you (if given the choice) elect for trial by judge and traditional jury or by judge and expert assessors? Justice, speed, efficiency and cost-saving dictate that the latter should be imposed. I end as you did: 'The government should put the job in hand.'

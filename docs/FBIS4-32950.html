			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Santiago de Cuba correspondent Margarita Pecora] </F>   [Text] I can confirm with the conviction provided by facts  and without any triumphalism that economic recovery is in the  air in Santiago de Cuba. Approximately 500 leaders of this  territory's enterprises and organizations have been holding a  meeting on economic efficiency since this morning, chaired by  Esteban Lazo Hernandez, Politburo member and Cuban Communist  Party first secretary in the province.    Economic recovery is well under way. The shoe industry can  reaffirm its pledge to produce 1.8 million pairs of shoes this  year, while the metalworking enterprise expects to double its  production in the second half of the year and to provide new  lines of production -- such as bicycle spokes and nails -- as  well as to reap good dividends from the sale of screws.    We can add to this network of important industrial centers  food production, which will grow considerably compared to the  previous year in terms of flour and dairy products, the  production of a line of soy yogurts, and the production of  Cerelac supplement for the elderly.    The production of Santiago de Cuba's liquor and beverage  enterprise is also encouraging, since it solved acute problems  in the boilers, refrigerators, and filters and now intends to  increase beer production by approximately two million boxes, as  well as 3.7 million liters of rum, in addition to providing 55  tons of yeast for bread production in Santiago de Cuba and  Guantanamo Provinces.    To this we can add the mango crop, which will triple last  year's with a harvest estimated at 500,000 quintals. Lazo also  acknowledged that the production of tubers and vegetables in  Santiago de Cuba, although production plans are fulfilled every  year, remains the Achilles' heel of the province. This is why  he demanded more and better work to extract from the earth  everything it can yield despite the lack of appropriate  resources. He added that there can be no enterprise director  whose mind and soul is not pledged to the battle for economic  efficiency.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH PRESS OKS ETHICS CODE  </P> <P> Britain's national newspapers published a code of conduct today aimed at  reviving the battered public image of the press and heading off government  controls on reporting.  </P> <P> The five-point code, agreed upon by editors of up-market heavyweights and racy  tabloids alike, said intrusion into private lives must always be justified by  public interest.  </P> <P> In addition to the code, every paper pledged to set up a system to investigate  complaints.  </P> <P> The British press has been increasingly accused by both the public and the  government of intruding into privacy. Earlier this month an editor was fired  for printing front-page color pictures of Prince Charles' son, Prince William,  urinating in a park.  </P></p>

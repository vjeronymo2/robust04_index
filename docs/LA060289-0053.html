			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> In Australia, where the environment has become a major political issue, Prime  Minister Bob Hawke and his 4-year-old granddaughter will appear on a 90-minute  program Tuesday called "Climate in Crisis." On the program, Hawke says:  "Sophie's now 4. In the year 2000 she will be 15 -- not all that far from  adulthood, with her own dreams and aspirations. How successfully she and other  children can fulfill their goals depends increasingly on how we look after our  environment and how we best use this planet's natural resources." Saving the  country's rain forests and cleaning up beach pollution are among concerns of  conservationists down under. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

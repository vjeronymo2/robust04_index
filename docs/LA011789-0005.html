			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES MAYOR'S RACE  </P> <P> Commendations are in order for Yaroslavsky. According to The Times, he has  decided to withdraw from the mayoral campaign because of poll results showing  Mayor Tom Bradley's popularity.  </P> <P> The campaign would certainly have increased intergroup tensions in Los Angeles.  While I respect the councilman and the mayor and doubt that either one would  have tried to win by inflaming already threatening intergroup conflicts, I have  less confidence in the campaign "professionals" whose only motivation appears  to be to win, and to win at any cost.  </P> <P> My sincere thanks to the Honorable Zev Yaroslavsky.  </P> <P> DAVID P. MACPHERSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

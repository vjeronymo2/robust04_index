			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Plea for change at non-aligned talks PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia, opening the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) yesterday, warned that 'the new world order' had yet to change the 'old patterns of domination of the strong over the weak and rich over the poor'. He spoke of 'the absurdity of net financial resources now flowing from the developing world to the developed countries' and was supported by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary general of the United Nations, who described poverty as 'the last challenge we must take up at the close of the century'. Mr Suharto called for the 'revitalisation, restructuring and democratisation' of the UN. This received the tacit backing of Mr Boutros Ghali who told delegates 'the voice of the Third World, the voice of three quarters of men and women who live on this planet, must be represented, heard and understood'. Mr Boutros Ghali said NAM and the UN had 'produced a story of partnership and practical co-operation' but, in a review of his organisation, he noted many of its activities were focused on NAM member states. He estimated at 15,000 the military personnel under UN command in the former Yugoslavia - a founding member of NAM. Almost 2m refugees there were under UN care. The secretary general said the UN in Somalia was operating 'under conditions of military hostility' and planned to increase its forces from 500 to 3,500 to assist the famine relief effort. In Afghanistan, the UN is pressing for a cessation of hostilities and organising humanitarian aid, while in Cambodia it is engaged in 'a vast effort at post-conflict nation-building'. Mr Boutros Ghali said the end of the Cold War was 'a harbinger of concord and unity', but he warned 'the temptation to dominate, either worldwide or regionally, remains'.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Slovakia waits for the fruits of independence TWO months into independence, Slovakia is looking for foreign capital to revitalise one of the most distorted economies in the region. It is not an easy task. The break-up of the former Czechoslovak federal republic has already led to an unexpectedly sharp drop in trade between the hitherto economically intertwined republics. At the same time, European Community restrictions on steel exports have cut already dangerously low foreign currency earnings at a time when ties with the east have dwindled. A nationalist government with little experience of foreign relations and a bureaucracy trained in Soviet methods is hard pressed to come up with reliable statistics, let alone clear-cut policies designed to attract foreign investment. Inexperienced ministers are overworked and bogged down in detail as they grapple with complex regulatory, environmental and financial issues. It all seemed much simpler nine months ago when Mr Vladimir Meciar, leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), barnstormed this small country with a promise to restore Slovak pride and dignity after 1,000 years of foreign domination and 70 years as the junior partner in a federation with the more sophisticated and populous Czechs. What most Slovaks saw as a bid for greater autonomy within a looser confederal relationship with the Czechs was interpreted by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, as a bid for independence. Working on the principle that a quick divorce was better than a disputatious marriage, Mr Klaus insisted on rapid separation proceedings. But independence, formally achieved on January 1, found Slovakia facing high unemployment and the loss of an estimated Dollars 700m annual subsidy from the Czech lands. Under the circumstances it also found itself facing pressure for a devaluation which would further cut living standards of an electorate told earlier that independence would bring prosperity. The latest public opinion poll shows a sharp decline in the popularity of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister, who also faces internal dissention within the HZDS. Mr Meciar faces a challenge from Mr Milan Knazko, the popular former actor who is now the foreign minister, and pressure from opposition parties, especially the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDL), led by Mr Peter Weiss, which are demanding seats in a future coalition government. Mr Meciar, a former boxer who became a lawyer and critic of the former communist regime, remains the most powerful political personality. But an air of desperation is beginning to creep into his speeches. At a recent conference to attract international investors, he described Slovakia as 'a country at the centre of Europe but virtually unknown'. Slovakia needs support from the International Monetary Fund to reassure investors and unblock institutional capital inflows. But initial talks broke down in mid-February after the Slovaks refused to accept the IMF's suggestion to float the Slovak crown. Officially the Slovak crown remains on a par with the Czech crown. In practice the Czechs demand a 20 per cent discount when changing the Slovak currency, while the Slovaks, not to be outdone, insist on imposing a 10 per cent discount on the Czech currency. Foreigners meanwhile are billed in US dollars. Slovakia disputes the veracity of IMF statistics which, they claim, were prepared from information provided by Prague. Mr Julius Toth, the finance minister, says it would be absurd to devalue before even knowing the true trade and payments picture. But a clearer picture of the government's concern was revealed when importers asked when they would be allowed the foreign exchange required to pay for their imports. It transpired that, with little fanfare, the authorities have quietly blocked hard currency payments for undefined non-essential imports and are preparing 'temporary' import barriers to reduce strain on reserves. 'We are not looking for aid, but we must be able to increase our trade. If the west closes its markets and increases Slovakia's economic and social problems then the likelihood is that the present government, which is open to trade and investment, could be replaced by a much more left-wing government,' said Mr Lubomir Dolgos, the privatisation minister.</p>

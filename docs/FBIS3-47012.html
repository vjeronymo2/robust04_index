Officials said aichi made the remarks in talks with U.S.  Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who arrived Thursday for a  three-day visit.    Queried by Nunn on an upcoming review of Japan's national  defense program, Aichi was quoted as saying, "just because the  situation has changed, that does not mean (Japan's military  strength) should be drastically altered."    He said the strength of Japan's military is not intended to  correspond to any particular external threat.    Officials said Nunn, who is chairman of the Senate Armed  Services Committee, urged active Japanese commitment to United  Nations peacekeeping activities to help offset U.S. costs.    Nunn called peacekeeping an important aspect of U.S.-Japan  cooperation, they said.    Officials said Nunn also urged that Tokyo's host nation  support for U.S. Forces in Japan be more "flexibly" spent on  such things as repair of facilities.    Defense Facilities Administration Agency Head Ichiro  Yoneyama  replied that funds can be allocated under the existing framework  for such large-scale projects as repairs to runways.    Nunn and Lugar, who is a senior member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, will leave Tokyo on Saturday for South  Korea.</p>

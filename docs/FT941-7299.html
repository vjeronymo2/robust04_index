			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fax designed for public use For those who want to send a fax when at an airport, station, hotel or other public place, the French company Schlumberger has developed a terminal which accepts payment by plastic cards through an anti-vandal reader. Publifax costs FFr47,000 (Pounds 5,460) and has a telephone handset for voice communication. Schlumberger says it is the first to be purpose-designed for public use. The user lays the document on the surface at the bottom of the terminal. The scanner is several inches above, behind protection. This ensures documents cannot be lost and minimises the potential for vandalism. Schlumberger: France, 47 46 62 47</p>

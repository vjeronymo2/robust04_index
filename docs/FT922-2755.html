			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (7): Doubts over role for foreigners - Infrastructure: China faces energy crisis as economic growth fuels consumption AS reformers gain ascendancy the development of China's infrastructure has become of crucial importance if the moderates are to achieve their goal of sustained market-oriented economic growth. However, in spite of significant progress, the prospects for expanding and modernising the country's infrastructure remain clouded by financial difficulties, geography, bureaucracy, and continuing differences of opinion over how extensive a role foreign companies should be given in areas deemed vital to China's national security. The scale and nature of the problems can perhaps be found most starkly in three areas where slow progress could prove crippling for economic development: telecommunications, transportation, and energy. Under China's Eighth Five-Year plan, all three are deemed priority areas and receive the maximum resources the state can provide. Progress has been made in each area, yet all face significant challenges. ENERGY China faces a severe energy crunch, which has the potential to cripple the rest of the economy. China derives 75 per cent of its energy from coal, of which it is the world's largest producer. The remainder of the country's energy comes from hydro and nuclear power, wind, and oil. Of the energy that is coal-driven, 43 per cent is for industrial purposes, nearly half is split equally between electricity generation and residential and commercial use, while the remainder is needed for steel production and transportation. Last year's coal production was about 1.1bn tons and it is expected to be about 1.4bn tons in 1995. By 2000, China's output is projected to be about 2bn tons. By then, western experts forecast China will consume one half of the world's mined coal. In spite of this increase, China has an energy shortfall. Many factories work short weeks because of a lack of electricity, but the country's economic development is fuelling demand for even greater energy use. The only option China has to meet its energy needs is to increase coal production. Its dilemma is how to increase efficiency in mining and transportation, and to increase efficiency in combustion with minimum environmental impact. China's coal production has a serious environmental impact. Much of the coal has a high sulphur content which cannot be removed with simple methods such as washing. In the winter, a haze from coal-fired boilers hangs in the air. Inefficient use of coal stems partly from prices being set too low. The industry relies heavily on government subsidies and necessary investment is not made. Small price increases have not kept up with inflation. 'Sharp increases in coal prices could send too many waves through the economy', a western expert said. 'Too big a shock would push up the prices of all other goods and this could lead to unrest.' Among other resources, the most crucial is oil. Demand is lifted by economic growth. China produces approximately 2.7m barrels of crude a day, but growth has been virtually stagnant since 1989. China has had no significant discoveries in recent years. Questions are being raised about whether there is enough oil to support the economy. China exports 500,000 barrels a day, but western businessmen say that by 1995 it will not have enough to continue exporting. The government is attempting to increase production in three ways: it plans to open the East China sea to foreign exploration; secondary and tertiary recovery techniques from existing oil fields are being stepped up; and much effort is being put into developing the Tarim Basin in the western province of Xinjiang. Western oil executives say the Tarim Basin could equal the reserves found in some Middle Eastern oil fields. So far, China has not allowed any foreign equity participation in oil development and exploration in the area. But the country's economic growth and its nearly stagnating domestic oil production could compel the government to reconsider. 'China is starting to open the door a crack', a western executive said. 'They are back against a wall, but their national pride and politics get in the way'. TELECOMMUNICATIONS Because of the low density of telephones and the rise in living standards, demand for telephone services has soared. Residents in cities often wait two years and pay Yn3,000 to Yn5,000 to install a private telephone. The number of applicants increases annually by about 16 per cent, according to the official English-language newspaper China Daily. China has about 11m telephone lines, more than three times the number 10 years ago. Placing a call internationally to the US or Europe is easier than dialling domestically or to Hong Kong. There are more gateways, the exchange equipment which manages transmission paths internationally, in China's main cities. There are 1.92 telephones per 100 people, though in Beijing the figure is 13.5. The government is taking steps to increase capacity and is also improving communications in remote areas, particularly those with strong national minorities such as Xinjiang, inner Mongolia, and Tibet. Acute demand has been a boon for cellular telephones. Subscription for a portable telephone costs about Yn20,000. Even so, the market has taken off, particularly in prosperous Guangdong province. Beijing has ambitious plans to continue improving and expanding its telecommunications network. By 2000, the target telephone density is three per 100 people nationwide. About 10,000 km of optical fibre cables have been laid and there are plans to more than double that figure in the next five years, according to western businessmen. During the same period the government plans to add another 15m lines, of which nearly 12m will use computer switching. Nonetheless, severe problems remain. One of the most significant is Directive 56, an internal report issued by the State Council in 1988. It stipulated that China could form joint ventures with only three foreign companies - Siemens, Alcatel and NEC - to manufacture telecommunications switching equipment to sell to the Chinese market. Other companies were frozen out. The Chinese expressed concern about the development of too many software packages that would be potentially incompatible with the original three. China faces Cocom restrictions on the transfer of channel signalling, technology used to re-route calls on demand automatically around damaged circuitry. This can be useful in warfare and is relied upon in the west when natural disasters damage telephone lines. Developing physical transmission capacity and the intelligent software to manage it with limited financial resources therefore remains a challenge. According to a western businessman, the main problems have been managing investment priorities between switching and transmission and the degree to which China is willing to partner other technology suppliers. 'They want to do everything they can locally. They know they can do it faster if they import. But they have to determine how they can balance these two objectives'. TRANSPORT China is moving rapidly to eliminate bottlenecks in ports and railways. All the country's main ports - Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fujian, Ningbo, Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian - are carrying out large expansion programmes. Ningbo, near Shanghai, has the most extensive deep water port for handling container vessels in China. Although they lack the high throughputs and efficiency of Hong Kong or Singapore, China's ports are all fairly efficient and have eliminated the heavy port congestion and waiting times of the 1980s. Particularly efficient is the Tianjin free trade zone where cargo can be kept under bond until the importer pays for it. Tianjin has set up a joint venture with a Dutch freight forwarding company to clear customs and provide rail service direct to land-locked Mongolia. A priority in all ports is development of more container berths for handling coal and grain. Coal is transported across the country by rail and then on freighters down the coast to southern ports because it is too expensive to ship it by rail from the north. Modernisation of coal handling is crucial as much equipment is obsolete, causing significant loss and spillage. The Chinese have plans to develop further a port in the Tumen Basin near Vladivostok where economic activity is flourishing between Russia, North Korea, and China. The government's main goal, however, is to consolidate port projects begun in the 1980s and improve information, management, and costing systems rather than to build new ports. In contrast to the ports, the country's rail network is woefully inadequate and operates some of the most intensively used lines in the world. China is the third largest shipper of cargo per kilometre after the former Soviet Union and the US. Cargo and passenger traffic is growing at 9 per cent annually. The main focus is to continue to develop more rail lines to relieve coal bottlenecks, double-tracking and electrifying along the main north-south corridors from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai, and east to west from Zhejiang province to Changsha in Hunan province. Electrification is cheaper than using diesel fuel and the lines can carry more traffic.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Action by Names' opponents adds twist to saga The long-running High Court battle by hard-hit Lloyd's Names to win compensation for losses took a further twist yesterday when their opponents' lawyers said they would launch their own legal proceedings. The action is being taken by lawyers representing 'errors and omissions' insurers who provided negligence cover for the professional Lloyd's agencies being sued by Names' action groups. Earlier this month Gooda Walker Names won substantial damages for losses incurred between 1988 and 1990. E&amp;O insurers now want the High Court to clarify whether those Names, the individuals whose assets have historically supported the insurance market, should be allowed to take a large share of the funds available for paying damages - or whether some should be held back to pay awards won by other Names' action groups. They also want the court to rule whether compensation should include interest and whether E&amp;O insurers should help fund an interim payment. The latest move, which could involve more than 30 Names' action groups, means Gooda Walker Names are unlikely to receive even an interim payment until December or next year. However, their lawyers said resolving such issues could avoid problems later. Mr Philip Rocher of solicitors Wilde Sapte said: 'Our aim in this exercise is to prevent E&amp;O underwriters from raising myriad arguments as to why they should delay payment.' The level of compensation for Gooda Walker Names has yet to be agreed. The Names' estimate of Pounds 504m (which includes Pounds 71m in interest payments) is strongly disputed by the E&amp;O insurers. Lawyers representing the E&amp;O underwriters are expected to begin their proceedings formally next week. The case is likely to be heard in December.</p>

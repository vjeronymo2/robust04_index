This is the first Slovak  visit at the level of foreign minister to this country since the  division of Czechoslovakia.    Bulgarian National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov  paid  a working visit to Bratislava in April last year, Slovak  President Michal Kovac was on an informal visit to Bulgaria.  Having come for a holiday at the Black Sea in the summer of  1993, Mr. Kovac met President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov.  Some time before President Zhelev and President Kovac had talks  in Brussels where they attended the funeral of King Baudouin.    The separation of Slovakia and the Czech Republic gave rise  to certain problems of bilateral relations: The older  Bulgarian-Czechoslovak agreement should be either updated or a  new agreement should be signed, President Zhelev said after his  meeting with President Kovac in Sofia. Dr. Zhelev stressed that  "there are no political or any other obstacles to resolving the  problem rapidly and in the best possible way." Slovakia sees a  friend in Bulgaria and although we are not neighbours, we are  bound together by the Danube, our historic contacts and Slavdom,  now that the totalitarian regimes, we have a common goal:  Integration with the European structures, Slovakia's President  Michal Kovac told reporters at the time. "Slovakia believes  that Bulgaria is an important stabilizing factor in the Balkan  region," he stressed. We would like to have the status of  observers in the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, on the other  hand Slovakia is ready to support Bulgaria's participation in  different projects within the framework of the Central European  Initiative, Mr. Kovac said. Both sides expressed their desire  to create, at state level, prerequisites for the activation of  Bulgarian-Slovak relations in the field of economy, tourism and  culture, and to promote political cooperation at international  level. Mr. Kovac invited the Bulgarian president to pay an  official visit to Bratislava.    Bulgaria and Slovakia are planning to sign agreements on the  avoidance of double taxation, on encouragement and reciprocal  protection of investments, on culture and on trade. A Slovak  Cultural Centre was opened in Sofia in October 1993.    In November Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov  received Mr. Jozef Dravecky, charge d'affairs of Slovakia's  embassy in Sofia. According to the official statement, it is  the sides' shared opinion that there are very good prospects for  the development of cooperation between Bulgaria and Slovakia.    "Slovakia has great interest in the region. We want to  restore the level of our good contacts that existed before,"  Mrs. Vlasta Jonasieva of the Slovak Trade Ministry said in may  last year. The Bulgarian and Slovak experts share the opinion  that the volume of trade between Bulgaria and Slovakia in 1992,  amounting to $28 million, is awfully small. "Slovakia has not  lost its interest in Bulgaria," Mrs. Jonasivea said in an  interview for the Bulgarian Press.</p>

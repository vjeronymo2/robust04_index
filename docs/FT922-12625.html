			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Worried fishermen call summit over prawn glut GERMAN, DUTCH and Danish fishermen have called a summit meeting next month to discuss ways of coping with a glut of North Sea prawns piled up in cold stores. Good fishing and breeding conditions have led to the build-up of more than 2,500 tonnes of prawns in the three countries, according to Mr Hermann Kock, president of the Schleswig-Holstein prawn fishers' association. 'Wholesalers are not prepared to take any more,' he said yesterday. Prices have fallen to about DM2.40 (83p) a kilogram. His members, who between them operate 120 vessels, have already stopped fishing at weekends and are reducing their weekly catch by up to 50 tonnes. They are also planning to make long-term cuts and to switch some of their fishing effort to catching sole. The size of their boats and the unpredictability of the North Sea weather confines the fleet to shallow, inshore fisheries. The crisis meeting will be held on May 8 on the Danish island of Romo.</p>

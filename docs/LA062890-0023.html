Ferrand said detectives are investigating whether there was any  relationship between the residents, the victims or the suspects.  </P> <P> Evidence from the double slaying and information about the victims led  investigators to Rosales, Ferrand said. Rosales was charged with being an  accessory to murder and trafficking in narcotics, Ferrand said.  </P> <P> The victims were part of an Orange County drug ring and were killed in an  apparent drug rip-off scheme involving members of a Pacoima drug ring, Ferrand  said.  </P> <P> He declined to give further details.  </P> <P> He said investigators are unsure how many other suspects were involved in the  shooting.  </P></p>

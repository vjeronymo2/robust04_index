			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Producer price figures boost gains in shares - Market report Confidence that weakness in the US dollar will not provoke hasty action on US interest rates helped shares move ahead strongly in London yesterday. With British government bonds also very strong as the June producer price statistics confirmed that domestic inflation remains subdued, the stock market moved to within 8 points of the FT-SE 3,000 mark before closing off the top as Wall Street made a cautious start to its new trading session. At 2,983.8, the FT-SE Index was finally a net 21.4 up on the day, and gains across the broader range of the market lifted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 19.3 to 3,473.9. Trading volume was brisk, bearing out indications that retail, or genuine investment interest in UK equities, has recovered from the nervousness seen ahead of the G7 meeting in Naples last weekend. Equities opened cautiously behind the weaker trend in the US currency following comments from President Clinton as well as the widely-expected absence of any strong statement on the dollar from the G7 meeting. But shares soon responded to firmness in European bond markets. London was also encouraged by a shift towards optimism on gilt-edged securities by UK fund managers, disclosed in the latest survey of investment funds by Gallup for Smith New Court, the London investment house. Early gains were extended after UK producer prices for June, showing the lowest rise in output prices since 1967, were seen as convincing evidence that commodity price inflation has yet to reach manufacturing producers. The UK market reached the day's peak with a net gain of 30 points as it waited for Wall Street to show its response to the G7 meeting and the renewed slide in the dollar. Shares later came off the top as US Federal bonds eased and Wall Street failed to hold its early gain to show a fall of 9 Dow points in London trading hours. The UK market closed in confident mood, brushing off some concerns that this week's list of statistics on the US economy, beginning today with the producer price data, could still bring action from the Federal Reserve. Much of the upward impetus for share prices came from stock index futures as the big securities houses moved themselves on to the bull tack after nearly a fortnight of uncertainty regarding the outlook for the dollar and global interest rates. Consequently, the focus was on the Footsie listed stocks which are included in the baskets of shares making up the futures contracts. Of the 542.5m shares traded, around 47 per cent were Footsie-listed issues, and the remainder the non-Footsie stocks which drive the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. On Friday, retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.46bn, confirming the recovery in investment activity. The oil sector provided one of the few weak spots among the dollar-orientated issues, which were otherwise little affected by the selling of the US currency. Interest-related stocks attracted buyers, several leading building issues responding to optimism on rates in Germany. There were widespread gains across the broad range of UK manufacturing stocks, with engineering and vehicle industry shares to the fore. Retail stocks recovered poise on growing confidence that the recovery in the UK economy can be extended without causing inflation dangers.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Bond jailed for acting dishonestly A WESTERN Australian court yesterday sentenced Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt entrepreneur, to two-and-a-half years in prison for acting dishonestly during a ADollars 370m (Pounds 153m) corporate rescue five years ago. Mr Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, showed no emotion as he was sentenced by Judge Peter Blaxell in the Perth district court. Mrs Eileen Bond, his divorced wife, burst into tears as he was led away by police. Mr Bond was convicted on Thursday of dishonestly inducing Mr Brian Coppin, a Perth businessman, to subscribe to a rights issue during the rescue of Rothwells merchant bank after the 1987 global stock market crash. The court heard that Mr Bond concealed an agreement with Mr Laurie Connell, the chairman of Rothwells, that Bond Corp would receive a ADollars 16m success fee for helping to organise the rescue. Mr Bond denied that the agreement existed, and claimed he had no intention of misleading Mr Coppin. However, the jury accepted Mr Connell's evidence that Mr Bond had negotiated the fee. Mr Ian Callinan, defending, said Mr Bond had acted without premeditation at a time when he was suffering from jetlag and tiredness caused by the 'extraordinary circumstances' of the stock market crash. Judge Blaxell said it would be grossly unfair to make Mr Bond a scapegoat for the events surrounding the Rothwells rescue - which is the subject of a royal commission investigating alleged corruption and mismanagement. He also commended Mr Bond for the 'quiet dignity' he showed during the five-day trial. However, prison was the only appropriate penalty. Mr Bond, 54, was declared bankrupt last month with debts and contingent liabilities of ADollars 700m. He resigned as chairman of Bond Corp in September 1990, two days before the group announced a record loss of ADollars 2.2bn. Mr Bond is under investigation by the Australian Securities Commission, the federal corporate watchdog, and has figured in other inquiries into corporate behaviour. Charges are outstanding against several other former entrepreneurs, including Mr Connell and Mr Christopher Skase, former chairman of Qintex Australia.</p>

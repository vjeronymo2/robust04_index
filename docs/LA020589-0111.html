			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush and his top advisers discussed the savings and loan crisis but  the President made no decisions, the White House said. The advisers --  including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Budget Director Richard G.  Darman and Chief of Staff John H. Sununu -- traveled to the presidential  retreat at Camp David, Md., and conferred with the President for 3 1/2 hours,  said B. Jay Cooper, a presidential spokesman. Federal Reserve Board Chairman  Alan Greenspan joined the group for lunch. Among the proposals that were to  have been discussed were plans to raise $54 billion over three years through  financing arrangements based on boosting deposit insurance premiums paid by  institutions, according to the New York Times. The plan would call for banks to  pay 18 cents in insurance premiums for every $100 in deposits, while savings  and loans would pay 25 cents per $100, the paper said. Banks now pay 8 cents,  while S&amp;Ls pay 21 cents.  </P></p>

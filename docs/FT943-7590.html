			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Investors are shrugging off the good news - London The mood of the stock market appears likely to remain gloomy this week, surprisingly so in view of the relatively favourable news on UK inflation and interest rate prospects. While welcoming the reduction in base rate fears inspired by the UK July retail sales numbers and also the Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged, market analysts appear to be whispering, under their breath, 'but don't you believe it.' 'Unfortunately . . .', says Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney; itself an interesting opening to a commentary on the latest fall in UK inflation rate. His thesis that the best news for the market would be a rise in base rates, indicating that the UK Treasury, like the US Federal Reserve, intends to be pro-active on inflation, is echoed by several other market analysts. At Nomura Research, Nick Knight, the notable bear of the UK market, contrasts the latest inflation reports with signs that investors are beginning to move against the interest rate sensitive share sectors. His research indicates downward pressure on building material stocks which together with stores, brewers, motors and textiles are regular losers from rate rises or the threat of them. He repeats the argument that if, as is probable, the UK chancellor is even more unwilling to raise rates following the July retail sales figures, then this is 'ultimately bearish' in terms of the rate rise which will eventually be proved necessary. There's no news like bad news, especially if it looks like good news, apparently. Nor do the market technicians provide much comfort. Derivative Securities says its readings of the Footsie Index track continue to show that the market is overbought and, with the Bank of England still evidently wanting the next base rate move to be upwards, the medium-term direction (of the Footsie) is expected to be downwards. The market's unwillingness to make further progress is casting a shadow across the merchant banking sector, where fortunes are closely tied to that of the securities industry. NatWest Securities sees these banks struggling to repeat the 1993 performance when the shares outperformed the market by 47 per cent. NatWest sees the sector return on equity falling to 14.8 per cent in 1994-1995, compared with a record 18.2 per cent last year and an eight-year average of 12.5 per cent. It believes that the quality as well as quantity of earnings in the sector is deteriorating and that only SG Warburg is 'correctly' positioning itself to generate adequate earnings growth.</p>

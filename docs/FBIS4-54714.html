			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 3 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP), supporting the government, insists that parliament  discuss the cabinet's economic and social policy together with  the report of the National Bank, said BSP Executive Committee  member Doncho Konakchiev at a press conference today. According  to him, within the next few days Prime Minister Lyuben Berov  will propose concrete personnel and structural changes in the  cabinet. The premier announced his intentions to make changes  in the cabinet last Wednesday [27 April] in a declaration before  parliament.    We are in touch with Prime Minister Berov and we hope he  will  keep his promises -- to restore dialogue with the trade unions,  to make cost-of-living adjustments, to consolidate the foreign  exchange and financial market, and strengthen national security,  Mr. Konakchiev said.    The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) will  consider  its next steps at the end of parliamentary Easter recess, when  the future of Lyuben Berov's Cabinet will become clearer, the  top leadership of the coalition decided at its regular session  today. Within a week the parties in the SDS will make proposals  how to provoke the resignation of the cabinet and early  parliamentary elections.    The government has come under serious trade union pressure.  If Prime Minister Berov starts structural reforms without  parliament's support, the Confederation of Independent Trade  Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) will block them, KNSB leader Prof.  Krustyu Petkov said at a briefing today. The KNSB has called a  warning general strike for tomorrow as part of the preparations  for its general strike scheduled to start on May 17. The local  structures of the other major trade union amalgamation --  Podkrepa -- will also take part in protest actions. The trade  unions demand cost-of-living adjustment of the incomes of the  population after prices doubled in two months with the steep  slide of the lev against the U.S. dollar and the introduction of  value-added tax on April 1. Prof. Krustyu Petkov said today  that he expects 934 enterprises with over 200,000 workers to  take part in the warning strike.    The KNSB also demands the coordination and adoption of a  state policy for stabilizing the foreign exchange market,  clarity on the protection of Bulgarian producers, and  transparency regarding the obligations undertaken by Bulgaria to  the international institutions. In a letter to Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov European Confederation of Trade Unions Secretary  General Emilio Gabaglo expressed support for the KNSB. Mr.  Gabaglo has sent his personal adviser Peter Seideneck to observe  the observation of the rights of the strikers during the warning  strike.    This morning Prime Minister Lyuben Berov assured Prof.  Petkov  over the phone of his readiness to start negotiations on May 11  and to personally head the delegation of the government (on  which the KNSB insisted). This was announced today by the  leader of the confederation. "However, the beginning of  negotiations does not mean stopping strike actions," Prof.  Petkov said. In an interview for today's issue of the PARI  financial news daily, Prof. Petkov says that Prime Minister  Berov is ready to make maximum compromises in order to reach an  agreement. However, according to the KNSB leader, the stands of  the Prime Minister and the KNSB on protecting the savings of the  population and local production are diametrically opposed.</p>

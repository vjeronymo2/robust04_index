			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: THE TALE OF A DOUBLE STANDARD;  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: HOW THE MEDIA COVER -- AND FAIL TO COVER -- THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS  THE SUBJECT OF AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE IN THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE.  </P> <P> At least three times recently, young black people have attacked news reporters,  photographers or cameramen covering events in predominantly black communities.  Black politicians -- including Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry and Jesse  Jackson -- lash out at the media for an alleged double standard. Polls show  black mayors think papers do a lousy job of covering the black community, and  many black media professionals agree.  </P> <P> So what has happened since the days of the Civil Rights struggle, when the  media and the black community were "de facto allies against Jim Crow?" In the  July/August The American Enterprise, National Public Radio reporter and UC  Berkeley journalism professor William J. Drummond presents a number of  interesting explanations for the "complete about-face of prevailing sentiment"  toward the media.  </P> <P> Black politicians, he writes, "no longer enjoy the shield of moral leadership  once accorded them by the civil rights movement. They must take their lumps  from the press like other politicians, and they find this an unwelcome  surprise."  </P> <P> At the same time, though, Drummond suggests, there is a tendency for the media  to ignore black politicians on issues other than those directly related to  their race. All of which is complicated by the fact that minority journalists  assert their rights as professionals to cover any issue they choose. As a  result, the reporters who presumably have the greatest insight into and empathy  for the black community don't want to be pigeonholed into covering it -- not  that the number of black journalists is even remotely representative of the  population.  </P> <P> So, where does that leave us?  </P> <P> About where we were after the race riots of the mid-to-late '60s, when  President Johnson's Kerner Commission warned that the media "have not  communicated to whites a feeling for the difficulties and frustrations of being  a Negro in the United States."  </P> <P> If Drummond's excellent analysis has a weakness, it's in his inability to  reconcile two conflicting matters. On the one hand, he cites the growing demand  that the white-dominated media stop focusing so intently on the misleading  stereotypes of "black pathology": drug addiction, crime and the like. On the  other hand, he and others complain about the unwillingness of the media to shed  light on the problems faced by black America. Hence the frustrating  observation: "There is black pathology, but it is given more attention than  white pathology, and it is less understood."  </P> <P> Part of the problem may simply be, as he writes, that "some of the black anger  at the media must be anger at the news itself. The news for black America is  not good."  </P> <P> The underlying criticism in his piece, never explicitly stated, seems to be  that the media do a lousy job of covering almost any historically and  culturally complex issue or community, regardless of race, creed or color.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REQUIRED READING  </P> <P> * Japan may be the world's leading joho shakai ("information society"), and its  johoshi ("information magazines") are one way the Japanese get their  minute-by-minute information fix. The August Egg examines Trendy, Box, Quark,  Pumpkin, Lettuce Club, McSister, and others that fill Japanese newsstands,  offering "an extended, open-ended set of instructions for life." More than a  look at magazines, this is an excellent study of where Japanese and American  culture coincides and collides.  </P> <P> * First there was the "Mommy Track." Then the "Daddy Track." Now, the July 16  Newsweek tells us there's the "Daughter Track." Readers who can overcome their  natural aversion to overly catchy news weekly trend labels will find an  important examination of women's demanding role as double caretakers, first of  their kids and then of their ill and aging parents.  </P> <P> * Next year, construction begins on the Westside for a bicycle freeway. If the  folks at Bicycle Magazine had their way, the city would turn that two-mile  stretch over to automobiles and reserve the rest of L.A.'s hundreds of miles of  freeway for bicycles. The August issue offers dozens of suggestions on how to  make bicycle commuting more appealing until that freeway shift happens. The  piece is aptly titled: "How the Bike Can Save L.A."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW ON NEWSSTANDS  </P> <P> * In the old days, Rolling Stone was the cream of the rock rag crop and Creem  was a sort of low-fat imitator. Now Creem is back as a large format bimonthly,  looking a lot hipper than today's Stone -- which means it devotes itself to the  surviving stars of the late '70s and early '80s rather than those of the '60s  and Hollywood celebrities. (Judging from the first issue, it completely skips  the socially redeeming stuff Stone still does so well.)  </P> <P> With big pictures and -- for the most part -- mere snatches of prose, the  magazine seems to be catering to the shortened attention-span syndrome. But  enough of the pictures are striking and enough of the prose is fun that it  works. (Creem, $12, P.O. Box 3795, Jacksonville, FL 32206).  </P></p>

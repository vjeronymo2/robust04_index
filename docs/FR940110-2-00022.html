			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to ESP transactions, petitioners state that the preliminary margin program incorrectly deducted all HM commissions from HM price and all U.S. commissions from USP. Petitioners state that commissions should be deducted from both home market price and U.S. price only with respect to ESP comparisons that include a commission in both transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCM responds that the special rule governing commission offsets does not require that commissions be paid on every sale in both markets. Rather, TCM contends that this rule applies only when no commissions are paid on any sales in one of the markets under consideration. Because TCM pays commissions on certain sales in both markets, TCM concludes that the Department should continue to treat commissions as direct selling expenses in both the U.S. and home markets, and thereby not employ the offset rule in comparisons in which commissions are incurred in only one transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Petitioners' assertion that TCM failed to report U.S. ISE on PP transactions is incorrect. For the final results, we modified our PP computer program to deduct HM commissions from FMV and then offset them by adding U.S. ISE up to the amount of the HM commissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to ESP sales, we agree with petitioners to the extent that the mere existence of commissions on some sales in both markets does not automatically preclude the use of the offset rule. Our standard practice requires that for comparisons involving ESP for which a commission is incurred in both markets, we deduct the U.S. commission from ESP and the HM commission from FMV. For comparisons in which there is a commission paid in one market and none in the other market, we offset the commission with ISE incurred in the other market, to the extent of the lesser of the commission in the one market or the ISE in the other. In order to follow this standard practice, we have modified our ESP computer program for the final results because, in our preliminary results calculations, we did not offset the commission with ISE for comparisons in which a commission was paid in one market and not in the other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Petitioners contend that TCM's HM commission sales are outside the ordinary course of trade because they were unusual and infrequent, as stated by TCM in its June 24, 1991 questionnaire response. Petitioners argue that the Department should accordingly exclude TCM's HM commission sales from FMV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We disagree that TCM's HM commission sales are outside the ordinary course of trade. TCM paid commissions to both related and unrelated dealers on TCM's sales to end-users. Although sales to end-users constitute a very small portion of TCM's HM sales, and are included as comparison models, these end-users are TCM's usual commercial customers. As a result, we consider them to be in the ordinary course of trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Petitioners contend that HM transactions that have shipment dates prior to March 1, 1989 are not within the relevant reporting period (March 1, 1989 to July 31, 1990) and therefore should be disregarded for comparison purposes. Petitioners note that the questionnaire states that ``[t]here can be no new dates of sale after shipment and any subsequent price modifications must be reported as either a rebate or a discount.'' Petitioners further contend that TCM's response supports the use of shipment date as the appropriate date of sale, because it states that the date of sale is equivalent to the estimated date of receipt by the customer. In the interests of consistency, petitioners also suggest matching U.S. sales to HM sales on the basis of shipment dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, TCM argues that the date of sale, rather than the date of shipment, determines the reporting period for HM sales. TCM further argues that, in accordance with Department practice, TCM reported as the date of sale the date on which the parties were bound by the terms of sales. Because TCM followed the Department's requirements in determining dates of sale and reporting HM sales, and because the Department did not request from TCM additional information regarding sale dates, TCM concludes that the Department should not revise its reporting requirements for HM dates of sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's Position <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We agree with petitioners. Any given sale cannot have a date of sale later than the date of shipment to the customer. Any adjustments to price or quantity that take place after the date of shipment must be reported as discounts or rebates, in the case of changes in price, or quantity adjustments in the case of changes in quantity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have therefore used the HM date of shipment as the date of sale instead of the date of delivery, which TCM reported as the date of sale. We analyzed these HM shipment dates in order to determine whether they met our criterion for contemporaneity with regard to matching to the U.S. sale dates. We found that all but two of TCM's proposed matches were suitably contemporaneous, and that these transactions were only used for matching with two ESP sales. We assigned these two sales the weighted-average dumping margin calculated for ESP sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Petitioners claim that TCM failed to include the G&amp;A expenses of one of its related subsidiaries, C. Itoh Industrial Machinery Inc. (CIM). Petitioners state that TCM calculated a G&amp;A factor for U.S. ISE but failed to apply this factor to the selling price and, therefore, did not include an amount for the G&amp;A portion of U.S. selling expenses in its reported sale-by-sale ISE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

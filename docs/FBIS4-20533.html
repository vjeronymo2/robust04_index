			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Daimler Wants To Become Controlling Shareholder </F> of Cap Gemini Sogeti"]    [Text] Daimler Benz just can't get enough of Cap Gemini  Sogeti [CGS], at least to judge by what executives of the German  colossus in Stuttgart are saying. Since July 1991, Daimler Benz,  as a partner of the French computer services group, has held a  34 percent interest in Sogeti, which is CGS's holding company.  But now, by converting a stockholder loan into shares and by  exercising, in a new stock issue, the subscription rights it  obtained as part of the partnership accord negotiated between  the two groups, it has the chance to acquire a controlling  majority of CGS as of 1 February 1995.    Though all this is still a year ahead, rumors are already  flying. Last week the rumor mill was stirred up again by  publication of CGS's earnings statement for 1993, which showed a  loss of 434 million [French] francs. Daimler Benz attitude  toward CGS is unambiguous, according to sources at the company's  Stuttgart headquarters. The group says it does not want to  withdraw from the French company but rather is looking for a  partner that will help out on capital acquisition but allow it  to operate the French concern. Daimler Benz says it will  entertain offers from any potential partner. Matra and France  Telecom are among the names being mentioned. If unsuccessful in  its quest for an ally, Daimler Benz will decide next year  whether or not to exercise its option to acquire a 51 percent  interest.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Britain reassesses its Bosnian peace role The British government is re-assessing its role in the United Nations peacekeeping effort in Bosnia, amid fears that failure of the latest peace plan - a territorial division of the region - could trigger a re-escalation of the conflict. Ministers have raised the possibility that the 3,000 British troops in Bosnia may have to be withdrawn later this year if the plan unveiled in Geneva this week is rejected by the warring Serbs and Moslems. The Ministry of Defence is expected to prepare detailed contingency plans against such an eventuality. The reassessment follows a warning to cabinet colleagues from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that a rejection of the proposed settlement by one of the two sides would lead to a gradual breakdown of the present ceasefire. A subsequent end to the UN arms embargo would also raise the threat of much more generalised Balkans war, with the conflict spreading to neighbouring Kosovo and Macedonia. Amid renewed tension between London and Washington, Mr Hurd believes it may well be impossible to prevent the US from lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian government if the Serbs reject the latest settlement. Despite the recognition in London that President Bill Clinton would face irresistible Congressional pressure to lift the ban on weapons sales, the UK government remains convinced that such a move could provoke a massive escalation in the conflict. It fears the resumption of arms supplies to the Bosnian Moslems would undercut decisively the neutrality of the UN forces. Facing the risk of attacks by the Serbs, Britain and France would have no alternative but to withdraw. Nevertheless, Bosnian Moslem leaders yesterday said they would endorse the plan, presented on Wednesday in Geneva, for Bosnia's partition, despite its drawbacks. The go-ahead from Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Mr Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the Moslem-Croat federation, virtually assures that their parliament will back the proposed maps. Mr Izetbegovic said: 'The positive element is that the state of Bosnia-Hercegovina will be preserved.' The maps create two mini-states, giving 51 per cent of Bosnia to the new federation and 49 per cent to the Serbs, who now control 70 per cent. The plan was presented by the five-nation contact group, composed of diplomats from the US, Russia, Germany, France, and the UK. Both sides must decide on what they call the 'last-chance' peace plan by July 19. In an apparent shift of tactics, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, softened his criticism. He said that his assembly's vote hinged on the constitutional plan rather than the territorial division. Earlier he sought to rupture the fragile unity in the contact group by denouncing the plan as an 'American dictate'. Serb leaders have exploited international divisions in the conviction that this will silence demands to reverse their military gains. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (g) of this section is also revised to reflect the 1988 Amendment to section 236 of the Act which added remedial education as being approvable as classroom training. Training designed to enhance the employability of individuals by upgrading basic skills, through remedial education or English-as-second-language courses, are considered as remedial education approvable under &sect;617.22(a) if all the approval criteria in that section are met. A training program of remedial education only may now be approved for an individual if he or she possesses occupational skills and needs only remedial education to obtain employment. Ordinarily, remedial education is made part of a broader skills training program as defined in &sect;617.22(f) (3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Revision of &sect;617.22(a)(5) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 617.22(a) lists six criteria that must be met for approval of training. These are intended to assure that training will lead to a specific occupational goal. Clause (5) of &sect;617.22(a) deals with a worker's personal qualifications to undertake and complete such training. The Department's interpretation of this clause has been changed to add ``financial resources'' to those personal qualifications, and this change is included in amended &sect;617.22(a)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change 3 to GAL 15&hyph;90, dated July 17, 1991, (56 FR 46331, 46333), announced a change in the definition of the criterion for approval of training in Section 236(a)(1) (E) of the Act, by adding ``financial resources'' to the existing physical and mental qualifications which must be reviewed in making a determination that a worker is able to undertake and complete training, as set out for criterion (E) in Section G.1. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 and incorporated in this final rule. This change was made to enhance the worker's ability to complete training by stressing that the duration of approved training should be commensurate with the worker's financial resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Training may be approved for a duration not to exceed 104 weeks under a single certification, as limited in amended &sect;617.22(f)(2). However, combined UI and TRA entitlement is available to workers for a maximum of 78 weeks. When the duration of training exceeds the remaining weeks of UI and TRA payments, a worker's income support may end or be substantially reduced before completing the approved training program. This situation often results in workers dropping out of training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amended &sect;617.22(a)(5) will require State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff to explain to workers seeking approval of training in which the duration of training exceeds their remaining weeks of UI and TRA payments, that in the absence of other financial resources such training may not be appropriate. When the worker's financial resources are not commensurate with a training program suitable to the worker, the training requirement may be waived under &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Revision of &sect;617.22(f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An individual who satisfies the six criteria for approval of training in &sect;617.22(a) may be enrolled in a training program that does not exceed 104 weeks in length. (See &sect;617.22(f)(2).) Inquiries were received on whether an individual may pursue more than one training program under a single certification or whether training under a certification is limited by the 104-weeks time provision. To eliminate any uncertainty on this matter, clause (2) on length of training has been revised to state more clearly that the maximum duration for any approvable training program is 104 weeks and no individual shall be entitled to more than one training program under a single certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of part 617, a new clause (3) is added to &sect;617.22(f), which provides a definition for a ``training program''. Subclause (i) of clause (3) provides that a training program may consist of a single course or a group of courses designed and approved by the State agency for an individual to meet a specific occupational goal. Subclause (ii) of clause (3) authorizes State agencies to amend an individual's approved training program, when the duration of training is less than 104 weeks, to add a course or courses designed to satisfy unforeseen needs, such as the need for remedial education or specific occupational skills. However, the amended training program may not exceed the 104-week time limitation in clause (2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clause (4), previously clause (3), is amended to clarify that the hours in a day and the days in a week an individual attends an approved training program must be full time commensurate with the standards of the training facility. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that hours of training per week and length of the training program are scheduled in a manner that the individual will develop the skills needed to achieve a specific occupational goal in a reasonable time period and at a reasonable cost. Any week in which training is less than full time will still count as a full week for the purposes of the 104-week limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. Revision of &sect;617.26 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 617.26, entitled ``Approval of other training including interstate,'' was not among the sections of regulations proposed to be amended in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988. However, rethinking occasioned by the 1988 Amendments led to the conclusion that there is a need to clarify, and in some respects alter, the roles and responsibilities of liable States and agent States in the administration of the TAA program. Among the OTCA amendments that caused such rethinking were those making training an entitlement and an eligibility requirement for basic TRA, and the provisions of amended section 231(c) on training waivers. In addition, comments received on related sections of the proposed regulations were considered in reaching this conclusion. The redescription of liable State and agent State roles and responsibilities was announced in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90, which was published at 56 FR 46331, 46332.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present &sect;617.26, written in 1975, provides that the agent State shall be responsible for the selection and approval of training, and will pay any training related costs, and that the liable State is responsible for determining eligibility for TRA, job search and relocation allowances, and may approve and purchase training provided that certain conditions are met. Although the respective roles of the liable and agent States were spelled out, the section was silent on the legal relationships and the appellate authority in the case of determinations made by the agent State. In addition, there were some overlapping responsibilities relative to training approval and payment of training costs. The regulations as revised in this document address these issues and, in general, deal more comprehensively with the roles and responsibilities of liable and agent States in administering the TAA program. Accordingly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.26 is retitled ``Liable and agent State responsibilities'' and the roles of liable and agent States are delineated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

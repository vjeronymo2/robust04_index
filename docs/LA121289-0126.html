			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. THEATERALTERNATIVE REPERTORY CONJURES UP 'A CHRISTMAS MEMORY' REAL AS LIFE  </P> <P> Most theater in Orange County, like most theater anywhere, is based on the art  of illusion. The players make the audience believe, to a greater or lesser  degree, that what it is seeing on stage is somehow real. This holds true across  the entire theatrical spectrum, from William Shakespeare to Neil Simon.  </P> <P> Such an illusional art almost always requires the technical support of scene  designers and costume-makers, lighting engineers and sound technicians. And yet  this conspiracy of make-believe need not depend on anything more elaborate than  a bare space to succeed, so long as the players are able to transform mere  words and gestures into feeling. It takes a certain talent for that, of course,  but also a conviction that transmutes emotion into art.  </P> <P> Until now, the Alternative Repertory Theatre has had a struggle to achieve this  sort of effect. The storefront troupe time and again has conjured an atmosphere  of make-believe only to fall short of a more solid result. Valiant players have  pretended with all their might, as though effort could substitute for  conviction.  </P> <P> But it is a pleasure at last to report that ART has come into its own, with a  staged reading of Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory." This graceful, intimate  offering rings as true as life itself and ought not to be missed. Beautifully  played on an empty stage by Barbara Sorenson and Lee Clark, it caps a heartfelt  evening of Christmas tales.  </P> <P> The duo's performance also represents a giant stride toward maturity for a 2  1/2-year-old company still learning to balance artistic strengths against  weaknesses in a tiny playing space where false notes are magnified and easily  detected. Under Joel T. Cotter's skillful direction, Sorenson and Clark take us  straight to a country kitchen in the rural South without need of anything  except their own delicate and unadorned acting.  </P> <P> They draw us into Capote's reminiscence about his boyhood friendship with a  cousin in her 60s no less imaginatively than a full-blown production could.  Theirs is make-believe of a high order, so richly textured and vivid that you  forget they are merely enacting a narrative. You can taste the whiskey-laced  fruitcakes that Capote's cousin makes for Christmas, and feel the tug of that  "lost pair of kites hurrying toward heaven."  </P> <P> As a prelude to "A Christmas Memory," other members of the ART ensemble --  garbed in sweaters and scarfs and seated on stools -- read a nicely paced  selection of five other seasonal stories ranging from the traditional (Charles  Dickens and O. Henry) to the offbeat (Jonathan Winters and Steve Martin). The  anthology is amusing, unpretentious and imbued with warmth.  </P> <P> That ART regards this presentation of readings as a casual production, not to  be rated alongside its more ambitious efforts, is understandable. However, the  care that has gone into this charming evening is evident, and the payoff large.  </P> <P> "A CHRISTMAS MEMORY" AND OTHER TALES OF CHRISTMAS'  </P> <P> A production of the Alternative Repertory Theatre.

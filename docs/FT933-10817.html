			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / People: Erith turns non-executive Bob Erith, who in his heyday was the star stockmarket analyst of the building industry, has decided to bow out of broking and take on the non-executive chairmanship of Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management, a Pounds 4bn private client fund manager. Erith, who turns 55 this year, has worked for the same firm, albeit under different owners, for 27 years and feels that the time is right to make the transformation from being a busy executive to a professional non-executive. Most of his City career has been spent at Savory Milln which was absorbed by Swiss Bank Corporation in 1990. In order to take up his new job he will retire as chairman of the equities group of Swiss Bank Corporation but will remain a consultant. His move to Capel-Cure Myers, which has been without a chairman for some time, appears to have resulted from a chance encounter between a Swiss Bank Corp executive and a member of Canadian Insurance Group, CCM's majority shareholder, at a dinner in Toronto. The Canadians were looking for a chairman and Erith's name was mentioned. John Henderson, CCM's chief executive, said that he had not known Erith before the appointment was made. With 22 offices and 460 staff, CCM has remained profitable under various owners and has built a reputation specialising in private clients, unit trusts pensions and insurance funds. A few years ago when a former Canadian parent ran into problems there was speculation that CCM might be sold. Canadian Insurance Group, which is now the majority shareholder, has indicated to CCM chief executive John Henderson that it is not seeking a buyer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alberto Pepe Leira] </F>   [Text] Montevideo, 7 Apr (EFE) -- The Common Market of the  South (Mercosur)'s progress toward a projected common tariff  system as of 1995 has encountered new stumbling blocks in the  past few weeks following Argentina's and Brazil's intransigence  in recognizing Uruguay's free trade zones, sources involved in  the negotiations have said.    The Brazilian delegation, within working subgroup No. 7,  expressed the Brazilian Government's decision of "not yielding  on this issue" because its interests "are non-negotiable."    Mercosur also has run into other difficulties in its  integration march, like the establishment of a common foreign  tariff for third-country imports, an issue that remains unsolved  after one year of negotiations.    The fast development of free trade zones in Uruguayan  territory, which has attracted many investors from  industrialized countries, has become an issue of constant  concern, especially for Brazil, which fears the competition of  East Asian countries within Mercosur's borders.    The latest negotiations have been suspended, hoping for "a  high-level political decision" to shed light on this problem.    This issue now must be directly resolved by the presidents  of  Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, who in January  postponed their decision on the common tariff system.    In the Uruguayan city of Colonia, the presidents on 26  January committed themselves to establishing a tariff before  July, after ordering a number of additional technical  negotiations.    The free trade zone issue also must be resolved in July.    Concerning these two controversial issues, the main Mercosur  partners have taken different sides.    While Argentine, along with Uruguay and Paraguay, promotes a  low tariff to avoid dependence on Brazilian technology, the  Brazilian Government pursues the idea of protecting industries  and endorses a high tariff that will make imports from third  countries less competitive.    Concerning the free trade zone problem, Argentina and Brazil  have allied themselves and are forming a common front against  their weakest partners: Uruguay and Paraguay.    The uncertain situation involving the future of Mercosur's  free trade zones has had international repercussions and  negative reports for investors are circulating in the developed  nations.    The Uruguayan newspaper EL TELEGRAFO, published in the city  of Paysandu, 380 km northwest of Montevideo, publishes today an  "exclusive report" drawn up by a Rotterdam consulting group.  This "exclusive report" reviews the services potential in the  River Plate basin.    The report notes: "Despite the substantial incentives and  benefits that the free trade zones offer to foreign investors,  there are certain uncertainties regarding their future."    The report notes that it would not be positive for capital  outside Mercosur to introduce raw materials from other nations  and industrialize them in the regional free trade zones.    According to EL TELEGRAFO, the Brazilians do not accept  these  products because "they would destroy Brazilian industry at the  root of their business within Mercosur."    Pursuant to this new reality, Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu  has told Uruguayan journalists that his country "will defend its  free trade zones at any cost."</p>

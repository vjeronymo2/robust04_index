			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, April, 10, IRNA -- Iran and Italy are now  engaged in financial negotiations focusing on rescheduling  Iran's debts to Italian firms, Iran's ambassador here, Majid  Hedayat-Zadeh Razawi said Saturday [9 April].    Razawi told IRNA that Italy is Iran's third largest trade  partner and Iran is Italy's third largest supplier of crude oil  with trade between the two countries standing at drls. 3 billion  annually.    The issue can be settled if Italian creditor companies agree  to reschedule the debts owed by Iran to them in a way that Iran  can pay off its debts in a four year period starting two years  after such an agreement is reached, he said.    "As a matter of fact, no figure has been mentioned in the  negotiations or in a letter of understanding inked by the two  countries.... What is important is the topic of discussion and  an overall agreement," he said.</p>

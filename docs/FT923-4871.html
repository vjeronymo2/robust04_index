			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / American poverty on the rise THE number of Americans living below the poverty line soared last year to its highest level since President Lyndon Johnson launched his War on Poverty in 1965. The US Census Bureau reported yesterday that 35.7m people were living below the level it defines as poor - an income of Dollars 13,924 for a family of four, or Dollars 6,932 for someone living alone - compared with 33.6m in 1990. In addition, Census Bureau economists said that the wealthiest 20 per cent of families had incomes averaging 8.4 times the poverty level, compared with a ratio of 6.1 per cent 25 years ago. The new Census Bureau figures place 14.2 per cent of the population below the poverty line, up from 13.5 per cent in 1990 and 12.8 per cent in 1989, but lower than in 1982-1984, during the last US recession. Earlier this week, the Commerce Department announced that personal incomes last year failed to keep pace with inflation for the first time in nine years. Average personal pre-tax incomes rose by 2.4 per cent, to Dollars 19,092, compared with consumer price inflation of 4.2 per cent. Census Bureau statistics show that 40 per cent of adults defined as poor worked, and 9 per cent of them held full-time, year-round jobs. Nearly three-quarters received public assistance in some form, and 29 per cent had no medical insurance. Poverty was most pervasive in the south, where 16 per cent of the population were counted as poor. The poverty rate reached 14.3 per cent in the west, 13.2 per cent in the mid-west and 12.2 per cent in the north-east.</p>

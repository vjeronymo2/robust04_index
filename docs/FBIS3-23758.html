			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Isayev: "Have We Elected the Wrong People </F> Again?"]    [Text] Only 10 percent of St. Petersburg's residents are  fairly well pleased with the current makeup of the State Duma.  Furthermore, those who did not take part in electing its members  are even less satisfied with them. It would seem that they have  no cause to complain: they got the individuals for whom they  voted. But in our opinion that is too superficial an  explanation. Without going into the issue in detail here, let us  simply note the following: if the election were held right now  only 75 percent of those who went to the polls on 12 December  would vote the same way again, 14 percent would vote  differently, and 11 percent are unsure how they would vote now.    All things change, but we are going to have to travel with  the current Russian parliament for quite some time and in an  unknown direction. In light of that St. Petersburg residents'  assessment of the election success of one of the Duma's key  players -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- is very curious. Of all  voters in St. Petersburg only 9 percent are of the opinion that  his success event will help improve the state of affairs in  Russia. The same percentage is also found among those who  actually voted. Yet their numbers should be significantly larger  (recall that the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia won 17  percent of the vote in St. Petersburg). Can it be that these  people are now free of his spell?    At this time it is difficult to answer that question. We are  still seeing the phenomenon of respondents' cunning evasion of  answers to direct questions such as: "Did you personally vote  for Zhirinovskiy?" As this phenomenon was first detected during  pre-election polls of public opinion and also cropped up in  polls taken the day of the election, it cannot be attributed to  a reaction by LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]  supporters to the storm of revelations about the Liberal  Democrat leader after 12 December (one scenario that has been  offered: many people have had their eyes opened and are now  ashamed to admit their political shortsightedness).    St. Petersburg residents' attitudes toward the prospect of  the current Cabinet of Ministers receiving a vote of no  confidence appear to be quite undetermined. It seems the issue  has lost some of its urgency for the time being.    As for the personal ratings of current and former members of  the government, it turns out that the politicians who are  leaving the scene have a higher degree of public support than  the ones who remain.

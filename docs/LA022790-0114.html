			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES TO VOTE ON RELOCATION OF SCHOOL  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Union High School District trustees are expected to vote  tonight on whether to move Wintersburg Continuation High School to the campus  of Fountain Valley High School.  </P> <P> For months, angry Fountain Valley parents have been protesting the proposed  relocation of the school, which serves students with behavioral, academic and  attendance problems.  </P> <P> Wintersburg is now next door to Ocean View High School in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "We are just stressing that these kids obviously have problems -- that's why  they are at Wintersburg in the first place," said Corlie Guild, leader of the  30-member Fountain Valley group opposing the move.  </P> <P> "There's no way, with them putting the two schools so close together, that the  two groups of kids won't be mingling, and what happens with this is that kids  on the borderline at Fountain Valley will be tempted to cross over."  </P> <P> The proposed lease of the land now occupied by Wintersburg is a part of the  district's effort to raise revenues in the wake of declining enrollment. The  district stands to earn $1 million a year on a 60-year lease of Wintersburg and  15 acres that surround the school, district officials said.  </P> <P> Both Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley school districts have been hit hard  by declining enrollment. The Fountain Valley school district has had to close  eight schools during the last 10 years. ALLISON SAMUELS  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that all references in the rule to ``landings'' be changed to ``cycles.'' The FAA concurs that the reference should be revised. The FAA has reviewed the applicable service information related to this action and finds that the majority of references to recommended compliance times are stated in ``flight cycles.'' Although the FAA normally uses the terms ``landings'' and ``flight cycles'' interchangeably, the FAA considers that it is appropriate in this case to change the verbiage of the AD to match that of the cited service bulletins. Therefore, in this final rule, the FAA has substituted the term ``flight cycles'' for the term ``landings.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter, a non-U.S. operator, requests that the proposed rule be revised to include a provision specifying that pressurization cycles of 2.0 psi or less need not be counted as a flight cycle when determining the number of flight cycles relative to the proposed compliance thresholds. This commenter states that a pressurization cycle of 2.0 psi or less is a typical pressure used during flight training, and causes little fatigue damage of the kind addressed by this AD action. The FAA does not concur. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to include various provisions in an AD applicable to a single operator's unique use of an affected airplane. Paragraph (i) of this AD provides for the approval of alternative methods of compliance to address these types of unique circumstances. Further, this commenter does not compile data for each of its airplanes so that an individual airplane's pressurization cycles could be determined; instead, it uses a fleet average to calculate the equivalent number of pressurization cycles. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to use approximations for determining compliance with this AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 116 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this proposed AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required inspections will entail 100 work hours per airplane per inspection, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $638,000, or $5,500 per airplane, per inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required ``full'' modification will entail approximately 96 work hours for each 200-inch length of uncracked and uncorroded lap joint, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) There are 100 lap joint sections per airplane, each with a length of 200 inches. The cost of required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $61,248,000, or $528,000 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection following modification will entail approximately 56 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this requirement AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $357,280, or $3,080 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is expected to be $62,243,280, or $536,580 per airplane. This total cost figure includes the inspections and modification, for the first year of the average five-year inspection cycle. Additionally, the total cost figure indicated is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

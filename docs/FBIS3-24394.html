			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Ivanov, first deputy minister of foreign </F> affairs of the Russian Federation: "What Russia Is Defending in  the Near East"]    [Text] The present revitalization of Russia's diplomatic  activity has been brought about primarily by the exacerbation of  the situation in Bosnia and the Near East. But this does not  mean that Russia was earlier a passive observer of the events  occurring here. Our country was a participant in the Madrid Near  East Peace Conference in 1991 and participated throughout the  past two years, as cosponsor of this conference, in the  negotiating process. Inasmuch as this process was quite smooth,  diplomatic activity was not that noticeable to public opinion.    Russia's interests have traditionally been connected with  the  Near East. So our promotion of a peace settlement is far from  fortuitous. The work initiated on the instructions of President  Yeltsin is expressed both in contacts of the minister of foreign  affairs of the Russian Federation with his colleagues from many  states and in our active position in the UN Security Council. My  trip to the region in the past week was made within the  framework of these efforts. Its purpose was to meet directly  with the leadership of the parties, to obtain information about  the state of affairs first-hand, and to attempt to find  compromise solutions that would make it possible to halt the  violence and to resume the negotiating process. After all, as we  all know, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon terminated the negotiations  with Israel after the Hebron tragedy as a sign of solidarity  with the PLO leadership.    A great deal of hard diplomatic work is now needed for  finding a way out of the situation. There were meetings in the  course of the trip with Yasir Arafat and the PLO Executive  Committee in Tunis, with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,  and with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shimon Peres in Jerusalem.    A practical step toward a resumption of the negotiating  process could be, in our view, an effective UN Security Council  resolution condemning the terrorist act in Hebron and opening  the way to the creation of the conditions for assurance of  security for the Palestinian population. Second, it is necessary  to decide the question of an international presence from the  viewpoint of both its format and mandate in order to guarantee  the realization of the accords that are achieved.    It seems to us that an international presence should be  realized with the active role of the cosponsors of the Madrid  Peace Conference, that is, Russia and the United States, which  does not, of course, rule out the participation of other states.  For it was Russia and the United States that assumed  responsibility for the peace process, appending their signatures  to the Declaration of Principles of Provisional Palestinian  Self-Government adopted last fall in Washington. The practical  aspects of the international presence, on the other hand, would  be resolved by the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships: Without  their consent there can be no question of the dispatch of  observers at all.    I was asked frequently during my Near East trip: Are Russia  and the United States not competing over what credit will be  attributed to whom? But I replied: We are not at the Olympic  Games, they are over, the medals have been handed out.  Russian-American cosponsorship presupposes both the joint  efforts of the two countries and the independent diplomatic  actions of each of them: This is what the United States is  doing, this is what Russia is doing also.    The trip to the region helped in an explanation on the spot  of our new initiative, which had originally been misinterpreted.  We proposed, as we all know, stage two of the Near East Peace  Conference. The reaction, on the part of the United States and  Israel primarily, was cool: They were afraid that we wanted in  this way to substitute for the negotiations that are already  under way and, in fact, to cancel out all that has been  achieved. But this is by no means part of our intentions. We are  confident that the present Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are  close to completion and that we need to be thinking today even  about the future. Stage one has been negotiated, and certain  experience--both negative and positive--has been accumulated. We  now need to meet and think about how to further advance the  peace process in all directions.    On 14 March Andrey Kozyrev will meet with Warren Christopher  in Vladivostok, and a principal topic of the negotiations will  be a Near East settlement. We will be discussing this topic with  Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon also. We have traditionally had good  relations with the Palestinian people and other Arab states. But  we attach great significance to relations with Israel,  proceeding from the fact that we could be an equal partner with  all the parties, not an advocate for just one of them.    Attempts have been made in the Yugoslav conflict also,  incidentally, to depict us as the defenders of the interests of  just the Serbian side. But Russia has supported and continues to  support equal contacts with the Serbs and with the Muslims and  with the Croats. Shuttle diplomacy is in this respect helping us  clear up the misunderstandings and find compromise solutions.</p>

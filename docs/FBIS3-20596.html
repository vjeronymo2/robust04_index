Today, the focus of rural  work is on accelerating rural economic development and  increasing the peasants' income. Now that the masses of peasants  are warmly clothed and well-fed, income has become the issue of  greatest concern to them. To prompt society to pay more  attention to the rural areas, we have compiled some letters and  essays from the rural areas. On the one hand, they reflect some  of the poor conditions in the rural areas, and on the other  hand, we urge comrades who have contact with the peasants and  the villages not to further add to the peasants' burden by  artificial means.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Calor workers accept contracts Manual workers at Calor Gas, the gas-products company, have agreed to sign individual contracts. The TGWU general union had secured a vote by a narrow margin for strike action against the contracts. The strike threat was called off yesterday, however, when Calor said that 90 per cent of the 363 employees had signed the new contracts. In separate negotiations the company has revised its pay offer to 52 drivers at Calor Transport, its haulage division.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Leaseholders to profit from property reform: Extensive changes in land law THE right of leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property, which was heralded in the Queen's Speech last week, is one of the most radical and controversial changes to land law in England and Wales this century. The legislation, which is likely to become law by summer next year, is 'an essential part of our policy on extending home ownership', according to Sir George Young, the housing minister. The proposals, which will tackle the difficulties of bad management and leases which have a only short time to run, have been welcomed by consumer groups and building societies. The losers are traditional landowners who resent being forced to sell. 'It is a massive infringement of democratic principles,' says Mr Jeremy Newsum, chief executive of the Grosvenor Estate, which owns much of London's Mayfair and Belgravia. One MP compared it to the dissolution of the monasteries, in its arbitrary transfer of property from one section of the community to another. How many properties are affected? There are an estimated 1.5m leaseholders in the UK, concentrated in London and towns on the south coast. Why is the legislation being introduced? First, it will tackle bad management of flats as owners will be able to get rid of landlords who fall short of their responsibilities. Second, it will help in cases where leases have less than 70 years to run, which are not mortgageable and so are often unsellable at present. How much will it cost to buy a freehold? The price will be the market price plus an additional sum to account for the 'marriage value' released by merging the freehold and leasehold interests. The landlord's costs and loss of development rights or effect on the value of other land owned will also be taken into account. If agreement cannot be reached, the courts will decide. Building societies may be willing to provide loans to cover the cost of buying a freehold. Who qualifies? At least two thirds of the long-lease holders must agree to purchase the freehold. What happens to those who do not want to buy their flats when a block is enfranchised? The buyers will be the joint freeholders for any tenants or leaseholders who do not participate. Which flats will not qualify under the legislation? Exemptions include properties with leases that were originally granted for less than 21 years, properties with a substantial annual rent, properties with fewer than two flats, properties where fewer than two thirds of the flats are let on long leases, properties where more than 10 per cent of the floorspace is used for non-residential purposes, properties owned by the Crown or charitable trust housing already let at a discount. Exemptions also cover converted buildings with four or fewer flats, where the landowner lives in the house for at least a year. Flat owners in blocks that do not qualify will have the right to extend their leases at market price. What about houses? The 1967 Leasehold Reform Act will be amended to remove the upper limits on rateable values. The houses affected would be those whose rateable values exceed Pounds 1,500 in London and Pounds 750 elsewhere; or whose annual rental equivalent exceeds Pounds 25,000, when leases were granted after April 1 1990. Will the value of property be enhanced? The It will clearly help properties with short leases that are now virtually unsaleable. In the long term, though, properties might fall in value if the buildings deteriorate as a result of lack of agreement between flat owners. What are the Commonhold proposals? Quite separately from the enfranchisement proposals, the government is working on a new form of tenure that might replace the freeholder/leaseholder structure. Each commonholder owns his or her unit outright, together with a share in the common parts. How should a tenant go about enfranchisement? The first, optional step is to serve a notice on the landlord to find out whether the building qualifies for enfranchisement and how much it will cost. The next step is to serve a Purchase Notice on the freeholder and to form a company to own the freehold. The landlord then serves a counter notice, disputing the terms, if necessary. If negotiations fail or if one of the parties delays completion by more than two months after agreement, either party has the right to go to court. A booklet on enfranchisement is available from Room N11/11, Department of the Environment, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1 3EB.</p>

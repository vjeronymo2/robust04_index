			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Executive pay As the last of the electricity companies finally brings down the curtain on this year's main results season, an irritating trend is visible. Embarrassed executives are increasingly refusing to discuss their pay when they announce their preliminary results, arguing that the information will be disclosed in the annual report. Since most publicity is focused on the preliminary results, and annual reports are not normally newsworthy, this is a pretty clear attempt to avoid the limelight. Perhaps future artful dodgers will get the publicity which their shyness and pay rises really deserve.</p>

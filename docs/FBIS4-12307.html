			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott  arrived here this evening on a three-day visit. Talking to  newsmen on his arrival, Mr. Talbott said the Clinton  administration attach great significance to Indo-U.S. relations.  He said India is important to them and Washington wants to  ensure that relations with New Delhi expand and strengthen in  the years to come.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Kamini Sawhny] India is Mr.  Strobe Talbott's first destination abroad after taking over as  America's deputy secretary of state. Mr. Talbott, who arrived  in New Delhi this evening on the first leg of his overseas tour,  is here on a three-day visit. The United States has been  India's largest trading partner, and with the liberalization of  the economy, the trade turnover between the two countries is  expected to touch $7 billion this year. Indian exports to the  U.S. were up by 20 percent last year, while about 40 percent of  all investments approved by the government in the same year were  from U.S. firms. So economic issues will probably be high on  the agenda when Mr. Talbott, who is the highest ranking U.S.  State Department official to visit India from the Clinton  administration, meets with Indian officials tomorrow.    [Talbott] My government attaches considerable significance  to  my visit here. President Clinton and Secretary of State  Christopher have asked me to come here in order to consult with  Prime Minister Rao and other officials of the Indian Government  on concrete ways in which we can give together new impetus and  new scope to U.S.-Indian relations.    [Sawhny] Nonproliferation is also likely to be a key subject  for discussion. According to reports, the U.S. proposal to hold  a multilateral conference on nuclear nonproliferation and  regional security in South Asia is likely to be conveyed to the  government. The backbone of India's nuclear policy has been the  Rajiv Gandhi action plan of 1988, which calls for a regime that  is global and nondiscriminatory. Another related issue that  India may take up is the proposal to supply 38 F-16 aircrafts to  Pakistan as a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment. India  feels that this will escalate the arms tension in the region.  The post of U.S. ambassador in New Delhi, which continues to be  vacant for over a year, will also figure in the talks. At the  end of his visit here, Mr. Talbott is headed for Islamabad.  [end recording]</p>

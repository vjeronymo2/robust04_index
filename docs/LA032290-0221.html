			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> REDONDO SURVIVES BIG SOUTH TORRANCE RALLY, HANGS ONTO 8-7 WIN  </P> <P> Redondo High School's Frank Bignami used up six of his nine lives Wednesday  afternoon.  </P> <P> Then his teammates nearly used up the rest of theirs.  </P> <P> Bignami pitched his way into and out of jams for the first six innings of  Redondo's Ocean League opener against visiting South Torrance, but the  right-hander finally ran out of luck in the seventh. South stormed Bignami and  reliever Akash Sehgal for six runs in the inning, but Redondo held on for an  8-7 victory.  </P> <P> "South got their share of hits off Frank, but he made the great pitches when he  had to," Redondo Coach Tim Ammentorp said. "He got some key strikeouts, and we  played solid defense behind him."  </P> <P> Redondo's 8-1 lead looked safe going into the seventh, but Bignami gave up a  single and two walks to start the inning.  </P> <P> Bignami came out for the soft-throwing Sehgal, who had an 0.66 earned-run  average after four games. But South's Tay Sneddon and Stu Manthey greeted  Sehgal with soft RBI singles. Then South third baseman Brian Swearingen cleared  the bases with a triple up the right-field alley.  </P> <P> Swearingen scored on Chris Castillon's sacrifice fly to left, but Sehgal got  Kevin Fitzpatrick to fly to center to end the game and get the save.  </P> <P> South had runners on base in every inning. But Bignami (2-1) escaped trouble in  the first with a double play, and then retired three hitters in a row in the  second after Sneddon doubled and went to third on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Bignami ended a threat in the third by striking out South's Greg Paluszek with  runners on first and third.  </P> <P> He gave up a walk and a double to start the fourth, but Redondo shortstop Brian  Davison nailed Sneddon trying to score from third on a ground ball. Jason Bobb  then flied to center, and Redondo center fielder Brett Tyrrell gunned Manthey  down at the plate for a double play.  </P> <P> In the fifth, Bignami allowed two runners but got a pair of strikeouts to get  out of the jam. South (2-6 overall, 0-1 in league) finally scratched out a run  in the sixth on Bobb's bad-hop single.  </P> <P> As it turned out, Redondo (6-3, 1-0) needed each of its eight runs. The  Seahawks broke a scoreless tie with a pair of runs in the fourth, then got six  more in the fifth with the help of three South errors and Artie Scarpino's  pinch two-run double.  </P> <P> Redondo second baseman Chris Townsend and designated hitter Brian Fitzgerald  led the Seahawks with two singles and a run apiece.  </P> <P> St. Bernard 6, Bosco Tech 3 -- Junior right-hander Andy Diver improved his  record to 4-0 by pitching a four-hitter, and Jeff Richardson and John Coleman  each batted two for three to lead the Vikings to a Camino Real League victory  at St. Bernard.  </P> <P> After falling behind, 3-2, in the second inning, Diver finished the game by  retiring 17 batters in a row. Bosco Tech scored all its runs in the second on  three bloop hits, a walk and a run-scoring ground out.  </P> <P> St. Bernard (6-1 overall, 2-0 in league play) went ahead with two runs in the  bottom of the second. Bob Waller led off with a double, went to third on a  single by Brian Shackleford and scored on Coleman's squeeze bunt.  </P> <P> After Shackleford was picked off second, Coleman stole second and went to third  on an errant throw. Sean Dunbar walked, and Coleman came home on a double  steal.  </P> <P> Richardson, who is batting .474 (nine for 19), homered and drove in two runs as  St. Bernard kept pace with El Segundo for first place. Coleman stole three  bases to give him 14 for the season.  </P> <P> Bosco Tech slipped to 1-1 in league play.  </P> <P> El Segundo 18, St. Monica 0 -- Brett Newell batted four for four with a home  run, a triple and four RBIs, Jason Wayt drove in three runs and right-hander  Rob Croxall pitched a two-hitter to power the Eagles to another easy victory in  a Camino Real League game at Marine Park in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> El Segundo (7-1 overall, 2-0 in league play) has outscored its last three  opponents, 77-7.  </P> <P> Croxall (3-1) took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, when he surrendered two  hits. The Eagles supported him with an errorless defensive effort.  </P> <P> Newell, a junior third baseman, hit a two-run homer in the sixth.  </P> <P> West Torrance 5, Mira Costa 4 -- The Warriors rallied from a 4-0 deficit and  scored the winning run on Stefan Wilson's squeeze bunt in the sixth inning in  an Ocean League opener at West.  </P> <P> Wilson, a sophomore right-hander who pitched a four-hitter, drove in John Walsh  with his bunt, which capped a three-run sixth for West (2-5 overall).  </P> <P> Mira Costa (1-8) scored all four runs in the second, highlighted by D. J.  Allen's two-run single.  </P></p>

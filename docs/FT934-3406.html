			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Texas relents in row over gay rights and investment After a furious local debate pitting jobs against 'family values,' a county in Texas has reversed a decision taken last week and decided to offer incentives to Apple Computer to attract a new investment. At issue was Apple's policy of offering health benefits to homosexual employees. Last week the five-member board of commissioners for Williamson county, just north of Austin, the state capital, voted 3-2 against giving the company nearly Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in tax breaks in order to secure an investment providing up to 1,500 new jobs. Apple promptly threatened to look out of state for a location, bringing Governor Ann Richards, up for re-election next year, vigorously into the fray on its behalf. The company, which has held a lease option on the land in Williamson County for some years, said it had been besieged by offers from other Texas counties. On Tuesday the commissioners reconsidered and decided in favour, also by a 3-2 margin, of a different deal amounting to the reimbursement of costs to develop the 128 acre site, worth approximately the same amount. The company said it was satisfied. The saga had made Georgetown, the county seat, briefly the centre of national attention, with rallies organised for TV cameras both by gay rights activists and the religious right. The commissioner who reversed his vote on Tuesday insisted he still opposed Apple's policies and argued that the new decision did not amount to public funding.</p>

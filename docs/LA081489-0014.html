			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DURANG HAS LAST LAUGH IN 'BETTE'  </P> <P> To laugh at something isn't to make light of it. Playwright Christopher Durang  specializes in a kind of cancer-ward humor, where the thing most feared becomes  the object of the most ferocious joke one can think of.  </P> <P> Laughing at Sister Mary Ignatius and all her works -- to name Durang's most  famous heroine -- is the first step to getting out of her grip. You need to be  tough on her; she was tough on you. Once you have pulled free, however, it's  possible to start admiring the old bat.  </P> <P> In "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, Durang  does for (or to) his family what he did for his favorite teacher. This is  Durang's "Long Day's Journey Into Night," a laying of family ghosts. But it is  played like a cartoon, so as to avoid O'Neill's mistake of buying into the  family curse.  </P> <P> A very healthy impulse and a painfully funny play. As in O'Neill's tragedy, we  get the sense of a family as a nest of lonely people dedicated to making each  other miserable. But here, for some reason, it's the stuff of laughter.  </P> <P> Not because the pain is downplayed. Peter Sagal's LATC program note suggests  that this will be the approach. "No one in this play wants to hurt anyone  else." Happily, director Dennis Erdman is having none of this. The  eye-for-an-eye principle is seen as the very foundation of a Christian family  life.  </P> <P> Boo (Guy Boyd) insults Bette by getting drunk all the time. Bette (Christine  Ebersole) counters by getting pregnant all the time. The baby is born dead, as  was bound to happen, Bette and Boo being victims of the Rh factor -- and  everybody is happy.  </P> <P> Bette and Boo learned these tactics at home. Boo's dreadful father (Bryan  Clark) has terrorized his tremulous mother (Lynn Milgrim) into being (his  little joke) "the dumbest white woman alive." Bette's mother (Angela Paton) has  scared her sister (Lela Ivey) into being the guiltiest Catholic girl ever.  </P> <P> This is known as the family romance. The fact that it's a Catholic family adds  a layer of things for the characters to be nervous about, including a rather  forlorn priest named Father Donnally (Stephen Tobolowsky), no match for Sister  Mary Ignatius. But Durang doesn't make as big deal of the church as one might  expect. Father Donnally doesn't press Bette to have all those babies. Bette is  positive that she was meant to have them, and she intends to keep on doing so  until she gets a good one. The indoctrination comes from Hollywood as much as  from Rome, but the real problem is Bette, whom Ebersole shows us will not take  "No" or even "Maybe" for an answer.  </P> <P> The real problem, Durang seems to be saying, is human nature. Put these people  in any culture, and they'd be on each other's case. Durang's narrator, and  clearly his surrogate, is Bette and Boo's son, Matt -- the one blue bundle that  lived. He's trying to understand why people keep setting such exquisite traps  for themselves, and by the end of the play it's still a mystery to him. A  mystery that he'll probably play a role in, down the road.  </P> <P> Actor David Marshall Grant ends the play on a note of acceptance -- not a  whimper; not a smile. His Matt progresses through adolescent shell-shock to the  point of being able to feel a bit of sympathy for the hell his parents went  through, and we sense a real, if small, gain.  </P> <P> Earlier, however, Grant makes Matt so diffident that we don't pick up on Matt's  dread that his family's problems are somehow both his fault and his  responsibility. Durang was to have played the role at LATC originally (he had  to drop out for a screenwriting assignment). The character might have been  clearer with the author at his elbow.  </P> <P> No one else in the play changes a fraction -- it's part of Durang's point that  families don't change, unless it's to get even more impossible. Director  Erdman's cast makes strong choices about who their characters are and what they  want, and the only drawback is that the character sometimes misses the layer of  self-deception that makes certain domestic monsters so fascinating.  </P> <P> Angela Paton as Bette's mother, for instance, would be funnier if she hid her  wolfishness a bit -- if in some sense, she really did wish the best for her  children, at least in her own mind. Bryan Clark's big smile as he destroys his  wife (Milgrim's wonderful) is more like it.  </P> <P> Ebersole is all presence as Bette, Boyd all absence as Boo, and that's the  right combination. Tobolowsky's Father Donnally may be too soulful, forgetting  that "Bette and Boo" can't afford to get too real about all this stuff, or we  get into O'Neill territory, where it can't compete. Better to go for the fun in  the role, and let the darkness take care of itself.  </P> <P>  Plays Tuesdays-Sundays at 8 p.m., with Saturday-Sunday matinees at 2 p.m.  Closes Sept. 17.

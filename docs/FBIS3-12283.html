			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] George Habash, secretary general of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], has said the basic  lesson learned from the black criminal act is the direct  responsibility the leaders of Israel hold at a time when they  are talking about peace and security. Habash also held the U.S.  Administration responsible through its protection of Israel.  Habash did not exempt Yasir 'Arafat and the Oslo-Cairo team, as  he said, from responsibility through their signing of agreements  that entrench the occupation and protect the settlements.    In a statement published in the Iraqi newspaper  AL-JUMHURIYAH, Abu-al-'Abbas [Muhammad 'Abbas], secretary  general of the Palestine Liberation Front [PLF], called for  halting the negotiations with Israel and resuming armed struggle.    Through its official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawash, who spoke at  a news conference, Hamas called on the PLO to return to its  people. Hamas criticized the president of the PLO for continuing  negotiations. Hamas reiterated its rejection of the Oslo-Cairo  agreements and said these agreements maintain the settlements as  time bombs that explode in the faces of Palestinians every day.</p>

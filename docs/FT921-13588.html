			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The shopper's tangled tale FT-SE Index: 2,544.9 (+8.2) The picture of UK retail sales is getting murkier just when the market most needs guidance. The government tells us that December was awful. The CBI tells us that December continued the mild recovery of the previous four months but that January looks awful instead. Anecdote tells us that the picture was appalling until just before Christmas, then got sharply better until early January, then may have gone off again. With luck, the CBI's expectations for January may chiefly reflect the depressed mood of its respondents in mid-December. On the other hand, if the anecdotal evidence is right, the official 1 per cent drop in December retail volume is worse than it looks. The period ended on January 4, thus taking in most of the recovery period. Early December must thus have been dire indeed. Where we are now is anyone's guess. The trouble is that this slender evidence is being loaded with a significance greater than it can bear. The market looks to the retail sector for clues to the economy. The government looks to the economy for clues to the election. The consumerlooks to the election for clues on when it is safe to start spending again. The result is gridlock. It seems to follow that last week's recovery in retail stocks - the sector outperformed the market by 4 per cent - was once again premature. The sector's historic p/e is over 18 times against 14.5 times for the market, while its yield is more than a full percentage point below the market average. There is no doubt that the retailers are more geared than most to recovery. It could also be argued that wider faith in recovery was implied by yesterday's slight rise in the FT-SE despite the retail figures. The fact remains that in terms of the economic fundamentals, the market is proceeding in the dark.</p>

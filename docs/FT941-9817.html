			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / View from the end of the ski run: The Winter Olympics, which open in Norway today When Norway's Stein Gruben soars off the ski jump with flaming torch in hand to open the Lillehammer Winter Olympics this afternoon, be prepared for an explosion of Norwegian national pride and an exuberant celebration of the country's folksy culture. Snorting reindeer, swishing sleighs, galloping horses, frolicking trolls and the music of massed fiddles will fill the snow-carpeted arena above the postcard-perfect lakeside resort for the opening ceremony. Above all, there will be dozens of men, women and children on skis. The primitive-looking pictograms being used as symbols for the Lillehammer games are derived from 4,000-year-old rock carvings of skiiers found in the Arctic north of Norway. More recently, skiing has even played a political role in a country - notably when the ski-borne heroes of Telemark sabotaged a heavy water plant crucial to Nazi attempts to make a nuclear bomb during the second world war. So Norwegians expect great things of their winter athletes. They won no fewer than nine gold, six silver and five bronze medals in the 1992 Albertville winter games, ranking third in the medals table behind Germany and the CIS. This year at Lillehammer, they are widely tipped to do even better. Hosting the games has, therefore, been seized by Norway as a perfect opportunity to present itself as a successful small country opening it arms confidently to the wider world. But there is a paradox to this picture - one that Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, the foreign minister, described this week as the conflict between the missionary and the viking. To many Norwegians, the games exemplify their independence of spirit, showing that Norway needs no help in living its life 'on the northern outskirts of the globe', as Ms Ase Kleveland, the culture minister, put it. These viking-like characteristics are best illustrated by Norway's stubborn insistence last year on resuming commercial whaling, in the face of strong international opposition, and its continued culling of baby seals. It is also to be found in Norwegian resistance to joining the European Union, due to be tested in a referendum before the end of this year. This week, Norway's prickly nature was again evident in a spate of inhospitable criticism from Norwegian athletes and the domestic media of Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Spanish president of the International Olympic Committee, which oversees the organisation of the Olympics. Mr Samaranch was accused of being undemocratic and was also publicly reminded of his past links with the late General Franco's fascist regime. But the Olympics are also a chance for Norway to show what Mr Godal called its missionary side, evident in its efforts at mediation last year, which helped produce the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Norway also has a long record of commitment to United Nations peacekeeping operations and is a world leader in dispensing development aid, on which it spends more than 1 per cent of GNP each year. Moreover, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Labour party prime minister, has been a champion of world environmental awareness - notwithstanding her backing for Minke whale hunting. Mr Tore Hagebakken is one of those who hopes the games will promote Norway's international instincts. The Labour mayor of Gjovik, an Olympic site close to Lillehammer best known for its extraordinary ice hockey stadium blasted out of the inside of a mountain, points optimistically to the latest opinion poll, which shows that opposition to EU membership is falling sharply. 'It is difficult to win the (pro-EU) argument in Norway,' he says. 'People are afraid they will lose their independence. But I hope the games will change this a little bit. We wanted to bring the games here to be more international - to show we have a lot of friends in Europe and all over the world and there is nothing to be afraid of.' Certainly, if the attitude of the 30,000 Norwegians who packed Thursday's rehearsal for the opening Olympic ceremony is a guide, there is now great national enthusiasm for hosting the games, despite initial disquiet over the escalating costs incurred during a recession. The Labour government has ended up spending NKr7bn (Pounds 632m) on the games, more than three times the estimates made when Lillehammer won the Olympics in 1989. A net deficit of NKr4.3bn is projected, and there are doubts about the future economic viability of many Olympic sites. These include two new ski jumps, a bobsleigh run, three skating rinks and the Hamar Olympic hall, a speed-skating stadium in the shape of an upturned viking ship. But one factor in the high spending has been widely welcomed and has set a standard for future Olympic Games, whether winter and summer. For the first time a host city has made a priority of organising the games along 'environmentally friendly' lines. After an acrimonious fight with the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature over the siting of the Hamar speed skating hall, which encroaches on important wetlands for migrant birds, the Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee embraced the idea of running a 'green games'. A member of the conservation society was employed to direct the environmental effort - which was made one of the 'success criteria' for the games. The results have been significant. The bobsleigh run was moved from its original site to a less obtrusive position; the ski jumps were built below the skyline; the athletes' village blends with local architecture and includes several buildings that can be moved elsewhere after the games; and, during construction, contractors were fined up to Dollars 7,000 for each tree they knocked down. The effort to be environmentally friendly goes well beyond the construction of the games infrastructure. A huge recycling effort means all meals are being served on plates made of potato and maize starch and eaten with similarly-made utensils - all of which can be turned into compost. All the bullets from the guns of the biathletes - participants in the cross-country skiing and shooting event - will, for the first time, be collected for recycling using special target backdrops. The only aspect of the environment the organisers have no control over is the weather. With 1.3m of snow already blanketing Lillehammer, the last thing the Winter Olympics need is more winter weather. The Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee is praying for clear skies.</p>

Allowing for inflation, their net income was 594 yuan, an  increase of 63 percent. [passage omitted]    Important factors causing the increase in their income were,  first, a good harvest in agricultural production; second,  township and town enterprises' vigorous development; and third,  a reduction in the peasants' expenditures.    In the income from agricultural production, the per capita  net income from crop planting was 334 yuan and the per capita  net income from animal husbandry was 67 yuan, an increase of  respectively 19.9 percent and 15.2 percent over the previous  year. Their per capita net income from tertiary industries was  78.33 yuan, increase of 39.3 percent.</p>

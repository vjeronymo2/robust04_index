			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA-BASED FIRM'S SYSTEM;  </P> <P> MORTGAGE LIST DISPUTE PITS LENDERS AGAINST BROKERS  </P> <P> A scrap is brewing between mortgage lenders and real estate brokers over an  obscure legal issue that could affect the way billions of dollars in mortgage  loans are sold.  </P> <P> The tussle has attracted little attention outside the real estate industry. But  both sides have dispatched lobbyists to importune the federal Department of  Housing and Urban Development, and both sides consider the stakes high.  </P> <P> The fight concerns a computerized mortgage system devised by Prudential Real  Estate Affiliates Inc. in Costa Mesa, a fledgling network of franchised real  estate brokerages that the big insurance company started in 1987. At issue is  the money Prudential pays its brokers who use the computer system.  </P> <P> That system -- called CLOS, as in to "close" a loan -- electronically matches  home buyers with a suitable mortgage from one of 10 or so lenders listed,  including Prudential's own mortgage lending subsidiary.  </P> <P> For every customer who uses CLOS, the brokerage gets $100 from Prudential to  reimburse the brokerage for hiring an employee to operate the system.  </P> <P> Prudential plans to sign up 3,000 brokerages nationwide by 1993, and it  estimates that lenders could eventually sell as much as $10 billion worth of  loans through CLOS.  </P> <P> The problem, says the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America, isn't the computer:  It's that $100 fee. The trade association says it's a conflict of interest when  a broker gets paid to refer customers to a mortgage lender. Lenders fear a  broker will then "steer" customers only to certain lenders, where they might  not get as good a deal.  </P> <P> And, the lenders say, such an arrangement violates federal law governing real  estate transactions.  </P> <P> The Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act -- RESPA -- forbids paying  referral fees to brokers.  </P> <P> Prudential and the National Assn. of Realtors, on the other hand, say the money  isn't a referral fee; it merely covers the brokers' costs of operating the  computer, which is now permissible under federal law. Prudential has an October  letter from HUD saying so.  </P> <P> But HUD officials are writing new RESPA regulations at the urging of mortgage  lenders, and both sides are pressing to persuade HUD to come down in their  favor on the payments.  </P> <P> Both powerful trade associations say they have the consumer's interest at  heart.  </P> <P> "The thing that disturbs us is the 'Big Lie' technique the Mortgage Bankers  Assn. is using," said William North, executive vice president of the National  Assn. of Realtors. "They keep saying these payments are referral fees, when  really the lenders are reimbursing the broker for running the computer system.  </P> <P> "This system actually makes getting a mortgage a lot more convenient for  consumers," North said.  </P> <P> Not so, says Robert M. O'Toole, senior staff vice president at the Mortgage  Bankers Assn.  </P> <P> "From our point of view, it's purely a matter of getting a fee and steering a  customer to that lender," O'Toole said. "And that's contrary to the law.  Without the fee, we'd have no objection to computer mortgage systems."  </P> <P> Computerized mortgage systems appeared in the early 1980s, long after Congress  passed RESPA in 1974. But they didn't really catch on until recently.  </P> <P> A second wave began a few years ago with Citicorp's MortgagePower. In 1986 HUD  lawyers said Citicorp could reimburse brokers for their costs in running  MortgagePower. The mortgage lenders got alarmed and persuaded HUD to reconsider  its rules regarding the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, which  Congress intended to protect consumers in buying a home.  </P> <P> The proposed new rules were set out for public comment in May, and HUD was  flooded with 2,000 responses, which it says is an unusually large number. Most  of the comments, says the mortgage bankers group, were negative.  </P> <P> In December a new set of regulations was leaked to the public which were much  more favorable to the mortgage lenders. According to the lenders'  interpretation, the new rules would have prohibited Prudential's $100 payment  to its agents.  </P> <P> That's where the matter stands now. HUD says it hasn't decided the issue yet,  and both sides say HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has not yet committed himself  either.  </P> <P> The matter may ultimately be thrown back in Congress' lap, since either side  could ask that the law be amended if they don't like the new regulations.  </P> <P> Prudential says it has its own lobbyists trying to catch HUD's ear. But  meanwhile it's business at usual at the new Prudential subsidiary atop a  mid-rise office building in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza area.  </P> <P> After little more than a year, Prudential had 300 affiliates signed up by the  end of April. They are required to use Prudential's computer system, although  they aren't required to use CLOS, which stands for computerized loan  origination system.  </P> <P> CLOS works this way: The customer specifies what type of loan he's looking for  -- adjustable rate, lowest monthly payment or some other requirement -- and the  computer reads back the loans that come closest to fitting those requirements,  deleting the lender's name from the information.  </P> <P> If the loan is approved, the lender pays Prudential $425.  </P> <P> But Prudential insists it's less interested in the money than in using CLOS as  a way to sign up more brokerages for its franchise system. Prudential hopes the  system will be a strong lure for attracting home buyers to its brokerages.  </P> <P> "We don't have any ambitions to become mortgage lending kingpins," said Carl  Espy, a senior vice president at Prudential Real Estate. "We're just trying to  make the buyers feel more comfortable."  </P> <P> Unlike Citicorp's MortgagePower, says Espy, the Prudential system offers more  than one lender, with as many as 10 choices in some markets. While the system  could eventually account for 20% of the loans on homes sold through its  brokerages, Prudential says -- and possibly as much as half in some markets --  that still leaves as much as 80% of the loans to lenders not on the CLOS  system.  </P> <P> Already signed up for CLOS are several national lenders, including GMAC  Mortgage Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage. Prudential is seeking a few  more to combine with three or four local lenders in each state.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> $1-BILLION DISNEY PARK;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH, ANAHEIM IN CONTENTION  </P> <P> The Walt Disney Co. today announced that a $1-billion theme park will be built  in Southern California and unveiled plans for about a dozen new attractions at  Disneyland that will give the venerable park more of a Hollywood flavor.  </P> <P> The new park will be built either next to Disneyland in Anaheim or near the  Queen Mary-Spruce Goose attraction -- bought by Disney from the Wrather Corp.  in 1988 -- in Long Beach, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner said at a  news conference.  </P> <P> "It depends a lot on which community wants us more," Eisner said.  </P> <P> Disney will go to the city that demonstrates the best plan for handling the  traffic and parking needed for the massive project, Eisner said. He declined to  release details of the park, saying its theme, size and opening date will  depend on where it is built.  </P> <P> In Anaheim, Disney owns about 66 acres around Disneyland. In Long Beach, the  company leases 55 acres and holds the option to develop 256 acres of water  surrounding the Queen Mary attraction. Previously, Disney officials had  mentioned the idea of a water theme park for this site.  </P> <P> The announcement of a new park is likely to set off a bidding war between  Anaheim and Long Beach, two cities that already compete for lucrative  convention business. Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter was first to the punch today as  he presented Eisner with a proclamation honoring Disneyland's 35th anniversary  being celebrated this year.  </P> <P> "Here I have the first opportunity before Long Beach to say the answer is yes,  yes, yes," Hunter said.  </P> <P> On Thursday, some Long Beach officials were given a presentation about the  possibility of a theme park. Long Beach City Councilman Evan Anderson Braude,  who represents the downtown area and the Queen Mary site, said Long Beach  offers a superior infrastructure and transportation system.  </P> <P> "We will go as far as we have to go as long as it makes economic sense" to get  the theme park, Braude said.  </P> <P> Eisner also announced plans for a "Disney Decade" that will include the most  ambitious expansion in Disneyland's history. The expansions will tie the  Disney's increasingly successful movie operations to the theme parks.  </P> <P> This summer, a Dick Tracy stage show at Disneyland will open, timed to  accompany the release of the company's Dick Tracy movie. In 1991, the Muppets  will have their own attraction and daily parade and a "Young Indiana Jones"  stunt show will also open.  </P> <P> Later in the 1990s, two new "lands" will be built: Mickey's Starland, which  will include the Muppets and an attraction based on the animated film "The  Little Mermaid," and "Hollywoodland," a reconstruction of Hollywood Boulevard  as it looked in the 1930s and 1940s, plus two new Roger Rabbit attractions.  Disneyland's "Tomorrowland" area will also be entirely remodeled.  </P> <P> Eisner said an expansion plan for Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., will be  announced next week.  </P></p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / E Germany's first blooms: Europe Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Germany's Dresdner Bank, has complained that the European Community is not doing its share in helping the integration of the former East Germany. 'Unfortunately,' he said last week, 'it is virtually taken for granted in Europe that the Federal Republic must deal with the economic integration of east Germany on its own. Why should southern Italy, parts of Greece and Portugal, and French agriculture be seen as European problems, while eastern Germany remains a purely German affair?' This could jeopardise pro-European sentiment in west Germany, he warned. From a factual point of view, of course, Mr Sarrazin's moan is misleading. The Community's farm policy applies just as much to east Germany as it does to France, and the same is true of the Regional Fund. On the other hand, it is easy to see why some west Germans should now have second thoughts about their original decision to treat economic unification as a purely German affair. The budgetary costs are turning out to be many times greater than expected by the daffy optimists (who included Dresdner Bank), and the results much more disappointing, or at least much slower. In December 1989, Chancellor Helmut Kohl predicted that there would be 'blooming landscapes' in the eastern Lander within two or three years; but these blooming landscapes have yet to appear, and Mr Kohl's words are daily held against him by the many disillusioned people of the east. The main reason for disillusionment has been the steep rise in unemployment and the general collapse of east Germany's uncompetitive industries. Recent figures show an average unemployment rate of 16 per cent. If you add in job creation, career training, and early retirement or equivalent, the real total of the unemployed and the under-employed together is reckoned to be 35 per cent or more. I recently visited the east German Lander on a tour arranged by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the German think-tank associated with the SPD social democrat party. By and large the trip confirmed the seriousness of the economic problems of the east. But it also suggested that the picture is not as unrelievedly bleak as the crude unemployment statistics imply. In agriculture, as in industry, there has been a collapse in employment. In Mecklenberg-Vorpommern the number of farm jobs has dropped from 180,000 to 25,000, in Brandenberg from 300,000 to 30,000. But we met one man who, virtually overnight, has been transformed from being an ordinary farm co-operative member to a large-scale farmer. In 1991 the 360 members of the co-operative in the village of Puchow received vouchers valuing their shares. In exchange for an undertaking to pay off the other members over five years, Detlef Sunboldt and a partner now farm 2,800 hectares, on which they pay DM300,000 (Pounds 120,000) rent, and employ 31 members of the co-operative. No doubt the choice, and the change, were difficult for other members; but it sounds like a shrewd arrangement for the market economy. In Neubrandenburg, the biggest industry under the old regime, the vast Warsaw Pact RWN tank repair centre, is being broken up and privatised. Heinz Schewe, an employee of RWN, worked his way up from an apprenticeship in 1969 to an engineering diploma. In 1990 he and a partner bought out one of the RWN subsidiaries, on money borrowed from Commerzbank. The company, which makes aluminium frames and windows, now employs 80 people, and last year doubled its turnover to DM15m. In the late 1980s, the GDR built a vast penicillin factory. But when it came on stream in May 1990, it became clear that it was totally uncompetitive, and it had to be closed. 'It was on much too large a scale,' says Manfred Pfeifer, the company's production director. 'We were not ready for the free market - indeed, we had no market, once the state disappeared.' On the wreckage of the company, the liquidator built a 68-room hotel, which Dr Pfeifer is now run-ning, apparently profitably. One of the constant laments in the east is that the modernisation or reconstruction of old housing is being obstructed or even paralysed by disputed ownership claims. In Saxony they have settled 112,000 such claims, but that leaves nearly 300,000 unsettled. In Dresden, the 40,000 outstanding claims have driven land prices so high that building costs are more expensive than in Munich. And yet there is no denying the vigour of the construction boom, confirmed both by the ubiquity of large building cranes and by the statistics: construction turnover in Saxony up 11 per cent this year. But what is being built is not productive industry. 'The new companies coming here are not producers,' says Dr Pfeifer. 'They are wholesalers, cash and carry, builders' merchants, steel merchants, furniture warehouses.' He might have added: petrol stations, car showrooms, insurance companies and banks (83 new banks in Dresden alone). Some analysts worry that the east is skewed in the direction of consumerism and services, unsustainably dependent on budget transfers from Bonn. Yet perhaps the development of services and infrastructure are really the precondition for industrial investment. But the most important task is the reconstruction of society: the weeding out of tainted judges and the introduction of good law, retraining of teachers, conversion of bureaucracy, education in politics. This will take a generation; and of course it is something that only the Germans can do, and they must do it by themselves.</p>

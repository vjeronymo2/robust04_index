			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Israeli deputy foreign minister denies end to hunt for wanted Palestinians ISRAEL'S deputy foreign minister Yossi Beilin yesterday denied that Israel had promised to halt the hunt for wanted Palestinians, in the wake of the Israel-PLO autonomy accord, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. He was reacting to PLO protests about the recent arrest of six Palestinian intifada (uprising) activists in the occupied West Bank. PLO chairman Yassir Arafat has lodged a protest, via an intermediary, with Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres, over the army's capture on Wednesday morning, in the Jenin area of the West Bank, of six leading members of the Black Panthers, an armed Palestinian group believed to have killed dozens of Palestinian 'collaborators' and several Israelis. Mr Arafat said he had instructed the Black Panthers and other such groups to lay down their weapons after the signing of the peace accord almost three weeks ago. They had complied, on the understanding that the security forces would stop hunting them. But Mr Beilin said no such under- standing had been agreed by Israel, and senior army sources confirmed yesterday that the search for wanted Palestinians would continue.</p>

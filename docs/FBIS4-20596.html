			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hidenaka Kato, staff writer] </F>   [Text] Four foreign aerospace firms will join the  government-backed project to produce the YSX passenger jet,  Ministry of Trade and Industry officials said last week. The  plane would be the first commercial airliner produced by Japan's  aircraft industry since 1972.    Three Western companies -- Boeing Co. of the U.S., Aviation  de Transport Regional, a French-Italian joint venture and  Saab-Scania AB of Sweden -- plus the state-run Aviation  Industries of China will this year join feasibility studies for  the mid-range YSX aircraft, say the officials.    Since halting production of the short-range YS11 passenger  aircraft in 1972, the Japanese aerospace industry has long  talked of producing another commercial plane. The YSX, aimed to  begin service early next century, has a capacity for 70-80  passengers and a cruising range of between 1,000-1,300 nautical  miles (1,800-2,400 km).    The foreign participation is seen as vital -- particularly  that of Chinese. The Japan Aircraft Development Corp. (JADC), a  private consortium backed by MITI, always aimed to attract  partners with big markets.    Industry estimates suggest that China will need up to 800  airplanes in the next 15 years and will become the world's  third-largest aviation market next to the U.S. and Japan. That  demand would make ready-made sales for mid-range regional jets  like the YSX.    Foreign partnerships should also help reduce development  costs, estimated to total &yen;80 billion ($708 million).    MITI, together with JADC, launched the first feasibility  study in 1989. Since then almost &yen;400 million has been spent  on the project.    For fiscal 1994, starting next April, MITI plans to allocate  &yen;1.6 billion for the YSX regional jetliner with another  &yen;800 million coming from the private sector members of JADC.    The foreign firms are expected to become full members of the  development team in fiscal 1995, although no concrete agreements  have yet been made on the partners' status when the feasibility  study finishes, said a MITI official. JADC hopes to start  engineering the YSX in 1997.    The non-Japanese companies hope to take advantage of the  growing demand for small passenger aircraft, industry observers  explained. Boeing, the world's largest aircraft builder, for  example, currently has no airplanes with less than 100 seats.    JADC estimates a total of 650 airplanes with less than 100  seats will be needed on the world market during the first decade  of the next century. At least 300-400 orders would be required  for the project to break even.    There are considerable risks. Many European aircraft  builders  are also trying to enter the small-to-mid-range jet market and  have projects for planes with less than 100 seats already  up-and-running. Both Saab and ATR have independently-launched  projects to develop aircraft similar in size to the YSX. That  could, fear Japanese officials, marginalize their involvement in  the YSX project.    Those with long memories will also point to the previous  Japanese commercial airliner, the YS11, a 75-seat plane, which  was a commercial flop.    European manufacturers are already touting their own  commuter  aircraft on the Japanese market. Nichimen Corp., Japan's  second-tier trading house, will carry out demonstration flights  of German Dolnier 328 in Tokyo and Okinawa in March, hoping to  win orders. Bombardier Inc. of Canada has also proposed a 50  seater small aircraft.</p>

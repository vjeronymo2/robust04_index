			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / People: Party time Paul Judge, who staged a highly successful buy-out of Cadbury Schweppes food interests under the Premier Brands label, is severing his formal links with the venture capital industry to concentrate on his new task of reorganising the Tory Party. Judge, 43, has resigned as non-executive director of Grosvenor Development Capital, the Slough-based venture capital group which featured, not always to its advantage, in the recent BBC2 Series The Adventurers. The Grosvenor link resulted from Judge's friendship with Grosvenor's late chairman, David Beattie, from their time at Cadbury. Beattie was a one-time managing director of Cadbury's speciality foods division while Judge was group planning director. Judge, who is also chairman of the food promotion organisation Food from Britain, led a Pounds 97m buy-out of Premier Brands in 1986. He subsequently resigned when a planned flotation did not go ahead and Premier was bought by Hillsdown, a food conglomerate, for Pounds 182m in May 1989. Appointed director general of the Tory Party last November, Judge has since been engaged in a restructuring of the party organisation to reduce staff levels and cut costs.</p>

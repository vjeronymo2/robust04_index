			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Bush winning few votes with folks back home MR NICHOLAS BRADY can be more frank than most. The US Treasury secretary was going through his standard spiel for American journalists about why this summit promoting international economic growth mattered to election year voters back home when he allowed himself what amounts to a confession. 'Has it been well sold? Has that thought been well sold? No,' he said. 'Has a better job got to be done on it? Yes.' The more political of the White House spin doctors would not normally admit as much, but Mr Brady had put his finger on a problem. Unless some rabbit can be pulled out of the summit hat - and it is hard to see what it will be  -the political benefit of President George Bush's attendance here does not appear to be very great. Mr Bush's presumed edge over Bill Clinton and Ross Perot is experience and competence in foreign policy. This may not be decisive in a year when domestic concerns are paramount, but in a close race every little bit helps. That was certainly the case on Sunday in Warsaw when he was able to play the role of the popular statesman abroad and bask in the warmth of his reception. With 12m Polish Americans back home, the endorsement of President Lech Walesa counts, and the pictures were lovely. Munich is messier, mostly because the news out of here is essentially indecisive. While it may matter that serious discussions have taken place on Gatt and on Yugoslavia, as well as on the international economy, the inability on all fronts to achieve what can be portrayed as decisive breakthroughs makes the selling of the summit, to apply Mr Brady's words to the geopolitical, that much harder. Nor, half way through the event, does it appear that Mr Bush has been playing the role of primus inter pares. To the extent that initiatives have been evident at all they have come from Mr John Major and Mr Jacques Delors on Gatt, Mr Francois Mitterrand on Yugoslavia and Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, on his negotiations with the Russians. Given the intractability of all three issues, Mr Bush may have calculated that to be exposed on any of them would carry more risk than reward. But it has also not helped the presentation of his performance to his domestic audience that the principal conduit, the White House press corps, has been isolated at a remote hotel and fed a diet of thinnish, almost defensive, gruel. It has not resulted in favourable coverage. This is not yet irredeemable, nor, in the greater and longer scheme of things, may it matter. But Mr Bush may recall that since Rambouillet in 1975, two of the three incumbent US presidents who hoped that summits would give them a boost - Gerald Ford in 1976 and Jimmy Carter in 1980  - went on to lose. Ronald Reagan had it easy in 1984, but by the time he got to the London summit he was already home and dry. Mr Bush is not.</p>

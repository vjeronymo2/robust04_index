			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 14 (XINHUA) -- A seminar was held  here today to commemorate Dr. James Endicott, a renowned  Canadian peace champion and a life-long friend of the Chinese  people.    Among the participants were Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of  the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's  Congress, Huang Hua, president of the China Society for People's  Friendship Studies, Canadian Ambassador to China Fred Bild and  members of the Endicott family.    Dr. Endicott was born into a missionary family in Leshan  city, in China's Sichuan Province, in December 1898, and died in  Toronto, Canada, in November 1993.    The Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign  Countries (CPAFFC) in August last year conferred on him the  honorific title of "friendship ambassador," together with a  certificate.    In accordance with his last wishes, Mrs. Endicott and his  children brought his ashes to spread on the river that flows by  Leshan, his "second homeland".    In his speech, Huang Hua described Dr. Endicott as a foreign  friend who sympathized with and supported the Chinese people in  their just struggle.    "Dr. Endicott devoted his entire life, energy and wisdom to  the Chinese people's revolution and national development, to  friendship between the Chinese and Canadian peoples and to world  peace," Huang said, adding that Endicott made significant  contributions in all these endeavors.    Recalling the century-old friendly ties the Endicotts have  with China, CPAFFC Vice-President Xu Qun expressed the hope that  there will be more and more friends who will, just as Dr.  Endicott did, concern themselves with the cause of Sino-Canadian  friendship and make it more bright.    A speech written by Bishop K. H. Ting, vice-chairman of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference and chairman of the China Christian  Council, was delivered for him because he could not be present  for health reasons.    Dr. James Endicott's son Stephen Endicott and son-in-law  William Small also spoke at the seminar.    Mrs. Endicott presented to the China National Library via  CPAFFC the one-volume edition of "The Canadian Far East  Newsletter", edited and published by Dr. Endicott from 1948 to  1992, which reported objectively China's socialist construction  and rebutted anti-China allegations in the West.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGIC, COOPER LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING FOR THEIR NEW COACH  </P> <P> Magic Johnson, through his personal publicist, issued the following statement  Monday about Pat Riley's resignation as Laker coach and Mike Dunleavy's  appointment:  </P> <P> "Pat Riley has helped me grow as a basketball player as well as a man and I  will always love him for it. Pat was much more than a coach to me, he has been  my friend and a inspiration. When I was down, he was able to pick me up and  help make me the best basketball player and person that I could be. When I'm  older and somebody talks about 'Showtime,' the first person I'll think of is  Pat Riley. . . . I wish Pat the best of luck in whatever he does, and I will  definitely miss him.  </P> <P> "I'm excited to start working with Mike Dunleavy and I am confident that he  will help us achieve our goal and return the championship to the Lakers."  </P> <P> Michael Cooper, who has been with the Lakers for 11 seasons, said Monday that  he, too, will miss Riley.  </P> <P> "The important thing was, it was his decision," Cooper said. "This thing wasn't  forced on him."  </P> <P> Asked if a coaching change were needed, Cooper said it was not his place to  say.  </P> <P> "Only management could tell you that," Cooper said. "We've done so many great  things under Pat. . . . (But) the NBA is changing a lot. Coach Riley had his  philosophy as far as coaching, and he went about it that way. It worked for us  in the past. In the early '80s, it worked great."  </P> <P> Asked about Dunleavy's reported low key approach, as opposed to Riley's intense  manner, Cooper said: "Too much basketball wears you out. If (Dunleavy) is low  key and knows when to back off, it'll help. But I'm sure he'll come in  forceful, but probably not too forceful." SAM McMANIS  </P></p>

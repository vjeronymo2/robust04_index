			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong climbs on a wall of US money  -Simon Davies describes a contradictory couple of weeks for the equity market The Hong Kong stock market has acted in direct contrast to Sino-British talks over the colony's political future in recent weeks, as a wall of US money has flooded out local political and economic concerns. Since September 27, the Hang Seng index has risen by 801, or 10.8 per cent, to 8,253.45 in the face of a chain of seemingly negative news. Beijing lost its bid for the 2,000 Olympics; the New York meeting between the British and Chinese foreign ministers achieved nothing; and Governor Chris Patten has shown no signs of withdrawing his political proposals in the face of continuing Chinese opposition. The reason for the disparity between local sentiment and the market performance has been US mutual fund cash, and the growing assumption that politics will do nothing to hurt the local economy. A fortnight ago Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's director of global strategy, wrote: 'After eight days in China, I'm tuned in, over-fed and maximum bullish.' He made no reference whatsoever to politics and advised a substantial increase in Hong Kong weightings. US fund managers have responded accordingly. With its currency pegged to the US dollar, Hong Kong is seen as representing an attractive option for cash rich US fund managers looking for high growth, low valuations and limited currency risk. Based on Goldman Sachs forecasts, the Hang Seng index is trading on a 1993 price earnings ratio of 15.2 and a 1994 p/e of 13, in spite of its 50 per cent increase this year. By comparison, one of Asia's cheaper markets, Thailand, is on 1993 and 1994 p/e's of 23.4, and 19 respectively. The colony was previously deemed to be too much of a political risk, because of Beijing; but as attitudes towards Chinese economic trends have changed, so has the international perception of the stock market. Mrs Janice Wallace, research director at Goldman Sachs Hong Kong, says: 'I'm just overwhelmed by the liquidity flows. Obviously it can't go on forever, but I can't see what the trigger will be'. There are a number of such potential triggers. Concern remains over whether China's austerity programme could take some of the strength out of the local economy, which is already looking at declining corporate earnings growth in both 1993 and 1994. In the near-term, politics appears a more likely challenge to the US bulls. On November 11, Mr Patten will visit the UK for what is likely to be a final consultation with the UK government before proceeding with his proposals for political reform, thereby putting an end to hopes for a peaceful compromise with China. The stock market is suggesting that politics will not impact on corporate growth, but Chinese officials have already suggested that if Mr Patten goes ahead with his proposals, the economy could suffer; this provides potential for substantial mood swings. Other blows could be dealt by the death of the ageing Chinese patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, or signs that the US may revoke China's MFN status or impose specific trade tariffs as a means of extracting improved human rights and a more open economy. On the more positive side, China has still retained the two business trump cards of its approval for Hong Kong's new airport, or its postponed Container Terminal 9. Either card would give greater credence to the view that China will not let politics hurt Hong Kong's economy, and would boost the stock market. But Beijing has given no sign that such a gesture will be forthcoming. Analysts claim that much of the new money is coming into Hong Kong on the basis that, in 45 months, it will be part of the fastest growing major economy in the world - and that, on a long-term view, this will outweigh any immediate concerns such as worsening Sino-British relations. Mr Han Ong, managing director of Warburg Asset Management Hong Kong, says that it is difficult to maintain caution in the face of this inflow of funds. 'You can sit back and say there are any number of worries from a fundamental point of view. But it is another thing to stand in the middle of the road, say I'm right, and get run over by the juggernaut'.</p>

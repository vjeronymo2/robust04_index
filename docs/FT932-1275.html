			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rothmans The rumpus surrounding the leaking of Richemont's restructuring plans raises the vexed issue of when shares should be suspended. The general principle must be that it is best avoided. Owners of suspended shares, such as Queens Moat, can be locked in for months. A clearing price of any kind at least enables them to release their capital. But there are exceptions. Richemont's restructuring proposals were complex and it was questionable whether they would go ahead. When they leaked into the market, the Stock Exchange was asked to suspend the shares of Rothmans and Dunhill, the two quoted companies involved. But while this was being considered, Richemont released a statement outlining its demerger plans. Astonishingly, given the suspension request, the Stock Exchange did not approve the content in advance. It subsequently considered the statement lacked clarity. After the flurry in the shares of both Rothmans and Dunhill, it eventually agreed a suspension. The onus is now on Richemont promptly to produce its full plans enabling the two shares to be traded again. What disturbs, though, is the conspicuous lack of co-ordination. The Stock Exchange liaised with Rothmans' stockbrokers. The Takeover Panel dealt with its financial advisers. Communications between them were clearly unsatisfactory. The Stock Exchange would have done best to suspend the shares at the time of the announcement. Such confusion and delay does it little credit.</p>

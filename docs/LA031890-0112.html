			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: SOME PERKS MAKE VISITORS FEEL RIGHT AT HOME;  </P> <P> SAVVY: HOTELS COMPETE IN AMENITY WARS;  </P> <P> HOTELS: BIG WINNERS OF THE AMENITY WARS ARE GUESTS, WHO CAN BE TREATED TO  EVERYTHING FROM SEWING KITS TO CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. BUT TO SOME OPERATORS,  THE SITUATION HAS GOTTEN TRULY OUT OF HAND.  </P> <P> Recently, when I checked into a hotel room, I was confronted with nothing less  than a combination drug and fashion store.  </P> <P> On the bed was a large bathrobe. Near it were terry-cloth slippers. A note  advised me that jogging shoes were available in my size if I needed them.  </P> <P> On the bathroom counter was a virtual pharmacy: three kinds of soap, bath oil,  shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, suntan oil, hand lotion. There were also  bath beads, Q-tips, toothpaste, mouthwash, soap flakes and even a shower mitt.  </P> <P> And to think I had bothered to pack!  </P> <P> About the only thing missing was the inevitable plastic shoe horn. (Later, I  found it -- an expensive brass model, hanging in the guest closet, next to the  flannel shoe bags.)  </P> <P> Welcome to the one-upmanship world of hotel amenity wars, as hotels throughout  the world try to gain your loyalty by showering you (sometimes literally) with  goodies. There seems to be no middle ground when it comes to amenities. Most  hotels either provide too many items . . . or too few.  </P> <P> Many mid-priced hotel bathrooms contain the bare minimum -- a glass wrapped in  plastic, an ice bucket, two small bath towels, two hand towels and, instead of  designer soaps, small cakes of generic soap.  </P> <P> But some upper-scale hotels provide everything from bath beads and cotton balls  to bottles of cologne.  </P> <P> "That's just too much," said Nicholas Rettie, general manager of the Athenaeum  Hotel in London. "The biggest mistake many hotels make is that they lose  perspective when it comes to amenities. We're in the service business, not the  amenities business.  </P> <P> "And certainly we're not in the perfume and cosmetics business. People come to  a hotel for service, not to take home giveaway items."  </P> <P> However, there are hotel amenities that do make sense.  </P> <P> Budgetel Inns offers free continental-breakfast room service to guests at each  of its 72 locations.  </P> <P> Some hotels, like the Four Seasons in Los Angeles, put fax machines in guest  rooms. Others lend guests free videotapes.  </P> <P> The Heathman Hotel in Portland, Ore., gives guests sweatproof jogging maps and  ID holders that can be laced into running shoes.  </P> <P> Other hotels keep a full supply of amenities for women travelers. The Mandarin  Oriental in Hong Kong offers an amenity kit that includes a nightgown, sewing  kit, panties, panty hose, hairbrush and extra tissue paper. The hotel also  provides heated hair rollers on request, and has a full-time seamstress  available.  </P> <P> Some amenities can only be defined as special touches: In Australia, the Regent  of Melbourne gives each guest a little bottle of Australian champagne every  night.  </P> <P> In Honolulu, the Halekulani gives each guest a different sea shell every night  upon turndown. And a host of hotels have replaced the traditional mint on the  pillow with chocolate chip cookies and milk.  </P> <P> There have also been some failed amenities. "Wall-mounted hair dryers are a  disaster," said Raymond Bickson, general manager of The Mark in New York City.  "You can never control their speed, and they always seem to be placed in the  most awkward positions, so you have to be Houdini to dry your hair.  </P> <P> "In fact, any amenity that's mounted is a failed amenity. If you need to mount  or bolt a night table lamp, remote control for a TV -- I've even seen a  corkscrew that was chained to the wall -- then it doesn't belong in a guest  room. It's an insulting amenity."  </P> <P> Still, an amenities debate is raging within the hotel industry. To what extent  do amenities provide a necessary service or that special added touch, or to  what extent are amenities a needless and overly expensive exercise in waste?  </P> <P> "We certainly share the blame," Darryl Hartley-Leonard, president of Hyatt  Hotels, said in a recent speech. "We started an amenities war in 1967, when we  bought the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, and that has culminated in amenity packages  that cost up to $20 per room for commercial hotels and up to $60 per room for  resorts.  </P> <P> "Today, soaps, shampoos, conditioners, bath gels and bathrobes aren't extras  anymore. They are expected by our guests."  </P> <P> But what else is now expected? Beyond the obvious items, a hotel amenity  package often includes items guests can take home with them, products they  would normally bring from home anyway, and items that they actually use while  at the hotel which they might otherwise buy.  </P> <P> "Amenities have truly gotten out of hand," said Rudolf Greiner, president of  Regent Hotels. "So much of it is just garbage, or it simply insults the guest.  Then there are some hotels that give guests a bathrobe, which is displayed  proudly on each bed.  </P> <P> "Why? Would you put a bathrobe on a bed, with a note in the pocket telling  guests that they can buy it? Are you supposed to boast that your hotel has  bathrobes? Are you in the business of selling bathrobes?  </P> <P> "No. Guests expect to find bathrobes in the bathroom. We look at bathrobes as .  . . standard operating equipment these days."  </P> <P> Stan Bromley, regional vice president and general manager of the Four Season  Hotel in Washington, agrees. "Amenities that are obviously wasteful may get a  guest's attention, but ultimately not in a positive way," he said.  </P> <P> "Why should a hotel put an expensive bottle of cologne in a guest room when you  already know the guest will be bringing his own? Chances are he won't even like  your choice."  </P> <P> Indeed, this new soap opera can be expensive for both hotels and guests. Each  hotel does extensive price breakdowns and cost projections on guest amenities,  and the figures can be staggering.  </P> <P> The number of amenity items in a regular hotel room might surprise you, ranging  from matchbooks and pens, notepads and tissues to soap and bathrobes.  </P> <P> At The Mark in New York City, the amenities package includes plastic newspaper  holders (so guests won't get their hands dirty when picking up the paper in the  morning), mineral water, granola, bathroom scales, shoe trees, garment bags,  bottle openers, bath salts, an array of soaps, gels, Q-tips, cotton balls and  umbrellas, just to name a few.  </P> <P> "But we don't get crazy with the amenities," said the Mark's Bickson.  </P> <P> "There's no point in overdoing it," the Athenaeum's Rettie said, "because if  you do, it might give the impression to guests that you're overcompensating on  amenities to hide bad service."  </P> <P> Location can also be a factor when a hotel selects its amenities. The  Halekulani, for example, is on the beach at Waikiki. Therefore, the guests are  not only supplied with the standard amenities, they also receive suntan lotion,  washing suds to rinse out their swimsuit and plastic bags to put the wet suit  in. Hair dryers -- another important feature for a beach hotel's guests -- are  also in the bathrooms.  </P> <P> Hilton developed its amenities package by studying focus groups of business  travelers. (Added to the package: extra-gentle shampoo and mouthwash.)  </P> <P> All of the amenities, bathroom goodies and conveniences may indeed be tempting,  but remember, you're paying for it. And, at some hotels, room rates are so  expensive that no amount of soap or chocolate is really worth the extra tariff.  </P></p>

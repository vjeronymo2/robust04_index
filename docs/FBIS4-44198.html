			<p>BFN     [Text] Bordeaux, France, June 27 (AFP) -- French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe said Monday [27 June] that France's  military intervention in Rwanda had attained its first objective  by restoring security to threatened people.    Juppe, who is attending a seminar here on the devaluation of  the CFA franc earlier this year, said the "first objective of  Operation Turquoise in Rwanda has already been attained because  we have reassured threatened populations and restored security  to threatened populations."    The foreign minister said opposition to the French operation  was waning, in particular that of the Tutsi-dominated rebel  movement, Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), "because we explained  that our objectives were exclusively humanitarian."    Juppe also said the international community was mobilising  in  support of Operation Turquoise. "Most of our European partners  are with us," Juppe said, referring to European Union support  given at last week's summit in Corfu, Greece.    "The priority is to ensure that United Nations troops are on  the ground as soon as possible," Juppe said.    In Paris, assistant chief of staff General Raymond Germanos  said Monday that French troop strength between the two staging  posts of Goma and Bukavu, in Zaire on the Rwandan border, would  be up to 1,300 men by Monday evening.    Germanos said no incidents had been reported, but that the  troops had noted tensions when they made forays into western  Rwanda. "People are frightened and don't always show it,"  Germanos said, "The atmosphere is very tense."    The town of Kibuye on the shores of Lake Kivu was the main  seat of inter-ethnic tension between Tutsis and members of the  majority Hutu tribe, another military source said.    The source said several hundred Tutsis had taken refuge  around the town under the protection of nuns and were being  threatened by Hutu extremists.    Germanos said the French force was being progressively  expanded to its full strength of 2,500, and would reach 1,300 by  Monday evening compared with 1,150 on Sunday.    Operation Turquoise was delayed in its early stages by the  inability of 25 chartered Russian-built Antonov transport planes  to land at Goma airport, which has only one runway and no modern  equipment, Germanos said, but now the Antonovs were landing  there normally.    He added that two field hospitals were being set up near  Goma  and Bukavu and that an operating theatre would be established at  another site.    Meanwhile, in Libreville, Gabon, a central African economic  cooperation group declared "full support" for the French  operation.    The general secretariat of the Economic Community of Central  African States (CEEAC), one of whose 10 members is Rwanda,  called on members to send either troops or food and medical aid.    Other members of the CEEAC are Burundi, Cameroun, the  Central  African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome,  Chad, and Zaire.</p>

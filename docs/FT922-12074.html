			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks take the lead in UK power station loans JAPANESE banks played a significant role in three big loans signed in London last week, despite fears that the recent weakness in Japanese share prices would force the banks to withdraw from international lending. In one loan - a Pounds 370m facility to finance the construction of a gas-fired power station for Medway Power in Kent - half the 10 lead banks were Japanese. The three loans, all for independent gas-fired power station projects, reveal that the Japanese banks are now pursuing high margin lending, rather than repeating the low margin loans with which they flooded the international credit markets in the 1980s. The margin on one of the projects, a Pounds 375m loan to build a power station at Keadby, South Humberside, rises from a healthy 1 percentage point in the first three years to 1.15 percentage points at the end of the 15-year loan. The terms of the other loans have not yet been revealed, but are believed to be broadly similar. Five Japanese banks - Sanwa, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Fuji and Dai-Ichi Kangyo  -are among the 10 underwriters of the Medway loan. Some of the Pounds 370m will be taken up by other banks through a syndication agreement, but each of the 10 lead banks is expected to advance a significant portion of the loan. Sanwa is the only Japanese bank among the seven lead banks in the Keadby loan, while LTCB International is among the lead banks in the third project, a Pounds 150m loan for a power station at Derwent, in the Midlands. The three projects were agreed last week, ahead of the expiry of draft supply agreements with British Gas. These would have lapsed had loan agreements not been signed within six months of the contracts being agreed last autumn. Part of the explanation for the continued involvement of the Japanese is that all three projects have been under consideration since the end of last year. The banks' involvement with the projects goes back even further. Japanese banks were among the most active in lending to the UK's regional electricity companies in the run up to their privatisation in 1990. These companies are now joint partners behind the projects. The earlier loans to the regional electricity companies were made at margins of only around  3/16 of a percentage point. Involvement in the new project loans is seen as part of the compensation for having supported the electricity companies before.</p>

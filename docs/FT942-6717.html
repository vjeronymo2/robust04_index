			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: More cost cuts at Metallgesellschaft Metallgesellschaft's German base metals operations yesterday joined the growing lists of sacrifices being made to salvage the battered metals, mining and engineering group. A tin plant is to be shut, along with a zinc alloy works, while zinc production at MG's Ruhr-Zink smeltery in Datteln is to be more than halved to 90,000 tonnes a year. The measures will cost around 500 jobs, the group said yesterday, indicating further payroll cuts to come soon with an announcement that restructuring measures were under way in lead smelting. Earlier this month MG said it planned to reduce its total workforce by 7,500, saving DM550m (Dollars 329.3m) a year. The group, which made a loss last year of some DM2bn, also said it had bought a further 24.2 per cent ofthe London metals trading business, Metallgesellschaft Ltd, from MIM Holdings of Australia. No price was disclosed for the deal which raised MG's stake in the London Metal Exchange business to 86 per cent. Yesterday's statements, following the disclosure earlier this week of the sale of prime assets to help cover freshly-discovered risks in the US oil market, confirms that the promised shake-out at MG is well in hand. Earlier disposals included a 49 per cent stake in vehicle components supplier Kolbenschmidt, and a small holding in Methanex, a Canadian methanol maker. In the light of European over-capacity, low profitability and the added burdens of Germany's tough environmental laws, action on the domestic base metals business had been expected. However, the sale of the Buderus heating business, MG's headquarters in Frankfurt and the Lenkhering Montan Transport company, came as a surprise. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the renowned company doctor shipped in by the banking consortium responsible for a DM3.4bn package which saved MG from the brink of collapse earlier this year, had previously insisted they were 'not for sale." The group has not stated the extent of the fresh risks uncovered in the US oil business. However, its 80 per cent holding in Buderus, the real estate and transport companies are estimated to be worth almost DM2bn. Buderus, a high-profile brand, is benefiting from a continuing domestic construction boom. The company's offices occupy a prime, historic site in the heart of Frankfurt's business district. Although many more of MG's 250-plus subsidiaries are likely to go, progress so far suggests Mr Neukirchen is focusing manufacturing operations on environmental technology and engineering.</p>

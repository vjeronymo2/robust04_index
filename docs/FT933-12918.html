			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Mubarak set for third term President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was set to win parliamentary approval last night to run unopposed for a third six-year term as the country's leader, Mark Nicholson writes from Cairo. The vote is a formality since 98 per cent of the People's Assembly's 454 elected members have already sworn their support for his nomination. His nomination must then be endorsed by a referendum in October, when he will need a simple majority of votes cast. This too is expected to be little more than a formality; he secured 97 per cent of the vote last time.</p>

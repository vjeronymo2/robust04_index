			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOTTLING UP BARS;  </P> <P> ACTIVIST OPPOSES LICENSES UNTIL BUSINESSES USE ALCOHOL ABUSE PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Like thousands of other Westside residents, Beverly Hills pediatrician Trisha  Roth has discovered that the rejuvenated 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica  now boasts a thriving night life and an impressive array of trendy restaurants  and bars.  </P> <P> Some restaurant and bar owners wish she had not.  </P> <P> Roth has made a name for herself in her home city as a vigorous and sometimes  strident opponent of alcohol abuse. She has campaigned before the City Council,  school board and PTA for programs to prevent the serving of alcohol to minors  and to discourage drinkers from driving. In her unsuccessful effort to win a  seat on the Beverly Hills City Council earlier this year, an anti-alcohol  message was a major component of her campaign.  </P> <P> Now, she is branching out. In recent months, Roth has been raising objections  before the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Department to liquor license  applications from new Westside businesses, and she has paid particular  attention to the three-block outdoor mall.  </P> <P> The protests have forced the state agency to hold a hearing before granting a  license, a process that can hold up a license for months. Roth does not  withdraw her protests unless the applicants agree to implement programs  encouraging responsible drinking.  </P> <P> Her latest protest is over a liquor license sought by the Golden Monkey Cafe,  which is scheduled to open in February on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard  and 3rd Street.  </P> <P> Roth says she is pleased that she has found a way to force establishments that  seek liquor licenses to develop designated-driver programs, but she complains  that some restaurants have gone back on their word and have done little or  nothing to discourage drinking and driving once the licenses have been issued.  </P> <P> Carl Falletta, a spokesman for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Department, said  that new applications for full liquor licenses generally take about three  months to approve but that a protest such as Roth's can extend the process to a  year.  </P> <P> The state does not require licensees to have designated driver or server  training programs, Falletta said.  </P> <P> Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District Corp., the  nonprofit group that manages the Promenade, said most proprietors are  responsible and have drunk-driving programs, although perhaps not at the level  Roth would like.  </P> <P> Carroll said owners realize that the sale of alcohol is vital to the success of  their businesses, and they do not want to risk losing their licenses.  </P> <P> Carroll said the idea of a coordinated designated-driver program for the  Promenade will be among the items discussed at a meeting of proprietors this  week.  </P> <P> Councilman Dennis Zane, a force in the mall's renovation, said that he believes  most proprietors are acting responsibly but that the city may be in a position  to encourage more cooperation from licensees.  </P> <P> Roth insists that she is not singling out the Promenade in her campaign. In  fact, she makes protests most new license applications on the Westside. It is  with the Promenade protests that she has managed to draw city officials and  licensees into at least preliminary negotiations for a comprehensive policy for  businesses.  </P> <P> Roth says, ideally, she would want a highly visible program at every  liquor-serving establishment and that every group of patrons has a designated  driver. That person would wear a button and would be served free coffee or soft  drinks. She said she would also like to see so-called notices posted at each  table warning against the dangers of drinking and driving.  </P> <P> Randy Larscheid, general manager of the Golden Monkey Cafe, said his 344-seat  restaurant will have such a program in place for its late-February opening.  </P> <P> Another Promenade restaurant, Chillers, has printed the phrase "Please don't  drink and drive" on plastic cups that customers can take home. That was part of  an agreement that owners had to make to get Roth to withdraw her protest of  their liquor license earlier this year.  </P> <P> Chillers, which attracts a college crowd, also provides a "party bus" on  Tuesday nights to provide transportation for UCLA and USC students.  </P> <P> Not all Promenade restaurant owners feel they have to go that far to promote  responsible drinking.  </P> <P> "Anything we can do to make everybody safe is good, but I'm not going to make  anyone wear a badge," said Jivan Tabibian, managing owner of Remi, a new  Italian restaurant.  </P></p>

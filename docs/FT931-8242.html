			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Vitro hit by sluggish growth in Mexico VITRO, the large Mexican glass company, yesterday announced net profits of 602m new pesos (Dollars 200m) last year, 11 per cent less in real terms than in 1991. Sales reached 10.32bn new pesos, a 2.4 per cent increase after inflation. The company blamed the fall in profits on the sluggish growth in Mexico and the US, higher domestic interest rates and real appreciation of the peso. Nearly half of Vitro's sales were in the US, making it particularly vulnerable to a strong peso and a weak US economy. During the year Vitro acquired two local glass companies - Vidriera Oriental and Alum de Mexico - and bought ACI of the US. Without these acquisitions, sales last year would have fallen by 3 per cent. Mr Ernesto Martens, chief executive, said 1992 was 'a complex period due to macroeconomic conditions', but said he hoped this year his company would consolidate dynamic growth, reduce the level of indebtedness, and improve productivity. Vitro's margins fell particularly sharply in the US, in part due to operating difficulties with Anchor Glass, its US subsidiary. Exports, however, reached Dollars 377m, an increase in dollar terms of 7.4 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BONDS WOULD LET GARDENA HELP 1ST-TIME HOME BUYERS  </P> <P> First-time home buyers in Gardena who earn as much as $70,000 annually will be  eligible to receive loans from the city under legislation passed last week by  state lawmakers.  </P> <P> The bill, authored by state Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), authorizes the city  to issue revenue bonds to raise money that would be lent to the home buyers  with flexible payment schedules.  </P> <P> Gardena officials say the legislation, which was initially opposed by  low-income housing advocates and still must be signed by the governor, will  allow the city to assist middle-class residents who otherwise would be forced  to buy in less expensive housing areas.  </P> <P> "My God, it takes a small fortune to get in," Councilman Jim Cragin said,  adding that his three sons were forced to purchase homes outside Gardena  because they could not afford to buy within the city.  </P> <P> "We have to be very conscious of that group of people who need homes and need  to get their feet on the ground," he said.  </P> <P> The legislation was approved by state senators on Friday. The next day,  legislators voted to put a $325-million bond proposal on the November ballot to  assist first-time home buyers and build low-cost housing statewide.  </P> <P> The state measure would calculate income limits on a different basis than the  Gardena program. Gardena officials say that, even if the proposal wins  statewide approval, Dills' legislation will provide Gardena with complete  autonomy.  </P> <P> "It's our program and we'll call the shots," said Michael Wapner, the city's  senior administrative assistant.  </P> <P> Dills' legislation initially would have applied to all cities statewide and was  staunchly opposed by low-income housing advocates. The advocates contended the  bill served a high-income group at a time when many cities have failed to make  substantial progress in meeting their state-mandated goals for low-income  housing.  </P> <P> However, the advocates took a neutral position when Dills amended the bill to  apply only to Gardena, which in recent years has taken steps to provide such  housing. For example, in 1985 the city, in what was hailed as a unique move,  issued revenue bonds to buy a mobile home park that was slated for demolition.  The park's tenants, many of them low-income, were allowed to remain.  </P> <P> City Manager Ken Landau said the legislation was necessary because the income  limits established previously by law would have precluded the city from selling  bonds and lending the money to home buyers whose incomes exceeded roughly  $47,000.  </P> <P> Under the approved legislation, however, first-time Gardena home buyers whose  incomes do not exceed 35% of the median purchase price of a home are eligible  to receive a city loan. Because the median-priced home in Gardena is about  $220,000, people whose household incomes range up to about $70,000 are  eligible.  </P> <P> Landau said details of the city's bond program have yet to be worked out, but  the legislation requires the home buyer to provide a down payment of at least  5%. Also, the buyer would have to qualify to meet the debt service on both the  city loan and the remainder of the mortgage. A first-time home buyer is defined  as anyone who has not owned a home during the previous three years.  </P> <P> The legislation also allows the city to delay a buyer's initial payments on the  city loan for up to five years and specifies that the mortgage contract cannot  exceed 40 years. The purchase price of homes cannot exceed the city's median  price.  </P> <P> Landau said Dills' legislation allows the city to lend up to 65% of the  purchase price, but city officials intend to lend only up to 15%.  </P> <P> Gardena officials say they do not know what interest rates borrowers might pay,  but they are confident the rates will be below those offered by conventional  banks or savings and loan institutions.  </P> <P> Although the city-backed bonds would be exempt from state taxes, they would be  federally taxable. One longtime legislative analyst, who did not want to be  identified, expressed doubts that the bonds would be attractive to  institutional buyers because they are subject to federal tax.  </P> <P> However, several city officials said they believe the bonds will be marketable,  largely because of the city's excellent credit rating.  </P> <P> Under the statewide proposal that will go before voters this fall, $200 million  would be used to help first-time home buyers obtain second mortgages at  low-interest rates. The state is authorized to issue loans with interest rates  as low as 3% to home buyers who can come up with a down payment of 5%. The  money from the state loan would be payable when the house is sold, refinanced  or paid off. Although the proposal does not specify a maximum state loan  amount, it is expected to be capped at $35,000.  </P> <P> Fred Noteware, director of programs for the California Housing Finance Agency,  which would administer the program, said first-time home buyers whose incomes  do not exceed 35% of the average resale price of a home in the county in which  they are buying would be eligible.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, where the average resale price is $171,000, the income  of a household with one or two persons could not exceed $59,900, Noteware said.  The price of the home could not be more than $171,000.  </P> <P> Households with three or more people are allowed to purchase a home costing 10%  more than the average resale price. In Los Angeles County, that means the price  could go up to $188,100, Noteware said.  </P> <P> "My feeling is this brings housing programs into the real world for high-cost  areas like Los Angeles County," Noteware said.  </P></p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank decision to ease repo rate provides limited relief THE BUNDESBANK's decision to ease its repo rate, a key money market interest rate, while leaving Germany's official discount rate and Lombard rate unchanged, provided some relief for Europe's government bond markets yesterday and prompted interest rate cuts in the Netherlands and Belgium. However, while bond market analysts said the 15 basis point cut in the repo rate to 8.6 per cent could help to reduce some of the tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism, some market participants were disappointed at the small size of the Bundesbank easing and at the decision to leave the official discount rate and Lombard rate unchanged at 8.25 per cent and 9.5 per cent respectively. The bond market reaction to the Bundesbank's easing was rather muted: after an initial rise in prices on the news, longer-dated German and French government bond prices ended the day slightly lower. Strong buying of German government bonds earlier this week on expectations of lower interest rates had helped to push up bund prices, and dealers said many investors decided to take profits yesterday. Continued good demand for two and three-year paper led to a further flattening of the German yield curve, dealers said. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, was quoted yesterday saying that the reduction in the central bank's 14-day securities repurchase tender rate from 8.75 per cent to 8.60 per cent was not a signal, but was a cont-inuation of the central bank's easing in monetary policy. News of further supply may have helped to depress the long end of the market, as the Finance Ministry said it would increase the size of the 8 per cent Unity Fund bond by DM2bn to give a total issue size of DM19bn. THE Bundesbank's easing helped to improve sentiment in the French government bond market, relieving some of the strain on the French franc, which closed stronger against the D-Mark. The yield on the 8.5 per cent bond due 2003 rose from 8.05 per cent to 8.09 per cent, while the futures contract on the Matif exchange in Paris closed at 112.64, down 0.16 from late Wednesday. The French government raised FFr16.457bn at its regular auction yesterday, including FFr10.71bn of the 8.50 per cent bond due 2003 at an average yield of 8.09 per cent. LONG-DATED UK government bonds fell back about a quarter point after the Bundesbank announced that it would lower its repo rate while leaving key German interest rates unchanged. Short-dated gilt prices held steady, helped by sterling's relative strength in the foreign exchange markets as the pound traded at around DM2.51 yesterday afternoon. Dealers said longer-dated gilts drifted lower on fears of new supply, with the market expecting the Bank of England to announce a new gilt auction shortly. However, estimates of how much funding the government needs to do in the remainder of this financial year vary. Mr Ifty Islam, economist with BZW, predicts that the Bank of England needs to issue about Pounds 2.25bn in new gilts, while Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, estimates that some Pounds 4.5bn of new gilt issuance remains to be achieved. JAPANESE government bonds closed higher, touching four-year highs in the cash and futures markets. Dealers noted strong investor buying across the yield curve, with the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moving from its opening level of 4.48 per cent to as low as 4.45 per cent before closing at 4.455 per cent. The March futures contract climbed from 108.47 to a high of 108.62, before ending at 108.59. The Ministry of Finance offered Y800bn of 10-year government bonds with a coupon of 4.8 per cent at auction, as expected. The coupon is the same as for the last 10-year auction stock - the No 153 - and the issues are expected to be merged to form a new 10-year benchmark eventually, dealers said. The auction had a relatively high bid-to-cover ratio of 6.56 per cent. The average bid price was 100.90 and the lowest accepted bid price was 100.85. A LARGER-than-expected fall in weekly jobless claims, continued worries about the impact on the market of fresh supply, and various technical factors, sent longer-dated US Treasuries reeling yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 3/16 at 102 1/16 , yielding 7.445 per cent. At the short end of the market, the declines were less marked, with the two-year note down  3/16 at 100, to yield 4.608 per cent. Record amounts of new corporate bond issues, plus the upcoming sale of new government securities, have depressed Treasury prices in recent days. The downward trend, however, was exacerbated by a string of good economic news, primarily the announcement that claims for state unemployment insurance fell 40,000 in the week ending December 26. Although analysts said that the holiday-shortened week was partly behind the big drop in claims, it did not explain all of the decline. Consequently, the data was taken as another indication that labour market conditions have been improving, and analysts said that the figures increased the likelihood that today's December employment report will show a significant increase in non-farm payrolls. The market was also unsettled by news of robust chain store sales, and by the latest ABC/Money Magazine consumer comfort index, which rose to the highest level since May 1991. Illiquid conditions, heavy selling the futures markets, and talk of big sellers of five-year notes and 30-year bonds, were also behind the afternoon declines.</p>

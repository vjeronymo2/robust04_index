			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good afternoon! This morning UN Special  Representative Alioune Blondin Beye left the Zambian capital for  Huambo and will later leave for Luanda. A source close to the  mediator told Radio Nacional that Alioune Blondin Beye will take  this opportunity to hold talks with President of the Republic  Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].  The source said the UN official will discuss two issues linked  to war in Angola: distribution of humanitarian aid and the  Angolan peace talks underway in Lusaka.    The UNITA negotiating team has also left for Huambo and it  is  presumed that this trip in within the framework of the usual  consultations with its leadership at a time when the Lusaka  talks are apparently at a standstill due to the intransigent  positions defended by Savimbi's team on the issue regarding the  installation of UNITA and its senior officials and the retention  of 76 foreign nationals by UNITA in Huambo, which over the past  two days has caused intense diplomatic movement.    Taking the advantage of the temporary suspension of the  talks, the government representatives left for Luanda and are  scheduled to return to Lusaka tomorrow.</p>

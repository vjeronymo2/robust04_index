			<p>BFN     [Text] [Pakistani] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali  has told the Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] ministerial meeting in  Cairo that the Kashmiri people's right to self-determination is  an acclaimed, undeniable, and irreversible truth and should not  be subjected to political expediency.    Addressing the meeting, the foreign minister stressed that  the process of self-determination must be completed by granting  the right of self-determination to the people of Jammu and  Kashmir, who are engaged in a relentless struggle against Indian  oppression. He said the cruelty that has been adopted to crush  the Kashmiri people's struggle is unparalleled in history. The  official machinery and institutions in occupied Kashmir have a  free hand to commit all sorts of atrocities to suppress the  people's aspirations. Torture, the molestation of women, the  death of people in detention, robbery, and the burning of  people's houses have become routine. These cruel activities are  being committed by the more than 500,000 occupation forces  deployed in occupied Kashmir.    The foreign minister also told the Non-Aligned Movement  ministerial meeting that massive attempts are being made to  misrepresent the indigenous uprising launched by the people of  Kashmir. Allegations are being made about foreign interference  and assistance in this regard. He reminded India that the light  of freedom has never been extinguished by oppression and terror.  He said this misleading and cruel policy is no answer to the  situation in occupied Kashmir. The only solution to the Kashmir  issue is to implement the UN Security Council resolution.</p>

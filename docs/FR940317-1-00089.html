This could also occur where the employee is working for another Federal agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Furthermore, dual purpose situations are commonplace where benefits to the Government and the member or employee may or may not be concurrent; for example, use of privately owned vehicles at or away from assigned duty station, or permanent change of station with delay en route. (See subpart E for the handling of certain claims arising out of nonscope activities of members of the Army.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.72  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Law applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The whole law of the place where the act or omission occurred, including choice of law rules, will be applied in the determining liability and quantum.

(See &sect;&sect;536.28 and 536.29.) If the issue of indemnity or contribution is not satisfactorily adjusted, the claim will be compromised or settled only after consultation with the Department of Justice as provided in &sect;536.75(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims for indemnity or contribution. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Claims for indemnity or contribution from the United States will be compromised or settled under this chapter, if liability exists under the applicable law, provided the incident giving rise to such claim is otherwise cognizable under this chapter. As to such claims where the exclusivity provisions of the FECA may be applicable, see &sect;536.75(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ARNG vehicular claims. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) When a vehicle used by the ARNG, or a POV operated by a member or employee of the ARNG, is involved in an incident under circumstances that make this chapter applicable to the disposition of administrative claims against the United States and results in personal injury, death, or property damage, and a remedy against the State, or its insurer is indicated, the responsible area claims authority will monitor the action against the State or its insurer and encourage direct settlement between the claimant and the State or its insurer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Where the State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials rather than the insurer is desirable. Regular procedures will be established and followed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on by both local authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrence by Commander, USARCS. Such procedures will be designed to ensure that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for processing claims and, whenever possible and in accordance with governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement for disposition of such claims as in paragraph (d) of this section is worked out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) Amounts recovered or recoverable by claimant from any insurer (other than claimant's insurer who has obtained no subrogated interest against the United States) will be deducted from the amount otherwise payable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims arising out of training activities of NG personnel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Contribution may be sought from the State involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where it has waived sovereign immunity or has private insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would cover the incident giving rise to the particular claim. Where the State involved rejects the request for contribution, the file will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, is authorized to enter into an agreement with a State, territory, or commonwealth to share settlement costs of claims generated by the ARNG personnel or activities of that political entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims not payable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusions listed in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680. The remainder are based either on statute or court decisions. The interpretation of these exclusions is a Federal question to be decided under Federal law; for example, the tort of assault and battery listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(h) should be interpreted in accordance with Federal common law principles, and where State law differs, the former will prevail.

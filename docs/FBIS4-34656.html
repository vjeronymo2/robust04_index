			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Celso Pinto and Fernando Abrucio: "Surprises in </F> `Who's Who' of PT Administration"]    [Text] Sao Paulo -- Aloizio Mercadante is regarded as the  potential minister of finance in a PT [Workers Party]  administration, but if he is appointed to that post, he will  have to face strong opposition from within the party. For his  part, economist Jorge Mattoso is not well-known to the public,  but he has a good chance of occupying "a prominent position in  the economic area in a probable Lula administration."    Precisely because of its assumption that a good many of its  clients --important businessmen and bankers -- do not know about  the PT's internal resistance to Mercadante or who Mattoso is,  the Rosenberg Consultancy has prepared a report on what the PT's  factions think and what its program is and listed the top people  in the party. That "Who's Who" of the PT describes the 138  prominent figures who are either in the party or close to it and  assesses their chances for being part of a Lula administration.    Luiz Paulo Rosenberg, a former adviser to Delfim Netto (when  the latter was minister of finance) and to former President Jose  Sarney, takes a pragmatic view of the matter. Since there is a  reasonable chance that Lula will be elected, he feels that it is  time for businessmen to stop complaining about the PT and start  getting better acquainted with the party and its people.    To help prepare his report, he hired Wladimir Pomar of the  PT  Executive Committee. Pomar, who was general coordinator of the  PT's campaign in 1989 and is involved in the current campaign,  is "ideologically a democratic socialist," according to the  description in "Who's Who." The report's general assessment of  the PT and its program is far from being apocalyptic.    Rosenberg personally is convinced that a Lula administration  "will not be a disaster." He feels that Lula will be a  combination of Argentine President Carlos Menem, although not as  pragmatic, and Socialist French President Francois Mitterrand  "in his doctrinaire stuffiness." In other words, he will end up  adjusting pragmatically to reality and its limitations. "Lula is  not another Alan Garcia," says Rosenberg, referring to the  former Peruvian president whose populist policy led his country  into bankruptcy.    The history of the PT and its internal disputes involves a  tangle of acronyms, realignments, and breakups. The current  picture as described in the report involves eight main groups:    1. Alliance (now called Alliance in Struggle), comprising  30 percent of the party. Uniting Christian socialists, social  democrats, democratic socialists, and pragmatics, it occupies  the center-right in the party.    2. Leftist Alliance (now called Leftist Option): 23  percent of the party. Uniting Christian socialists, democratic  socialists, revolutionary socialists, and pragmatics, it  combines the center and the center-left.    3. Socialist Democracy (now part of the Leftist Option):  11 percent of the party. A combination of democratic socialists,  revolutionary socialists, and Trotskyites, it is obviously  further to the left.    4. Socialist Force (now part of the "In the PT Struggle"  faction): 10 percent of the party. It comprises democratic  socialists and revolutionary socialists. "In the PT Struggle"  unites the factions further to the left and "Shiites."    5. Labor (of "In the PT Struggle"): 5 percent of the  party. A combination of revolutionary socialists and Trotskyites.    6. Socialist Component ("In the PT Struggle"): 3 percent  of the party. A combination of Christian socialists and  revolutionary socialists.    7. Plan for Brazil (now called Radical Democracy): 11  percent of the party. It unites neoliberals, social democrats,  democratic socialists, Christian socialists, and pragmatics.  Comprises the PT's right-wing groups.    8. Independents: 7 percent of the party. These are  individuals or groups that have no ties with factions; they  cover the entire spectrum from right to left in the party.    Anyone adding up the figures based on this picture will  conclude that the Left predominates. But the report is more  cautious.    "Looking at things realistically, Leftist Alliance and  Socialist Democracy (grouped together in Leftist Option)  represent the center and the center-left. They are the pendulum  in the PT's political spectrum. By allying themselves with part  of the "In the PT Struggle" movement, they are seeking basically  to ensure their hegemony in the party machinery and prevent the  former Alliance, with which they still have many points in  common, from uniting with Radical Democracy completely and  moving the PT all the way to the right. In practice, that center  seems to be acting as the point of equilibrium preventing the  "Shiite" wings from becoming a center of attraction for the  party's rank and file -- something that was in fact happening as  a result of the Alliance's move in the direction of Plan for  Brazil (now called Radical Democracy)," says the report.    The report admits that that kind of reasoning is very  different from the analysis usually found in the media, which  are in the habit of describing the PT as a party dominated by  the "Shiites." The report observes that presenting it in that  way may be useful as a weapon in anti-PT propaganda but that it  is also deceptive."This has probably done more to confuse the  PT's opponents themselves, since those analyses are of little  value if they are to be used in the strategic battle or if they  are to serve as reference points in dialogue and negotiation,"  the report argues.    In its extensive analysis of the PT's platform, the report  shows that on several points it is much more moderate and  realistic than the 1989 platform. It represents a compromise  among the various factions, which are currently divided on two  issues: 1) the chief reforms that a PT administration should  introduce, and 2) attitudes toward such controversial issues as  agrarian reform, the role of the state, monopolies,  privatization, inflation, foreign debt, an opening up to trade,  foreign capital, fiscal and tax reforms, education, science and  technology, and public policies.    As described in the report, the thinking of the Radical  Democracy faction is to a large extent indistinguishable from  that of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. It wants to  stabilize and modernize the economy, reduce state monopolies as  much as possible, and privatize. It supports fiscal reform,  favors rural settlements but opposes the invasion of property,  and favors an opening up to the rest of the world (although with  some control over foreign capital). Federal Deputy Jose Genoino  belongs to this faction.    The Alliance faction is divided. Some of its members support  Radical Democracy, while others want more thoroughgoing reforms.  The Leftist Alliance wants a mass market. It also wants to  change the profile of rural and urban production and preserve an  important role for the state. The other factions polarize around  leftist ideas. "Who's Who" has several surprises for anyone not  familiar with the party. The report points out that Mercadante,  for example, "is accused of being one of the current defenders  of policies approaching neoliberalism on the issues of foreign  capital, negotiation of the foreign debt, and stabilization  policies, even though his stands on those issues are more  complex." Hence the resistance that will arise in the party if  Lula appoints him minister of finance.    Another of the PT's public stars in the economic area,  Senator Eduardo Suplicy, is described in tough terms. "He has a  great feel for creating political events and appearing in the  media...and charisma in the eyes of part of the population.  Despite that, his influence inside the PT is relative. He seems  to have no preconceived ideas on the most controversial issues,  but simply sticks to the middle way when it comes to opinions."  He is not mentioned as a possible candidate for a post in Lula's  administration.    Several of the individuals mentioned as possible occupants  of  important posts in the economic area do not come as a surprise:  businessman Oded Grajew, who is involved in Lula's campaign;  Professors Paul Singer and Francisco de Oliveira; Maria da  Conceicao Tavares; and Paulo Nogueira Batista, Jr. (although not  a member, he is often consulted by the party). Jose Marcio  Camargo, an economics professor in Rio de Janeiro, and Jose  Graziano da Silva, an agricultural expert, are likely to be  members of a PT administration.    Several other individuals who are also prominently mentioned  are much less familiar to the public. In the economic area,  besides Jorge Mattoso, whom we have already mentioned, there is  Cesar Benjamin, who is one of the coordinators of the party  platform, a member of the Leftist Alliance faction, and one of  the chief supporters of the introduction of a mass market.  Another economist who is not well known to the public but who  may be given a post is Carlos Eduardo Carvalho, coordinator of  the 1989 platform. He is a "democratic socialist" who tends to  side with the Leftist Alliance on tactical issues.    Marco Aurelio Garcia, a prominent adviser to Lula, is  mentioned as the probable minister of foreign affairs.  Geographer Aziz Ab'Saber may be a star in the area of the  environment. Benedita da Silva and Herbert de Souza ("Betinho")  may be important in the social area. Santos Mayor David  Capistrano and Leoncio Feitosa (of the parallel government) may  be given key positions in the Ministry of Health.    Luiz Soares Dulci of the Minas Gerais National Directorate  and the Alliance faction "will probably be given an important  post in a Lula administration." So will physicist Luiz Pinguelli  Rosa and Prof. Emir Sader. Philosopher Leandro Konder is tipped  for the cultural area, and journalist Perseu Abramo is seen in  some sort of direct advisory capacity in the Office of the  President.    Among the party's well-known politicians who may occupy  federal posts, the following are mentioned, among others: Plinio  de Arruda Sampaio, Jose Dirceu (if he loses the gubernatorial  race in Sao Paulo), Rui Falcao, Jose Genoino, Luiz Gushiken,  Jorge Bittar (if he loses the gubernatorial race in Rio de  Janeiro), and Vladimir Palmeira. Also mentioned are jurists  Dalmo Dallari, Fabio Konder Comparato, Raymundo Faoro, and Helio  Bicudo.    If there is a PT administration, it will not only change the  government radically but also cause a substantial increase in  the size of businessmen's lists of telephone numbers.  <H5>  "Plan Will Obstruct Future Administration" </H5>   Sao Paulo -- The national president of the Workers Party  (PT), Rui Falcao, said last Friday that "the big problem with  the economic plan is that it may obstruct action by the future  administration, especially if it causes a recession." When asked  whether Lula's campaign managers were concerned about the  benefits that the stabilization plan might have for presidential  candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Falcao answered: "What we  are concerned about are the perverse effects that introducing  the real may have, particularly from the standpoint of  unemployment."    But despite saying that the PT does not fear the  stabilization plan's possible effects on the election, Falcao  asserted that "this new plan is as much a vote-getting ploy as  the Cruzado Plan was, and the fact that the real banknotes are  being printed with Fernando Henrique's name on them is  conclusive proof of that."    Falcao also said: "The government's economic plan would not  be a vote-getting ploy only if structural reforms were included  among its goals, which is what the PT is doing in its plan for  government."    Among the structural reforms listed by Falcao, the most  important are agrarian reform and employment. To deal with that  last-named problem, the party has introduced the Plan for Impact  on Unemployment under the coordination of Deputy Aloizio  Mercadante. The PT's plan for combating unemployment will  earmark $25 billion for promoting the creation of 8 million  jobs. The money will come from the Social and Constitutional  Funds and from budget allocations from the National Treasury,  according to the Globo Agency.    The most important official topic at the meeting was the  possibility of alliances in three states: Santa Catarina,  Rondonia, and Bahia. In the case of Santa Catarina, the PT wants  to support Senator Nelson Wedekin of the PDT [Democratic Labor  Party], provided that PT members Milton Mendes de Oliveira and  Luci Choinacki can run respectively for lieutenant governor and  for one of the vacancies in the Senate.    In the case of Rondonia, the PT National Executive Committee  decided by a vote of 10 to three to uphold the resolution passed  at the party's Ninth National Convention, which stipulated that  the regional directorate should "lay the foundations enabling  the PT to present its own candidate."    The stand taken by the PT Executive Committee was motivated  by the decision by the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party] in Rondonia to support the candidacy of Orestes Quercia.    In Bahia, the situation is too complicated for the PT  leadership. The reason is that while the executive committee  wants to develop support for the candidacy of Jutahy Magalhaes  of the PSDB, most of the PT in Bahia wants to run a PT candidate  and is suggesting the name of Zezeu Ribeiro.    To get around the problem, the Bahia PT is suggesting that  Lula campaign for all three candidates: Zezeu Ribeiro for the  PT, Jutahy Magalhaes for the PSDB, and the current front-runner  in the polls, Joao Durval of the PMN [National Mobilization  Party]. Joao Durval was launched in politics by former Governor  Antonio Carlos Magalhaes of the PFL [Liberal Front Party].</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> The Tin Drum (TNT Sunday at 7 p.m.): Volker Schlondorff's superb, Oscar-winning  parable about the Nazi era, adapted from the Gunter Grass novel and starring  12-year-old David Bennent as a ferocious 3-year-old who stops growing when the  Nazis come to power. (3:10)  </P> <P> The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (Bravo Sunday at 10:30 p.m.): Vittorio De  Sica's remarkable Oscar winner illuminates the plight of the Jews under  Mussolini in which their tragic predicament serves as a background for a  poignant, ill-fated romance and an eloquent, never sentimental evocation of a  privileged, insulated way of life destroyed by World War II. (2:00)  </P> <P> Mephisto (A&amp;E Tuesday at 6 p.m., again at 10 p.m.; Saturday at 1 a.m.):  Istvan Szabo's dazzling Oscar winner in which a bravura actor (the brilliant  Klaus Maria Brandauer), whose most famous role is Mephistopheles, sells his  soul in return for stardom in Nazi Germany. (3:00)  </P> <P> Modern Romance (Channel 13 Wednesday at 10 a.m.): Albert Brooks' 1981 romantic  comedy, in which he plays a Hollywood film editor so smotheringly enamored of  bank official Kathryn Harrold that he makes their lives miserable. A fresh and  acute vision of life and of self from a distinctive talent. (2:00)  </P> <P> Rude Boy (TMC Saturday at 4 a.m.): Jack Hazan's raw, scruffy 1980  semi-documentary is about an actual British working-class rebel who becomes a  roadie with a punk rock band. (2:05)  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "President Thanks Outgoing Premier, </F> Labor Minister"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, May 1 -- Head of State Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro praised the outgoing premier, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, for  what he said were his "enormous labors" on the employment front  and the "exceptional time" of the historic wage pact signed at  the end of July last year by the three trade union  confederations, the government and business and industry  representatives.    Speaking today in the Presidential Quirinale Palace at a  Labor Day ceremony for the award of "stars of merit" to new  "masters of labor" from the Lazio and Umbria regions, the  president extended his glowing words to include the labor  minister in Ciampi's cabinet, Gino Giugni, and the activities of  the government installed at the end of April last year.    Addressing the gathering which included Ciampi and Giugni,  Scalfaro recalled the "burst of applause" of the constituent  assembly of the republic on hearing of the constitutional  definition of Italy as a republic "founded on labor."    "A fine definition because it lends dignity, defends the  dignity of man. And this is where thanks are added, thanks due  as an act of justice from the head of state to Premier Ciampi,"  added the president.    The labor minister, who spoke earlier, defined "the great  cooperation agreement between the government and the labor and  business sides" signed July 23 last year as "a genuine social  pact" and voiced the hope that "this experience will be  prolonged under the sign of continuity in the new phase  beginning."    Recalling his year in office, Giugni referred to the 70,000  workers "in excess," especially those on the workforces of the  automaker Fiat, Ing. C. Olivetti SpA and at the Enichem plant in  the southern city of Crotone and named this problem as not only  Italian but European and world-wide. [passage omitted]</p>

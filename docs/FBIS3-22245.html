			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [``na''-signed report: ``Decrease of Public Share To Be </F> Yardstick for Financial Policy Decisions'']    [Text] Duesseldorf -- In its basic program, to be adopted  at the fifth all-German party conference between 21 and 23  February, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will enlarge its  policy model of social market economy by an ecological  dimension. The new basic party program advocates an  ``ecological and social market economy.''    The party's new basic program will realize and update the  existing basic program, adopted at the Ludwigshafen party  conference in 1978. The party conference submission commission  rejected proposals by the Christian-Social workers and several  land organizations that had spoken out against expanding the  term ``social market economy'' to read ``ecological and social  market economy.'' The ecological extension of the social market  economy is one of the most important innovations the basic  program has seen.    The draft program that the delegates have been recommended  to  adopt says that the CDU wants to step up the use of market  economy instruments and control mechanisms in order to achieve a  more gentle treatment of nature and the environment. The  objective of the ecological and social market economy is  combining economy, social justice, and ecology.    The CDU considers the principles of polluter and precaution  the basis of an ecological order. It calls for a system where  producers and consumers meet the costs resulting from their  failures in environmental precaution and from using the  environment. This can only be guaranteed if the costs result in  honest prices. With this, the CDU wants to stimulate and  encourage people to be gentle on the environment.  <H5>  Ecology in Tax Law </H5>   Based on the individual's responsibility in the ecological  and social market economy, the CDU speaks out on using all  cooperation opportunities before implementing government  regulations. But it leaves no doubt that ecological regulations  with legal orders and prohibitions, critical values,  requirements, and licensing procedures are necessary to  efficiently tackle the immediate danger to humans and the  environment.    But in order to increasingly use industry's efficiency and  innovativeness to serve the environment, the CDU wants to  increase the use of ecological control elements in the tax law,  environmental fees, compensation regulations, and liability  rules.    The CDU basic program also reflects the intensive debate on  Germany as a business location. The draft program says that as  a country with a scarce supply of raw materials and high labor  costs, Germany relies heavily on the efficiency and  innovativeness of its people and industry. ``With our capacity  to achieve the top results we have to concentrate on top quality  products and production methods. The cycles of technological  progress are becoming ever shorter, requiring a speeding up of  innovations.''  <H5>  Strengthening Business Location Germany </H5>   For this reason, Germany's competitiveness as a business  location depends very much on high standards in research and  development, as well as the use of new technologies such as  biological and genetic engineering, information and  environmental technologies. Environment-friendly products and  technologies will be very important in the future. ``By further  developing our economy to become an ecological and social market  economy we can both strengthen our leading role in the field of  environmental technologies and secure an important advantage for  the future.''    In order to strengthen Germany standing as a business  location, the CDU suggests:    -- Decreasing the public share and cutting taxes and fees;    -- Improving education and vocational training, science and  research, and its infrastructure;    -- Promoting future-oriented technologies and environmental  protection;    -- Privatizing and cutting subsidies;    -- Deregulating and decreasing bureaucratic regulations and  requirements, and speeding up licensing procedures;    -- Introducing more flexible working hours and longer  machine- operating hours;    -- Improving information and transport infrastructures;    -- In particular, securing social peace and social  partnership.    The program turns against protectionism. It says that  Germany as an export-oriented industrial nation depends on free  trade. Protectionism blocks the dynamics of the economy and  prevents innovation.    The consequences of reunification are mainly described in  the  basic program's chapters on fiscal and financial policy. These  chapters say that the framework conditions of financial policy  changed drastically for a longer period of time following  reunification. ``In order to promote the growing together of  Germany at a high speed, we have had to put up with higher  public debts, an increase in the public share, taxes and public  expenditure for a certain period of time. This must, however,  be followed by reducing indebtedness, consolidating all public  households, reducing the public share in the gross national  product, and easing the tax burden in the medium term. The  draft says that a reduction of the public share with  consolidated public households is the yardstick for all fiscal  policy decisions.  The CDU wants to create the conditions for reducing debt by  redefining public tasks.'' ``We will have to redefine  priorities in the public services, what the state and social  insurance systems can do, which public services can be  controlled via market relations, and which services we will have  to cut.'' The CDU considers structural changes and shifts, cuts  in spending, and higher efficiency necessary. ``By  deregulating, cutting bureaucracy, and privatizing we want to  make public services more efficient and cost-effective.'' The  CDU wants to increase the share of public tasks that are  financed by special funds, such as prices and fees, and  co-insurance. Also, it calls for a comprehensive cut in  subsidies. Subsidies should be limited in time and be  digressive.    In order to increase clarity and justice, and to simplify  administration procedures, the CDU wants to link the tax system  and social benefits that are not based on contributions.  <H5>  Tax Burden To Be Cut </H5>   In the medium term, the CDU wants to reduce the overall tax  burden and restructure the tax system. The draft program says  that the direct tax burden on productive factors such as capital  and labor is too high. ``We want lower direct tax rates, but a  broad tax base with less concessions and exemptions.'' This is,  at the same time, a simplification, and thus increases tax  equity. The CDU says that it will have to increase taxes on  consumption, especially energy consumption and environmental  fees. ``By restructuring the tax system along economic and  ecological lines, we are setting the course for further  development of the ecological and social market economy.''    In terms of taxes, real capital must not be at a  disadvantage  in relation to financing capital. The CDU wants to cut  nonprofit-linked taxes and to speed up the harmonization of  taxes within the European Union.</p>

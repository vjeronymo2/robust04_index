			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Chernichenko, chairman of the Peasant </F> Party of Russia: "Our Choice"]    [Text] To the chairmen of oblast, kray, and rayon  organizations of the KPR [Peasant Party of Russia], and to  members and friends of the Peasant Party of Russia.    The Peasant Party of Russia is faced with a major test. The  first elections of the organs of local authority on a multiparty  basis are drawing near.    Local elections are our elections. Find and nominate  candidates for each seat in the oblast duma and in rayon-village  organs of authority. Farmers, do not shun your nomination:  Leaving authority to the communists will turn into your leaving  your own land. Mobilize resources for the election  campaign--your own, peasant, and the offerings of sympathizers.  Agitation for a candidate should be simple, easy to understand,  and take place everywhere. Our leaflet should be in the rural  store, and our conversation--at the well, in the farmyard, and  in the workshop. Do not go on the defense; the best defense is  offense. Your candidates are worthy, respectable, and reliable  people; your agitation is just; the farmer movement is  liberation. Be able to explain to a kolkhoz woman on pension her  benefits from owning a share of land, try to gain the support of  all honorable workers, and do not be afraid to talk about the  obvious vices of the Agrogulag--the universal theft,  drunkenness, laziness, deceit, and corruption. The people know  everything, be the yeast in the dough.    The party of free peasants will be opposed by the team of  communists and agrarian bosses of the refurbished kolkhozes.  There are a lot of industrious and knowledgeable people among  them, but this does not change the fundamentals. We are for free  labor on our own land, and they are for the preservation of the  Agrogulag.    Rural life is such that the support of one head of  administration is dearer than all the president's edicts. A  village elder headman elected from the farmer movement can  create the conditions of life and labor for hundreds of people.  But a loss in the elections can echo with the ruin of strong  farms. As it is, bankruptcy among farmers is extremely high. In  1993, 87,100 individual farms were established, which is less  than in 1992 by a factor of 1.5, while in 1993, 19,200 farms  broke up, which is more than in 1992 by a factor of 3.8.    Local elections are a test of our political will and  maturity. Do not spare any efforts--victory will come!    [Signed] Yuriy Chernichenko, chairman of the Peasant Party  of  Russia, KPR executive committee.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yingchun (3769 6601 2504)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- According to the "Plan  for the Organization, Establishment, and Operation of the State  Development Bank" approved by the State Council, the People's  Construction Bank of China has been entrusted to handle the  payment of policy-leading loans extended by the State  Development Bank. A proxy-signing ceremony for the business was  held in Beijing today; the proxy was signed separately by Yao  Zhenyan, State Development Bank president, and by Wang Qishan,  president of the People's Construction Bank.    The State Council recently gave a formal approval to the  State Development Bank's establishment. The new bank's  establishment is an important measure in the reform of China's  investment system, as well as an important part of the reform of  the banking system. The State Development Bank, as a  policy-leading state banking facility, will strive to build an  investment restraining mechanism and a bank loan risk  responsibility mechanism. It will create a stable, long-term  source of funds, raise funds from the society for the  construction of key state construction projects, guide funds  from the society into the construction of key state construction  projects, and control the fund source to regulate the total  amount and pattern of state investment and to enhance investment  efficiency. After discontinuing its policy-leading banking  business, the People's Construction Bank of China will become a  state commercial bank with medium-term and long-term loans as  its main business, and it will handle the payment of  policy-leading loans extended by the State Development Bank.    Yao Zhenyan said during the proxy-signing ceremony: It is  important to find a proper proxy for handling the policy-leading  loans and the task is very arduous; and I believe that the  construction bank can do the job well because it is experienced  in managing fixed assets investment. Wang Qishan said the  construction bank and the development bank share the objectives  of promoting reform, supporting key construction projects,  improving macroeconomic regulation and control, and enhancing  investment efficiency, and that the construction bank will do  its best to provide good service and handle well the business  entrusted to it by the State Development Bank. The two banks  agreed to cooperate, support, and coordinate with each other,  and to contribute to bringing about a sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy.    After a consultation, the State Development Bank entrusted  the Construction Bank to supervise the execution of loan  contracts, handle loan and fund payment businesses, supervise  the use of loans, and assist in recovering loans. The two banks  reached an agreement on defining their responsibility, rights,  and monetary business procedures.    Present at the signing ceremony were leading comrades of the  State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade  Commission, the State Economic Restructuring Commission, the  Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China.</p>

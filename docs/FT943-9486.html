			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Oman hands big gas field to joint venture Oman yesterday signed an agreement dedicating output of its natural gas fields to Oman Liquefied Natural Gas (ONLG), the joint venture by the state-owned oil company and a consortium of foreign energy companies. The government of the Gulf state said that the deal represented a milestone in the development of its proposed Dollars 9bn liquefied natural gas plan, which is one of the biggest energy projects of the region. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the state-owned oil company, said the agreement 'demonstrates the resolve of the government of Oman and its private oil industry partners to progress the project with due speed, and bring the LNG to market as quickly as possible.' The deal, covering 7,000bn cubic feet of proven and recoverable gas reserves, is with Oman Liquefied Natural Gas (OLNG), a company established this year by royal decree and 51 per cent owned by the Oman government. Other partners are Shell (34 per cent), Total (6 per cent), Mitsubishi and Mitsui (3 per cent each), Partex (2 per cent) and Itochu (1 per cent). The gas fields are owned by the government and operated by PDO. The LNG plant is to start in the year 2000 with annual output of 6.2m tonnes. Preliminary work will start this year, and pre-qualified contractors will be bidding to build the downstream facilities in the middle of next year, so as to let the contract be awarded in 1996. The plant is to be at Al Ghalilah, near Sur. The LNG project is the largest industrial enterprise embarked on by Oman. It envisages the production of 900m cu ft of gas a day in central Oman, and transportation over 360km to the liquefication plant where it will be loaded on to specially built tankers for shipment to customers in Asia and southern Europe. Much of the output is expected to go to Japan, the world's largest importer of LNG. Oman, whose oil reserves are dwindling, expects that, once the LNG plant is in full operation, the value of its gas business will equal that of oil and eventually overtake it. A Dollars 5m pipeline to transport gas from Oman to India is under consideration.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Clinton decision on Vietnam trade soon President Bill Clinton will decide 'within the next several days' whether to lift the 19-year-old US embargo on trade with Vietnam, he said yesterday. Virtually all Mr Clinton's advisers are urging him to resume trade links with Vietnam, and the US Senate last week gave the president political backing for the move by voting heavily in favour of a resolution urging an end to the embargo. But to do so will bring down the implacable hostility of veterans' organisations and groups representing the families of servicemen listed as missing in action (MIAs) during the Vietnam war. Mr Clinton himself, to the ire of many veterans, evaded military service in Vietnam. The US embarked three years ago on a slow journey towards normal relations with Vietnam. The Bush administration offered the Hanoi government a 'road map' linking progress towards the establishment of a peacefully elected government in neighbouring Cambodia, and towards full accounting for MIAs, with economic and diplomatic concessions from the US. A new Cambodian government is now in place - fulfilling the fourth and final phase of the US road map - and Vietnamese co-operation in tracing the remains of MIAs has been, according to the US taskforce in Vietnam, excellent. But the US has still not lifted its embargo, foreseen in phase three, let alone allowed full normalisation of economic and diplomatic relations, as laid out for phase four. 'The road map policy for normalisation established by the Bush administration was intended to answer the charge that the US was always moving the goalposts for normalisation. It would be unfair, and beneath the dignity of the US, to do so again,' said Senator John McCain, a decorated Navy pilot who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and who was one of the leaders behind last week's Senate resolution. Mr Clinton last year dropped US opposition to Vietnam's reinstatement as a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and US companies are now allowed to bid on projects sponsored by the multilateral development banks. Over 30 have opened offices in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. US companies are champing at the bit to take advantage of what many see as potentially one of Asia's most promising market opportunities. The US Justice Department has found no grounds for prosecution of Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, on charges that he had accepted Dollars 700,000 (Pounds 467,000) to help lift the US embargo on trade with Vietnam. Justice's criminal division told Mr Brown's lawyers that it was closing its investigation into the allegations, made by a Vietnamese-American businessman, and said no further investigation was warranted.</p>

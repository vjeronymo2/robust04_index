			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Iraq told to name nuclear suppliers UNITED Nations nuclear inspectors say Iraq must reveal how it procured vital material and equipment used in its nuclear weapons programme before there is any chance of declaring Baghdad in compliance with UN Gulf war ceasefire terms. In particular, UN inspectors say Iraq must explain where it acquired 100 tonnes of maraging steel, a special alloy used in construction of uranium enrichment centrifuges, and 20 carbon fibre rotors, also used in the enrichment process. Mr Maurizio Zifferero, head of the UN team investigating Iraq's nuclear programme, said he was seeking assistance from countries or companies which might have supplied these. He said Iraq must also identify the technical specialists who advised Baghdad on its advanced nuclear programme. The UN inspectors believe that a handful of key foreign specialists, possibly retired from the nuclear industry, provided Iraq with technical expertise. The Italian scientist, based in the International Atomic Energy Agency headquarters in Vienna, said that until his inspectors had a clear idea of Iraq's procurement system, they could never be confident that they had uncovered the full extent of Iraq's nuclear weapons-building programme. He said that despite Iraq's improved co-operation with UN inspectors, some important inconsistencies remained in what had so far been either uncovered or revealed. Mr Zifferero nevertheless said he was satisfied with the co-operation of Iraqi officials during the 11th and latest UN nuclear inspection mission to Iraq, which oversaw destruction of buildings in the Al Atheer complex south of Baghdad, said to be central to development of an enriched uranium weapon. However, he said Iraq was still 'stonewalling' on its procurement programme.</p>

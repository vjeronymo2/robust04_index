			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Voters inspired to stay at home VOTER turnout for yesterday's general election fell to a near record low, suggesting that the political fervour of the campaign was not enough to inspire some Japanese to make a trip to the polling stations. Before the election, the furore over the fall of the government seemed to heighten interest among the electorate. However, only an estimated 67.2 per cent turned out to the polls. The figure is 6 percentage points lower than the previous election in 1990 and 5 points lower than the average of the past 18 elections. While some analysts blamed a televised sumo final and bad weather, the lack of issues directly concerning the ordinary voter is seen as the main reason for the low interest. Calls for political reform dominated the platforms of most parties, and some voters seemed to be turned off by the absence of debate over issues such as tax reform and the controversial dispatch of Japanese troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Polls taken just before the election indicated that 43 per cent of the electorate had not decided who to vote for. The new reformist parties which have splintered from the ruling Liberal Democratic party has confused many voters. Apathy was most prominent among urban voters, with the turnout around or below 60 per cent in Tokyo and surrounding areas such as Chiba and Saitama. In contrast, rural Japan, which has a high proportion of faithful LDP supporters, saw a large turnout. Over 77 per cent visited the polls in Shimane, the constituency of Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister.</p>

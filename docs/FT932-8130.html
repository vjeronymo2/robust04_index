			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / People: The Body Shop John Jackson, operations director of the Body Shop, the natural toiletries and cosmetics group, has left the company after five years. The company said yesterday there was 'no drama and curiosity' in his resignation, which did not result from any disagreement. It said Jackson felt he had achieved all he could with the company, and was looking for new challenges, perhaps in the shape of a chief executive's position - a post that is not vacant at Body Shop. Jackson was not available for comment. Jackson joined Body Shop from Chesebrough Pond's, the cosmetics subsidiary of Unilever, in 1988. He has been closely involved with the reorganisation of the Body Shop into seven distinct divisions - comprising UK, US and worldwide retailing, and the company's production and warehouse operations, soapworks, make-up and cosmetics divisions - which was completed last autumn. Body Shop said Jackson would continue to work with chairman Gordon Roddick on the Big Issue, the magazine whose proceeds go towards helping the homeless.</p>

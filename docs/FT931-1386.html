			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Yeltsin tipped to win vote THE mood among Russian deputies yesterday was uncertain, but most signs suggested anti-Yeltsin forces will struggle to get the 689 votes in Congress for the two-thirds majority needed to impeach him. Mr Nikolai Pavlov, a member of the fiercely anti-Yeltsin bloc, Russian Unity, said the chances of impeachment were minimal. The US TV network ABC quoted a Yeltsin opponent saying: 'We only have 600 votes.' Mr Yeltsin can rely on support from the Radical Democratic and Democratic Russia blocs, and can be fairly certain that all in the Union of Creative Forces and absolutely certain that all in Russian Unity will vote against him. The Democratic Centre is the group to play for. It includes the left centre grouping of Mr Victor Sheinis on the one side and the Free Russia faction of vice-president Alexander Rutskoi on the other. Mr Sheinis generally supports the president, while General Rutskoi has come out strongly against Mr Yeltsin's assumption of special powers. The ingredient which will work for Mr Yeltsin, if impeachment is put to the vote tomorrow, is fear. Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov, chairman of the Council of Nationalities, said: 'It's all very well being a hero but the heroism being shown will be at the expense of the destruction of Russia.' He called for compromise. So numerous have been the warnings of civil war that some impressionable and wavering deputies from provincial constituencies are bound to be affected, and vote not to punish Mr Yeltsin. Further, his milder opponents could be swayed by the continuing impression that he retains popular support. An opinion poll in the strongly pro-Yeltsin daily Izvestia yesterday showed Mr Yeltsin with a 50 per cent approval rating against 9 per cent for General Rutskoi. Nearly 60 per cent said Mr Yeltsin's assumption of special powers was either correct (49 per cent) or not tough enough (22 per cent). One view last night was that an impeachment vote might backfire. Mr Vladimir Varov, an influential radical from St Petersburg, said: 'I don't object at all if the anti-Yeltsinites get two thirds. It would show up the Congress for what they are. And it they tried any action against the president I'm sure the people would put on an equally suitable reaction.'</p>

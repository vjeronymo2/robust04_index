			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: First Leisure shares fall despite advance to Pounds 14m First Leisure yesterday announced interim profits up 16 per cent to Pounds 14.1m pre-tax, but warned that there was still no sign of a substantial upturn in consumer spending. Mr John Conlan, chief executive of the discotheques, bowling and tourist attractions group, said consumers did appear to be going out more and spending more. He added that market conditions were more encouraging than they had been for some time, but he said: 'What we haven't seen is a boom around the corner. We shouldn't over-anticipate the speed and scale of the recovery.' The City reacted badly to the announcement, marking First Leisure's shares down 19p to 289p. Analysts said this was more of a comment on the prospects for leisure spending generally than on First Leisure, which is seen as a well-managed group. Turnover in the six months to May 1 rose 21 per cent to Pounds 62.9m. Earnings per share were up 7 per cent from 5.74p to 6.15p. The interim dividend is raised to 2.12p (2p). Profits from tourist resorts fell 19 per cent to Pounds 1.3m, resulting from an increased depreciation charge and accelerated pre-season marketing costs. The group expects to benefit, however, from the publicity surrounding the centenary of the Blackpool Tower. Profits from the sports division, which includes bowling, a marina and a health club, dipped 13 per cent to Pounds 6.6m. The fall resulted from bowling, where price increases in 1992 ran into consumer resistance. Mr Conlan said the group was in the process of introducing a new pricing policy with the aim of enticing bowlers back. The discotheques division saw profits increase by 13 per cent to Pounds 8.5m. Spending per head was up 2 per cent. COMMENT Reservations about First Leisure reflect doubts about the nature of post-recession spending throughout the economy. Few know whether consumers will resume their free-spending habits of the late 1980s, even when the good times have fully returned. Early evidence from First Leisure is that leisure consumers are not about to abandon their caution. A good summer in Blackpool might restore enthusiasm for the group. That partly depends on the vagaries of the British summer. Expected full-year pre-tax profits are Pounds 38.5m, with earnings of 17p. The prospective multiple of 17 fairly reflects the balance between competent management and an uncertain economic future.</p>

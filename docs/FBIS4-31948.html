			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Clients' Money Is Not at Karic </F> Bank"]    [Text] The delay in the payment of the savings deposits at  Karic Banka has been lasting for 10 months now. In this period,  the payment of the denar savings was carried out in limited  amounts and with deferred payment. The citizens were able to  withdraw 1,000 denars ($22.2) only as monthly interest, while  they could not get the rest of the principal and interest.  Firstly, the clients were offered to extend their agreement for  fixed term deposits to another three months and then withdraw  their principal and interest, but even after this period of  time, they did not get anything.    There are often quite unpleasant scenes between the clients  and the bank clerks at the bank, sometimes the sums of the  minimal paid interests are written in Serbian language, and in  dinars, instead of denars. Karic Banka does not have a  guarantor in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM]. The National Bank of Macedonia only  guarantees for those banks which are registered according the  new law, that is , which received working licenses. Karic Banka  is a branch bank of a foreign bank and has the same treatment as  the business units of other banks which have head offices  outside the state and which are guaranteed for by that foreign  state. This means that the clients are only left to settle the  agreement signed at this branch office in the court in Belgrade,  which gives little hope when it is known that also in Serbia,  the citizens were cheated out their money by the Serbian banks  "Jugoskandik Banka" and "Dafiment Banka".    In September last year, Karic Banka had a debt to 8,000  clients of up to three million German marks and then it was said  that this debt would be taken over the bank AKA, which opened a  representation in Skopje and which is the first foreign branch  bank registered in Macedonia. However, AKA Bank is  disassociating itself from any connections with Karic Banka. It  works with the economy, that is, crediting companies, but not  the population. Although the public knows about the connection  between AKA and Karic Banka for some time, AKA Bank denied this,  these days.</p>

On behalf of the autonomous regional people's congress  standing committee, Puqung delivered a work report in which he  discussed at length the work carried out by the autonomous  regional people's congress standing committee since the First  Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Congress, as well as the major tasks to be carried out over the  next year.    The report stated: Since the First Session of the Sixth  Autonomous Regional People's Congress, the autonomous regional  people's congress standing committee has, in accordance with the  resolution passed at that session and under the autonomous  regional party committee's leadership, actively advanced the  drive toward establishing a socialist market economic structure,  performed its constitutional and legal functions, and made new  headway in all fields of work on the basis of work carried out  by previous standing committees, while focusing on the central  task of economic construction. In the space of over a year, it  held nine regular meetings in accordance with the law,  deliberated 17 work reports, enacted six regional laws and  regulations, adopted six resolutions, and appointed or removed  188 government functionaries.    Last year, the autonomous regional people's congress  standing  committee examined and approved the "Regulations of the Tibet  Autonomous Region Governing Foreigners Who Come to Tibet for  Mountaineering," the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous Region on  Implementing the `Law of the People's Republic of China on  Compulsory Education,'" the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous  Region on Implementing the `Organic Law (for Trial  Implementation) of the People's Republic of China on Villagers'  Committees,'" and the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous Region  on Implementing the `Organic Law of the People's Republic of  China on Urban Residents' Committees.'" It conducted initial  deliberations of the "Regulations of the Tibet Autonomous Region  on the Comprehensive Management of Public Security." Moreover,  it conducted a preliminary review of existing laws and  regulations, and adopted resolutions on revoking regional laws  and regulations which were incompatible with the developments of  the times.    To give more effective guidance to the elections of a new  term of deputies to county and township people's congresses and  to promote the construction of grass-roots political organs, the  Standing Committee also adopted a "Decision on the Election  Schedule of People's Deputies to County and Township People's  Congresses." As a result of the elections in 1993, 6,411  deputies to county and township people's congresses were elected  directly by some 1.2 million voters throughout the region.    The report points out: Over the past year, deputies made a  total of 94 suggestions. Of the six suggestions put on the  record, five were taken care of, with the remaining one in the  process of being handled. Replies were already given to  deputies. In the past year, the Standing Committee actively  organized deputies to conduct inspection in the vicinity and  received some 40 inspection reports from them, which were of  great help to the relevant departments in improving work.    The report emphasizes: The Standing Committee's main tasks  in 1994 are: accelerating the pace of enacting laws and striving  to keep legislation abreast with the progress of reform;  energetically strengthening supervision to ensure the smooth  implementation of various laws, regulations, and major reform  programs; stepping up publicity of the legal system to enhance  the whole society's awareness of laws; and continuing to improve  the Regional People's Congress' work.    In the report on the work of the regional Higher People's  Court, Bai Zhao said: In the past year, the regional Higher  People's Court earnestly performed functions empowered by the  Constitution and other laws. It accepted 3,092 cases; of these,  the hearing was completed on 2,581 cases, thus dealing a harsh  blow at separationists' sabotage activities, severely punishing  criminal offenders who disrupted public order, striking  relentlessly at serious economic crimes, and resolutely cracking  down on corruption according to the law. In 1994, courts  throughout the region will, with a view to stabilizing the  situation and promoting economic development, fight unswervingly  against separatism, continue to strike severely at various  criminal offenders, step up efforts to try major and serious  cases, especially economic crimes, and deepen the anticorruption  drive. Moreover, in the process of readjusting economic  relations, courts will earnestly safeguard the lawful rights and  interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations.  They will strictly enforce the law and raise the judicial  quality so as to contribute to Tibet's economic development and  social stability.    In the report on the work of the regional People's  Procuratorate, Lan Rifeng said: In the past year, procuratorial  organs in Tibet, led by the regional party committee and the  Supreme People's Procuratorate, firmly implemented the party  Central Committee's guidelines on the anticorruption drive and  adhered to the principle of "strictly enforcing the law and  resolutely handling cases" in striking harshly at a handful of  separatists and serious criminal offenders; in concentrating  efforts on investigating and punishing a number of major and  serious cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other economic  crimes; in investigating -- according to the law -- criminal  cases involving infringement of rights [qin quan 0187 2938] and  malfeasance [du zhi 3460 5120]; and in strengthening the  supervision over law enforcement and the improvement of the  quality of procuratorial personnel; thereby making fresh  contributions to safeguarding the motherland's unification, to  enhancing national unity, to maintaining social stability, to  safeguarding reform, opening up, and the establishment of a  socialist market economy, and to promoting socialist democracy  and the legal system.    The report points out: This year, procuratorial organs in  Tibet will continue to give top priority to harshly striking at  a handful of separatists and serious criminal offenders  according to the law; concentrate forces on handling major and  serious cases in the anticorruption drive; continue to step up  investigations and handling of "infringement of rights" and  "malfeasance;" and further strengthen the functions of  procuratorial organs in supervising law enforcement to ensure  the correct implementation of state laws. They will also persist  in improving the quality of people's procuratorates, strictly  executing procuratorial duties, and raising the quality of  procurators according to the law.</p>

This is evident  from the preliminary results of the Czech Statistical Office.  Total exports for 1993 rose to Kc372.3 billion (approximately  two-fifths of the gross domestic product), while imports  amounted to Kc366.4 billion. Slovakia accounted for virtually 19  percent of the overall volume of foreign trade; countries with  developed market economies accounted for 58 percent. The  remainder is accounted for by developing countries and the  countries of the former Eastern bloc.    The Czech Republic achieved a positive balance of trade with  the countries of the European Union (Kc7.5 billion), developing  countries (Kc13.6 billion), European countries whose economies  are in transition, excluding the former USSR (Kc8.4 billion),  countries having a system of state trade (Kc6.4 billion), and  Slovakia (Kc9.6 billion). The balance of trade involving  countries of EFTA [European Free Trade Association] was on the  negative side (Kc12 billion), as was the balance involving the  remaining developed nations with market economies (Kc7.7  billion) and trade involving the countries of the former USSR  (Kc19.8 billion).    A significant increase developed in exports (excluding  exports to the Slovak Republic because data for 1992 do not  exist), which amounted to a 20-percent rise in comparison with  1992. Imports for last year, compared to the previous year, rose  by only 2.7 percent. Excluding the Slovak Republic, the balance  of trade remained on the negative side to the extent of Kc3.7  billion, although the current account of the balance of payments  in convertible currencies was specifically on the positive side  last year; for just 11 months of 1993, it amounted to $637  million--that is, approximately Kc18.5 billion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jan (EFE) -- El Salvador's Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) today, Wednesday,  rejected in the Mexican capital any insinuation that attempts to  implicate it in the Chiapas conflict. Incidents in Chiapas "are  strictly internal problems of the Mexican state," and solutions  should be reached while respecting Mexico's sovereignty,  indicated the FMLN in a press communique sent to EFE.    The former Salvadoran guerrillas expressed their support for  the peace initiatives through dialogue between all the sectors  involved and regretted the loss of human lives in the armed  conflict.    The FMLN reiterated that since the signing of the  Chapultepec  Agreement in January 1993, it is a completely legal political  party, respecting noninterference in the internal affairs of  third countries.    The former guerrillas condemned press and political  statements linked to the ARENA [Nationalist Reublican Alliance]  party that attempt to tangle the FMLN in the violent Chiapas  incidents. They warned that these accusations are evidence of  despair in the face of the FMLN's electoral progress with regard  to the March 1994 Salvadoran elections.</p>

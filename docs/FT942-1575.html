			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: SA eco-tourism group expands Conservation Corporation, the South Africa eco-tourism group, plans a R66m (Dollars 18m) expansion into east Africa through the purchase of two wildlife lodges in Kenya and Tanzania and a share of an important hotel group in the region. The two lodges, Kichwa Tembo Camp in Kenya and Ngorongoro Crater Lodge in Tanzania, and the hotel group, Windsor Hotels, are part of the Abercrombie and Kent Group. The deal has been financed through a R15m issue of new Conservation ordinary shares to the vendors and R51m in cash, which was raised through rights issues partially underwritten by Hambros Bank in London. Mr Geoffrey Kent, Abercrombie and Kent chairman, will become joint chairman of Conservation with Mr David Varty, the current chairman. Mr Steve Fitzgeral, former chief executive of Halcyon Hotels, has been appointed managing director. According to Mr Alan Berstein, Conservation's deputy chairman, the move signals a belief in the strong potential of African tourism. 'We expect to be very well positioned to take advantage of a positive trend in the South and east African tourist markets,' he said. Conservation, which was founded four years ago, is regarded as one of the premier eco-tourist operations in South Africa, where it runs four game lodges. The Abercrombie deal is widely seen in South African financial circles as a precursor to a stock market listing in the next couple of years, either in London or Johannesburg.</p>

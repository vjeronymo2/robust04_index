			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WALL ST. NEAR NORMAL AFTER POWER OUTAGE  </P> <P> Trading slowly returned to normal today after a power outage in lower Manhattan  knocked out electricity to much of the financial district Monday.  </P> <P> All the major exchanges opened, some with delays.  </P> <P> But all suffered a drop-off in trading volume as Wall Street firms operated  without some of their back-shop and computer operations due to the power  outage.  </P> <P> A large area of lower Manhattan still did not have electrical power this  morning after the fire that cut power in much of the Wall Street area just  after noon Monday.  </P> <P> About 1,100 customers, many of them financial firms near the New York Stock  Exchange, were still affected.  </P> <P> Consolidated Edison said the blackout area was around the South Street Seaport,  a market and restaurant complex surrounded by a number of Wall Street firms on  the East Side of Manhattan's tip.  </P> <P> "We can't predict when everyone will be back in service but we expect full  restoration to take several days," the spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> But on the West Side of lower Manhattan, the World Trade Center was back in  business, as were a number of big firms surrounding the city's tallest and most  spacious building.  </P> <P> The American Stock Exchange, which had been forced to close early on Monday,  opened on schedule.  </P> <P> The Commodity Exchange Inc., which houses precious metals and copper, had  expected to open on time but later reversed course and announced delayed  openings.  </P> <P> The Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange said openings in coffee and cocoa  futures would be delayed, while sugar contracts would open on schedule.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ over-the-counter stock market opened on time but made special  provisions for member firms without power so they could initiate trades through  NASDAQ computers.  </P></p>

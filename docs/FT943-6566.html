			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Stage set for Manila development fight The stage is set for potentially the largest property development in the Philippines in a decade. It involves turning part of a former military camp on the east of the Philippine capital into a commercial and trading centre. The 214-hectare property, part of Fort Bonifacio which has been home to the Philippine Army since the 1940s, will become a 'new Makati (business district),' according to the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA), the state agency in charge of the proj ect. Five groups responded to the starting gun last Friday for a selection process for BCDA's 'strategic partner' for Fort Bonifacio's development. The process will culminate in bidding for the property next January. From the five, a shorter list of qualifiers for the bidding will be known on September 9. Among the five is a consortium led by Ayala Land, the property arm of the widely diversified Ayala conglomerate which in the 1950s and 1960s pioneered the development of Makati. The Philippine subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based First Pacific Group is co-lead investor, with Urban Bank, in another consortium that includes a number of big local property companies and banks. A provident fund for military personnel, the AFP Retirement Separation and Benefits System, leads another group. A predominantly Filipino group among the prospective bidders is the Fil Estate/PentaCapital consortium led by Fil-Estate Group. Another Filipino-led group is JG Summit Holdings, which owns the Robinson's chain of shopping malls in Manila. Under current plans, BCDA will auction 55 per cent holdings in the Fort Bonifacio venture. Out of the property's 214 hectares, the partner will get 118 hectares. At the bidding in January, the qualified groups will be asked to offer a per-square metre price for the parcel. At the minimum price of 10,000 pesos a square metre set by BCDA, the block will yield at least 11.8bn pesos (Pounds 290.3m).</p>

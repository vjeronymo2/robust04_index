			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ioannis Loulis] </F>   [Text] The first major poll conducted on the upcoming  European Parliament elections gives an idea of the possible  outcome of that election. On behalf of private station Sky, MRB  conducted the poll from 13 to 18 May in the greater capital area  using a sample of 1,000 voters and the ballot method. The  information received outlines a series of critical parameters in  the election behavior of voters.    First, the distance that PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] established from ND [New Democracy] in October's  election appears to be decreasing. The MRB poll gives PASOK  30.7 percent and ND 27.2 percent. The respective percentages of  the parties in the same election district were 45.19 percent for  PASOK and 36.46 percent for ND. As expected, the governing  party is in the lead.    Second, PASOK's losses in the greater capital area come from  both the left and the right and do not appear to be accidental.  PASOK has lost 3.7 percent of its power to the Political  Spring, 2.7 percent to the Coalition of the Left and Progress,  and 1.2 percent to ND, while 8.7 percent of those who voted for  PASOK in October are now undecided. The "unity" of PASOK voters  (those voters who say that they will vote for their party again)  is 78.9 percent, a percentage that is neither low nor high.  This percentage does point out the possibility of some  remarkable losses for PASOK.    Third, among all parties ND shows the highest "unity"  percentage (83.3 percent), followed by KKE [Greek Communist  Party] with 81.8 percent. This percentage shows that ND will  possibly not suffer any serious losses compared to October. (If  this happens, it will not be unnatural, given that the  percentages that both large parties expect to receive at the  European Parliament elections tend to be lower than those  received in the national elections.)    Currently, other than its remarkable "unity" percentage, ND  appears to have suffered some losses to the Political Spring  (3.4 percent), while for the first time it appears to have a  very small gain from PASOK (1.2 percent). Therefore, there is  an initial feeling (which other polls taken closer to the  European Parliament elections will confirm or deny) that ND has  "clear gains" (although very small) from the movement of voters  from and to PASOK. It is crucial for ND to minimize its losses  to the Political Spring and increase its "gains" from PASOK.    Fourth, the Political Spring, with a low "unity" percentage,  will be the big question mark in the elections. The poll gives  it 7.1 percent in a region where it received approximately 6  percent. As a protest party (something that has been confirmed  by every poll before the October elections), Political Spring  shows great movement in voters "coming" and "going." It is  becoming clear, however, that the party is gaining more than it  is losing. At the same time, it is also showing a greater  percentage of undecided voters (16 percent) compared to other  parties, something that makes safe predictions of its course  very difficult.    Fifth, Coalition of the Left and Progress shows clear rising  tendencies. Its gains come mainly from PASOK.    Concluding, the gap is narrowing between PASOK and ND, with  the former one maintaining the lead position at a safe distance.  There is also a clear tendency of the Coalition and the  Political Spring to increase their power, a tendency that is  notable but not impressive. In any case, the two large parties  appear to be confirming their sovereignty despite any small  losses, particularly those of PASOK, which do not appear to be  accidental.</p>

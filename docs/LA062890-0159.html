			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HISTORICAL SOCIETIES  </P> <P> Diversification is the operative term among historical groups within cities in  Orange County. Advisory boards appointed by individual city councils recombine  with smaller societies of citizens attempting to protect ancient structures  from being razed by developers. Some groups are associated with particular  historical landmarks; some serve as research libraries and offer their archives  to the public; others offer group outings to visit historical sites but have no  particular headquarters. The Pickwick Hotel, used as a workshop by the Anaheim  Historical Society, met its demise by a wrecking ball in September, 1987; board  meetings are today held at a member's bed-and-breakfast house. Public libraries  are additional historical resources: the Elizabeth J. Schultz History Room,  Anaheim Public Library; the Launer Room, Fullerton Public Library; the Santa  Ana History Room, Santa Ana Public Library, and the Local History Collection,  Yorba Linda Public Library.  </P> <P> ANAHEIM  </P> <P> Anaheim Historical Society  </P> <P> P.O.

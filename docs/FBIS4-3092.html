			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Powerful Priority"] </F>   [Text] China is to target financial transnationals for  capital to beef up its overburdened power sector to break the  economic "bottleneck" hindering development.    The country, which has suffered shortages of electricity for  two decades, expects at least $25 billion to be invested in the  sector in the next seven years.    Delegations will be sent to Western nations this year with  proposals for co-operation, said an official with the Ministry  of Power Industry.    Power production has become a key attraction for foreign  investors over the past two years and several overseas-financed  power plants have been announced.    "Big breakthroughs in foreign investment are expected," the  official, who declined to be identified, said in an interview  with Business Weekly last week.    China can produce up to 181 million kilowatts. Experts  estimate that 25 percent more capacity is needed to satisfy the  booming demand.    Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen last week began a 17-day  trip to France, Spain and Israel to bring in investment.    China expects 9 per cent economic growth for the next seven  years. To achieve that goal, additional generating capacity of  at least 120 million kilowatts must be installed by the year  2000.    That means an average 17 million kilowatts of generators  should be installed each year.    The government plans 12 million kilowatts for this year, but  financing has not been fully-arranged. Some 10 billion yuan  ($1.15 billion) of the 66 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) needed is  not available.    Ministry officials said the capital shortage will probably  be  eased later this year as the central government gives the sector  top priority and the new State Development Bank begins  supporting construction of infrastructure.    But they pointed out that bigger problems lie ahead. Fewer  projects were kicked off last year than were expected and no  projects have been approved so far this year. Big power plants  that are planned may not be completed, they said.    This scaled-down construction, they caution, would  jeopardize  long-term economic growth.    The government does not want to let big capital construction  projects drive up inflation, which in the first two months of  the year stood at 20 percent. Building a large power plant  requires billions of yuan.    Plants with total capacity of 53 million kilowatts are under  construction, but that is at least 7 million kilowatts less than  expected.    At the same time last year, 54 million kilowatts were under  construction.    Officials warn that if enough investment is not found,  construction would further shrink.    In France, Shi is expected to sign an agreement with the  French power sector to extend a 10-year power co-operation  treaty that expires this year.    The minister, leading five key officials from the ministry,  is to explain China's energy policies to the French Government  and business community, discuss possibilities for further  co-operation, and learn about French corporate management.    Coming on the heels of French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur's visit to China, the mission is expected to be  fruitful, trade analysts said.    Balladur's visit was described as a turning point, following  about four years of relatively cool relations between the two  countries.    Shi's visits to Spain and Israel are also considered  important. A Western European power union is based in Spain, and  Israel has ties with financial organizations worldwide.    China is also to rely on foreign power groups for know-how  to  improve its efficiency.    The Ministry of Power Industry said late last year that  China  would need $25 billion in foreign investment by the year 2000 to  generate enough electricity to support its economy.</p>

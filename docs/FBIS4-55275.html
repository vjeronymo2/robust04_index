			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Uros Lipuscek] </F>   [Text] Washington -- Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle  met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in  Washington late this afternoon. A brief news conference was held  prior to the official talks in the State Department building, at  which the U.S. secretary of state among other things said that  Slovenia was an extremely successful country that was advancing  fast. He also expressed satisfaction over the fact that  Slovenia had joined the Partnership for Peace. When I asked him  what was the U.S. stance toward the statements of some Italian  politicians who have been voicing open territorial demands  toward Slovenia and Croatia, the U.S. secretary of state said  that he was not acquainted with such demands but in extremely  categorical terms stated that the United States is opposed to  change of borders and resolutely supports the territorial  inviolability of Slovenia.    Slovene Foreign Minister Peterle after the talks said that  they were very successful. They discussed political and economic  cooperation, where certain problems exist, for example, the  issue of debts of the Krsko nuclear plant that were approved by  the U.S. export-import bank EXIM. The Slovene foreign minister  also raised the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo for  Slovenia. Although the United States would not agree to a  unilateral lifting of this UN Security Council measure, there is  a growing belief that the United States would consent to a  partial lifting of this embargo, especially in nonmilitary  spheres. As an example of this, Foreign Minister Peterle put  forward the import of explosives used in the construction of the  Slovene highways.    The U.S. secretary of state among other things also received  an invitation to visit Slovenia. With this, Slovene Foreign  Minister Peterle ended the talks in Washington.</p>

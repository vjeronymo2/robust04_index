			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9305 (c)(1) and (c)(2) of OBRA '86 amends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1861(e) of the Act, which defines ``hospital'', by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adding to paragraph (6) a requirement that a hospital have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in place a discharge planning process that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of a new section 1861(ee) of the Act. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1861(ee), a discharge planning process of a hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is sufficient if it applies to services furnished by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and meets the guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and standards established by the Secretary of HHS to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a timely and smooth transition to the most appropriate type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of setting for post-hospital or rehabilitative care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1861(ee) requires that the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and guidelines include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The hospital must identify, at an early stage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitalization, those patients who are likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suffer adverse health consequences if discharged without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate discharge planning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Hospitals must provide a discharge planning evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the patients identified under (1) above and for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients upon request of the patient or his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative or physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Any discharge planning evaluation must be made on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely basis to ensure that appropriate arrangements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post-hospital care will be made before discharge and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid unnecessary delays in discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A discharge planning evaluation must include an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of a patient's likely need for appropriate post-hospital services and the availability of those services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The discharge planning evaluation must be included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the patient's medical record for use in establishing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate discharge plan, and the results of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation must be discussed with the patient or his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Upon the request of a patient's physician, the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must arrange for the development and initial implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a discharge plan for the patient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Any discharge planning evaluation or discharge plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under section 1861(ee) of the Act must be developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by, or under the supervision of, a registered professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel. (Although the statute refers to a ``registered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional nurse,'' both in this provision and in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1861(e)(5) of the Act, there is no distinction between this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term and ``registered nurse,'' which is more commonly used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We will hereafter use the term ``registered nurse'', to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with other references in our regulations.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9305(c)(3) of OBRA '86 amends section 1865(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act so that, in effect, when the JCAHO or AOA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires hospitals to have a discharge planning process or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposes a requirement that serves substantially the same purpose as the condition of participation for discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning, the Secretary is authorized to find that those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals with JCAHO or AOA accreditation meet that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of section 9305(c) of OBRA '86 were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective October 21, 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 16, 1988, we published a proposed rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement these legislative changes as well as the clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory director standards revisions mentioned earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (53 FR 22506). We also proposed several minor revisions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate a request from the Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget concerning paperwork burden and reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Discharge Planning Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To implement section 9305(c) of OBRA '86, we proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to incorporate the provisions of the statute and would add a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new hospital condition of participation, &sect;482.43, Discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning, which would have applied only to Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients. We proposed to delete the current discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning requirement in &sect;482.21, Quality assurance, as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medically-related patient care service standard applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1861(ee) of the Act confers authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include standards and guidelines beyond those explicitly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enumerated in the statute. We proposed to specify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge planning evaluation include an evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare patient's capacity for self-care or the possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this patient being cared for in the environment from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which he entered the hospital. Under the requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discharge plan, we would require, on an as-needed basis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Medicare patient and family members or interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons be counseled to prepare them for post-hospital care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For clarity, we wanted to include the concept in the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation explicitly requiring the actual transfer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referral of Medicare patients after discharge planning is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete. We also proposed to require periodic reassessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Medicare patient's discharge plan to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it needs to be changed. We would also require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital to reassess its discharge planning process on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ongoing basis to ensure that it meets Medicare patients'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We deferred proposing any requirements relating to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs assessment instrument that is being developed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary as required by section 9305(h) of OBRA '86. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1992, HHS submitted a report on the needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment instrument to Congress including recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for further testing and development of the instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The organization, called "Anti-Dashnak Organization," held  its first meeting in Baku yesterday and proclaimed its goals as  follows:    "Our principal objective is to wage a just and armed  struggle  against the Armenian Dashnak party [Armenian Revolutionary  Federation]. As is known this party has resorted to cruel acts  and has perpetrated genocide against Turkish and Muslim people  with a fascist mentality and with rigid and uncompromising  Armenian fanaticism. The Armenians have been perpetrating  genocide against the people of Azerbaijan for more than 100  years. They use every opportunity to exterminate hundreds of  thousands of innocent and defenseless Azeris. Throughout history  Armenians have repeatedly attacked and tried to seize our lands.    "The Anti-Dashnak Organization is determined to stop the  savagery and massacres by the fanatical Armenians."    The statement notes that the headquarters of the  organization  is in Baku and that the new group is engaged in extensive work  to organize across the country. [passage omitted]</p>

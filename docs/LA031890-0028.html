			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-GAY VIEWS  </P> <P> I am distressed by an item in the March 11 "Pop Eye" column, particularly the  noting of Cinderella's Tom Keifer's hateful statements about gays. It is  irresponsible of The Times to provide a forum for such views. If Keifer held  similar views about blacks, I don't think his vile thoughts would be treated so  lightly.  </P> <P> BRUCE DAVIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

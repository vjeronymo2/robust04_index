			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By trainee reporter Yang Fan (2799 1581): "Chinese Finance </F> Minister on Value-Added Land Tax"]    [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- Finance minister Liu  Zhongli told reporters here today that the provisional  regulations on levying a value-added land tax, as a law approved  by the State Council, must be strictly enforced. The localities  must comply with the regulations. The laws and regulations  formulated by themselves without authorization are all null and  void. In view of the proposals made by foreign investors, there  will be some readjustment in the detailed rules for  implementation to be promulgated very soon.    China's real estate developed rapidly last year and the year  before, Liu Zhongli said, but the government failed to introduce  effective tax categories. Now the State Council has approved  the regulations on levying a value-added land tax. As a law, it  must be enforced.    He clarified some misunderstanding. The value-added land tax  is not merely levied on foreign businessmen because tax laws  apply to both Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises and  individuals. Liu said that the regulations are promulgated to  crack down on speculation in real estate. Actually, the returns  from real estate go as high as 30 to 40 percent.    Liu Zhongli said that he had heard opinions aired by foreign  businessmen on the new regulations. He said that their opinions  and proposals will be taken into account in the detailed rules  for implementation to be promulgated soon.    The minister said that the detailed rules constitute a kind  of tax law. One of the principles of tax reform is a fair tax  burden and unification of tax laws. Liu said that he had not  heard about the news of Guangzhou and Hainan promulgating their  own sets of tax laws. If some localities have promulgated their  own regulations on levying the value-added land tax, they will  all be null and void.    Liu pointed out that the value-added land charges collected  by Shenzhen and other localities in the past will automatically  become void following promulgation of the new value-added land  tax. All localities should abide by the unified tax system of  the Finance Ministry. Despite the implementation of the new tax  system, Liu said, preferential policies for the special economic  regions will remain unchanged. The value-added land tax is the  only thing which belongs to the state.    On the question of the impact of the new tax system on  foreign investors, Liu Zhongli made an analysis of three  aspects: First, in the value-added tax, foreign businessmen,  who have signed contracts with China before 31 December 1993 and  who have a tax burden, will only have to return the amount of  taxes earned in the next five years. Second, company and  enterprise income taxes have not increased or decreased, but  domestic enterprises are drawing closer to foreign-funded ones.  Third, the rate of personal income tax of 90 percent of the  foreign staff dropped while only 10 percent rose, with the  extent exceeding not more than 5 percent.</p>

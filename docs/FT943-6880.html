			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / A damaging diversion: Rows over Pakistan's nuclear capability will not help attempts to bring stability An admission this week by Mr Nawaz Sharif, former Pakistani prime minister, that his country has the atomic bomb comes at a difficult time for Pakistan. Following soon after reports from Germany that Pakistan is a possible destination for plutonium smuggled out of the former Soviet Union, Mr Sharif's claim will heighten international concern about Pakistan's nuclear programme. It has also inflamed relations with Pakistan's arch-enemy India, which are already tense because of the territorial dispute over the troubled region of Kashmir and because of Indian allegations that Pakistani secret service agents helped organise terrorist bomb attacks in Bombay last year. Mr Sharif's admission was promptly denied by the Pakistani foreign ministry which said, as it has before, that Pakistan has the technology to make atom bombs but has decided not to manufacture such weapons. Nevertheless, the former prime minister's claims will make it easier for Pakistan's international critics to attack Islamabad over the nuclear issue, the biggest point of tension between Pakistan and the west. These developments could undermine prime minister Benazir Bhutto's efforts to stabilise Pakistan after the domestic political storms which have accompanied the country's transformation in the past five years from a military dictatorship into a fragile democracy. Pakistan's political stability is important not just for Pakistanis and their immediate neighbours - an unstable Pakistan, vulnerable to the influence of Islamic fundamentalists and armed with the means to make atom bombs, would be a danger to all. To avoid instability, Ms Bhutto, who took over as prime minister from Mr Sharif after a general election victory last autumn, must bring economic and social progress to one of the world's poorest nations. But she will find it difficult to do this, if her attention is distracted by rows over nuclear arms. Indeed, Mr Sharif, whose government collapsed last year amid arguments with the powerful army and with the then-president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and who now leads the parliamentary opposition, seems to have been trying to embarrass Ms Bhutto. As the Pakistani foreign ministry said, Mr Sharif's words were 'a political statement made by a politician'. Ms Bhutto herself acknowledges the damaging impact of the nuclear issue on Pakistan's ties with the US and other western countries. 'We believe that it is not right that the relations between Pakistan and the US be only one-dimensional - that is only on the nuclear issue,' she told the FT in a recent interview. In any event, Ms Bhutto has recently been making some progress towards bringing stability to Pakistan. Her first government, in 1988-89, lasted only 20 months before it was toppled by the politically-powerful army and its ally, Mr Ishaq Khan, the then-president. Her second administration has had a much better start. Ms Bhutto herself, now 41, has established her personal authority: she has got to grips with the tough world of Pakistani politics. The army, under an avowedly non-political chief of staff, has conspicuously stayed out of politics. Also, Ms Bhutto has been able to manoeuvre Mr Farooq Leghari, a close aide, into the presidency, replacing Mr Ishaq Khan. Ms Bhutto had the additional good fortune not to succeed Mr Sharif directly. Between Mr Sharif's resignation and her election, Pakistan was ruled by a caretaker, Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former World Bank economist. Mr Qureshi cut public spending and launched pro-market economic reforms in exchange for emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. Ms Bhutto came to office only after the balance of payments crisis that precipitated Mr Qureshi's call to the IMF was over. Despite some back-sliding, Ms Bhutto has mainly stuck to Mr Qureshi's programme. She has reduced the fiscal deficit, imports and bank lending  - all of which soared under Mr Sharif. While inflation remains high, running recently at 11 per cent a year, both the IMF and the World Bank have praised the government's performance. Admittedly, so far, economic growth has been weak, held back by poor crops of cotton, the country's principal export. But, after recent modest increases in gross domestic product - the economy expanded by an estimated 4 per cent for the year ending June 1994 - Ms Bhutto's officials believe that, given good harvests, Pakistan can expect 7 per cent GDP growth in 1994-95. The government is also making progress with economic restructuring. Measures taken include cuts in import tariffs, deregulation, privatisation (notably preparing to sell shares in PTC, the state-owned telecommunications monopoly) and making the rupee fully convertible on the current account in the 1994-95 budget. Industry is responding. In June, ICI Pakistan, the 61-per-cent-owned affiliate of ICI, the British chemicals group, announced plans for a Dollars 350m synthetic fibre materials plant - one of Pakistan's largest-ever industrial investments. International bankers are close to approving the Dollars 2bn 292 megawatt oil-fired power station project on the river Hub, a joint public and private-sector scheme. Meanwhile, stocks on the Karachi Stock Exchange have soared 70 per cent since Ms Bhutto came to office, largely on the back of the international popularity of emerging markets earlier this year. Yet further economic advances will depend on Pakistan building on its relative political stability. Ms Bhutto boldly insists that she is as secure as any democratically-elected leader. 'We don't have a democracy in name (any more); we have a democracy in fact,' she says. But, given the country's record for political turmoil, such a claim seems premature. First, the army still looms large in public life, with fully one-third of the budget spent on defence. While General Abdul Waheed, the chief of staff who took over in early 1993, has kept out of politics, his successors may not. Moreover, if Pakistan is to be a true democracy, its National Assembly (parliament) needs to be more representative. More than 50 per cent of the assembly is drawn from the rural landowning class, which constitutes less than 5 per cent of the population. Most Pakistanis still have little political voice. They are poor, badly educated and vulnerable to manipulation by Islamic fundamentalists. Also, the landowning elite runs the country largely for its own benefit. There is widespread undermining of public institutions through corruption, nepotism, and violence. Ms Bhutto hopes to spread the country's wealth beyond the elite through a five-year Dollars 8bn Social Action Programme, supported by international donors and designed to improve education and health services. Schooling in Pakistan is particularly inadequate, with just 29 per cent of school-age children enrolled in the late 1980s, compared with 68 per cent in India, according to UN data. The problems lie in SAP's implementation - for example, making sure teachers in backward districts do not abandon their villages for the comfort of nearby towns. These ambitious social plans could be fulfilled more easily if Pakistan scrapped its nuclear programme. US economic aid, withheld from countries suspected by Washington of having bomb-making technology, would immediately resume. With it would probably come more foreign trade and investment. But Islamabad is most unlikely to abandon its nuclear know-how. It has no intention of even capping its nuclear programme at current levels unless India also does so. India will not consider such a move unless China and other big nuclear powers also call a halt to weapons development. Mr Sharif's outburst does not change these realities. But by drawing the world's attention to truths which Pakistan prefers to keep hidden he has done his country no favours.</p>

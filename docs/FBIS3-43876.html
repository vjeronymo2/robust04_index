			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Guinea Government has been perhaps surprisingly  silent about the recent events of Macenta near the Liberia  border. It is now clear that ULIMO [United Liberation Movement  for Democracy in Liberia] forces crossed the border from Liberia  and caused havoc in carnage in the Macenta region leaving,  according to one estimate, 100 people dead. They were  apparently carrying out reprisals against people backing the  anti-ULIMO Loma Defense Force. Yesterday Liberia's interim  president, Amos Sawyer, apologized for the ULIMO incursion and  today the Guinea authorities have responded. From Conakry, Fode  Fofana telexed this report:    The Guinean Government has finally broken its silence on the  Macenta affair, deploring, and I quote, the clash on our  territory by warring factions in Liberia. [no reference to end  of quote as heard] The statement issued after a cabinet meeting  said that the government is taking very strong measures to  protect our people and their property and calm has now returned  to Macenta. According to the statement an investigation into  the deadly clash is continuing and the findings will be made  known internationally.    Meanwhile, in revenge for the attack on Macenta, a former  member of parliament for Lofa County in Liberia, Musa Boney  Camara, had his house and car burnt down in Bambala near the  Liberian border. Camara is widely considered to be the ULIMO  representative in the area. Another victim was Karamoko  Modjenga, who is believed to be furnishing ULIMO fighters with  traditional bulletproofs and other invincible charms in their  battle against Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of  Liberia. Karamoko Modjenga had his house razed to the ground  and his personal mosque built inside the compound was also  destroyed.    Meanwhile, the people of Macenta, in solidarity with their  Loma kith and kin in Liberia, have threatened to blow up the  whole area if ULIMO is not completely driven out. A Guinean  Loma elder in Conakry told me that they have been holding  meetings here in Conakry and contributing generously toward this  task.</p>

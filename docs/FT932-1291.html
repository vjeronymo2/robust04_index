			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Book Review: But are you being served? 'MERGER IN DAYLIGHT' By Damien Neven, Robin Nuttall and Paul Seabright Centre for Economic Policy Research; Pounds 25/Dollars 37.50; 296 pages The topic of mergers and takeovers is by its nature a contentious one. On one view, mergers are a conspiracy against consumers and workers. On another, they are a necessary response to a changing world. In reality, they are very often both, which is why the competing claims need to be carefully balanced. In the EC, the argument goes further. Granted, the balancing is a job for bureaucrats. But if subsidiarity means anything, why the devil should the bureaucrats be in Brussels? The question has a certain topical force. When the EC system of merger regulation was set up almost three years ago, it was decreed that mergers should be policed by Brussels - rather than by individual states - if the resulting company would have sales of over Ecu5bn. It was also suggested that the figure should be reduced to Ecu2bn in 1993. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC's competition commissioner, has until the end of this month to decide whether to press ahead. Given that Germany, the UK and France seem flatly opposed to further meddling, he is understandably leaving it a little late. Then again, if he has read Merger in Daylight he may simply have decided not to bother. The book - billed as the first independent review of the Brussels merger regime - argues that size scarcely matters. This is because bigger flaws in the system need to be addressed first. Not that the book is anti-Brussels. The authors - three academic economists, one French, two British - point out that when the system was set up, after 16 years of argument, there was deep disagreement on the likely results. One school believed it would make mergers easier, since it would remove narrow nationalistic barriers. Others believed it would make them harder, since the EC appeared to have an ideological bias towards small and medium-sized firms and against big ones. The authors take the latter view, but on quite different grounds. The point about the mergers now covered by Brussels is precisely that the companies operate in a number of EC markets. In assessing such a merger, national agencies such as the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission and Germany's Bundeskartellamt will naturally put a higher value on the benefits to domestic companies than on the damage to foreign markets, which they probably could not measure. Thus, nationally based merger control is in such cases both inaccurate - and hence economically expensive - and too tolerant of market power. When it comes to the flaws in the system, the argument is exhaustive. Indeed, the lay reader should perhaps be warned that the book is aimed at the professional, whether lawyer, economist or merchant banker. But perhaps the most interesting objection has the widest implications - that the system takes no explicit account of whether a merger will lead to greater economic efficiency. This takes us to the heart of an apparent ideological tension between two powerful Brussels departments, those of competition and industry. In bald terms, the argument runs as follows. The economic future of Europe, says the industry commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann, depends on the international competitiveness of its industry. The market against which European industry must be measured is that of the world, not the EC. If the by-product of creating world-class companies is allowing them to dominate the EC market, so be it. Under Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Van Miert's predecessor as competition commissioner, this argument was stood on its head. The interests of the EC consumer were paramount, and world domination took second place. Even for Sir Leon, this may largely have been a matter of rhetoric. Mr Van Miert, a man less given to precise formulations, takes a much more pragmatic line. Thus, while the Commission is not supposed to give weight to questions of industrial policy when ruling on mergers, it does so in practice. The result, as the book points out, is an apparent inconsistency in some of the Commission's published rulings. The findings of the bureaucrats point one way, the decision of the politicians another. In a particularly interesting experiment, the authors gave post-graduate economics students copies of some reports with the conclusions left out, and invited them to deduce from the internal arguments which way the ruling had gone. In one contentious case, the merger of the German car component manufacturers Bosch and Varta, every single student got it wrong. The conclusion is obvious and sensible. If the Commission is going to take industrial efficiency into account anyway, better do so formally in public than intuitively behind closed doors. Other recommendations are equally clear and closely argued. The bureaucrats should formally restrict themselves to investigating proposed mergers, leaving the decision wholly to the politicians. The haggling process by which companies modify the proposed deal to get it allowed should be conducted in public, preferably with input from competitors. There is a perfectly good reason for the emphasis on transparency. The book contains a striking survey of companies which had gone through the Brussels process of merger scrutiny. The majority found the results satisfactory and not too onerous. As the authors remark, it is not a good sign when the poachers speak well of the gamekeepers. If anything, the system is letting too many mergers through, chiefly because of a characteristically Brussels penchant for compromise. If the rules were more clearly laid out and more publicly applied, the European consumer, at any rate, might be better served.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 29 (AFP)--Israeli and PLO negotiators  have reached agreement in principle on the release of all  Palestinian prisoners held by Israel who commit themselves to  renouncing violence, a senior PLO official disclosed Thursday.    The two sides agreed that in addition to 5,000 Palestinians  whose release had already been approved, all remaining prisoners  would be eligible for a pardon if they pledged "in writing" to  abandon violence and to adhere to the policies of the PLO, Nabil  Sha'th said.    The offer would apply to all Palestinian prisoners  regardless  of their political affiliation, according to Sha'th, who is the  Palestine Liberation Organization's chief negotiator in talks  here with Israel.    The negotiations are aimed at implementing limited  Palestinian self-rule on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank  town of Jericho in accordance with a Declaration of Principles  signed by the PLO and Israel in Washington last September.    After months of difficult and delicate talks, PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are to  sign an accord here on May 4 to launch Palestinian autonomy,  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak announced Thursday.    Sha'th said Israeli-PLO contacts would continue after next  Wednesday's signing ceremony to determine a timetable for the  prisoner releases. He said Palestinians in the autonomous areas  would be issued a passport by Palestinian authorities that would  be valid for three years and would entitle them to travel to any  country accepting the document.    On the question of jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho, which  had plagued the Cairo talks earlier this month, Sha'th reported  that the two sides had agreed that Palestinian officials would  exert authority "in all domains, with the exception of Israeli  citizens, Jewish settlements and external security."    He said the principal outstanding issue was the scope of the  security zones to be established around the settlements on the  Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want to reduce the dimensions of  the zones to a minimum, according to Sha'th, who added that  their proposed boundaries were detailed in maps appended to an  agreement here on February 9. The maps have not been made  public. Other sources close to the talks said the PLO and  Israel still had to agree on the size of the autonomous Jericho  area and the presence of a Palestinian guard on the Allenby  Bridge between the West Bank and Jordan.    In Paris Thursday Israeli and Palestinian officials also  reached an accord on future economic relations between Israel  and the autonomous areas. In a statement released after five  months of arduous talks, the Israeli delegation said "all the  obstacles have been overcome and differences settled." "The  heads of the delegations think it is possible to reach a general  accord on Friday which will form the basis of economic relations  between Israeli and Palestinian authorities," the statement  said. Details of a final economic agreement were to be worked  on overnight ahead of a 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) signing ceremony  Friday at the French foreign ministry.    [Paris AFP in English at 0759 on 29 April in a  Cairo-datelined item by Marius Schattner adds the following:  "The two remaining points to be sorted out by Rabin and 'Arafat  would be the size of the autonomous Jericho area and the  presence of a Palestinian guard on the Allenby Bridge between  the West Bank and Jordan, sources close to the talks said. But  chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Thursday the principal  outstanding issue was the dimension of the security zones to be  established around Jewish settlements on the Gaza Strip."]</p>

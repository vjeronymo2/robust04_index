			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker slides to Pounds 4.61m - Workforce trimmed by 10% and all UK businesses profitable CORNWELL PARKER, the furniture and fabrics group which issued a profits warning in June, reported a 42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended July 31, from Pounds 7.91m to Pounds 4.61m. Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, said the business had been through 'the worst trading conditions for years.' Nevertheless, all UK businesses remained profitable. He did not think the market for the group's products would improve in the short term. 'But if and when there is an upturn it will come through to profits very rapidly.' The group, best known for its Parker Knoll furniture, was concentrating on giving value for money and on extending its markets. Early in the year it bought Fardis to strengthen its position in the French fabrics market, and in June it bought Vibeltex, the Belgian distributor of its Monkwell fabrics. It had also shed 10 per cent of its UK labour force, about 150 jobs, and had succeeded in making reductions in its procurement bills that had largely offset the effect of sterling's devaluation. Overall turnover was Pounds 89.2m, including Pounds 5.71m from acquisitions and Pounds 1.18m from discontinued operations. Last year's turnover was Pounds 90m, including Pounds 3.84m from discontinued operations. Operating profits on continuing operations were down from Pounds 8.58m to Pounds 5.47m. Net interest payable rose from Pounds 29,000 to Pounds 462,000, largely reflecting the cost of recent acquisitions. Earnings per share fell from 12.4p to 7.3p. However, the final dividend is maintained at 4p, for an unchanged total of 5.7p. Net borrowings were Pounds 3m, giving gearing of 8.5 per cent. Shareholders' funds stand at Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 44.6m). At the end of last year the group had net cash of Pounds 1.4m. The shares closed down 3p at 174p.</p>

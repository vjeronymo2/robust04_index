			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Acquisitions behind 26% profits rise at Hagemeyer HAGEMEYER, the Netherlands-based international trading company, posted a 26 per cent increase in net profit to Fl 85.2m (Dollars 45.8m) in 1991. The dividend is to be increased by the same percentage to Fl 5.68 from Fl 4.52 in 1990. Sales were up nearly 18 per cent at Fl 2.96bn last year and are expected to show a further rise to around Fl 3.5bn in 1992. Hagemeyer, which is 60 per cent owned by the Hong Kong investment company First Pacific, attributed the rise mainly to acquisitions, including its purchase in late 1991 of a 60 per cent stake in Froschl, one of Germany's largest electro-technical wholesalers. Growth of existing businesses was just under 2 per cent, reflecting slower economic growth in Australia and setbacks on the German market for consumer electronics. If these two areas are disregarded, organic growth totalled around 5 per cent. For 1992, Hagemeyer forecasts further profits growth.</p>

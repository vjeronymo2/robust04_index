			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Management: In the court of Lord King - British Airways' name-dropping chairman in full flight Lord King of Wartnaby has just arrived back at his St James's office from a long lunch across town. The 74-year-old chairman of British Airways is late, and does not look in a particularly good mood. 'Close the door, there's a good man,' he growls, a fat cigar stub between his lips, at his PR man. The message does not get through. 'Jane,' he bellows at one of the two secretaries who sit outside, guarding his office. 'Close the door.' The task accomplished, he turns his attention to the job in hand: writing 'King' with a beautiful black and gold fountain pen on gaudy certificates that each British Airways employee receives after 25 and 35 years of service. 'Well?', he says, abruptly starting the interview. His PR man, a wheeler-dealer from Northern Ireland, and a good match for his boss, shows him a clipping of a previous article in the 'My Office' series. ''Sir Christopher Hogg does his own filing'' Lord King reads out aloud. 'Does he, indeed?' he scoffs and casts the paper aside. Warming to the task of describing his own spacious room, Lord King starts with his large collection of pictures and photographs that cover the walls and are stacked on bookcases and side tables. He gets up from behind his heavy, leather desk and lumbers over to the photographs. 'There's me with the Pope, and my wife with the Pope,' he starts. 'That is me in the Oval Office with Bush, me with John Major outside Number 10, and me with Billy Graham.' He rattles through the collection at great speed. Clearly this is not the first time he has shown them off. Lord King is fussy about who he has his picture taken with. He does not like being snapped with a cigar or a drink in hand: however, he once arranged to have the schedule of Corcorde changed so that he could be photographed beside it at Heathrow. 'That's me on holiday with Reagan,' he continues, pointing at a photograph of the two men in cowboy gear, enjoying a week's holiday with the 'Rancheros' riding down the west coast. Horses feature strongly. There are many pictures of him hunting with his daughter; there is even a sickly oil, showing the two returning after a hunt at sunset. Lord King's office leaves one in no doubt that the man is a name dropper and a lover of expensive things. The polished wooden furniture does not have the cheap reproduction sheen of most 'traditional' offices; Lord King's has a more worn, blue-blooded look about it. Yet blue-blooded is exactly what the man is not. He comes from humble origins and started out selling second-hand cars. Rather than capitalise on his rags-to-riches success, he prefers to draw a veil over the rags - showing an insecurity that is so blatant, and so unnecessary, it is almost touching. His is the old-fashioned style of management: he rules with charm of a pugnacious kind, pays no lip service to modernity. There are no computers in his room: 'You have to manage, not let yourself be managed by computers. I've got plenty of people to tell me what computers do,' he says. In addition to the two top secretaries, he has as a special adviser, Sir Francis Kennedy - whose distinguished Foreign Office career King races through by way of introduction. 'If I'm going to a foreign country, he organises for me to see the prime minister or president.' It is on this level that King operates best. His contacts are impressive by any standards; he is a great fixer. By his side is Sir Colin Marshall, the chief executive who plays the professional manager. King, by contrast, is not frightened to take decisions on impulse. On a large dining table in the middle of the room, a single letter sits next to a model of a British airways jet. 'The table is very convenient for anything that is impossible to answer. If I put something there I know I must tackle it,' he says. What is the letter? He can't remember and moves over to check. 'Someone wants me to do something. I don't know whether I should or not. Yes, perhaps I will.' What about his average day? When he is in London ('The week before last I was in Venezuela, last week I was in New York') he puts in long hours. He starts reading papers at five each morning. He gets into the office early, talking on the phone in his private London taxi as he goes. It is good preparation for a day of solid talking at the meetings that his secretary has set up back-to-back, months in advance.' Secretaries love to fill up diaries', he says. 'Its my job to deal with it.' A favourite slot in the day is lunch. If on his own, he goes to White's, his club. If he is entertaining, it is Green's, either in St James or in Westminster. The advantage of trekking across to Westminster is that he can keep an eye on his political friends. Otherwise he goes to the Savoy Grill which, he says, is where 'all the editors of your distinguished profession' eat their lunch. Lord King is not particularly articulate and tends to sound pompous. 'My office has reminders and comforts of a certain tranquility,' he says, summing up its charms. On the way out, he stops in his secretaries' room to show off their word processors, which are neither new nor remarkable. He points out the four clocks showing the times in different parts of the world, suddenly noticing that something is amiss. 'That clock is not straight,' he says, lunging at it. Behind his back, his secretaries exchange looks: exasperated, but not unaffectionate.</p>

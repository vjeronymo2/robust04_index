			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FAREWELL ADDRESS  </P> <P> Reagan's farewell speech was a masterpiece of deception filled with hypocrisy.  He failed to mention the scandals in his Administration, how he has been  anti-labor, restricted civil rights, ignored the homeless, supported cuts in  Medicare, VA, education, health and child care programs, tax increases for the  middle class, surtax on senior citizens receiving Medicare, curtailed  information to the media and finally approved the 50% pay raises which boosts  his own pension -- in addition to the $49,000 pension he receives from  California. I say: Good riddance!  </P> <P> PETER C. LATSIS  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

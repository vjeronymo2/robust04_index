			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Shareholders and creditors come to Camper's rescue Camper and Nicholsons, the UK yacht builder, was saved from closure yesterday. Shareholders and creditors have agreed to a restructuring package. Camper and Nicholsons had incurred trading losses of Pounds 1.66m over the last three years. The losses, which have been funded primarily by its Liberian-based parent company Naiad Ship Finance Corporation, have been exacerbated by two bad debts worth Pounds 720,000 which are subject to litigation. Out of total liabilities of Pounds 4.3m, shareholders and associated creditors were owed Pounds 3.4m and third party creditors Pounds 900,000. The yacht-makers bankers are owed Pounds 250,000 but are not covered by the deal. The package was negotiated by the company's directors and corporate recovery specialists from Coopers and Lybrand. The creditors agreed yesterday to the voluntary arrangement drawn up by Coopers and Lybrand. Under the voluntary arrangement, drawn up by Coopers and Lybrand, Naiad will make a cash contribution of Pounds 250,000 to the creditors. This should trigger a full recovery for the preferential creditors and 16p in the pound for the unsecured creditors. This could rise to 60 per cent if the bad debts are recovered and the company is sold within three years. Camper and Nicholsons employs 115 people. It is no longer associated with Camper and Nicholsons International, the yacht brokers. Naiad, which has invested Pounds 8.5m in the company since gaining a 95 per cent stake in 1982, will not reduce its shareholding under the deal but will dispose of its shareholding if a buyer can be found.</p>

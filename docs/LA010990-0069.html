			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER HEART SURGERY  </P> <P> Question: I had a bypass operation close to a year ago. Shortly after, my  doctor recommended that I get involved in a cardiac rehabilitation program, but  I guess I was too upset at the time to do anything about it.  </P> <P> I'm sorry now that I didn't, and I'd like to know if such a program would do me  any good if I got into one now.  </P> <P> Answer: The results of one study suggest that patients can benefit from a  cardiac rehabilitation program even if they enter one up to two years after  having had a heart attack or bypass surgery. However, those who begin  participating in such a program within six months of the event do appear to  realize greater benefits from it.  </P></p>

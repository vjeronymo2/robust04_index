			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPANISH COLONIALS  </P> <P> My parents were in Los Angeles recently and sent me a copy of Leon Whiteson's  article (" '20s Spanish Style Needs No Revival," March 5).  </P> <P> About a year ago, we moved into a Spanish Colonial home in Omaha. Spanish  Colonial exists, but is not a common style here.  </P> <P> Our home was designed in 1925 by an Omaha architect and has all of the  characteristics you mentioned except the white stucco. I think all of the  Spanish Colonial homes we have seen in Omaha are of a dark beige stucco.  However, we are interested in learning more about this style of architecture  and, after reading your article, are considering re-stuccoing the house white.  </P> <P> MAUREEN M.

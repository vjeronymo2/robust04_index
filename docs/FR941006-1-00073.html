			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission informs the committee which items serve as the basis for the sample, and the committee responds only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee shows that any errors found among the sample items were not excessive or prohibited contributions, timely refunded, reattributed or redesignated, or for some other reason were not errors, a new projection is made, based on the reduced number of errors in the sample. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is further proposing to clarify at new paragraphs 9007.1(f)(3) and 9038.1(f)(3) that the amount of any excessive or prohibited contributions that are not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner shall be paid to the United States Treasury. Committees have 30 days from the date of receipt in which to refund prohibited contributions, and 60 days in which to seek the reattribution, redesignation or refund of excessive contributions. 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) and (3). A committee's failure to take action on these contributions, as well as attempts to cure them outside of the specified time periods, would cause these contributions to be treated as in violation of the FECA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The equitable doctrine of disgorgement supports the payment to the Treasury under these circumstances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See generally, United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bonanno Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  683 F. Supp. 1411 (E.D.N.Y. 1988),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> aff'd <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  879 F.2d 20 (2d Cir. 1989) (disgorgement an appropriate, non-punitive remedy to deprive wrongdoers of their ill-gotten gains and to deter future violations). A payment to the Treasury is an equitable remedy for contributions that have been accepted in violation of 2 U.S.C. 441a and 441b, and is also consistent with past Commission practice. See Matter Under Review [``MUR''] 1704 (based upon preliminary estimates, Commission directed respondents to pay $350,000 to the United States Treasury for contributions that would have exceeded section 441a limits); Plaintiff's Motion to Effectuate Judgment,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FEC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Populist Party, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 92&hyph;0674 (HHG) (D.D.C. filed May 4, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, this proposed payment is analogous to, and consistent with, the requirement at 11 CFR 9038.6 that stale-dated checks be paid to the Treasury. This issue arose after the 1984 election cycle, and the rule was promulgated as a means to codify the Commission practice of requiring disgorgement, which was implemented during that cycle.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  52 FR 20864, 20874 (June 3, 1987). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disgorgement eliminates the need for the Commission to monitor a committee's refunds of excessive or prohibited contributions. In addition, it is easier for a committee to make one payment to the Treasury, as opposed to refunding multiple contributions. Finally, this is a practical approach in those situations where it is difficult to discern the original contributors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Further Streamlining the Audit Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is seeking comments and suggestions on ways to further reduce the amount of time it takes to audit publicly funded presidential committees, to make repayment determinations, and to complete the enforcement process for these committees. The Commission's responsibility for conducting a thorough audit and examination of qualified campaign expenses is set out at 26 U.S.C. 9007(a) and 9038(a). The Commission has an additional responsibility to conduct adjudications as to whether any portion of the public funds received should be subject to a repayment. 26 U.S.C. 9007(b) and 9038(b). The public financing statutes at 26 U.S.C. 9007(c) and 9038(c) specify a three year time period in which the Commission will notify publicly funded committees of repayment determinations. Separate enforcement procedures are prescribed under 2 U.S.C. 437g. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has taken several actions to help insure that the audit and repayment processes are completed as expeditiously as possible. For example, the 1991 revisions to the public financing regulations eased compliance with the state-by-state allocation rules set forth at 11 CFR 106.2, and implemented improved use of subpoenas in presidential audits. See 56 FR 35899&hyph;900, 35903&hyph;04 (July 29, 1991). In addition, as noted above, the Commission has begun to use generally accepted sampling procedures in conducting these audits, and has instituted a policy that limits a committee to one extension of time in which to respond to the Interim and Final Audit Reports [``IAR'' and ``FAR'']. These actions are having the desired effect, in that the Commission is currently on schedule, or ahead of schedule, with respect to nearly all 1992 audits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

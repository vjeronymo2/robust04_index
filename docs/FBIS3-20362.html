			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "New Stimulus to Relations After Silence"] </F>   [Text] The recent state of relations between Finland and  Russia may be described as an expectant silence. Russia has  curled up into itself with its own enormous problems. Like the  rest of the world, in Finland we have stopped to look at how  Russia's economic reforms are progressing and in which direction  the power relations between the different factions are  developing in that country. The talk about a special  relationship between Finland and Russia has died down.    The world has changed so much that talk about a new period  of  transition in relations between Finland and Russia sounds like a  hackneyed phrase. However, with the end of Mauno Koivisto's term  in office, the time when the special relationship between  Finland and Russia was founded on the maintenance of high-level  personal contacts is apparently finally at an end.    It is unlikely that Martti Ahtisaari can continue to operate  on the same basis. The world has changed, Russia has changed,  and the relationship between Russia and Finland has changed too.  There is no reason to yearn for the old days. We have to quickly  learn to live in keeping with the new circumstances without  losing any opportunities to make use of those advantages and  assets that we may have had for a long time in the past.    Getting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit Finland  had been put off for a regrettably long time. The damage has now  been repaired. Today, Chernomyrdin is more and more clearly  Russia's day-to-day strong man. We must, however, take care not  to lapse into the old pattern of thinking that Chernomyrdin  could become the key man in economic relations between Finland  and Russia. We must in the future be able to develop relations,  above all, directly with business firms.    The slowdown in Russia's market economy reforms does not  change this basic fact in any way, let alone Chernomyrdin's  promise to revive the former Economic Commission. The Economic  Commission may be of help in dealing with various financial  arrangements, guarantees, and countersecurities. But under the  new circumstances the commission will no longer be the  cooperation engine and problem resolver of the good old days.    The agreement between Neste [state oil company] and Gazprom  [gas industry], the world's biggest producer of natural gas, on  setting up a joint company is one model indicative of the  direction in which development should be oriented. The Russian  company is paying for its share in hard currency, markkas. At  the present time natural gas is probably one of the riskiest  fields for joint ventures. Hopefully, through it we will gain  momentum for Finland, too, in the important plans for a West  European natural gas network and for linking up both networks.  The Imatra Power Company's general agreement on overhauling  Russia's power plants is also a valuable new field.    Chernomyrdin's official visit as prime minister was devoted  solely to economic issues. President Martti Ahtisaari still  played a secondary role. Political relations and talk of a  special relationship between Finland and Russia may acquire new  significance if Finland becomes a member of the European Union.  In that case Russia will gain through Finland both a political  and an economic EU neighbor on its border.</p>

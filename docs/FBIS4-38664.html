			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The attitude of the ruling party to the  referendums organized on the initiative of the opposition groups  was expressed once again at a press conference in the Seimas  today.    Seimas Chancellor Neris Germanas, Vladas Butenas, member of  the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction, and faction elder  Justinas Karosas spoke at the press conference.    The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party members did not deny  the constitutional right to hold referendums but proposed an  assessment of the need for them and their cost. In their  opinion, the referendums proposed by the opposition on early  Seimas elections and savings compensation cannot result in  anything positive and will only create confusion in the state.  [passage omitted]    Justinas Karosas stressed that the 4 million litas cost of  one referendum is a large sum for the budget of a poor country.  [passage omitted]    Vladas Butenas rejected accusations by the opposition about  the government crisis. He stated that neither the president,  nor the Seimas, nor the government can be accused of inactivity.  They are all carrying out constitutional reforms. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICE NOT PERFECT FOOD  </P> <P> Question: I enjoy watching the programs on public television that deal with the  way people live in other parts of the world. It seems to me that in many  countries, children are brought up on rice, if they're lucky, and little else.  </P> <P> Is rice such a wonder food that it can provide everything a child needs in the  way of a nutritious diet?  </P> <P> Answer: Children who live almost entirely on rice do so out of necessity, not  out of choice. In many cases, the alternative is not to eat at all.  </P> <P> No single food can provide all of the child's nutritional needs, and rice is no  exception. For example, rice provides almost no Vitamin A, which is essential  for good vision. Children on all-rice diets who do not receive Vitamin A  supplements are at risk of blindness.  </P></p>

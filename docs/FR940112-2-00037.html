Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 20, 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12873, entitled ``Federal Acquisition, Recycling and Waste Prevention,'' (58 FR 5411, October 22, 1993). Section 503 of Executive Order 12873 requires EPA to ``issue guidance that recommends principles that Executive agencies should use in making determinations for the preference and purchase of environmentally preferable products.'' Draft guidance for implementing this provision is to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by EPA within 180 days from the effective date of the Executive Order (April 18, 1994). The Executive Order also allows the Agency to issue additional guidance for public comment on how the principles can be applied to specific product categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To implement section 503 of Executive Order 12873, the Agency is establishing a process whereby public input is solicited from all interested persons and organizations. This process will include public meetings and discussions with stakeholders where interested parties will be given an opportunity to comment on a concept paper. This concept paper will be available in late January and will describe the Agency's preliminary proposal on guiding principles that Federal agencies should use when making determinations for the preference and purchase of environmentally preferable products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To schedule oral testimony at the public meeting and to obtain a copy of the concept paper, contact EPA's Public Hearing Hotline, 110 Hartwell Avenue, Lexington, MA 02173&hyph;3198; telephone (617) 674&hyph;7374. Callers will receive mail confirmation of their scheduled testimony and logistical information. Persons who wish to make oral presentations must restrict testimony to 7 minutes and are also expected to provide three written copies of their completed comments for inclusion in the official record. If interested parties are unable to attend the public meetings, they are invited to submit written comments to the Agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Agency plans to hold a series of stakeholder meetings beginning in February, as time allows, at EPA Headquarters. The Agency will accept requests for participation in stakeholder meetings on a first-come, first-served basis. Persons or organizations wishing to sign up for stakeholder meetings with Agency representatives should contact Claudia O'Brien at the telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Due to the limited amount of time available to develop the draft guidance, the Agency requests that organizations and companies with similar interests arrange to meet with Agency representatives during the same time period. The Agency may also hold a limited number of audio or video conferences for persons or organizations lacking travel funding. Interested persons should contact Claudia O'Brien at the telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Approach <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has been directed by Executive Order 12873 to develop an approach for Federal acquisition of environmentally preferable products that not only minimizes environmental burden, but also provides incentives to industry to continuously improve the environmental performance of products and services to the Federal government. Ideally, the approach would guide Federal agencies in comparing environmental performance among competing products and services, so that the environmental impact becomes a criterion like cost or performance against which Federal agencies may select products or services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As currently envisioned, the Agency's guidance on acquisition of environmentally preferable products would include three components: (1) General principles and procedures that apply across product categories and that Federal agencies can use when implementing acquisition programs for the purchase of environmentally preferable products; (2) guidance for applying these principles to specific products or product categories (to be developed as appropriate at a later date); and (3) a code of practice that Federal agencies could use when judging the credibility of non-governmental environmental certification or eco-labeling programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lynn R.

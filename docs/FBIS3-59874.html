			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin: "Rights of the Kurds"] </F>   [Text] What rights does any national minority want in any  country?    The impostors of "the Kurdish struggle"--traitorous  groups--have never raised this question, nor has it been raised  by the nations that pretend to be concerned about the Kurds and  seek to protect them by falsehood and slander.    As for the traitorous groups, their foremost concern has  been  how to serve America, serve Iran, or serve any big or  neighboring country--indeed, how to achieve for the Zionist  entity its goals in the region. As a result, what price does  each of the parties pay? It is not in the form of rights for the  Kurds, but in the form of money that accumulates on gambling  tables and personal pleasures.    They have completely ignored in their talk and in their  cooperation with these parties the goal of the role that they  have termed "a struggle"--that is to say, its relation to the  rights of the Kurds. This is because the traitorous groups have  perceived before others and more than others that national  rights for the Kurds are utterly anathema to the customary  practice of their masters.    As for the international parties, they want the Kurdish  issue  to become an instrument to dissipate some of Iraq's thrust,  drain Iraq's resources, distract Iraq from its pan-Arab role,  and divert Iraq from building itself up; then they would push  Iraq into surrender to what the West wants and to the goals that  Zionism wants in the area.    When the Soviet Union split up, each nationality, however  insignificant, obtained a state or ministate as an acknowledged  right or rights, while this was kept from the Kurds as an  exception. No one in the new international order or in the  remains of the Soviet Union uttered a word about the rights of  the Kurds--bear in mind that Zionism, the United States, and the  West generally were in the position of being able to dictate  conditions to the new governments that the collapse left behind.    Since the eternal Mother of Battles, America, the entire  West, and the Zionists have wanted northern Iraq to remain  isolated from the body of the country. Their airplanes still fly  over this section, units of their armies still pollute it, and  the men and women of their intelligence agencies are still  plotting a role for one person and charting the course of  someone else. They extend the hand of generosity to leading  traitors and block the flow of aid to other Kurdish citizens.  Their audacity has gone as far as to accuse Iraq of blockading  the Kurds, while they blockade Iraq as a whole.    Amid this penetration and intervention unsanctioned by  international law and unjustified by custom or law, everyone has  ignored the question of what the Kurds' rights are and what  their condition is. In fact, talking even in a whisper or in  lies about these rights raises the resentment of one party and  the anger of another, and thus is a cause of discord. Iraq alone  and its leader Saddam Husayn in particular have raised the  question about the rights of the Kurds. The question was not  raised to deal with a difficult situation through which the  revolution was passing. It was not raised in the context of the  violent confrontation with the West. It did not come about in  order to avoid a sudden danger or to seek desired but threatened  security.    The subject of Kurdish rights was raised on the basis of an  ideology that regards people as equals--an ideology whose root  is in the Noble Koran and whose branches nourish themselves on  the facts of the age. The rights of the Kurds came from the  position of the state's power and ability--politically,  economically, and militarily--above all else.    The Kurds are Iraqi citizens first, and therefore they have  the rights and duties of every citizen.    The rights of the Kurds begin with their being recognized as  a minority with a special character on the one hand and  incorporated into the formation of Iraqi society on the other  hand. The Kurds consequently have the right to use their  language--indeed, to be educated in it alongside Arabic. They  have the right to adhere to their own customs and to develop  their culture.    Iraq, under the leadership and guidance of Saddam Husayn,  added that the Kurds should participate in governing Iraq as a  whole and that they should act as rulers in local affairs in the  context of the unity of Iraq and without prejudicing the rights  of the Iraqi people as a whole or of its central government in  guiding affairs so as to benefit everyone and prevent harm to  all.    Thus, Kurds have become members of the central government,  the central parliament, and central institutions--just as they  have come to have their local authorities.    Indeed, the Iraqi state has not neglected the right of the  Kurds to disagree among themselves in opinion and ideology in a  multiparty system to which all doors have been opened. In the  forefront of these parties were those who are now seeking the  sympathy of Iraq's enemies and inciting these enemies against  their own country.    What, other than what we have mentioned, are national  rights?    Furthermore, is it not Iraq, which is accused of blockading  the Kurds, that has spent billions to develop life in the  Kurdish regions, while the neighboring countries that the  traitors serve want to keep the Kurdish people locked in the age  of pastoralism?    Today, after the years of fighting in the Mother of Battles,  the Kurdish citizen realizes that under the leadership of Saddam  Husayn a free and dignified life for himself and his national  rights exist for the first time in history.    Certain it is that this truth will someday be transformed  into affectionate action that will amaze the world when, after  all the noise of propaganda, it is seen that Iraq's Kurds want  no alternative to their dignity and will accept no one but  Saddam Husayn as leader.</p>

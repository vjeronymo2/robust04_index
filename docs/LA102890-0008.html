			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GUIDE, GOSSIP, A GLIMPSE OF GLORY;  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA: A SPECIAL BOOKS EDITION;  </P> <P> RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).;  </P> <P>  1/2 "SUPREME FAITH . . . SOMEDAY WE'LL BE TOGETHER" BY MARY WILSON AND  PATRICIA ROMANOWSKI HARPER COLLINS ($19.95)  </P> <P> Where's the dirt? There's not much in this sequel to Wilson's 1986 "Dreamgirl"  -- about the rise of the Supremes, the Motown vocal trio featuring Diana Ross  that reigned in the '60s. Thanks to the dirt -- Wilson was the first to  extensively paint Ross as a villain in print -- the first book is billed as the  most successful autobiography by a pop performer in book-publishing history.  </P> <P> Apparently Wilson used up all the good gossip in the first one, which covered  the Supremes' rise up to Ross' departure in early 1970. The sequel reads like  something Wilson wrote to capitalize on the success of "Dreamgirl;" since then,  other books have also trashed Ross, robbing Wilson of her whipping girl.  </P> <P> Ross is a minor character in the new book, which covers the post-Ross decline  of the Supremes, Wilson's legal battles with Motown and her personal struggles.  A battered wife, Wilson triumphs over a bad marriage and tries to resurrect her  music career. None of this, however, is particularly riveting. This book would  be more interesting if the first one hadn't been so chock-full of juicy gossip,  whetting appetites for more of the same. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

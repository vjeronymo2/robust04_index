			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> FUTURE MOVIE LOCATION?  </P> <P> The City Council, in a bid to lure Hollywood production companies to Monrovia's  quiet streets, unanimously approved an ordinance Tuesday to cut filming fees by  about two-thirds. The first day of shooting will now cost $150 instead of $468,  and charges for each additional day are down from $234.50 to $75.  </P> <P> The amendment was prompted by a request from the California Film Commission,  which is trying to promote film production in the state. The commission was  created after California lost $3 billion worth of movie production to other  states in 1988.  </P> <P> In order to streamline the process of obtaining permits, the council also  instructed city employees to switch to the film commission's application and  insurance forms and imposed new deadlines for staff members to process the  applications.  </P></p>

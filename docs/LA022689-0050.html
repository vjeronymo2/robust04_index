			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPONSE TO 'STING'  </P> <P> You've no idea of the response which has resulted from Evelyn De Wolfe's  article (Feb. 5) about the "sting" operation. To date, I've heard from 48  individuals, from San Diego to San Francisco, and had two speaking invitations.  </P> <P> The comments have been uniformly positive (although I'm sure her handling of  the subject matter has dismayed some potential forgers). I am delighted to have  been in a position to contribute to the article, and the exposure which you  gave us is greatly appreciated.  </P> <P> H. COLLYER CHURCH  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

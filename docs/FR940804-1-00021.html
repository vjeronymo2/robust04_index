			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> NMFS published a proposed rule to list Johnson's seagrass as a threatened species on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48326). Critical habitat was not proposed for designation at that time because the analysis of impacts of the proposed designation, as required by section 4(b)(2) of the ESA, had not been completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS has now completed an environmental assessment (EA), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to evaluate both the environmental and economic impacts of the proposed critical habitat designation (See ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed designation identifies those physical and biological features of the habitat that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management consideration or protection. The direct economic and other impacts resulting from designating critical habitat, over and above those that result from listing the species, are expected to be minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the ESA as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) Essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species *&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' Areas outside the current range of a species can only be designated if a designation limited to the species' present distribution would be inadequate to ensure the conservation of the species. The term conservation, as defined in section 3(3) of the ESA, means ``*&blank;*&blank;* to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criteria to be considered in designating critical habitat are specified under 50 CFR 424.12. When designating critical habitat, NMFS considers physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management consideration or protection, including but not limited to the following: (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals or other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for breeding, reproduction or rearing of offspring; and, generally, (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, NMFS must list the known physical and biological features (primary constituent elements) within the designated area(s) that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management considerations or protection. These essential features may include, but are not limited to, food resources, water quality or quantity and vegetation and sediment types and stability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consideration of Economic and Other Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The economic, environmental and other impacts of a designation must also be evaluated and considered. NMFS must identify present and future activities that may adversely modify the proposed critical habitat or be affected by a designation. An area may be excluded from a critical habitat designation if NMFS determines that the overall benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation, unless the exclusion will result in the extinction of the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impacts considered in this analysis are only those incremental impacts that specifically result from designating critical habitat, above the economic and other impacts attributable to listing the species. These incremental impacts are expected to be minimal (See Significance of Designating Critical Habitat section). In general, the designation of critical habitat duplicates and reinforces the substantive protection resulting from the listing itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impacts attributable to listing include those resulting from the taking prohibitions under section 9 and associated regulations. With respect to fish and wildlife, ``taking'' as defined in the ESA includes harm to a listed species. Harm can occur through destruction or modification of habitat (whether or not designated as critical) that significantly impairs essential behaviors, including breeding, feeding or sheltering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to plants, section 9 of the ESA makes it unlawful for any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to ``remove and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any such area; or remove, cut, dig up, or damage or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any law or regulation of any state or in the course of any violation of a state criminal trespass law.'' Although this provision does not prohibit takings, such as harm or harassment of a species of fish or wildlife, it does provide protection for plants in areas under Federal jurisdiction and under state laws. As with the takings prohibition for fish and wildlife, these protections are triggered when a species is listed. Therefore, generally, the critical habitat designation will duplicate these protections. This is particularly true with respect to acts that ``remove, cut, dig up or damage or destroy listed plants in knowing violation of any law or regulation of any state.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

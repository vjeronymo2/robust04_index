			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Profit-takers depress dollar THE dollar came off its highs yesterday, pushed down by profit-taking late in the afternoon, writes Peggy Hollinger. Traders said a large selling order from a south-east Asian bank had been responsible for the dollar's dip. In New York, rumours that the Bundesbank and Federal Reserve were checking prices helped to push it lower in US trading. Traders said the US currency may have entered a phase of consolidation after the heady rises of recent days. In fact, said Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank, the dollar had dipped almost to the level where, 'if it had gone lower we would have started to see more aggressive selling'. There appeared to be a growing sense of nervousness about the dollar's strength, although there still appeared to be significant underlying demand. Some economists suggested the US currency's strength was premature. 'We are still likely to see further evidence of the weakness of the US economy,' said Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International. His comments were reinforced by worse than expected US data. The US December trade deficit came to Dollars 5.94bn, compared with forecasts of Dollars 4.9bn, while the weekly jobless figure rose by 18,000 - some 12,000 more than expected. The dollar largely ignored the numbers, however, and was trading above DM1.65 for a good part of the day. The US unit closed unchanged in London at DM1.6470. In New York it ended at DM1.6443. Two tranches of overnight intervention from the Bank of Japan failed to deter the dollar's early strength. The dollar ended near its highs against the yen at Y128.55. The Bank of Japan had intervened at Y128.23 and Y127.75. In New York it closed at Y128.60. Mr Cocker said the market had been too aware of the Bank of Japan's actions, too far in advance for the intervention to have any effect. 'If the market knows the Bank of Japan will be there, it won't turn the yen around,' he said. The D-Mark weakened against the Japanese currency from DM1.2808 to DM 1.2844 per 100 yen. The Bundesbank made it clear, yet again, after the conclusion of its council meeting that it had no intention of changing monetary policy. The D-Mark hit a five-month low against the French franc, falling below FFr3.40. It recovered to close at FFr3.4015. The franc was initially boosted by comments from finance minister Pierre Beregovoy, although enthusiasm was dampened by speculation of an imminent rate cut in France. The Dutch took advantage of the weaker D-Mark to cut the special advances money market rate from 9.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent. The guilder slipped to 112.5100/75 as a result. Sterling fell below its effective exchange rate mechanism floor - which was DM2.8853 last night - and closed at DM2.8825. Traders said the pound had taken little notice of GDP statistics showing that the UK economy, excluding oil, had shrunk for the sixth consecutive quarter.</p>

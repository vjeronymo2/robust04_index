			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Turn in Belgrade-Politics"] </F>   [Text] For the time being, we know very little about  [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's talks in Belgrade last  weekend. We know even less about the reasons for the suddenly  urgent visit. Therefore, we are forced to draw our conclusions  from the statements of the foreign minister and his host in  Belgrade and from the chance remarks made by [Prime Minister]  Peter Boross in his radio interview on 29 January.    What we can find out is that there has been a turn in the  Hungarian Government's Yugoslav policies.    The Hungarian statements suggest that the Yugoslav crisis  has  already been reevaluated in the secret rooms of international  politics and Jeszenszky actually "forwarded the CSCE's stance"  in Belgrade, in other words, he went there on a CSCE errand.  This latter statement is doubtful to say the least, and there  were no signs of the former up to last night. Therefore, these  statements are nothing but mere self-justification.    The turn was probably brought about by the fact that, in the  laboratories of Hungarian foreign politics, the view that "the  Serbs have won" must have become dominant, and we have to make  rapid use of the favorable moment. This view already almost  prevailed in early summer 1993, but it did not manage to break  through, because the need to catch up with the Atlantic side was  then dominant. At that time, the view in the United Nations and  NATO was that Milosevic and his Belgrade are responsible for the  situation in Bosnia and the Croatian Krajina -- even if the  other sides in the fighting share this responsibility. This  view has not changed since then.    It is a different matter that the international  organizations  seem to be impotent, they cannot find a way to a peaceful  solution, and they will not enter into a military solution.  However, they are still aware of what the running amok of the  grand nation-state concept could mean if, after Milosevic and  the Serbian victories were approved, it was let loose.    The foreign policy turn will probably be justified by the  expected positive change in the situation of the Vojvodina  Hungarians. The Hungarian Government is straying into an  extremely dodgy area through this. The statement that Milosevic  "is not averse to" the idea of territorial autonomy does not  mean anything and is not worth anything. And to talk about the  local assertion of democracy -- as Jeszenszky does -- is  meaningless under dictatorial circumstances. For the same  reason, it is impossible to appreciate the prime minister's  statement that "a legitimate government is operating" there.    For of all these reasons, it is also doubtful if the  Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] is acting wisely  when it enters into bargaining with Milosevic, who is hungry for  support and success, on an autonomy plan which, in its final  form, may give rise to further ethnic cleansing, and can incite  conflict between the national minorities even in places where  peace has so far been preserved.    Obviously, sooner or later, democratic order will also be  established in Rump Yugoslavia. At that time, will the  Hungarians be seen as the last ally of the dictatorship?  Because its ethnic party committed itself to Milosevic with the  active assistance of the mother country's government?    It would be appropriate to think in terms of the more  distant  future.</p>

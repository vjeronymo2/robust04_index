			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Inner-cities deal stays, says Major MR JOHN MAJOR denied in the Commons yesterday that an inner-cities aid programme had been cancelled. Challenged by Mr Peter Pike, Labour MP for Burnley, about a letter from the Department of the Environment to local councils warning them there would be no new projects under this programme, the prime minister said Pounds 176m would be available for the urban programme in 1993-94. That money will be for projects already approved. Mr Pike said cancellation of the programme, as a result of the public-spending settlement, would cause 'despair and despondency'.</p>

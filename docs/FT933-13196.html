			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / McGowan to float House of Fraser MR Brian McGowan contemplates his latest challenge: preparing the 59-store House of Fraser Stores group for flotation next year. The Egyptian Fayed brothers, who took over the stores in 1985, said yesterday they planned to float the chain next spring or summer - with the exception of the flagship Harrods. Mr Ali Fayed stepped down as chairman in favour of Mr McGowan. Mr McGowan recently announced he was retiring as chief executive of Williams Holdings at the end of 1993 to spend more time fishing. He turned down several other approaches but said the offer from House of Fraser 'rather appealed to me'. Assisting him will be Mr Andrew Jennings, managing director (left) and Mr Richard Scott, finance director (right). The Fayed brothers hope floating the House of Fraser stores, believed to have been valued at more than Pounds 500m by advisers SG Warburg, will allow them to pay off their debts while retaining control of Harrods.

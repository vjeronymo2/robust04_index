			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] has  issued a statement condemning the Greek parliament's decision  declaring 19 May as the anniversary of the so-called Pontus  massacre.    The political party groups jointly drafted a statement  drawing the attention of world public opinion. The statement,  which was read out by Mustafa Kalemli during today's session, is  as follows:    The declaration of 19 May, which marks the beginning of the  Turkish liberation struggle, as the anniversary of the so-called  Pontus massacre by the Greek parliament reflects an extremely  dangerous and warped mentality. We regret and condemn this  meaningless and baseless decision of the Greek parliament.    The Greek parliament appears to have forgotten that 75 years  ago Greece attacked Anatolia with the aim of eradicating the  Turkish nation. We would like to remind world public opinion of  the tyranny and barbarism applied by occupying Greece against  innocent people in Anatolia between 1919 and 1920. The actions  undertaken by Greece in Anatolia in violation of the law on wars  have been documented by the Lausanne Treaty, which is a  multilateral international document.    Given this situation, it is evident that the fact that the  Greek parliament is turning hostile attitudes against Turkey  into a state policy by distorting historical facts will merely  undermine bilateral relations and regional peace. We ask the  Greek parliament to display intelligence and common sense.</p>

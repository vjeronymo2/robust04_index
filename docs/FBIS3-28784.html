			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance  (MOF) announced Thursday [10 February] its belt-tightening draft  fiscal 1994 budget totaling 73,081.7 billion yen, up 1.0 percent  from the initial fiscal 1993 budget.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii presented the draft at an  evening cabinet meeting.    The Finance Ministry will immediately begin negotiations  with  other ministries and agencies on their allocation requests to  complete a government budget bill next Tuesday.    The growth rate is higher than the 0.2 percent rise in the  fiscal 1993 initial budget, but technical accounting methods  such as suspending transfers and moving up redemptions have been  used to inflate revenues and squeeze outlays. Without these  measures, the draft budget would have posted a year-to-year  contraction, officials said.    The general operating expenditures -- public works, defense  and other core outlays -- totaled 40,854.8 billion yen, up 2.3  percent to post the lowest growth since a 1.2 percent rise in  the initial fiscal 1988 budget.    Of the core spending, public works-related outlays come to  8,984.6 billion yen, up 4.0 percent, maintaining a relatively  high growth rate.    Defense spending is up 0.8 percent to 4,678.8 billion yen  and  official development assistance (ODA) is about 4 percent higher  at 1,055 billion yen.    As for other outlays, the ministry earmarked 14,360.2  billion  yen for debt-servicing costs, down 7.0 percent, 12,757.8 billion  yen for tax allocations to local governments, down 18.3 percent,  and an unchanged 1,300 billion yen for various purposes using  accumulated revenues from sales of shares of the privatized  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT).    The ministry also wants to return 1,544.8 billion yen  borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund in fiscal  1992 to cover a revenue shortfall.    On the revenue side, the draft budget estimates 53,665.0  billion yen in tax revenues, down 12.5 percent, due largely to  cuts of some 4,377.0 billion yen in income tax and other taxes.    Nontax revenues are expected to rise 104.8 percent to  5,601.2  billion yen, stemming from advanced loan redemptions, and income  from sales of NTT shares is estimated at 172.5 billion yen, down  7.5 percent.    The ministry is to issue a record 13,643.0 billion yen in  government bonds, up 67.8 percent, comprising 10,509.2 billion  yen in construction bonds to be used primarily for public works  and 3,133.8 billion yen in deficit-covering bonds for financing  the tax cuts. As a result, the dependence on public borrowings  comes to 18.7 percent of the budget, up from 11.2 percent in  fiscal 1993, and the outstanding balance of bonds tops 200  trillion yen for the first time to reach about 201 trillion yen,  up from an estimated 182 trillion for the current year.</p>

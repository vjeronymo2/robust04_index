			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Bankers and brokers breach crumbling walls - The link in the US between NationsBank and Dean Witter LAST week's announcement that NationsBank and Dean Witter are joining forces to run a securities brokerage firm is further evidence that the walls which have divided the US banking and securities businesses for more than half a century are crumbling. Although by law the two industries are meant to be kept strictly apart, the reality is quite different. A handful of the country's most securely-capitalised banks, notably JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, are allowed to underwrite and trade stocks and bonds just like any Wall Street securities firm. Some of the biggest broking houses and fund groups, such as Merrill Lynch and Fidelity, provide individual investors with a variety of services that mirror those available in banks. And many commercial banks offer mutual funds and other investment products to their customers. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which enshrined the separateness of the banking and securities businesses, is looking more and more redundant as regulators, under pressure to promote competition in the financial services industry, gradually allow banks and broking firms into each other's territories. NationsBank and Dean Witter have stepped into this evolving business environment with gusto. NationsBank is one of the largest banks in the US, and under the leadership of its ambitious chairman, Mr Hugh McColl, has earned a reputation for bold and innovative expansion. Dean Witter is also well respected within its industry. A large Wall Street securities house with a strong presence in retail stockbroking and a highly profitable credit card operation, Dean Witter is currently owned by the nationwide retail group, Sears, Roebuck. Next year, however, it is due to be sold to Sears' shareholders. The link with NationsBank can be seen in the context of a company looking to develop new businesses in advance of its independence. It was Dean Witter, after all, which approached NationsBank with the idea in the first place. The result of their union is Nations Securities, a firm that will be unlike anything else seen in the US securities or banking industries. The new operation's 400-strong army of brokers - half provided by NationsBank and half by Dean Witter - will not be manning telephones from a smart new headquarters in New York, or hustling stocks to individual investors through a network of broking offices. Instead, Nations Securities' brokers will be spread around hundreds of NationsBank branches across the southern and south-western states, selling a wide range of securities and investment products to regular bank customers. There are plans ultimately to syndicate services to other banks in the US. Like their counterparts in the securities industry, banks have been eager to build fee income from asset management to act as a counterweight to the more volatile earnings they make on their traditional business. Banks, however, have another incentive. In the past two years they have endured the sight of customers, unhappy with low yields on their bank products, moving their cash into stocks, bonds and funds in search of higher returns. This outflow of funds has been caused by extremely low US interest rates, and while at some stage in the medium term rates will doubtless come back up, longer-term demographic trends spell further trouble for banks. As a way round the problem the US banks have been trying to build up their asset management business, selling their own families of mutual funds through small securities subsidiaries. The strategy has had only a limited success. A key difficulty for banks has been a lack of experience in handling and selling investment products. Ms Nancy Bush, analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, says: 'It's very difficult to develop an investment-oriented culture within a commercial bank.' The link-up with Dean Witter should help solve that problem. The new operation will be run outside the bank structure, which should make it easier to create an environment suited to selling securities. There will also be a lot of new products to sell to customers, including fixed-income securities, municipal bonds, and individual stocks, as well as the large family of funds managed by Dean Witter. NationsBank has chosen in Dean Witter a firm with an extensive retail network, a strong sales culture and well-established asset management business. When asked what the bank gets from its new partner, Mr Dick Stilley, director of corporate communications at NationsBank, says: 'We gain more brokers, an infrastructure, a training programme and people who've been in this business a very long time.' NationsBank's chairman, Mr Hugh McColl, has already said he expects the venture to move the bank forward about 10 or 20 years in the asset management and securities broking business. The main attraction for Dean Witter is the access it will have to NationsBank's extensive customer base. Studies show that 80 per cent of bank customers in the US do not own investment products, so there is plenty of room for new growth. This is not the first time Dean Witter has attempted to sell securities products in an alien environment. The first, which involved the firm's brokers manning kiosks in Sears, Roebuck stores, failed. The setting of a bank branch, however, is much more conducive to the promotion of investment products. NationsBank has high hopes for the new venture. It expects the firm to break even in 1993, and within five years it should be contributing Dollars 50m to Dollars 60m to the bank's profits, which last year totalled Dollars 480m. The bank's existing small securities subsidiary, NationsBank Securities, will be merged into the new joint venture, which will be run by Mr Vincent Walls, a senior vice-president from Dean Witter. Analysts are sceptical that the link-up between NationsBank and Dean Witter will lead to a rash of similar ventures between banks and broking houses. The new company's first year will be watched closely by both banks and securities firms, says Ms Bush. 'I think people are willing to let NationsBank be something of a test case.'</p>

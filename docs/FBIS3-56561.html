			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] After the end of the visit by U.S. President  Bill Clinton to the Republic of Belarus, the government  delegation headed by Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav  Shushkevich, and the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the  Republic of Belarus, Vyacheslav Kebich, held a news conference  for republican and foreign journalists. In this news bulletin  we present a report on this event.    [Begin recording] [Shushkevich] Ladies and gentlemen, I am  pleased with the results of the visit. [passage omitted]    [Kebich, in Russian] I should like to say that the  government  took an active part in setting up the program of the visit, and  this question was agreed upon personally between Stanislav  Stanislavavich [Shushkevich] and me. The government commission  was headed by Mikalay Dzmitryevich Myasnikovich -- he is here --  and the visit was well organized. We discussed many topics.  [passage omitted] [indistinct passage]    [Shushkevich, in Russian] First of all, I want to note that  the question of compensation for the (?fissionable) material  being removed was raised during the talks for a third time. We  received an assurance during the talks with Senators Lugar and  Nunn, then in talks with Mr. Christopher. Today the position  was categorically confirmed by the U.S. side. This position was  agreed upon with Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. We, and the  U.S. side, raised the question many times. So, now it is a  question of formulating specific accords.    Now I would like to tell the esteemed correspondent: The  question should not be asked as to whether the positions were  agreed upon between the government and the Supreme Soviet at the  talks. That is an incorrect way of putting the question,  because we were one and the same [word indistinct], we have no  differences of view when it is a matter of the interests of the  Republic of Belarus. There is no difference, there never was  and never will be, because it is senseless and useless.  [passage omitted elaborating on this; Kebich agreeing with him]    [Kebich, in Russian] I can just add to what Stanislav  Stanislavavich said, that before the visit of Mr. Clinton I  received a letter from Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, saying  that Russia will take part in payment of this sum from the sale  of the uranium belonging to the Republic of Belarus. But as for  this sum, I do not want to name it -- this sum is subject to an  agreement, but I want to say that this sum will be sufficiently  large to support the economic condition of our republic. To put  it briefly, it will be equal to the equivalent of the nuclear  weaponry being removed. [passage indistinct]    [Kebich, in Russian] We have an interest in strengthening  interaction with NATO countries. We absolutely exclude the  possibility of political interference in our internal affairs,  and therefore, we have a very correct approach to those specific  proposals that are due to be included in the declaration, as you  understand, and in order to express our attitude to Partnership  for Peace with the NATO countries, we must conclude a  declaration with NATO, and in this declaration there must be a  certain number of articles. There is a proposal from the  Defense Ministry on this issue, but we specifically did not  bring them into our negotiations. I think that this a subject  for discussion in parliamentary commissions and in the  government. We are working out our attitude to this matter.    [Shushkevich, in Russian] We did not bring in these  questions, since I knew that these questions of (?foreign)  policy activity are questions that are in the competence of the  Supreme Soviet. [passage indistinct]    [Shushkevich, in Belarusian] Bill Clinton made a good  statement at the beginning our talks, that he would not want in  any way to give us advice how to act here in Belarus in solving  the main political questions. And I am grateful to him for  this. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

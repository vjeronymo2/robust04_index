			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bilston Enamels reduces losses Bilston &amp; Battersea Enamels made some improvement in the half year ended June 30 by cutting pre-tax losses from Pounds 52,000 to Pounds 28,000. But the recession showed no sign of abating, and the company said it continued to cut costs to preserve margins and cash flow. Turnover in the period was Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 1.61m). Sales in the UK improved 20 per cent on the low levels of last year, but exports continued to be eroded as the recession increasingly affected those markets. Losses per share came to 0.8p (0.9p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  Friday unveiled a plan to scale back Japan's plutonium recycling.    In an interim report on Japan's nuclear power policy, the  advisory committee for energy scrapped an original scheme to  start operation of a second nuclear recycling plant from around  2010.    When to start the operation of the second plant, designed to  reprocess spent nuclear fuel to produce plutonium, will be  decided around 2010, the report said.    The report called for limiting Japan's nuclear recycling to  a  nuclear power plant in Rokkasho, Aomori Prefecture, until the  second reprocessing plant is completed.    The Rokkasho plant is scheduled to begin reprocessing  nuclear  fuel around 2000, a delay from the mid-1990s of the previous  plan, the report said.    Japan's first "fast breeder reactor" should be built early  in  the next decade rather than the second half of the 1990s as  originally envisaged, it also said.    "The rescheduling does not mean Japan's nuclear policy has  retreated," an official at the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry told a press conference.    "Its policy of promoting plutonium use remains unchanged,"  he  said.    "Japan will proceed with the nuclear recycling plan in a  manner that doesn't raise global concern over nuclear  proliferation," he added.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (17): Nintendo's power play  -Industry GAME OVER: HOW NINTENDO ZAPPED AN AMERICAN INDUSTRY, CAPTURED YOUR DOLLARS, AND ENSLAVED YOUR CHILDREN by David Sheff Random House, Dollars 25 480 pages DURING 1990 the unthinkable happened. For the first time 'Q' ratings in the US, derived from surveys to indicate the popularity of politicians, film stars and other public figures, showed that Super Mario, Nintendo's electronic game mascot, was more recognised by American children than Mickey Mouse. 'The idea that Mario had become more popular than Mickey was to some a travesty that signaled the next phase of the Japanese invasion,' writes California-based author David Sheff. Sheff's book, researched over two years on the basis of interviews with Nintendo executives and its rivals, charts the rise and rise of the Japanese electronic games company through the late 1980s. In the process it provides a vivid but critical insight into the Kyoto-based company and its autocratic founder, Hiroshi Yamauchi. This is not a video games technical manual but an eminently readable business book which explains how, after a rocky start, Nintendo came to dominate a multi-billion-dollar industry in less than a decade. As many parents know, Nintendo is a force to be reckoned with. But anyone who has trouble taking seriously a company which built its success around an electronic cartoon character - a Brooklyn plumber supercharged with mushrooms who battles bomb-hurling mice, waltzing cacti and turtles - need only read some of the statistics in the first chapter. Nintendo is an astonishing success. By the end of the 1980s, just five years after the launch of the first Super Mario game, profits earned from its video games and the Nintendo Entertainment System hardware had transformed it into one of the world's most profitable companies. By 1991 it had replaced Toyota as Japan's most successful company. In 1991 the company earned about Dollars 1.5m for each of its 4,000 worldwide employees. Sony, with 10 times as many employees, earned Dollars 400m less. Last year Nintendo's pre-tax profits topped Dollars 1bn on sales of Dollars 5.75bn. There are as many Nintendo machines in the world - 50m to 60m - as personal computers. About a third of all US and Japanese homes now have a Nintendo-games playing machine. How has this been achieved? The key, argues Sheff, is that 'Nintendo had predicated its entire strategy on the control of both hardware and software.' Nintendo has kept tight control over the games cartridges, and extracting royalties for each of the 170m cartridges sold last year. In addition, Nintendo has pursued its strategy with single-minded determination, taking whatever action necessary to secure and maintain its dominant market position. As Sheff points out this has included a 'scorched earth' policy towards competitors, exclusive pacts with game developers and chip manufacturers, and a readiness to do battle with governments on three continents. Nevertheless, Sheff argues that Nintendo made a serious mistake when it delayed releasing a more advanced 16-bit machine - a lapse which allowed Sega, its arch rival, to secure a foothold in the market. Sheff, like his Nintendo-addicted son, is a video games fan, but his study is far from uncritical. If the book has a weakness it is when it looks to the future. Otherwise this book explains why Nintendo and video games are more than just kids' stuff.</p>

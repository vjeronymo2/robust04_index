			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates close level UK money rates were steady yesterday as sterling remained firm within the European monetary system and the drain of tax payments from the market decreased, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m funds early in the day. The main component contributing to the shortage was Pounds 735m in maturing treasury bills and repurchase arrangements from earlier days. Exchequer transactions, mostly comprising tax payments, drained Pounds 225m from the market, a lower level than seen earlier in the week. The Bank was able to inject a chunky Pounds 724m in early operations, puchasing outright Pounds 139m band 1 bills and opening a new date for repurchase funds. It bought Pounds 585m paper for resale to the market on February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. This was sufficient to remove any pressure for higher overnight rates, which fell back from 11 per cent on Thursday to 10 - 9 1/2 per cent by mid morning. In the afternoon session, just Pounds 10m band 1 bills were purchase before late assistance of Pounds 185 mopped up the remaining shortage of funds. The overnight money rate closed at 11 - 10 3/4 per cent; one-month interbank funds closed unchanged at 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent; three-month interbank funds at 10 -  9/16 per cent. In Frankfurt money market rates edged higher as operators anticipated a squeeze in liquidity conditions next week as pension fund payments drain funds from the market. Anticipating this, the Bundesbank yesterday injected 'section 17' funds into the market, transfering deposits held for the public sector into the commercial market. Call money was mostly traded at 9.45/55 per cent, from the 9.40/50 per cent level which has prevailed all week. The Bank of Japan kept liquidity conditions tight in Tokyo, despite another heavy fall by Japanese equity prices. The Nikkei stock market index fell by 500 points, matching the scale of declines which led to a fractional easing on money market conditions by the authorities earlier in the week. Faced with an estimated Y290bn liquidity shortage, later revised down to Y130bn, the Bank of Japan injected only Y100bn funds. As institutions scrambled for funding, call money interest rates were squeezed up  1/8 of a point to 5 per cent.</p>

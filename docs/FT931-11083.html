			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Personal View: Power must return to the provinces Britain needs strong, stable local government now more than at any time in recent years. Few aspects of modern British politics and administration have been more wasteful of public money and time than the seemingly endless disputes which have taken place between Whitehall and town halls. It is time for these disputes to end and to establish a new partnership between central and local government. While central government will always be the stronger partner, a reasonable recognition of the practical limits of its power and even more of its perspicacity is needed. Then we shall be able to make better headway in facing up to the country's social and economic problems. The government is learning this lesson, yet it continues to propose far-reaching changes in the powers and responsibilities of local government. Indeed, Britain is now close to a situation in which Whitehall takes decisions on relatively small matters affecting local people and communities. This is without it being able to place the issues in a local context, and it risks increasing people's alienation from the political system. My case for local government has four elements. The first is the most nebulous but the most important. Is it possible to imagine a healthy democracy at the level of the national government without there being a sound foundation in some system of local government? A healthy democracy rests not just upon a national parliament but needs vigorous political debate locally; the opportunity for citizens to participate in meaningful decisions affecting their communities; a means for communities to balance conflicting interests locally rather than needing to refer to the central authority; and a proper system of local accountability for financial management and propriety. Too often local democracy has been replaced by appointed bodies, answerable only to the centre. And I know from personal experience that the power and influence of an appointee are much less than that of a person who has been elected to a position, however flawed the process of election may be. Second, by spreading decision-makers we minimise the effects of any errors in public policy. We have the opportunity to experiment, perhaps to take some risks without committing the whole body politic to a particular course of action. It may well prove better to organise the provision of health, education or housing services in a new way. But what if it is not? By concentrating so much power at the centre we risk getting things spectacularly wrong and fail to allow for the testing and evaluation of new policy initiatives. Local government is also of continuing importance to Britain's economy. It employs 2.8m people and spends Pounds 60bn a year. It provides the necessary social and physical infrastructure to our economic life. A national partnership would allow central government time to concentrate upon national concerns with corresponding benefit to public policy. Third, a better partnership could in several ways save public expenditure. One would be by eliminating over time many of the organisations that have grown or been newly established in recent years to take over in whole or in part functions which were once the preserve of local authorities. Finally, the lessons of a comparative study of Britain's main competitor nations ought to be heeded. Each starts from a different position in the relative powers of its central and regional or local government. But none of our European partners is significantly reducing the power of local authorities. Nor does there appear to be so many disputes with local authorities, nor proposals to take over local powers and services without consultation with local government. The new democracies in eastern Europe are busy establishing vibrant local and regional governments. Can all these countries really be wrong while Britain is right? Recent history strongly suggests otherwise. Britain's local government is not perfect. By its very nature some authorities will manage their affairs better than others. But local government has gone a long way in recent years towards putting its own house in order. Westminster and Whitehall need to recognise this and be prepared to return some of the real power lost by local communities in recent years. If the principle of 'subsidiarity' is right for Europe, why is it not also right for Britain?

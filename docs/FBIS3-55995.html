Moscow Believes that Russian-U.S. Partnership Has  Entered a `Stage of Maturity'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Russian Foreign Ministry  believes that the message that Clinton will bring to Moscow is  that the reforms need "social cushions," and expects the U.S.  side to offer its assistance in this field. Diplomats are  recommending to President Yeltsin to raise the question of the  United States' increasing its influence in international  financial organizations with a view to unfreezing the funds  earmarked for Russia. At the same time, in Russia's opinion,  the economic effect from the abolition of discriminatory  limitations in trade substantially exceeds the scale of any  existing aid programs.    Deep in their hearts U.S. officials have presumably  understood that they are incapable of influencing the  development of the situation in Russia. Even so they continue  to support Yeltsin in the interest of global security. The  level of confidence achieved by the leaders of Russia and the  United States indeed has no precedent. During the visit the  presidents are expected to sign a document tentatively called  the Moscow Declaration. Although its final text has not been  coordinated yet, it is known to contain a number of new ideas in  the sphere of disarmament and nonproliferation of mass  destruction weapons, also defining the sides' general approaches  to the concept of Partnership for Peace. It is not ruled out  that in the near future Moscow will announce its intention to  acquire the status of an associate NATO member state  [strana-partner NATO]. The agenda for the talks on security  will include such topics as prohibiting the production of  fissionable materials for military purposes, a comprehensive ban  on nuclear tests, and the retargeting of strategic nuclear  forces. According to a high-ranking Russian diplomat who spoke  confidentially, Moscow is "advancing the idea" of Russia and the  United States making available special units for peacekeeping  operations under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE.  On the Russian side such a unit will be the 27th Motorized  Infantry Division and on the U.S. side the 3d Infantry Division.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry regards President Kravchuk's  consent to arrive in Moscow and fully reaffirm Ukraine's  obligations under the Lisbon Protocol as a major breakthrough.  Russian diplomats believe that thereby an end has been put to  debates on the fate of the Russian nuclear weapons stationed on  Ukrainian territory.    At the same time, the Russian-U.S. strategic partnership  which, according to a highly placed Russian diplomat, has  entered a "stage of maturity," is far from ideal. In particular  Moscow is not happy over Washington's attempts to  internationalize the conflicts on CIS territory. Russia  considers this territory to be the zone of its special  interests. Moscow is also unhappy with the fact that it is not  being admitted to talks on creating a new international  organization which is to replace the defunct Cocom. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Patten warns test boycott could hit budgets MR JOHN Patten yesterday sharpened his confrontation with teaching unions by hinting that a boycott of school tests this summer could weaken his hand with the Treasury in future education spending talks. The education secretary's remarks, in an interview with the Financial Times, underlined his determination to resist pressure from unions and some Conservative MPs for this summer's tests to be suspended pending a review. A concerted boycott by more than 400,000 teachers of at least some tests, affecting up to 1.2m pupils in schools everywhere bar Scotland, has moved closer as two teaching unions said they would ballot members over the tests for seven, 11 and 14-year-olds, after a third withdrew from testing last month. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, which withdrew last month, is defending its boycott in a legal battle with London's Wandsworth Council. Mr Patten's attempt to divide moderate teachers and more radical voices seemed to be dented by yesterday's refusal by the annual conference of the largest teaching union, the National Union of Teachers, to discuss an immediate strike over pay as part of a campaign with railworkers, firefighters and miners. Strike action by the NUT over pay is still possible next year. The conference will today consider whether to hold a second vote on boycotting appraisals of teachers' performance, used to determine merit pay rises. On Saturday it voted to ballot members on boycotting national tests. A summer of exam chaos in schools would undermine Mr Patten's political career - he has admitted that without tests he would be less able to withstand Treasury pressure on his department's budget. Mr Patten did not say whether teachers' pay or school budgets could be directly affected, but asked: 'How on earth can I argue in the forthcoming public spending round over education expenditure without the hard information of improving standards that testing gives?' The education secretary's confrontational strategy suggests that he believes many teachers, under pressure from parents, will eventually accept that the tests, although flawed, should go ahead so that improvements can be made next year. Mr Patten stressed the need for testing for 14-year-olds to start this year. 'Recent evidence demonstrates the contemporary tragedy that, of last summer's 16-year-old school leavers, up to 200,000 went on into the world still grappling with the English language.' The NUT yesterday voted to ban classes with more than 30 pupils, or more than 20 for practical lessons. The decision by the union's annual conference in Brighton means pupils face being sent home from class as teachers refuse to take large classes, Mr Patten was warned. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

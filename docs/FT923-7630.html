			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: Annie Get Your Gun - Theatre/Plymouth WHEN Ethel Merman revived Annie Get Your Gun in 1966, playing her own original part from 1946, it was dubbed 'Granny Get Your Gun.' But nothing could be more fresh, energetic and upbeat than this new production of Annie at The Theatre Royal, Plymouth. This is uplifting, sunny theatre, precisely sung, energetically danced and meticulously directed. The show has aged well. Annie was nearly written by Jerome Kern. He died in 1945 leaving the producers with everything but the music. They called on Irving Berlin in the spring of 1946, just before rehearsals were beginning, and he wrote them a golden score at breakneck speed. It opened at New York's Imperial Theatre in May 1946, and ran for 1,147 performances. Annie followed Showboat in setting a show within a show. It added two great American institutions, hotels and trains, and based itself on the life and times of Phoebe Anne Moses (1866-1926), sharpshooter and firebrand. The writers, Herbert and Dorothy Fields, had found a subject fantastic enough to meet the musical's demand for escapism. Roger Redfarn's direction knows that the musical offers the complete world. He leaves no character on stage redundant, even when not singing or dancing. The show-stopping ensemble 'I Got the Sun in The Morning' has a butler and footman singing to each other in the chorus, and makes two dancers pause before launching into the number, wondering whether to join in. The precise choreography complements the pacey orchestral accompaniment (Nick Davies) to make every aspect of the show hum with vitality. Each scene has its own rich design (Terry Parsons): stetsons and bustles in town, head-dresses and moccasins in the tee pee. Kim Criswelll plays Annie magnificently. She fills the stage with personality, rounding out a two dimensional part with the intimate 'Moonshine Lullaby' and the stomping 'I'm an Indian Too'. Opposite her, John Diedrich as Frank, her rival and beau, makes the most of Berlin's more varied fare, particularly 'My Defences are Down'. Their infectious energy transmits to the rest of the cast: Veronica Hart and Billy Burke as two young lovers, sing and dance their way into love, twice; Leon Greene (Buffalo Bill) and Brian Glover (Chief Sitting Bull) add height and depth. The all-singing all dancing chorus carries the ensemble numbers with verve and wit. This is a delightful piece of Americana, alive with movement and incident still foreign to the English sensibility. And it proves Berlin's wisdom, 'A man never trifles with girls who carry rifles'. The Theatre Royal, Plymouth, 0752-26722</p>

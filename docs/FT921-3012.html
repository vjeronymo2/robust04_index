			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Letter: Very different set of views Sir, The outcome of your survey ('Business chiefs want decisive Tory win', March 16) is totally predictable. These are the people who can, and have, paid themselves grotesque salaries at massively reduced tax rates and whose rates on their large houses have been reduced to insignificance via the poll tax. You should try surveying the 10-person business, grappling with the uniform business rate, late payment of invoices by big companies, inflated interest from aggressive banks which seem to be just waiting to liquidate one, savage VAT penalties for simple errors and so on. You would, I think, get some very different views about the Tories' economic management. M J Turner, 21 Lightburne Avenue, St Annes on Sea, Lancashire FY8 1SE</p>

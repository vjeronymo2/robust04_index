			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Export sales help raise Huntleigh Tech to Pounds 1.6m HUNTLEIGH Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment manufacturer, lifted taxable profits from Pounds 936,000 to Pounds 1.62m for the year to end-December. The 73 per cent surge was achieved on turnover increased to Pounds 17.44m (Pounds 14.87m), with more than 75 per cent of sales going abroad. Mr Julian Schild, finance director, predicted further profit increases. 'With an ageing population and the government under pressure to spend more on increasingly sophisticated medical equipment we believe we are in a recession-proof business.' The healthcare division represents 85 per cent of overall turnover. Earnings per share expanded by 78 per cent to 12.61p (7.1p). Net borrowings rose to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 1.8m), representing 52 per cent of shareholders funds. Net interest charges increased to Pounds 221,000 (Pounds 184,000). The increase in debt was due mainly to a heavy capital expenditure programme of Pounds 2.6m on new factories and machinery. A further Pounds 970,000 was spent on research and development. A proposed final dividend of 1.75p lifts the total by 1p to 3p. Mr Schild said the group would continue to develop and market new products in medical preventative techniques. It has recently launched a new version of Flowtron DVT, a pneumatic compression devise to prevent blood clots developing during surgery.</p>

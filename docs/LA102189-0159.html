			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMPETITORS UNDERESTIMATE LEXUS  </P> <P> It was only a month ago that BMW's top U.S. marketing executive predicted that  new luxury cars from Toyota and Nissan would not hurt his business much for at  least a couple of years, until they establish reputations.  </P> <P> But in its first month on the market, Toyota's Lexus is already outselling BMW  in the United States. Toyota officials said an early survey of buyers showed  that 15% were trading in BMWs.  </P> <P> Carl Flesher, BMW of North America's vice president for marketing, told  reporters in September he expected most early buyers of Lexus and Nissan  Infiniti cars to trade domestic luxury models, especially Cadillacs and  Lincolns. As the new cars build images for luxury and quality, he said, more  BMW and Mercedes-Benz owners would be tempted to switch.  </P> <P> Flesher contended that it is much too soon to measure the market impact of the  Japanese models.  </P> <P> "I think we need six months to see how this is going to gel," he said.  </P></p>

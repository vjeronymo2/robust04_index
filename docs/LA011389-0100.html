			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD / RANDY HARVEY;  </P> <P> SOME NAME ATHLETES TAKING WINTER OFF  </P> <P> The winter after the Summer Olympics should be one of the best for indoor track  and field in the United States because athletes, Americans and foreigners, can  use their 5-ring box-office appeal to turn gold, silver and bronze into dollars  and cents.  </P> <P> It is something like a victory tour, paid for by promoters who then can  advertise that they have a dozen or so Olympic medalists in their meets.  </P> <P> Most promoters, however, will be hard pressed to make such a claim during this  U.S. indoor season, which begins Saturday night with the Dallas Morning News  Games. Many of the sport's marquee names have decided to winter elsewhere.  </P> <P> Canada's Ben Johnson, of course, has no choice, having been sent to the  International Amateur Athletic Federation's penalty box for 2 years after  testing positive for steroid use at Seoul.  </P> <P> Neither will we see Florence Griffith Joyner or Sergei Bubka. And Carl Lewis,  so far, has committed to only one U.S. meet, the Houston Chronicle Games in his  hometown Jan. 28.  </P> <P> Take the money and run? Flojo has done the opposite. She ran and is now taking  the money. We have a better chance of catching her with Arsenio Hall on the Fox  Channel than with Evelyn Ashford at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Bubka, the Soviet pole vaulter who recently was named male athlete of the year  by Track &amp; Field News, apparently has enough VCRs in stock from his  previous U.S. visits. He won't need to return until he begins dealing in  compact disc players. He plans to compete only in Europe.  </P> <P> The Lewises, Carl and Steve, and their Santa Monica Track Club teammate, Joe  DeLoach, also will be seen more in Europe than in the United States. A fourth  member of the club, Danny Everett, probably will run in Japan.  </P> <P> U.S. track and field officials should be concerned. If the Santa Monica Track  Club is starting a trend, U.S. indoor track could go the same way as U.S.  outdoor track. Overseas.  </P> <P> "I've always put my athletes in U.S. meets," said Joe Douglas, manager of the  Santa Monica Track Club. "If I had my druthers, they'd be here again this  year."  </P> <P> But Douglas said that Europe and Japan offer better tracks and better pay.  </P> <P> "I have to think of my athletes first," he said.  </P> <P> At least for now, though, the U.S. indoor circuit remains the most established,  and its meets this winter will not be without attractions.  </P> <P> We will see no better high hurdles competition in the world this year than in  the Sunkist Invitational next Friday night at the Sports Arena, where 2-time  Olympic champion Roger Kingdom will race 2-time world champion Greg Foster and  1988 bronze medalist Tonie Campbell. Andre Phillips, who beat Edwin Moses at  Seoul in the intermediate hurdles, also is entered.  </P> <P> Foster is trying to come back after breaking his arm last summer, an injury  that prevented him from making the U.S. Olympic team, despite a valiant effort  at the trials.  </P> <P> Also trying to come back is Mary Decker Slaney, who had a disappointing  Olympics, finishing eighth in the 1,500 and 10th in the 3,000. She was not even  the best American in the 3,000 as Villanova's Vicki Huber finished sixth. Two  other Americans, Kim Gallagher in the 800 and Francie Larrieu-Smith, came close  at Seoul to breaking two of Slaney's long-standing American records.  </P> <P> Slaney proved that she is not ready for retirement by winning the Fifth Avenue  Mile after the Olympics. But apparently not everyone was impressed.  </P> <P> After a 14-year relationship with Slaney, Nike officials decided that she no  longer was worth a 6-figure annual contract and proposed a substantial cut this  year. She turned that down, then announced Thursday that she does not have a  shoe sponsor but that she will be competing for the L'eggs Running Club.  </P> <P> So it is important for her to re-establish herself as one of the world's best  middle-distance runners this winter. She will be tested. Romania's Paula Ivan,  the Olympic 1,500 champion, and the Soviet Union's Tatiana Samolenko, the  Olympic 3,000-meter champion, are expected to compete in the United States.  Samolenko and Slaney may meet in The Los Angeles Times/Eagle Games Feb. 17 at  the Forum.  </P> <P> Morocco's Said Aouita also has something to prove. He entered the Olympics  boasting that he could win the 800, 1,500 and 5,000. But he settled for third  in the 800, couldn't make it to the starting line for the semifinals in the  1,500 because of an injury and didn't enter the 5,000.  </P> <P> He continues to boast that he is the world's fastest man from the 1,500 through  the 10,000, although some close to him claim that he has run himself into the  ground. We will see, perhaps as early at the Feb. 3 Millrose Games at New York,  where he could meet Kenya's Julius Kariuki, the Olympic steeplechase champion,  in the 3,000.  </P> <P> And then there is Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has nothing to prove but will keep  trying anyway.  </P> <P> Whatever the amount that U.S. promoters pay her, it is not enough by half. Yet,  in the case of the Times/Eagle meet, she waived her fee so that it could be  donated to a charity benefiting sports programs for needy children in Los  Angeles. Much of her time, energy and money already go toward a similar program  that she established in her native East St. Louis.  </P> <P> Joyner-Kersee not only is the sport's best athlete but also its best  ambassador. She may compete in Japan this winter, but she also has commitments  to 3 U.S. indoor meets, including Saturday's at Dallas, and may enter 3 others.  </P> <P> Although there is little doubt that she would rather compete in the long jump,  her husband-coach, Bob Kersee, wants her to concentrate on the high hurdles.  This has been on ongoing battle between them.  </P> <P> "I've decided to soothe his ego by entering the hurdles," she said.  </P> <P> That was before she learned from meet director Will Kern during a luncheon last  week that the Soviet Union's Galina Chistyakova, the world record-holder in the  long jump, will compete at the Times/Eagle meet.  </P> <P> When the luncheon ended, Joyner-Kersee pulled Kern aside and said, "Don't count  me out of the long jump."  </P> <P> Track Notes  </P> <P> Brian Bridgewater, who won the state high school 200-meter championship last  year for Washington High, is sprinting for Long Beach City College. He has  entered the 60 meters at the Sunkist meet against a field that includes Houston  McTear, Nigeria's Chidi Imoh and Roy Martin.  </P> <P> The Athletics Congress, which governs track and field in the United States,  will have a third hearing Jan. 18 in San Jose for the U.S. athletes and  administrators who competed last fall in South Africa. Two previous hearings  have resulted in indefinite suspensions for 10 athletes and an administrator.  Among the athletes expected to attend this hearing are Olympians John Powell,  Carol Cady and Ruth Wysocki. TAC officials say that they will rule on the  length of the suspensions by the end of this month. . . . TAC named Carl Lewis  and Florence Griffith Joyner as its athletes of the year for 1988.  </P> <P> Great Britain's Sebastian Coe, 2-time Olympic champion in the 1,500, decided  not to retire after being left off the British team that went to Seoul last  summer. He will compete in the 800 meters at the European indoor meet next  month. Another British runner who appeared as if he might be finished with the  sport, David Moorcroft, is returning to the indoor circuit tonight at Hamilton,  Canada. He has entered the 3,000 next Friday night at the Sports Arena.  Moorcroft, a former world record-holder at 5,000 meters, was the subject of a  touching profile in Bud Greenspan's film after the 1984 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Several track athletes are among the Olympians expected to attend a U.S.  Olympic Committee career-counseling seminar Saturday at the Amateur Athletic  Foundation in Los Angeles to discuss their lives after sports. . . . Mike Tully  has recovered from Achilles tendon surgery and will compete Saturday at  Barcelona in a meet for pole vaulters only.  </P> <P> Organizers of the first Canadian indoor meet of the winter a week ago at  Saskatoon were a little shortsighted. After remarkable times were recorded in  the 1,500 and the 800, they decided to measure the track. They discovered that  it wasn't long enough. . . . When Primo Nebiolo resigned under pressure as the  president of the Italian track and field federation, speculation was that he  also would step down as president of the International Amateur Athletic  Federation. But he denies it. He said he was forced out in Italy because of  politics, not because of alleged corruption within the federation.  </P></p>

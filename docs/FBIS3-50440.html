			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Text] In the year's next to last session, the Legislative  Assembly approved the national general budget for fiscal 1994,  which amounts to 3.9034 billion balboas. The 1994 budget bill  is the largest in Panama's fiscal history, and it is the last  bill to be presented by President Guillermo Endara's  administration. Adhering to the constitutional principle and  mandate of having a balanced budget, the consolidated general  budget amounts to 3.9034 billion balboas in both revenues and  expenditures.    Contrary to what occurred with the 1993 budget, the assembly  managed to approve the 1994 budget before ending the current  period of sessions, which will end today in a formal ceremony  headed by Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino. The  legislators discussed the bill's acceptability in the final  debates. Legislators Gabriel Arosemena of the PDC [Christian  Democratic Party] and Gerardo Gonzalez of the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party] were the budget bill's staunchest opponents.    Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy minister, said  the 1994 budget was based on an agreement with the legislative  branch, adding that this helped expedite its approval. Cardenas  stressed that state budgets are never large enough to cover all  of the needs of each and every sector.    In general terms, the 1994 budget has two sections: 1) a  financial section, which gives figures for estimated income and  spending targets for the different government offices; and 2) a  rules section, which outlines those procedures that will  regulate the operational aspect of the budget cycle.    According to the budget, the central government has  operational expenses amounting to 1.5933 billion balboas and  total investments worth some 843.1 million. The central  government's current income is estimated at 1.4158 billion  balboas, while its capital income is estimated at 512.8 million  balboas.    Of the 512.8 million balboas in 1994 estimated capital  income, some 324.3 million will come from loans from  international credit organizations. Another 84.6 million  balboas will come from the sale of state properties, the Bayano  Cement Co., and buildings in the Colon Free Zone.    The budget assigns 843.1 million balboas to investments. In  this area, those sectors that will benefit most are education  with 48.5 million balboas, health with 96.1 million, and housing  with 61.8 million. In terms of debt service, the budget  includes 631.8 million balboas to be used to pay both foreign  and domestic creditors. The budget includes 348.3 million  balboas for foreign debt payments, 283.5 million to cancel the  domestic debt, 347.7 million for interest payments, and 284.1  million for amortization.</p>

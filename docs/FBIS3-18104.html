As soon as  the movement renounces violence, participates in the elections,  and accepts the basic principles of democracy, the movement will  be entitled to support.    This was stated by Development Cooperation Minister Pronk  this morning, during a discussion with the House of  Representatives. In principle, 100,000 guilders in financial  support has been appropriated for the ANC [African National  Congress], the National Party, the Freedom Alliance, and the  Inkatha movement. The outcome of the elections will then  determine how much money a specific party will get on top of  that.    The Council for the New South Africa, in which PvdA [Labor  Party], CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], VVD [People's Party  for Freedom and Democracy], D66 [Democrats 66], GroenLinks  [Green Left], SGP [Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed  Political Union], RPF [Reformational Political Federation] are  represented, determines whether or not a request from a South  African political party is complied with. For the next two  years, 10 million guilders is available. [passage omitted]</p>

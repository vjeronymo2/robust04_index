			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the general heading: "Our Aircraft </F> Are Valued in China, but the Tu-154 Crash Is the Worst in That  Country's Civil Aviation History"]    [Text] Russian spokesmen have categorically denied reports  from Beijing that the crashed Tu-154 aircraft had supposedly  undergone two major overhauls before it started operating in the  PRC.    Feliks Myasnikov, general director of the "Aviaeksport"  Foreign Economic Association, has reported that a new aircaft  was supplied to China under contract in 1986. Since then the  airliner, in full accordance with the recommended norms, has  undergone one planned overhaul, which was carried out at the  repair plant at Vnukovo in 1992. According to Feliks Myasnikov,  the Chinese side has not submitted data on the aircraft's  operation, but there can be no question of its operating life  having been exceeded with regard to any of the parameters.    The Main Aviation Industry Administration of the Russian  Federation State Committee for Defense Sectors of Industry has  reported that at the time of the aircraft's handover to the PRC  it had flown for 32 hours within the framework of control tests.</p>

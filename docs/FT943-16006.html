			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Taiwan banks report strong half-year gains Taiwan's six listed medium-business banks have posted strong half-year pre-tax profits. The three largest of these - Taipei Business Bank, Hsinchu Business Bank and Taitung Business Bank - saw pre-tax profits for the half-year to June 30 rise to TDollars 1.47bn (USDollars 54.8m), TDollars 1.36bn and TDollars 1.07bn respectively. This represents gains of 38.3 per cent, 25.8 per cent and 14.3 per cent respectively during the first six months. The banks, founded as credit unions backed by local families to finance small and medium-sized businesses, are restricted to particular districts. However, once they meet certain criteria, they will be allowed to convert in order to become nationwide banks.</p>

The high commissioner made a conditioned division of the  country's non-Latvians into those who really want to integrate  into the Latvian society and those who do not, and would leave  the country in next five years. He estimated the second group at  10,000 persons.    If somebody who lived in Latvia for a longer time failed to  learn the language, his willingness to integrate into the local  society as a full-fledged citizen becomes doubtful, said Van der  Stoel.    Van der Stoel, however, criticized the quota principle  stipulated by the Latvian draft citizenship law. The doubts and  uncertainty among non-citizens should disappear; they must have  a clear picture of their future, he said.    Ulmanis answered that he could not think about the future  not  thinking about the future of Latvians who also did not have  clear prospects in view of the threat of being pulled back to  the sphere of Russia's interests.    Consequently, it is not enough to judge by the language  skills on naturalization. The people brought to Latvia by force  or lured in by sweet promises should be offered a chance to  return home. But Latvia should receive some help to manage the  complicated process, said Ulmanis.</p>

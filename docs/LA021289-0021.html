			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPLINE: THEY MIGHT BE STARS  </P> <P> Attention all employers: If you've been noticing the mysterious number (718)  387-6962 popping up increasingly on those office phone bills, wonder no more.  It's the Dial-a-Song service of They Might Be Giants. For four years the skewed  rock duo from New Jersey has been offering callers a new song on the line each  day, publicizing the number with the added enticement that the service is, of  course, "free if you call from work."  </P> <P> For most fans, one song a day won't do. Addiction-prone members of what is  referred to in song as "the exploited working class" are increasingly spending  their own hard-earned dollars on They Might Be Giants. Neither of the duo's two  albums is on a major label; both -- including the recent "Lincoln" -- are  selling in the six-figure range.  </P> <P> Those numbers -- and mainstream media attention like guest shots with David  Letterman and rave reviews in People magazine -- aren't bad for an outfit that  has labored under an image as an East Coast intellectual novelty band.  </P> <P> That peg isn't groundless, given songs like "Youth Culture Killed My Dog," "Ana  Ng" (their latest alternative-radio hit) and "Kiss Me, Son of God" in which  absurdity is the means of bridging comedy and tragedy. Still, the two  singer/songwriters see the substance of their bizarre power-pop blend as less  jokey than "obsessively personal," if "lumpy and strange and hard to defend."  </P> <P> "The whole humor thing is sort of our cross to bear," admitted John Flansburgh,  partner of John Linnell, from his New Jersey home. "We especially flinch when  people say that we're comic. I feel like people will go into a coma if you talk  about humor in what you're doing. It's like hearing Jerry Lewis on some talk  show.  </P> <P> "But I do think we find as songwriters that using wordplay and having a lighter  touch actually helps us deal with issues that might actually be way too heavy  to deal with in a direct way, because without that element of lightness it just  would be considered absolutely moaning-and-groaning music."  </P> <P> Plus: "The other thing that's good about having humor in your music is that  it's actually funny." Check.  </P> <P> Some record industry types might find it funny that the duo has thus far  resisted what Flansburgh calls "the whole devil temptation of rock" and stayed  true to its minimalist roots -- still using tapes in lieu of a live rhythm  section, and still putting a new song each day on the answering machine in  Flansburgh's living room.  </P> <P> "In fact someone just called in. Did I tell you I got a machine that counts the  number of calls coming in? It was really a shock, because I never really knew  before how many people actually called, and there are days when it's around  300. It's really phenomenal. I mean, we make records now, so it's not like you  can't go get it." Chris Willman  </P></p>

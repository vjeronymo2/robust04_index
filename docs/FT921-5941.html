			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Lloyd's tragedy looks likely to run and run: Outline of the plot at the troubled insurance market ACT ONE of the drama now playing at the Lloyd's of London insurance market contained three extraordinary scenes. Staged in dingy corners of Westminster, they transformed a private vendetta by hard-hit Names - the individuals whose assets support the market's underwriting - into a public row. They forced the insurance market's authorities on to the defensive - it could even be argued that last week's appointment of Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, to direct investigations into alleged malpractice flowed directly from them. The Ambush Mr David Coleridge, the Lloyd's chairman, might have been forgiven for anticipating a gentle ride on February 11 at a 5pm appointment with Tory backbenchers at Westminster. True, the Pounds 116m settlement in the Outhwaite case - the biggest of a number of Lloyd's-related legal actions - would figure prominently in the next morning's headlines. But the second Guinness trial had just collapsed and Mr Peter Clowes had been jailed for 10 years so City-minded MPs might be expected to be preoccupied with other concerns. In any case, Lloyd's has traditionally enjoyed a cosy relationship with the Conservative party - nearly 60 Tory MPs, including ministers such as Mr Ian Lang, Mr Archie Hamilton and Mr John Wakeham, are Lloyd's members. Before the recent run of bad years MPs, like other well-to-do individuals, were attracted by the opportunity to make their capital work twice: investing it in orthodox fashion while at the same time committing it to Lloyd's to support underwriting. Of course, Names were solemnly warned that their liability was unlimited. But in the good years the prospect of penury must have seemed remote. The implication was that 'the moon will turn to blue cheese before you get a cash call', according to Mr Winston Churchill, a Conservative MP who became a Name in the 1970s. As 40 or so MPs assembled for the February 11 meeting in a Commons committee room, they were surprised to be handed a sheaf of 14 detailed and aggressive questions on the workings of Lloyd's, backed by a welter of supporting evidence. They included queries about why 'disastrously bad syndicates' were composed 'almost entirely of external or retired members' and why Lloyd's allowed 'excessive recruitment' of small investors with 'assets of only a bank guarantee of Pounds 100,000 on their house'. The dossier - the work of a prominent figure in one of the action groups representing the Names who face cash calls following losses on a number of syndicates - had a sting in the tail. Question 14 read: 'Is there not a structural rottenness over the conflicts of interest of the regulators within Lloyd's, which can only be met by outside regulation under the Financial Services Act?' According to one MP and Name who was present, those sitting within earshot were 'absolutely stunned by the questions and the detail backing them up'. Mr Coleridge 'practically had apoplexy' when he looked through them. The near-universal reaction among MPs was that the chairman's attempts to deal with the points raised was inept and unsatisfactory. 'We have seen Mr Coleridge on two occasions and found him to be very unconvincing,' said Mr Spencer Batiste, the Tory MP for Elmet and a Name. His 'lack of certainty or positiveness in addressing those questions' left 'a considerable feeling of unease', another MP and Name said . One upshot of the meeting appears to have been to encourage a small number of MPs to throw caution to the wind and seek a wider airing for their grievances. The Drop The following afternoon Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Workington who is known as a tenacious advocate of City reform, received a telephone call from a Tory MP he refuses to name, inviting him to a pre-arranged parliamentary visit to Lloyd's on February 17. Mr Campbell-Savours was due in hospital and suggested that the Tory MP approach Mr for Hackney South and Shoreditch. He asked for briefing notes, which arrived in the form of the questions put to Mr Coleridge the previous evening. Contact with Mr Sedgemore was made while the barrister was beavering away in the splendour of the Commons library. A pair of Tories approached, picking their way between the leather armchairs, and regaled their political opponent with details of their disillusionment with Lloyd's. About an hour later, a copy of the questions which had so discomfited the Lloyd's chairman appeared in Mr Sedgemore's Commons pigeonhole. The matter nearly died there and then - the former television presenter, who lists 'sleeping on the grass' as his Who's Who recreation, glanced at the papers and consigned them to the wastepaper basket. But a chance encounter led him to have second thoughts and he retrieved them. If he had not done so, the allegations of malpractice may not have entered the public domain the following day and Sir David Walker may not have been asked to direct the investigations. Once the potential was realised, the questions were plundered as the basis for a series of early-day motions on the Commons order paper for February 13. At this point, the charges were publicly available and had the protection of parliamentary privilege. Some Tories are prepared to condone publicly this method of bringing the allegations into the open. 'I think what the Labour MPs did was good,' says Mr Paul Marland, the MP for Gloucestershire West, who is one of 3,000 members of Gooda Walker syndicates to have received cash calls. The Lesson 'Tories declare war on Lloyd's' screamed the headline of the newspaper sitting on corporate affairs minister Mr John Redwood's desk as an Exmoor farmer walked into his office with a handful of other Lloyd's Names. It was 11am on February 13, the second visit in 15 days for the farmer - whose Lloyd's losses had put him in fear of having to sell land which had been in his family for 'very roughly 800 years'. On his first visit, the farmer - referred to as 'deep throat' by Mr Marland  -had presented the minister with a detailed exposition of the ways he believed the Lloyd's market was vulnerable to malpractice. With the aid of research accumulated over months, he set out to initiate Mr Redwood in the mysteries of 'churning' and the 'LMX spiral'. He says the alleged malpractice at Lloyd's would be 'quickly exposed if it took place at my local sheep market because it would be too simple'. He says Mr Redwood told him on February 13 that his first visit had been the first time the minister had been told of alleged misdeeds in the market. One cannot be sure how important a factor in subsequent developments this teach-in will be. The Department of Trade and Industry denies putting pressure on Lloyd's, which does not fall within its jurisdiction.</p>

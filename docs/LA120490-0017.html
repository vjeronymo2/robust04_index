			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> COMING AWAKE TO THE MEANING OF SLEEP;  </P> <P> ASLEEP IN THE FAST LANE: THE IMPACT OF SLEEP ON WORK BY LYDIA DOTTO WILLIAM  MORROW &amp; CO. $21.95, 352 PAGES  </P> <P> In "Asleep in the Fast Lane," Canadian science writer Lydia Dotto lists three  modern curses that blur the line between night and day. The first, jet lag, had  me wide awake recently at 4 a.m., so I turned on the lights (the second curse)  and an all-news radio station in time to hear that Chrysler was about to start  a 24-hour work schedule (the third curse).  </P> <P> Manufacturing experts were warning Chrysler that running a plant around the  clock might strain the machinery. No sleep experts, however, spoke up for the  workers whose body clocks could be wrecked by such a schedule.  </P> <P> "Asleep in the Fast Lane" isn't so much about why sleepy people shouldn't  operate machinery as it is about how we can control that third of our lives we  spend asleep so that we are alert when we are awake. Dotto opens "Asleep in the  Fast Lane" dramatically, taking her readers to Toronto's Defence and Civil  Institute of Environmental Medicine, where she volunteered for an experiment in  staying awake for 50 hours. Then, with firsthand knowledge of how sleep  deprivation can wreak physical and psychological havoc, Dotto explores the  phenomenon of sleep in the context of sleep medicine.  </P> <P> That we dream during REM sleep (so-called because it can be detected by Rapid  Eye Movement) is no new finding. However, a recently-discovered sleep disorder  is characterized by a cessation of the normal paralysis that occurs during REM  sleep, so that the sleeper actually acts out the dream, even to the point of  homicide.  </P> <P> Dotto tells us about circadian rhythm (a term derived from the Latin circa  (about) and dies (day), our biological clocks that follow a 24-hour cycle, and  the subtle rhythms within the cycle that include mini-sleep/wake cycles. She  verifies what many of us have long suspected, that we work better at certain  times of day than others. These high and low points correlate with the fact  that both the Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island accidents occurred around 4 a.m.,  as do a disproportionate number of automobile crashes.  </P> <P> Shift workers, jet pilots who zip through time zones, and astronauts in space  labs work without regard to the rising and setting of the sun. But the human  body has not kept up with human ingenuity. There have been instances, Dotto  tells us, when whole crews in jet airplanes have fallen asleep in the cockpit  and overflown their destination.  </P> <P> The solution to the hazards of nontraditional work shifts may be to return to  ancient sleep habits. Many mammals take short naps round the clock. Others,  like apes, nap after lunch. Can naps make workers more efficient? Apparently  they can, for some people, and in the proper dosage. But how can we be sure a  worker is rested and alert?  </P> <P> Dotto describes one solution, a device developed for Transport Canada for  possible use by air traffic controllers. SQUID (Superconducting Quantum  Interference Detector) is a helmet-like device with 60 sensors that monitors  magnetic brain activity and can sound an alert should the worker doze off. This  could herald a new directive in the workplace: sleep management.  </P> <P> The idea of monitoring someone's brain waves has overtones of Big Brother and  would probably be a hard sell. But it is not very different from urinalysis for  drug detection, which is now mandatory in many jobs that put the lives of other  people at risk.  </P> <P> Dotto's research is far-ranging. She tells us that for a long-distance racing  sailor, a few minutes sleep at regular intervals spelled success. Are we to  conclude that catnapping in order to sustain high performance is good for all  of us? Should we sleep more or less? One researcher she quotes says that "most  people in industrialized societies suffer from chronic partial sleep  deprivation." Another says "the average sleeper can reduce his or her sleep by  about 1 1/2 to 2 hours . . . without suffering."  </P> <P> Whom should we believe? Dotto doesn't say. The wealth of her research is  diminished by repetition and by her refusal to evaluate often contradictory  research. But her message is basically a sound one: Since we are developing new  sleep patterns in a world increasingly removed from the dictates of nature, we  ought to know what we are doing so we don't fall "Asleep in the Fast Lane."  </P> <P> Next: Jonathan Kirsch reviews "In the Shadow of Death: Living Outside the Gates  of Mauthausen" by Gordon J. Horwitz (The Free Press).  </P></p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Iraq rejects deal over jailed Britons Iraq yesterday turned down an appeal to release two Britons serving long jail terms for illegally entering the country, the head of the British Red Cross said, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Mr Michael Whitlam, director general of the British Red Cross, said he had offered Iraq's deputy prime minister, Mr Tariq Aziz, further humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people if Mr Michael Wainwright and Mr Paul Ride were set free. Mr Wainwright, 42, was sentenced to 10 years after cycling into Iraq from Turkey last May. Mr Ride, 33, was jailed last August for seven years for straying across the border from Kuwait.</p>

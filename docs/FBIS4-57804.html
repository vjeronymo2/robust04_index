			<p>BFN     [Text] One day after the Sole Workers Center [CUT] decided  in its national congress that it can neither support nor aid the  Workers Party [PT], PT presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula  da Silva campaigned on 23 May outside factories in the Sao Paulo  ABC region from a loudspeaker-equipped van owned by the  CUT-affiliated metalworkers union. On 23 May, Lula, who said  earlier he is against CUT support, stated it is up to the  workers to decide who should use the van. In the opinion of  electoral specialist Antonio Carlos Mendes, Lula violated  electoral laws.</p>

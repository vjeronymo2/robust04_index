			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- China and the United  States share a wide range of common interests. Both sides should  seize the opportunity created by the formal meeting between  Chinese and U.S. head of governments to help maintain the sound  momentum which has begun in relations, Premier Li Peng told a  group of U.S. senators here this afternoon.    "China's door is open to you. I hope that after this visit  you will know more about China and further explore many  possibilities for bilateral trade and economic cooperation," Li  said during the meeting with a U.S. Senate delegation led by  Bennett Johnston, chairman of the Senate's Energy and Natural  Resources Committee.    Li said a year of joint efforts has led to active  improvements in Sino-American relations, especially as the  formal conference between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S.  President Bill Clinton in Seattle was of great importance for  the development of bilateral relations.    "To catch this opportunity to strengthen communications and  cooperation in different fields and on different levels will not  only be in the interests of our two countries and peoples but be  helpful to the peace, stability and development of the whole  world, and of Asia in particular," Li said.    Li said the differences between the two countries should be  resolved on the basis of equality, mutual respect and seeking  common points while preserving differences.    "The differences are in a less important position than that  of our common interests, and should not affect bilateral  relations on the whole," Li said.    He said China and the United States have common interests in  preserving world peace and Asian stability, and promoting  mutually beneficial cooperation in every field.    Li said that the trade and economics of the two countries  are  comlementary, and it is in the best interests of both sides to  enhance cooperation in these aspects.    As China is undergoing a large-scale modernization and  foreign capital is entering more spheres, "we are glad to see  that American enterprises in the manufacturing industries as  well as some leading securities firms have ventured into China,"  he said.    Li held that China welcomes entrepreneurs from the United  States as well as from other countries to invest in China's  coal, electricity, oil, telecommunication and railway industries.    He said China has a huge market. In the next seven years  China's imports will hit the 700 billion U.S. dollar-mark, which  will render Sino-U.S. Cooperation in trade and economy promising.    "We believe that foresighted American statesmen and  entrepreneurs will not remain aloof from this market or turn a  deaf ear to this precious opportunity," Li said.    During the meeting Johnston said that now people have more  reason to believe that it is in the best interests of both  countries to build a strong and close relationship.    He said the development of bilateral trade will be  invigorated when a permanent and formal relationship is set up  between China and the United States and that the  most-favored-nation trade status is no longer debated annually.    Johnston said that he will, as usual, do his best to promote  bilateral, especially economic and trade, relations.    The delegation, which arrived in Beijing 4 January at the  invitation of the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs, consists  of 25 persons, including seven senators. It was reported that  the visit in China by such a huge U.S. Senate delegation has  been quite unusual.    As scheduled, during their five-day tour of China they will  head for Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong  Province, after winding up their stay in Beijing.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / People: Non-executive directors The TSB Group has headhunted Hans-Detlef Bosel, a board member of Bavarian bank Bayerische Vereinsbank, to join as its ninth non-executive director and to provide the group with a 'European view'. Bosel, who is 43, is currently in charge of retail banking in Germany, with regional responsibilities for the UK and Austria. He has worked at Vereinsbank, which is Germany's fourth largest private sector bank, for the past 12 years, having previously been at Citibank, where he joined as a trainee in Frankfurt, and later picked up international exposure in London, New York and Chicago. TSB says it was looking for an experienced banker who was young, had a solid international grounding and was particularly familiar with both the UK and Europe. It adds that the European dimension was important given that the Continent is much further advanced than is Britain as regards bancassurance, or the cross-selling of financial services. TSB regards itself as the pioneer in this field within the UK, an area that has proved a bright spot for the bank amidst all its other troubles. Bayerische Vereinsbank has co-operated with Victoria, Germany's fourth largest insurer, since 1990. ***** Graeme Elliot, former vice-chairman of Slough Estates, at AUTOMATED SECURITY HOLDINGS. ***** Larry Tucker, a partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, at BLENHEIM GROUP. ***** Ian Reeves, formerly executive chairman, as non-executive chairman at HIGH-POINT GROUP. ***** Atilla Uras, Ali Tigrel , directors of Auric Holdings which is a major shareholder, and Levend Beriker, industrial co-ordinator for Auric Holdings and Marmara Bank, which has provided loans, at BULLERS. ***** Ben Martin, who is retiring from BZW, at BRAKE BROS. ***** Lord Barnett has resigned from CONRAD CONTINENTAL. ***** Franz Winkelmann has resigned from ANGLO IRISH BANK CORPORATION. ***** Jack Schumann has retired from STAR COMPUTER. ***** Henry Clayton, a director of ALEXANDERS HOLDINGS, has died.</p>

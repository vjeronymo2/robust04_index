			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Treatment of repurchasing debt - Andrew Jack discusses the effect of a new accounting rule THE battle lines are drawn over a prospective new accounting rule which could force several prominent British companies to take as a charge in their current financial year many millions of pounds spent in repurchasing debt. The principal companies affected immediately will be the privatised utilities which successfully took part in the government debt auction last November: British Telecom, Scottish Power, PowerGen and Scottish Hydro. At stake is a mooted ruling from the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board, which could be published and enforced as early as next spring. The decision has not yet been finalised, but the task force says the preliminary view of a majority of its members is that any gain or loss to a company on the repurchase of its own debt should be recognised immediately. The alternative view - already adopted and defended by some companies - is to defer these items and recognise them over the period of the loan. Scottish Hydro-Electric has already publicly announced that it intends to adopt the former approach. The company bought back from the government Pounds 116m in 11.5 per cent debt redeemable in 2001, using cash and some short-term borrowings. It will show a redemption charge in its accounts for the year to March 31 next year of Pounds 12.5m. That cost will be offset by an estimated saving in interest payments of Pounds 1m for the current year and Pounds 4m a year thereafter. There will also be the impact of the short-term borrowings it used on the repurchase, which are currently estimated at about Pounds 20m. 'It would be more of a nuisance value to keep writing off the debt each year,' says Mr John Gray, finance director. 'It's better to take a big hit now while it is flagged and fresh in the minds of analysts. It's nice to clean these issues up.' That is a view shared by Mr John Rennocks, finance director of Powergen, which bought back Pounds 150m 11.9 per cent debt at a premium of Pounds 19m. 'I think this is the most sensible and reasonable solution,' he says. Mr Ray Hinton, technical partner at Arthur Andersen and a member of the task force, echoes these views. He says the argument works on two levels. Intellectually, the ASB's statement of principles says an asset is a right or access to future economic benefits. The gains or loss on repurchase of debt would not qualify. Intuitively, he says: 'People didn't feel comfortable with taking the gains or losses on one type of transaction and pitching it on to another.' To have reached its preliminary view, only two task force members could have voted against. Most are strongly minded to support the move when they meet again in January. It could then come into force almost at once. But Mr Duncan Whyte, finance director of Scottish Power, takes the alternative view. 'We have made it very clear we will write off the debt over the period it was redeemable,' he says. 'To do otherwise would be inconsistent and lead to distortion of earnings.' He stresses that this is not a short-term, self-serving solution. PowerGen has already adopted the practice as part of its declared accounting policies, and used it in a previous repurchase of about Pounds 13m in debt from the National Loan Fund. Had it adopted the task force's approach rather than amortising the gains, it would have boosted short-term earnings. But with a financial year-end in March, it may be forced to change its approach to comply with the new ruling. That will mean showing the Pounds 18m premium on the profit and loss account, offset by about Pounds 4m a year in saved interest payments assuming interest of 7 per cent. Meanwhile, British Telecom has yet to make up its mind. It bought back Pounds 320m in the government debt auction at 12.25 per cent, some redeemable in 2000 and the rest in 2002. That incurred a premium believed to be about Pounds 55m. There is a wider significance to the task force's statement last week. First, it represents an attempt to ensure that preparers of accounts are notified well in advance to give time for consultation. That follows anger from companies that they were caught by surprise by a ruling a year ago on the treatment of goodwill on the disposal of acquisitions. Second, debt repurchase is one of the first issues on which the task force has been used as a sounding board for a prospective accounting treatment. This is in line with a plea earlier this month by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, the ASB's parent body, who wants to get away from the practice of the task force reacting to unusual treatments already produced in published accounts. Scottish Hydro approached the task force over the summer to ask how it should deal with the repurchase of its debt. It - and particularly the other utilities - will watch the final task force ruling with great interest.</p>

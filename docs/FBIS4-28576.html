			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Communique of the Provisional National Commission Against </F> the Second U.S. War of Aggression in Cambodia"; dated 5 June]    [Text] Since May 1st, when we announced the establishment  of the Provisional National Commission Against the Second U.S.  War of Aggression in Cambodia, we have received a succession of  letters, particularly from students, teachers, professors, civil  servants, soldiers, farmers, and traders in various provinces  and districts of our Cambodia. These letters have welcomed and  voiced support for the establishment of our Commission and have  exposed and demonstrated the bad consequences of the previous  U.S. war of aggression and the consequences that will result  from the continued fueling of the communist Vietnamese  aggressors' war by the U.S. Administration in Cambodia.    Our Commission has been greatly encouraged by this vigorous  support. The commission would like to issue this communique  summing up the essence of these letters.    1. What were the tremendously destructive effects and what  was the nature of the suffering that resulted from the first  U.S. war of aggression?    The first U.S. war of aggression in Cambodia lasted from  March 1970 to April 1975. This war was a large-scale one  involving land, naval, and air forces, and artillery, including  the forces of [late Cambodian general] Lon Nol and (Thieu-Ky)  [former South Vietnamese leader]. Then, the entire Cambodian  territory was the victim of bullets, shells, and all sorts of  bombs dropped from aircraft. Some of the bombs weighed up to  1,000 kilograms and made craters as big as ponds and reservoirs.  Some bombs damaged the soil, as for example in Ratanakiri,  Mondolkiri, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Kandal, Takeo, and Kampot. To  this day these craters remain visible.    Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of oxen and buffaloes,  the  farmers' livelihood, were killed by bullets and shells. The  United States used B-52, B-57, F-105, F-4, F-111, OV-10, L-24,  C-130, C- 121, DC-3, and DC-7 aircraft, and all types of  helicopters, to drop various kinds of bombs, which destroyed  entire villages, property, water jars, plates, cooking pans,  fish paste, and salt. Everything was destroyed. Forests in  eastern Cambodia, such as in Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, Kratie,  Stung Treng, and Kompong Cham were razed and transformed into  open fields. Some trees were damaged, shattered, or pierced  through. Thousands of cubic meters of timber were destroyed.  People fled their houses and villages to avoid aircraft; they  lived in the forest and were affected by malaria and fever. The  health of tens of thousands of people was affected; these people  are still suffering. Consequently, the children of these people  were also affected with limb disability, blindness, and neurotic  diseases. Apart from this, tens of thousands of our people  died; and hundreds of thousands more were disabled in provinces  in eastern Cambodia as well as in the central part of the  country and in areas around Phnom Penh city.    Women, men, adolescents, babies, and elderly people all  suffered from this savage U.S. war. Some have become abnormal  due to the effects on their brains, nerves, and body. All this  was the result of the U.S. reliance on the strength of its war  machine to kill the Cambodian nation and people. Nobody forgets  this; no Cambodian forgets this -- neither do the land, rivers,  lakes, ponds, forests, and hills. The results are permanently  engraved and will be visible everywhere for generations.    2. Another bad consequence of the U.S. Administration's  involvement in the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war of  aggression in Cambodia was the deaths of American people.    The United States interference in Cambodia now comes on top  of the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war in the form of  military advisers and specialists, and through the supply of  tanks, aircraft, and ammunition. This amounts to a declaration  of war. Later on, more military advisers, specialists, or U.S.  troops will be directly involved in various ways or on different  battlefields in Cambodia. Later on, the United States will send  500, 1,000, or 5,000 soldiers to Cambodia, saying that these  troops are for protecting U.S. experts and advisers. In fact,  these troops will come to participate directly in the fighting  in Cambodia.    Now that the United States has dispatched advisers to wage  war to kill the Cambodian nation and people, the problem is  this: Will U.S. soldiers be killed or not; will they be wounded  or not? No one can be certain about this because a war is the  fighting among warring parties. If you have come to kill  others, other people also have the right to defend themselves.  If the United States has a lot of weapons and can kill 100 or  1,000 Cambodians on each battlefield, some U.S. soldiers will  unavoidably be killed or wounded, from a few to a dozen. If the  war continues, more Cambodians and increasing numbers of  Americans will be killed.    This is the law of war: if you play with fire, you will be  burned. The Cambodian people do not want war, neither do the  American people. This is certain.    Therefore, on this occasion, the Cambodian people in all  circles would like to appeal to the United States, which loves  peace, justice, and mankind, not to let Americans die in vain in  Cambodia. The American people have clearly understood the bad  consequences of the military involvements of previous U.S.  Administrations.    1. War sowed great destruction for the Cambodian nation  and people, who have suffered for 15 years from the Vietnamese  aggressors' war.    2. War will kill Cambodians as well as Americans, if the  U.S. Administration ventures into and get involved in the  communist Vietnamese's war in Cambodia.    3. The Cambodian and American people, who love peace and  justice, want peace and not death. The two peoples want to have  peaceful and friendly relations.    This is the profound request of both the Cambodian and  American people. The Cambodian and American people should  cooperate to prevent the U.S. Administration from sending troops  to fight in Cambodia through any means -- whether through  military advisers and experts, aircraft pilots, or those who  repair roads and bridges for transporting troops and war  equipment. These persons will all be involved in war.    We hold that the American people, like the Cambodian people,  want peace and peaceful and friendly relations. We repeatedly  appeal for the use of peace and friendship to solve the  Cambodian problem. This way is a thousand millions times better  than fueling the war. Involvement in war is a thousand millions  times worse than ending it. The Cambodian people and the  American people want peace and are totally opposed to war.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 5 June 1994    [Signed] The Provisional National Commission Against the  U.S. War of Aggression in Cambodia</p>

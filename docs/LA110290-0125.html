			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMELDA MARCOS SEEKING DEAL TO RETURN HOME  </P> <P> Making her first visit to Los Angeles since she was acquitted of fraud and  racketeering charges in July, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos said  Thursday that she is seeking a settlement with the Philippine government that  would allow her to return to her homeland.  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino's government has filed a civil suit in Los Angeles  federal court, seeking to recover some of the estimated $5 billion the  government claims was looted from its Treasury by the Marcos regime.  </P> <P> "Right now, talks are going on about this case, whether it should proceed or  not," Marcos, 61, said before a speech Thursday evening to supporters in  Carson.  </P> <P> She said she had rejected earlier suggestions of a settlement because of the  criminal charges pending against her.  </P> <P> Her acquittal in New York federal court provided the vindication she said she  needed before discussing a settlement. "Now that the verdict is in, that's good  money. That's clean money," she told more than 600 loyalists at a rally at the  Carson Community Center.  </P> <P> Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand E. Marcos, fled the Philippines in 1986  after the government was toppled.  </P> <P> "Now that the country is in dire need of funds, I offer to share whatever  wealth or resources I have with the Filipino people," the former First Lady  said Thursday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Philippine Consulate spokesman Roy Gorre said his government has  not ruled out the possibility of a settlement.  </P></p>

The seminars were sponsored by the Xinjiang Geographic  Institute, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the  Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan.    The seminars focused on two subjects: use of water resources  and control of mud-rock flow.    The seminars were held in Urumqi, capital of China's  Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Region, and Almaty, capital of Kazakhstan.  Scientist attending the meetings visited water conservancy and  mud- rock flow control projects in the autonomous region.    Xinjiang and Kazakhstan are neighbors in the desert area of  Central Asia. Two rivers flow from Xinjiang into Kazakhstan,  which are major water sources for Kazakhstan's inland areas.  The two rivers are fed by melting glaciers. As the globe  becomes warmer, glaciers have been shrinking faster rising to  higher altitude, while the rivers have seen less water flow.  This phenomenon poses a serious threat of water shortages in  the region.    At the same time, mud-rock flows have caused large losses of  life and property in the area.    The seminars were attended by 74 scientists from Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan, Russia, Japan and Germany.  Participants put forward 83 theses on rational tapping of water  resources and control of mud-rock flow.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MITSUBISHI RAYON PLANS HOUSTON PLANT  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Rayon Co., a leading Japanese chemical company, said it plans to  open a facility at the Bayport Industrial Park.  </P> <P> Dianal America Inc., a fully owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Rayon, will  specialize in production of acrylic specialty polymers, used in production of  toners for copy machines, inks, adhesives and paints.  </P> <P> The first Japanese chemical plant opened six years ago in the Bayport  Industrial Park, along the Houston Ship Channel near Pasadena, said John Brock,  president of the Greater Houston Partnership's Economic Development Division.  </P> <P> Houston now is the only American city with six such facilities, he said. The  others are Kaneka Texas Corp., Evalca, Zeon Chemicals Texas Inc., Nisseki  Chemical Texas Inc., and Arakawa Chemical Industries Inc.  </P> <P> Construction of the Dianal facility is expected to begin in July, with  production beginning in mid-1991.  </P> <P> "This is a unique situation that will greatly benefit Houston's economy and job  market," said Saadat Syal, an Economic Development Division vice president.  </P> <P> "In addition, every job created at the actual chemical plant site will create  another five more jobs in the community in construction, supplies and  services."  </P> <P> Houston was chosen over other cities because of the availability of its  petrochemical infrastructure, port facilities and human resource capabilities,  said Yataro Nagai, president of Mitsubishi Rayon.  </P></p>

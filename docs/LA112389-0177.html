			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HELPING HANDS: The Orange County Rescue Mission is crediting increased  awareness of the homeless situation for the big surge in volunteerism for  today's Thanksgiving feed. . . . The mission, which expects to feed 3,000  today, turned down about 50 volunteers after getting 150 signed up, about 65  more than it used last Thanksgiving. . . . Volunteers can try again for  Christmas, when 200 will be needed. Dana Parsons  </P></p>

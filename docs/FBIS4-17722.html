			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 28 Apr -- The Tajik Special Services  arrested several people in Dushanbe on Wednesday [27 April] for  disseminating antigovernment leaflets calling for the armed  overthrow of the Republic's present regime. Those arrested were  caught red-handed with a stack of proclamations. The ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told this today by the Ministry of Internal  Affairs press center, which declined to give more information in  view of the interests of the investigation.    Two days ago in Dushanbe and adjacent areas unidentified  people distributed proclamations signed by Rizvon Alimardon, one  of the leaders of the irreconcileable opposition in exile, who  calls himself commander of the Joint Armed Forces of the Islamic  Revival Movement of Tajikistan, calling on compatriots to wage a  general armed struggle against the "pro-Communist government."  According to the authors of the leaflets, the pro-Communist  forces are mainly to blame for the civil war that has been  unleashed in Tajikistan, and on coming to power they "brought  the people to complete destitution." According to the  proclamation, the "Red Plague" in Tajikistan should be destroyed.</p>

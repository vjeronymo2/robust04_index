After the talks the two ministers held a news  conference. In a brief statement the Ukrainian minister said,  among other things:    [Begin Zlenko recording, in Ukrainian with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] The main result of our visit to  Croatia is the fact that after discussing issues of mutual  interest, we achieved near identity of views on numerous  problems. We also agreed on the main guidelines concerning the  development of our relations and on a need to resolve some  concrete issues. Apart from this we agreed on a legal framework  for ways of resolving these issues, and decided what we could  start working on in the near future. Interstate expert groups  will meet to try and resolve certain issues.    However, and this is most important, we are all convinced  that the Croatian people view the Ukrainian people with sympathy  and this forms a basis for the future comprehensive development  of cooperation between the two countries.    Our future concrete tasks include the preparation and  signing, very shortly, of an agreement on friendly cooperation,  expected to take place at the time of Premier Granic's visit to  Kiev. We also agreed -- because of a failure to implement the  agreement on trade cooperation signed three years ago -- to  prepare another such document with more realistic objectives.  We hope that this is already a substantial progress in our  relations. [end recording]    In his statement Croatian Minister Mate Granic stressed the  following:    [Begin Granic recording] It is perhaps worth saying that  Croatia and Ukraine have no open questions and that political  relations and goodwill are at present way above economic  cooperation. It is clear that both countries are preoccupied  with their own problems. For Croatia, the most important  question at present is the reintegration of the occupied  territories in the legal system of Croatia. Ukraine is more  preoccupied with economic issues. I believe, however, that we  will achieve a more substantial development of economic  relations, for which we have realistic chances. [end recording]</p>

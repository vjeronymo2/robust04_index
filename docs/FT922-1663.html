			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Partner at BDO resigns after coup THE NATIONAL managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth-largest UK accountancy firm by fee income, resigned on Thursday night after a partnership coup removed him from his post. Mr Chris Swinson was replaced by Mr John Norton, the existing senior partner, at a meeting of the firm's national partnership committee. Mr Swinson resigned from the firm shortly afterwards. Mr Swinson said yesterday that his resignation had followed 'a dispute about the future management of the business'. He said: 'It was just untenable to continue with the firm.' He denied that the dispute was over a possible merger with another accountancy firm, 'I have a mixture of emotions,' Mr Swinson said. 'Some of it is relief, some of it is disappointment. I am currently examining my options and enjoying the company of my family.' Mr Swinson has been an outspoken voice in the accountancy profession and he failed to win the vice-presidency of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales this year. He had been widely credited with saving BDO when he was appointed a few years ago. Earlier this month BDO reported fee income down by more than 4 per cent, one of only four of the top 25 firms to report an absolute decline. The result reduced its ranking from seventh to eighth-largest UK firm.</p>

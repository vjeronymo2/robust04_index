			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim </F> Basindwah by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Abu-Husayn] You said during your recent visit  to Cairo that what is happening in Yemen is merely a state of  rebellion and that it would be settled in no more than 48 hours.  The Yemeni war has now entered its second month. Do you still  believe it is a state of rebellion and civilian-military  disobedience?    [Basindwah] Yes, what is happening in Yemen is no more than  a state of rebellion and disobedience. And even though the  battle has continued for longer than expected, the reason is  because we did not know that the group of apostasy and secession  had all the weapons we have just discovered. We did not know  that it had important strategic bases, which has caused the  fighting to continue for longer than expected. All this prompts  us now to say that the group of rebellion had made preparations,  not for the sake of threatening its opponents in Yemen, but  maybe for the sake of imposing its hegemony over the region as a  whole.    [Abu-Husayn] What do you mean by that accusation?    [Basindwah] The Socialist Party, which is led by al-Bid,  espoused the popular fronts for the liberation of Gulf states,  as it used to say. It used to consider their system of  government as reactionary and linked to Western imperialism, so  it should be reexamined.    The important thing is that, despite all this military  preparedness by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the legitimate leadership in  Yemen has managed to take control of three very large  governorates -- namely Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah -- from three  directions. And Aden is now -- to a large extent -- besieged  from several directions, especially the al-'Anad base, which is  actually the third military base in the world in terms of the  position and preparations inside it. [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] If the infighting in Yemen is merely an  internal rebellion, why did the Security Council discuss it?    [Basindwah] Some people say that what is happening in Yemen  affects the region's security and safety, and we stress that we  welcome any endeavors as long as they take account of Yemen's  unity and constitutional legitimacy and refer to the  Constitution of the Republic of Yemen. This is in addition to  the return of the forces belonging to the group of apostasy,  secession, and rebellion to their natural position as an  integral part of legitimacy under President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    [Abu-Husayn] Is the Security Council abiding by the Yemeni  demands you have listed?    [Basindwah] We are opposed to the Security Council's  discussing what is happening in Yemen, because what is happening  in our country is an internal affair. However, we cannot  prevent the Security Council [from intervening] by virtue of the  new world situation.    [Abu-Husayn] What if the Security Council adopts a  resolution on a cease-fire only, without prior conditions?    [Basindwah] No, no. If that happens, the Security Council  must stress respect for Yemen's unity and compliance with  legitimacy. [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] When will a cease-fire be announced?    [Basindwah] We will respond to a cease-fire the moment the  secession decision has been revoked and once unionist elements  in the Socialist party leadership have announced their  compliance with constitutional legitimacy.    [Abu-Husayn] And what if the southern leadership refuses to  revoke the decision to announce the new [Democratic] Republic of  Yemen?    [Basindwah] The fighting will continue. I would like to  point out here that we do not want to impose unity by force,  because the unity was established before the war, that is four  years ago. It was achieved voluntarily, and a people's  referendum on it and on the Constitution was held. So it is the  south which is seeking to impose secession by force. We are  defending the homeland's unity against this armed rebellion.  [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] [Question not given]    [Basindwah] A federation or a confederation might suit  states whose peoples are divided among themselves ideologically,  religiously, and linguistically. But in Yemen, we are one  Muslim people. There are no religious minorities or sects.  Yemen has been one country throughout history. For example,  what happened between Egypt and Syria in 1958 does not apply to  our case in Yemen. [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] If 'Ali Salim al-Bid -- and this is an  assumption -- announces a decision to revoke the republic  decision, would you hold a dialogue with him?    [Basindwah] No, no, no. We would deal with the elements not  implicated in the secessionist scheme. There are many people on  whom we are pinning great hopes.    [Abu-Husayn] Like whom?    [Basindwah] I do not want to specify names so that the  Socialist Party will not suspect anything.    [Abu-Husayn] Is that a maneuver on the northern leadership's  part to split the Socialist Party, as al-Bid and al-'Attas say?    [Basindwah] The Socialist Party has split within itself more  than once in the past, and we were not responsible for that.  [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] Was the discovery of oil a direct cause of the  separation, as is being said?    [Basindwah] Maybe that is the thinking of al-Bid and  al-'Attas, the group of rebellion seeking to monopolize the  Hadhramaut area to establish a state for them in it. But the  inhabitants of the area will not allow them to do that.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / G7 silent on Russian rescheduling DEPUTY finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations last week took no decision on Russia's request for a speedy rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt of Dollars 70bn (Pounds 35.1bn), postponing the issue to a Paris Club meeting which may be held within a few weeks. In the latest Russian cry of anguish over meeting debt payments, Mr Andrei Nechayev, economics minister, said Russia would find it difficult to clean up arrears and return joint venture funds 'frozen' in Vneshekonombank, which handles most foreign exchange business. 'These funds were not frozen, they were spent a long time before by this government came to power,' he explained. He promised however that the government wanted to issue five-year hard currency bonds for the holders of such funds. It was also serious about turning some debt obligations into property: yesterday Philip Morris, the US tobacco-based conglomerate, asked to be given office space in part repayment of outstanding debts owed to it by Russia. Meanwhile, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the acting central bank chairman, said yesterday that Russia had just Dollars 100m to spare for intervening to defend the ever weakening rouble. He also called for enterprises to be forced to sell all their hard currency earnings to the state, instead of just 50 per cent at present. Compulsory sales of all hard currency revenues are a normal part of internal convertibility schemes used in other countries but have so far not been introduced in Russia. Although Russia's export revenues amounted to Dollars 2bn a month, Mr Gerashchenko said an average of only Dollars 25m is sold every month on Moscow's fledgling official foreign exchange market.

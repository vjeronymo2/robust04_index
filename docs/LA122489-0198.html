			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> PUTTING THE '80S BEHIND US;  </P> <P> WHY HAS A DECADE THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS SO BUOYANT ENDED IN SUCH SEETHING  MEAN-SPIRITEDNESS?  </P> <P> The phrase has a nice sound, iambic and alliterative, a door softly clicking  shut: The end of the '80s.  </P> <P> But no divorce is truly final. One of the paradoxes of American life is how  deeply the phrase "put it behind us" is rooted in our cultural lexicon --  implying how often we find ourselves having to "heal" from one form or another  of lacerating violence and betrayal. Yet we love our nostalgic, picture-book  essays, our trivial pursuit into the torrential imagery of the past.  </P> <P> The '80s, for a few moments so buoyant, now seem so shallow that their  after-image is already fading before our eyes, like the memory of those  prominent paintings spirited out of sight by nouveau riche zillionaires.  </P> <P> Everyone knows it was a time in which everything of value was tinged with the  color of money, a period of the blockbuster deal and postponed moral debt. The  takeover artist, whether entrepreneurial or corporate, became the cultural  mover as business rumbled the arts. Our growingly sophisticated media  technology blitzed us with unprecedented media hype. Our insatiable thirst for  entertainment required an ever-widening pool of empty celebrity to satisfy us.  The image became our lingua franca.  </P> <P> And what has this meant to the American culture?  </P> <P> Paul Simon may have been kidding-in-earnest when in "Graceland" he sang, "This  is an age of miracles and wonder." The end of the '80s will be noted as the  time when the American Century posted its closing notice early, when the Cold  War '40s rolled to their end at last with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and  Europe felt young again while America seemed suddenly to grow fussy and old.  </P> <P> "No one ever dreamed that the West's vision of utopia would turn out to be  American," said author-journalist Tom Wolfe. "You talk to the young  intellectuals in Europe; they're looking to America. What has happened in this  great battle of ideas -- democracy versus Marxism -- can only be an enormous  victory to the country. Unless the colossal Matterhorn of debt collapses on  us."  </P> <P> If the Reagan Revolution represents both the climax of America's postwar  attempt to maintain a free world and an unprecedented domestic wealth, why is  it that life on our cultural front isn't correspondingly jubilant?  </P> <P> Why has the decade ended in such seething mean-spiritedness, where Kathleen  Turner and Michael Douglas savage each other in "The War of the Roses" with  infinitely greater malice than the Bickersons or even George and Martha in  "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"; where Andrew Dice Clay's sneering depiction  of women as submissive sexual pigs whips his audiences into brute, misogynistic  glee; where Spike Lee's Mookie in "Do the Right Thing" (one of the few movies  of the decade to carry the charge of a gut concern) touches off a race riot and  then demands payment from the man whose life he's virtually destroyed?  </P> <P> A sullen mood of betrayal hangs over the culture. Where once TV cop shows  contented themselves with tracking pimps, murderers and drug-dealers and then  cutting to the chase that gets evil into the slammer by 10 o'clock, the  Byzantine plot of "Wise Guy" unfolds over a common theme -- the good guy is  being sold out by his superiors, who are involved in a cover-up. The corruption  of authority is a given now in our prime-time consciousness.  </P> <P> If you're going back to the future again, you'll discover that your Mom looks  like a novice hooker. If you're coming back from the future, it will be with  the report that John Rambo has metamorphosed into a cyborgenic terminator with  an Austrian accent who, even after all his skin has been seared off and his  body dismembered, will still try to strangle the object of his obsessive hunt  -- an innocent woman.  </P> <P> The over-technologized, post-apocalyptic future itself looks to be broken down  into smoky pockets of warring barbaric tribes, surly Hulk Hogans brandishing  Uzis and chains. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner," Rutger Hauer's poignant  message about the sanctity of life is uttered from dying lips in a world that  resembles an overturned incinerator. Emerson observed of America, "All has an  onward, a prospective look." Not anymore.  </P> <P> The technology of our age of miracles and wonder included the CD, PC, microwave  oven, computer workplace, fax, cellular phone, aerodynamic auto design,  computerized ticket sales, satellite communications, the hand-held videotape  recorder, the Panther movie camera, colorization, the lithium-based battery,  ethanol and the Mavica camera. (Polavision, the disc camera, RCA's $250-million  investment in the video disc and the Betamax were ideas whose time came and  went).  </P> <P> All these modes of communication with so little to communicate. If, as Harvard  psychologist Howard Gardner tells us, "Music mirrors the structure and the  range of our emotions: it has the same kind of flow as our emotional life,"  what does the industrial screech of heavy metal tell us about psychic structure  and range, or the relentless pile-driver rhythm of rap that makes no allowance  for melodic possibility? Which may be the point: The rapper's world is not a  melodic place. Is the rise of MTV a tacit confession that the bulk of our pop  music is aesthetically insupportable without a series of mannered and  pretentious visual images to lend it appeal? How much of that stuff can we sing  in the shower?  </P> <P> True, the '80s didn't get off to a great start. The national mood was sour from  the murky spillover of the '70s, which saw the fall of Saigon and the  resignation of a disgraced President. OPEC's control of the world's oil  pipelines, American embassy officials still held hostage in Tehran, and a  threatened 18% inflation rate gave credence to the portents of minimalism:  American power was on the wane.  </P> <P> Summing up, Lance Morrow wrote in Time magazine, "Mostly the air in the '70s  was thick with the sense of aftermath, of public passions spent and consciences  bewildered. The American gaze turned inward. It distracted itself with  diversions, trivial or squalid; primal screaming, disaster movies, jogging,  disco, Perrier water. The U.S. had lost a President and a war. . . . Many of  the themes were woven around diminution. Paul Volker, head of the Federal  Reserve Board, said last fall that in his view the American standard of living  would have to decline -- a serious crack in traditional capitalist optimism. .  . . The '70s were given over to building private, not public, morale. Est,  Arica, Esalen, transactional analysis, set about fumigating the American  psyche." The odd thing is that, materially speaking, the country had never had  it so good.  </P> <P> The '70s spillage into the '80s were characterized by what seemed a spate of  death and dying plays such as "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" and, later, " 'night,  Mother," which were gloomy not because of their subject but because they seemed  false, spiritually hollow. They were really plays about capitulation. Our  bookshelves bulged with paranoid fantasies of urban guerrilla terrorism, such  as Robert Ludlum's "The Bourne Identity" and Bill Michaels and Lewis Orde's  "The Night They Stole Manhattan." Movie attendance slumped. Some blamed  inflation, but more to the point, it seemed, nobody wanted to go out anymore.  It was the start of the "cocooning" phenomenon that later led to the technology  of the home entertainment center.  </P> <P> But slowly, as the decade settled in, the national mood began to lift. After an  economic nose-dive in '82, the Reagan revolution began to take hold, led by a  President who seemed buoyant, ageless and invincible, who could crack jokes on  the gurney after he'd been shot in the street.  </P> <P> This was really our kind of guy, a warm, mediagenic, patriotic, congenial,  can-do figure, flush with optimism and faith in homespun America. He was  20th-Century America's home movie. The Tampico of his infancy lies in close  spiritual proximity to the Hannibal, Mo., of Mark Twain -- and he kept  retooling it to fit the popular images of the American Century. He may have  been, as Tom Wolfe reminds us, "the most issue-oriented President since  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a real conservative who forced other politicians to  take a stand on issues." But what we liked most of all was that he never turned  us down for a hit of what George Will called "his narcotic cheerfulness."  </P> <P> In 1984, George Orwell's spectral vision of civilization as penal society  failed to materialize. On the contrary, the nation seemed to burst out of the  winter of its discontent to splurge on the opulence and splendor of the summer  Olympics, where the world came to Los Angeles and the city put on its best  party manners to insure that the traffic kept flowing and that there would be  no riff-raff, ideological or plain troublesome, to spoil the fun.  </P> <P> An international arts festival gave us the momentary feel of global centrality  (even if it did expose the shabbiness of a lot of our local product, such as  Equity Waiver theater), so that when the improbable Rocketman flew into the  Coliseum to begin the ceremonies, and David Wolper's opening musical production  flash-flooded us with a magnificent seraphic high, everything for once seemed  to fall into place. An immaculate powder-blue sky stretched over the Games and  everyone warmed to the sensual nuzzling of the Santa Ana breezes as the best  hope of the new world -- its young -- began their trials on the field below.  </P> <P> It hardly mattered that the Soviet bloc was a no-show; the gold medal this year  went to capitalism -- after a lot of prognostications of disaster, the  privatization of the Games made them the most profitable in history. What a  movie! For a couple of weeks we were Randy Newman tooling a big Buick  convertible through balmy sun-drenched afternoons, arm around that big nasty  redhead, hearing "We love it!" from nearly every conceivable ethnic and age  group around town -- even the winos smiled and waved hello.  </P> <P> On a deeper level, the country turned to the Games in a big way not only  because sport beyond its quick-fix excitement is suspenseful and unambiguous,  but because these athletes' one-time efforts couldn't be faked, or edited, or  canned, or even repeated.  </P> <P> But of course they were just games, a distraction. Earlier in the year, before  they got under way, we had already begun to pick up on the new acedia. After  the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, the President told the  country, "If there is to be blame, it properly rests here, in this office and  with this President. And I accept responsibility for the bad as well as the  good" -- and did nothing.  </P> <P> By now we knew we were seeing the divorce between word and meaning acted out at  the highest level; that was nothing really new. But now the deregulation of  content began turning up everywhere as the '60s and '70s cult of narcissism  hooked up with the '80s cult of money and a new generation of young Babbits  flocked to their BMW showrooms and nouvelle cuisine restaurants, and heard  their empty souls' lament exquisitely calibrated in "thirtysomething's" sodden  Angst. If pot was the drug of choice in the '60s and paranoia its emotional  byproduct, coke, crack and ice came along in the '80s to feed its penchant for  megalomania.  </P> <P> "Greed is good, greed is healthy" trumpeted Ivan Boesky, one of the princes of  the new wealth, some time before he was nabbed as a central figure in the  biggest insider-trading scam in history. Nearly everyone, it seemed, was on the  take. Ranking Republican officials looked on public office as an extension of  their business careers. Stock traders and corporate raiders grabbed companies  by the heels in leveraged buyouts and shook out all the loose change they could  before cutting them up, or forcing them to borrow against their future. Plunder  was certainly nothing new in American history, but none of our New Age robber  barons were building universities and museums.  </P> <P> The art of the '80s became, as Donald Trump put it, "The Art of the Deal."  David Mamet caught the hustler's tone perfectly in "Glengarry Glen Ross," in  which a real estate con artist dazzles his prey in a restaurant banquette with  a series of magnificent, hypnotically empty verbal glissandi, before he  relieves him of his check for a parcel of Florida swampland. Oliver Stone  caught it too in "Wall Street," where Charlie Sheen's moral opprobrium seemed  petulant and schoolmarmish in the face of Michael Douglas' buccaneer panache.  </P> <P> In art and entertainment, the atmosphere of deregulation further obscured any  standards of critical measure regarding talent and achievement. Celebrity  became the new commodity as earnest reportage of the hot and the new took up  more and more air and tabloid space in the afflatus of '80s entertainment  reportage. Nobody seemed to mind that there wasn't much to report -- for weeks,  it seemed, America breathlessly awaited the latest details on Oprah's diet.  Baby Jessica's confinement made good copy; the 25% of American children born  into poverty didn't.  </P> <P> If greed was good, scandal could lead to a payoff too as any number of  disgraced public officials, white-collar ex-cons and fading movie and rock  stars with a substance dependency confessed their wicked, wicked ways in  best-selling autobiographies. There was nothing hallowed about the nation's  capitol steps for Rita Jenrette, who thought they'd be a kicky place to make it  with her congressman husband. Donna Rice climbed like a coquette into Gary  Hart's lap and his political career collapsed. After Jessica Hahn exposed Jim  Bakker's clammy depredations, she exposed herself as well in a Playboy  centerfold and defended her exhibitionism by saying she was proud of the body  God had given her. Then she decided to improve on the job by having it  completely made over.  </P> <P> The business of America had become business once again (Wall Street reports  took up a heftier share of our news programming, and even carved a niche in Los  Angeles' only local commercial jazz station). And it liked what it saw in the  worlds of culture and entertainment. Tens of millions of dollars -- much more  money than any museum save the Getty could hope to afford -- went towards the  acquisition of Van Goghs and Picassos, which then disappeared from public view.  Corporate conglomerates made further incursions into Hollywood studios, TV  networks and newspapers, which meant that the bulk of movie makers, network  programmers and magazine and news editors felt more answerable to marketing  experts than to the public. Good ratings became more of an imperative than  ever. Demographics became the euphemism for the lowest common denominator.  </P> <P> While network anchors successfully courted stardom, John Hart -- one of our  best -- left NBC to anchor "World Monitor" on cable's Discovery channel. "It  was disheartening over the last several years," he said. "Almost all the  decisions about what to air were made on the basis of ratings instead of  editorial content. It was all artifice, the glib taking the place of the  articulate. Art connects. Artifice diverts. I worry about our system of news  and entertainment becoming an exploitation of fantasy. America made the crass  choice in the '80s. I think there's a hunger for human size, for trustworthy  content that's communicated in a way that's simple. The central values, like  freedom, are simple.  </P> <P> "I worry that we've lost our sense of context in our schools and pop culture.  We've come to believe that we can really act out our fantasies. We're a people  with a strong sense of justice. We crave romantic love, peace. We want the  homeless, poverty and AIDS to go away. But nothing is real on the tube. We have  all this information, but we don't feel we have a grasp on our lives. Most of  the trouble you can base on advertising, which is based on the residue of  rejection and betrayal, not being loved. It exploits those feelings.  Advertising has become a storm of accusation. How can you break through?"  </P> <P> It may be that with the information revolution exploding in sparks under the  channel-chasing fingers of the viewing public, the potential for overload has  become so great that we've come to prefer the diversions of incessant novelty  over the sometime discomfort of innovation, with its implicit requirement of  change. Or that the modern classic antagonism between the artist and society in  America has become too one-sided. What else could explain the pusillanimity and  poverty of ideas in so much of the culture of the '80s, the decade of the  retread.  </P> <P> In both ends of '80s, when Broadway wanted to commemorate the dance, it  couldn't think of anything to do except revive Jerome Robbins' choreography.  The theater blockbuster has been thoroughly redefined by Andrew Lloyd Webber's  gaudy musical dirigibles. Even Stephen Sondheim is plagiarizing himself. The  gadgetry of '50s spy thrillers has resurfaced in Tom Clancy's techno-pop  best-sellers. If we can't have Marilyn anymore, Madonna will do. Instead of  Jackie Gleason, we have Roseanne. Mary Richards has left the news office;  Murphy Brown is the new hire.  </P> <P> Scratch Arsenio Hall's veneer of hip to find celebrity sycophant Merv Griffin.  Maybe that's unfair to Merv -- he could sing. And what is it with all these  talk shows all over again, with Donahue, Geraldo, Oprah, Sally Jessy, Johnny,  Pat, Byron, Fritz and David?  </P> <P> If you can't get on the air, you can yak it up all day and all night on talk  radio. David Reisman called us "The Lonely Society" in the '50s. Nothing's  changed, except we're noisier now with eager confession and aggressive  self-absorption, which translates into public rudeness and incivility. We can't  seem to distinguish between honesty and tactlessness, blunt opinions and  considered ideas. Yet nobody seems to have the moral or aesthetic authority to  challenge sleaze and the push of attention-grabbing incompetents. In the '50s,  young intellectuals talked their dates out of their leotards with mournful  soliloquies on existential emptiness. Now the deconstructivist tells us: trust  me, it's all sign language. You give it the meaning. You and the night and the  music.  </P> <P> As the decade began to wear down, the culture became more and more overrun by  show-biz values. Shirley MacLaine charged us $300 a head to hear of her  extraterrestrial adventures. Jerry Falwell plummeted down a waterslide on TV in  his suit and tie to benefit Heritage USA, and Oral Roberts climbed into his  office tower in a well-publicized attempt to extort $8 million from God. No  corporate head honcho had really arrived until he'd made his own TV commercial.  </P> <P> When Oliver North made his appearance in the lineup of new dirty tricksters in  the Iran-Contra hearings, the nation sat up and rubbed its eyes. Here was an  authentic hero, not one of the Sheen family play-acting war. Look at all that  salad on this proud young Marine's chest! See the earnest patriotic gleam in  his eye and hear the catch of noble cause in his throat as he volunteered the  truth, good bad and ugly. Mister Smith had come to Washington at last! But then  we saw the equivocation, his lawyer's contempt for our elected representatives.  They pegged the colonel for a liar and self-promoter and we slumped back into  our funk.  </P> <P> We looked for plausible earnestness elsewhere. For a while, the comedy boom  gave us the sense of actual as opposed to prepackaged human exchange, a chance  to hear rare social criticism live. But the top comedians kicked themselves  upstairs into movies and television and we were left with a generally sorry  foul-mouthed group of show-biz acolytes who cannibalized each other's skimpy  material and bored us with attitude. Even the luster of sports began to dim.  Magic and the Lakers were still good for show time, and wouldn't we miss the  baleful Kareem after all. But Robert Irsay whisked the NFL's Colts to  Indianapolis under cover of darkness and broke the heart of working-class  Baltimore, and America's team gave its innovative coach a pink slip instead of  a gold watch. Hey, that's show biz.  </P> <P> By decade's end, half the nation was in a swoon over "Field of Dreams," which  the other half viewed as a dewy crock of ersatz nostalgia, sure proof that  cloud-cuckooland had become a prime entertainment option. "When Harry Met Sally  . . ." ostensibly posed the question "Can friendship between a man and a woman  exist without sex?," but on a deeper unconscious level touched on a uniquely  contemporary dilemma. For now every cell in the human body was shadowed with  the foreknowledge that sex was no longer the most primal human repudiation of  death. AIDS was spreading through the culture. Sex and death were one.  </P> <P> It's amazing how certain themes keep cropping up in American history. Well over  a century ago, Emerson warned of "the tensions that threaten to turn the dream  into a nightmare," citing among them the destruction of individuality and the  difficulty of really experiencing the world.  </P> <P> As the '80s wound down, it seems our experience of the world was less direct  than ever. "My friends," George Bush told us in the presidential campaign of  '88, "flag sales are doing well. America is doing well." More than ever our  candidates' entourages, the PR consultants, pollsters, speechwriters, handlers,  coaches and spin doctors, kept their clients from spontaneous view. The art of  politics became the choreography of the image. News pundits and reporters wound  up interviewing each other to assess the quality of sound bites and photo  opportunities, and to tell us what to conclude about the speech we'd just  heard. "We thought of ourselves as producers," Reagan staffer Michael Deaver  told PBS' Bill Moyers, who in turn worried about "spectacle overcoming  analysis."  </P> <P> "The country has cut off its vocal cords," says art critic and historian Robert  Hughes. "The only real drama left is the drama of the market. The rest of  America is mired in emptiness because its leaders can't issue a statement that  hasn't been pawed over by their handlers. The sense of public discourse is  dying under the weight of euphemism, which is the tool of the mass media. 'Have  a nice day.' If language doesn't live up to its responsibilities, it dies. I  love this country. It's a great place. But it's running out of ideas, a  conception of itself. It's unable to maintain its priorities and an  authoritative show of cultural elan."  </P> <P> David Puttnam came and went through Columbia's presidential executive suite in  record time. His failure as a studio head didn't invalidate his hard view of  what had become one of the great American dream machines -- the film industry  -- and he summed up the decade as well as anyone when he told PBS, "The cinema  was developing an ethos in young people in the '50s, but by the '70s it showed  an America that had become nihilistic, self-loathing, violent and antagonistic  within itself. The image it's projecting is not an honest one. The thing I  loathe more than anything has become fashionable: cynicism. The audience is  viewed as a kind of lumpenproletariat, totally ill-considered."  </P> <P> Mort Sahl has been both a political and media watcher for over 30 years, and  underscores Puttnam's view. "There's a 9 to 5 amorality which the industry  calls for, having prostrated itself on the altar of materialism," he said. "The  media aristocrats make fun of America. Look at all that cheering when Jim  Bakker got 45 years. They're still angry at their mothers and fathers. What's  the spirit of the movies? 'The Burbs'? 'The War of the Roses'? It's the rage of  cowards, not a rage at the devil."  </P> <P> Usually we don't feel the end of a decade until two or three years into the  following decade. But by the time Ronald Reagan made his last hurrah and picked  up his $2 million for a day's work in Tokyo, we had begun to feel our sense of  aftermath early.  </P> <P> Somehow the idea of big bucks had not only lost its allure, but money-grubbing  and ostentation were becoming objects of scorn (even if our moneyed industry  types reverted to traditional Hollywood vulgarity in their architectural  tear-down monstrosities). Look at Leona Helmsley.  </P> <P> The adjuration towards "a kinder gentler nation" implied that we'd been  otherwise. The money hadn't trickled down after all. Patriotism's evil  stepchildren, xenophobia and intolerance, showed up in Howard Beach and  Brooklyn, and led to the resurgence of the Klan and anti-Japanese sentiment. We  hadn't moved very fast to ward off the lethal incursion of AIDS. After all,  wasn't it the disease of gays and junkies? Who needed a literate nation? We can  get everything we need to know from TV.  </P> <P> For as long as the media are used to exploit us as consumers instead of  citizens, our kinder, gentler nation won't be a safer, more knowledgeable  place. Our cities are running out of doorways for the homeless to sleep in. The  deficit looms like an aneurysm. The earth is darkening with the toxemia of  accumulating poisons, many of them made in the U.S.A.  </P> <P> There are plenty of fine artists, writers, composers and musicians who had a  productive decade, and the burgeoning magazine industry, as well as cable TV,  are good signs that the diversity of our cultural appetite is being addressed.  And if the NEA/Mapplethorpe flap struck an ominous note about the government's  support of the arts, at least it's brought the relationship into focus and  mobilized real -- not stage-managed -- debate.  </P> <P> Even our sharpest critics rarely fail to observe our native sense of humor and  fair play, and our generous impulse to help out, whether in South Carolina  after a hurricane, San Francisco after an earthquake, Chernobyl after a nuclear  accident or Eritrea during a famine. But we've always been a troubled, restless  people, with a long history of violence. If it's the truth that sets us free,  it doesn't look as though a lot of the arts and entertainment of the '90s will  be doing the job of telling it, of reminding us that there's a difference  between freedom and escape.  </P> <P> WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DECADE MAKES  </P> <P> A statistical overview of the decade in television.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.97IN:2.44IN:2.44IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>

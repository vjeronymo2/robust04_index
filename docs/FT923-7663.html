			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bimec cancels final pay-out BIMEC, the acquisitive waste treatment, aerospace and engineering company, yesterday said deteriorating business conditions had forced it to cancel the final dividend. The news sent shares plunging from 19p to 6 1/4 p, their lowest in five years, and left Bimec capitalised at Pounds 7m. Mr Sam Smith, the chairman who arrived in 1989 and fuelled Bimec's rise from a penny stock to a peak of 80p in October, said the company continued to receive the support of its bankers. He said production in the first few months of the year was more than 20 per cent down on the previous year. 'Looking ahead, the economy is not too brilliant,' he said. It had seemed prudent to cancel the dividend. The company also said that efforts to pull out of aerospace had been thwarted. Advanced negotiations on the sale of the aero and industrial division had fallen through. Mr Smith said it could be up to six months before a sale was completed. Analysts greeted the company's statement with dismay. 'Something fairly extraordinary must have happened since the year-end to say they would not pay the dividend,' said Mr Mitchel Teager, small companies analyst at Albert E Sharp. Many analysts had difficulty forecasting the level of interim profits for the six months to September after yesterday's announcement. Originally, estimates had been for Pounds 4m pre-tax, compared with Pounds 3m. For the year to March 31 Bimec reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 6m. However, that was after a Pounds 662,000 surplus on disposals and the capitalisation of Pounds 1.2m in development costs. Gearing has risen since the 69 per cent reported at the year-end. Earlier this week, Bimec announced the purchase of a building maintenance company - Pearl Contracts - from Cannon Street Investments. Consideration comprised the issue of 3.25m Bimec shares, then at 19 1/2 p. Mr Teager pointed out that the cash position of the company appeared to have worsened significantly.</p>

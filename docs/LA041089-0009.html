			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: ENGLISH FAILS IN MATTERS OF SEXUAL POLITICS  </P> <P> My search for a female equivalent of the word womanizer, meaning a man who  pursues women promiscuously, has not prospered.  </P> <P> That is indeed strange, because the English language is so profligate that it  has a word for almost everything, and usually more than one.  </P> <P> The question arose from the widespread use in the media of womanizer for John  Tower in his bid for Secretary of Defense.  </P> <P> It is curious that the first definition of womanize in Webster's is "to make  effeminate," which obviously does not apply in the Tower case; thus, the press  seized on the second definition, "to be sexually promiscuous with women."  </P> <P> Dallas Williams finds it odd that as first defined womanize is a transitive  verb, requiring a direct object; but by the second definition it is  intransitive, and does not require an object.  </P> <P> "Now," he argues, "assume a surgeon whose speciality is the sex-change  operation (doing only the male-to-female variety), and assume that this is all  he does every day. But every night this same doctor goes helling around with  eight or 10 different bimbos."  </P> <P> By definition, Williams argues, the man is womanizing day and night. "But  here's the dilemma: How can his womanizing be transitive in broad daylight and  suddenly become intransitive after dark?"  </P> <P> An interesting question, indeed, but one that has more to do with the vagaries  and flexibility of the English language than with our object -- the discovery  of a female equivalent for womanizer.  </P> <P> Karen Winant may have a clue as to why there is none. She argues that  womanizers are not only promiscuous with women, but enjoy an "eroticized  domination" of women. "It has to do with 'conquering,' with prey, with taking  prestige from 'having' women."  </P> <P> Women, she says, do not generally seek eroticized domination of men. . . . "So  there is no female equivalent of 'womanizing' because women's sexuality has not  been cultivated along lines of conquering . . . women don't have the same power  in the culture as men."  </P> <P> Like Ms. Winant, Ruth Brown protests my suggestion that in Washington "men of  power would be easy marks for sexually attractive women of ambition." She says  that is "to slide the blame for the womanizer's predatory practice of feeding  his ego to his victims. . . . It is quite impossible to think of the womanizer  as a victim of a procession of sexually attractive women with ambitions."  </P> <P> There is no female equivalent of womanizer, then, because there is no female  equivalent of John Tower?  </P> <P> Could be. But certainly there are man-chasers, to use the closest word I can  think of, who pursue men of power for the fun of it, for financial gain or for  the proximity to power.  </P> <P> Grover Collins suggests a word he picked up as an oil engineer in Bakersfield.  The term cruiser was used by most of the oil guys in reference to the ladies  who frequented the bar at the old Bakersfield Inn and the many other watering  holes in Bakersfield.  </P> <P> In pursuing the word at the watering holes of Bakersfield we are straying far  from the corridors of power in Washington, which is the proper venue for this  inquiry. It is true that the women Collins describes were engaged in the sexual  pursuit of men, but they can hardly be thought of as opposites to the  womanizing power figures of the capital.  </P> <P> John Degatina recalls that in his mother's gossip circle the words flirt and  man-crazy were used, the second being more derisive. "I don't think any better  terms have appeared," he says.  </P> <P> Ernie Alvarez suggests philanderer, not only as a synonym for womanizer but  also for its opposite, noting that his dictionary defines the verb as "to have  many love affairs," and does not specify sex. (But Webster's New World (1988)  says "to make love insincerely, said of a man.")  </P> <P> Carolyn M. Trump of Hermosa Beach suggests that lothario, meaning a "gay  seducer of women," could be feminized as lotharia. Somehow philanderer,  lothario and casanova all suggest a lighthearted, romantic male, which does not  seem to fit my image of John Tower and his ilk.  </P> <P> My friend Sara Boynoff Coonradt says succinctly: "There is no feminine  counterpart of the word womanizer, just as there is no feminine counterpart of  the word cuckold."  </P> <P> I don't think I care to get into that.  </P></p>

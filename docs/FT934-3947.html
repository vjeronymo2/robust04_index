			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Open-ended investment companies a step closer The introduction of the open-ended investment company (OEIC) came a step closer yesterday as the Treasury published a consultation paper on how the investment vehicle could be structured. The paper, produced after consultation with the investment industry, says that the new vehicle is needed alongside the unit trust to let UK fund managers compete more effectively in the international market. OEICs are common in other European countries and in north America, where investors and their financial advisers are unfamiliar with unit trusts. The regulation regime for OEICs will be set by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, which regulates unit trusts. In October the board issued a discussion paper putting forward ways of deregulating the Pounds 84bn unit trust industry, although this did not resolve the deep divisions about the future method of pricing. OEIC investments would be bought and sold at a single price, in contrast to the arrangements for unit trusts, where potential investors see both an 'offer' price, at which they can buy units, and a lower 'bid' price at which they can sell. The paper says that the costs to fund managers of setting up and running OEICs should not be more than it is for unit trusts, and emphasises that, whatever the pricing of OEICs, there must be clear regulations on disclosure of charges. To meet the industry's demand for early action the government plans to allow OEICs under secondary legislation, which could be processed early in 1995. Subject to the progress of the consultation, the tax treatment of OEICs would be covered in the 1995 finance bill. Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, said the proposals would offer investors a good standard of protection while enabling UK fund managers to compete effectively in the European single market. Written responses to the Treasury paper are required by March 18.</p>

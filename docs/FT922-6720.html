			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BT plays a canny hand Yesterday's annual figures from BT provided a model of regulator and investor relations. Other unloved monopolies, notably British Gas, would do worse than take notes. The novel, if tiny, fall in BT's pre-tax profits and the more substantial slippage of its rate of return were elegant reminders that the regulatory regime has indeed begun to bite. At the same time, the 8 per cent dividend increase and assurance that the payout will not be directly linked to a declining earnings stream were designed to keep shareholders sweet. Given that Oftel is shortly to complete a review of BT's prices, the company has played a canny hand. Consumers will doubtless be hoping it has not outplayed the regulator entirely. Oftel's problem is how seriously it should take yesterday's figures as a guide to the future. While the present price formula is certainly hurting BT - fourth quarter earnings per share fell by 12 per cent - it is not clear that it should be eased just because inflation has fallen. BT still has plenty of scope for job cuts and will continue to generate huge amounts of cash. But Oftel must also consider its general policy of encouraging competition. Unless Sir Bryan Carsberg's successor intends a radical shake-up of the entire UK industry, the likes of Mercury will find it harder to wrest market share if BT's price cap is too harsh. Oftel might favour a gentler cap in return for giving competitors better terms of access to BT's network. BT shares rose by 2 per cent yesterday, mainly because the market was pleased by the prospect of a smaller than expected charge from the redundancy programme to this year's profits. Were the pricing review to be favourable, the shares could rise a lot further again.</p>

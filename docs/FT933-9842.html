			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / BMA on doctor-patient relationship THE relationship between doctors and patients should not be based on commercial factors, the British Medical Association yesterday told a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into private medical fees. Last month the commission reached a preliminary conclusion that the way consultants set fees in relation to guidelines produced by the BMA and leading medical insurers formed a complex monopoly. In its response yesterday the BMA argued that an 'orderly arrangement', with fees set within a generally accepted and published range, should be fostered. The existence of guidelines provided a way of stimulating discussion about fees and helped prevent excessive charges.</p>

Some contracts with foreign investors  signed with the previous administration are likely to be  canceled amid charges that the government is motivated by  political revenge.    Senior government officials are embarking on a sound policy  to eliminate the remnants of Cambodia's previously-centralized  economy, analysts say, after a new leadership trained in the  West has taken control of virtually all key financial and  economic portfolios in recent weeks. The new government,  announced earlier this month, turned over most of the financial  and economic policy portfolios to the Royalist FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] party.    Many of the new ministers and economic policy advisors  recently returned from exile in France, and have vowed to begin  an aggressive campaign to restructure Cambodia's tax,  investment, banking, and currency laws. World Bank, IMF, and  ADB officials are currently in Phnom Penh advising the new  government as it rewrites existing laws.    Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi, a French-trained  economist, told THE POST there would be a new banking act,  foreign exchange act, and investment law promulgated by January,  1994. He vowed "the first real budget in 20 years" would be  submitted by January and that by 1995 a "stringent" budget, in  line with IMF and World Bank austerity programs, would be in  effect.    "We will have institutional reform in order to make the  government structure match the market economy," Rangsi said on  Nov. 15. But he warned that some contracts signed by the  previous government would be abrogated or "revised".    "Most of the contracts are acceptable. Some may need  amendments to reflect the new situation," Rangsi said. He also  said a "handful" of contracts will have to be canceled. "But the  majority of investors do not have to fear."    The first victim is widely expected to be the Thai giant  Chinawat which signed a 99-year agreement to broadcast IBC  [International Boradcasting Corporation] television with the  Cambodian People's Party which lost the elections. The station  went on the air prior to elections and was fined by UNTAC  [United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia] for  violating election laws.    "They gave full support and propaganda to one political  faction before the election and were allowed to operate for 99  years without one Baht -- one dollar -- for Cambodia. We should  bring things to a normal standard," Rangsi said.    He accused some investors of "giving so much money under the  table to corrupt officials" in previous months with no benefit  to Cambodia.    The government signed an agreement with Singapore  International Airlines (SIA) last week to create a new national  carrier. The deal, which gives 40 percent to SIA, 30 percent to  the government and 30 percent to local private investors,  effectively abrogates several other contracts signed between the  previous government and private investors.    Rangsi attacked the level of official corruption and called  for centralized economic policy-making and "transparent  political power" to root out corruption.    "There should be incompatibility between the status of  minister and that of shareholder of a private company," he said.  "Either ministers defend private interests or the national  interest."    He accused government official of receiving "free shares  when  some private companies were created by very questionable  interests".    "They should resign from government," he said. "This is the  kind of transparency we want to implement."    The government has also begun an attempt to strengthen the  Riel.    "We want to rely on sound macro-economic policy to restore  confidence in our currency by strengthening its value both  domestically and internationally," said Chulong Somura, vice  president of the Central Bank.    Cambodia has seen four straight months of negative inflation  for the first time in several years. It reintroduced the 50  Riel note earlier this month which had been dropped as worthless  last year in the wake of triple digit inflation.    The aim, according to Chulong, is to "decrease the  dollarization, the use of foreign currency". She said the  government would "drop two zero's" from the new currency to be  issued next year. The Riel strengthened 20 percent against the  dollar last week in the wake of the formation of the new  government, but Rangsi said they will attempt to stabilize the  Riel between 2,400 and 2,600 to the dollar.    "There is a squeeze in liquidity because we have not printed  money in more than one year, but we will not increase the money  supply," he said.    Rangsi said the investment and economic restructuring  programs are linked to the political developments in the country.    "Security and Khmer Rouge issues are both key investment  issues... eventually the best weapon against the Khmer Rouge is  economic development and rural development.    "We don't want to make war again against the Khmer Rouge. If  we can reduce the imbalance between the rich and poor, the urban  and farmers, reduce corruption, reduce social injustice, this is  the basis of our new policy, we believe then the Khmer Rouge  will disappear," he said.    Rangsi said the new banking legislation will be aimed at  weeding out dubious banks that have opened in Cambodia since  private banks were first allowed to operate here in 1991.    He acknowledged the authorities were aware of Cambodia  emerging as a significant heroin trans-shipment route.    "We are aware of this. There are banks operating with zero  capital, no customers, and run by people with no qualifications,  people who have nothing to do with the banking industry and are  laundering money and covering up other illicit activities. We  have to react quickly," he said.    Cambodia currently only requires five million dollars in  capital to open a bank "but even that is only theoretical," said  the Finance Minister.</p>

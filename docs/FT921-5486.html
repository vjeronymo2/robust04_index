			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: IMF still has critical role to play in structural adjustment programmes Sir, Michael Prowse's article on the current and future role of the International Monetary Fund ('Capitalist tool in need of sharpening', February 26), cannot pass without challenge. Mr Prowse argues that the fund's future role in designing structural adjustment programmes could well be taken on by private sector consultancies such as Sachs &amp; Associates or the Emerging Markets Corporation. Programmes designed by such consulting companies - if given an imprimatur by an impartial body - could 'unlock a flood of private sector capital'. This would free the fund to concentrate on its true function of 'running the world monetary system' - and financing short term balance of trade deficits. This suggestion is singularly misconceived in relation to most of the world's poorest economies and particularly those in Africa and the smaller low-income countries of Asia and Latin America. Economies in this category (that is, the majority) which have adopted IMF-sponsored adjustment programmes are not experiencing a significant increase in private-sector lending or investment even following a direct injection of IMF funds - generally a means to leverage donors' funds and not market funds. In Africa as a whole, according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, total net private sector flows in 1990 (direct investment plus market lending) totalled Dollars 2.6bn out of total flows of Dollars 32bn; in the smaller countries of low income Asia it totalled Dollars 1.4bn out of total flows of Dollars 15bn. No consultancy company will succeed in persuading multinational companies - the main source of foreign direct investment  - to invest or lend equivalent sums to those of the IMF (say Dollars 100m in one commitment) in or to countries such as Tanzania, or even Zimbabwe. The facts are that the costs of adjustment are high, the outcome uncertain, and the international economic climate hostile. The Bretton Woods institutions have a continuing critical role to play - and the fact that they are fallible, poorly co-ordinated and should probably be merged does not suggest that international private capital can conceivably replace their function in low-income countries.

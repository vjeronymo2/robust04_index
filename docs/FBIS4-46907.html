Sobolev, chief of the department of </F> securities, investment funds, and holding companies of the  Republic of Tatarstan Goskomimushchestvo (State Property  Committee) and candidate of economic sciences, published by  PRIVATIZATSIYA, joint publication of the Republic of Tatarstan  State Property Committee and the newspaper RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN:  "The End of Voucher Privatization? What Now?: On the Development  of a Stock Market and Investment Policy in the RT"]    [Text] The end of voucher privatization in Russia and  accordingly in Tatarstan substantially changes the situation on  the stock market: a high volume, highly liquid security  disappears and a large quantity of not very liquid stock of  privatized enterprises appears. Using the voucher, both the  stock market and the nonstock market, although they were  underdeveloped, drew away a large amount of private capital,  thereby supporting the basic turnover of capital. There were 650  check investment funds of Russia, a large number of the  population, and stock structures engaged in exchanging  securities whose basis was the voucher.    Today an enormous task has appeared, the task of developing  the investment process. The performance of this task is made  harder by the disastrous drop in production and the inability of  the state to allocate or increase capital for investments. It is  obvious that in these conditions investment policy must also be  changed and its mechanism must be based on the primary and  mandatory participation of nonstate capital in financing  investment projects.    Changing over from the direct allocation of state  investments  on a centralized and outright basis to distribution of these  resources on the principles of payback and income-production in  the form of state guarantees for particular investors and  particular investment projects can be proposed as one of the  ways to accomplish the above.    According to the predictions of analysts, a situation of  free-falling crisis and investment stoppage in its classic  variant (United States, 1929) may occur in Russia by fall.    A solution to the situation which has taken shape, starting  up the investment process with minimal state participation and  creating a system of state guarantees, is possible on the basis  of stock market instruments using market methods for attracting  additional capital of private investors (including the  population). In creating and developing a liquid securities  market as a most important regulator of investment processes in  a market economy, we initiate an influx of private investments  guaranteed by the state in the form of securities.    A packet of documents on this mechanism needs to be  formulated. The essence of them can be reduced to the following:  the state interested in developing priority sectors invests in a  project. The emissions body issues its stock and transfers to  the government (in the person of the agent) a block of stock in  exchange for investments, but with the guarantee to subsequently  buy it back at a price, say, indexed in relation to the dollar's  rate at the moment the transaction is registered. In addition,  transferable bills in the amount of the state's annual interest  rate set for investment credit are transferred. A transferable  bill is written out for every year.    The state transfers this block of securities in trust to the  government's agent, in doing so delegating the state guarantees  to him. The trust agreement stipulates that the securities be  distributed among private investors, including the population.    The agent structure accepts the state securities on its  balance and issues its own bonds which ensure the attraction of  additional investments of private investors and the full return  of the capital to the state.    It is obvious that the government's agent can be either a  state or a nonstate structure with which a trust contract has  been concluded. These structures are needed to attract the  capital of the population, nonstate pension funds, socially  oriented funds, and so forth. They reduce the risk of long-term  investments for them given an unstable economic situation.  Nonstate agents issue their bonds either in the form of  mandatory payment of fixed dividends, or the issuance of  securities at a specific fixed rate after a particular time, or,  finally, in the form of the purchase and sale of securities on  investment projects with the state's share participation.    In this way, the risk is redistributed and the interests of  the participants in ensuring the success of the investment  project (AVVA, for example) are combined.    The government's agent, a general investment fund, is  interested in the quick return of state capital, since this  raises its income on securities expressed as long-term bonds,  which stimulates investment activity. In this way, the general  investment fund can operate on a fundamentally new level of  participation in the investment process: not only as a guarantor  but as an active investor with an interest in a higher exchange  value of the securities, that is to say, in the long-term  development of enterprises. The return of investments to the  state and accelerated turnover of investment capital are  ensured, substantial amounts of capital of private investors can  be attracted in a short period of time, and state capital is  released to turn over again.    The best prepared nonstate agent structure today is the  system of investment funds which has taken shape (there are 16  of them in our republic). They are the ones who are able in a  short time to change from an apparatus for accumulating and  redistributing checks and IPV's [personal privatization  deposits] into a mechanism for efficient redistribution of real  capital. We already have large and stable funds: the National  Fund, the Zolotoy kolos [Golden Grain] Fund, the Obrazovaniye  [Education] Fund, and the Doveriye [Trust] Fund, which are the  largest holders of stock of privatized enterprises.    They integrate their capital and could act as specialized  institutions to realize state investment policy in the republic.  Especially since the funds must be integrated to join the  all-Russian and world securities markets.    The end of voucher privatization does not rule out the  continued operation of check funds. According to the Statute on  Investment Funds, they may not be liquidated as check funds for  3 years, especially since in our republic they must continue to  work vigorously until the effective period of the IPV's is up.  But at the same time, new trends in the development of check  funds have been noted, taking into account the coming crisis of  the stock market, the threat of bankruptcy, and the need to  accept the new forms of work which have become established in  world practice.    Some funds specialize in creating a universal diversified  portfolio (stock, deposits, and short-term investments). Another  group is oriented to long-term investments and "know-how" and is  reviving sectorial directions of investments. Finally, a  considerable number of funds will merge or change their status.  The funds appear to be ready for transformation into investment  companies, investment banks, affiliates, and branches of  investment banks and are being transformed or are creating  investment funds with deferred payments related to pension and  insurance support, payment for the future education of children,  and savings for building housing.    It would be right to support this aspiration of theirs and  use them as the basis to create the necessary structure of  agents of the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan.    This must also be done in order to prevent a social  explosion: the crisis of organizations which have hundreds of  thousands of stockholders among the population as their  investors puts responsibility on the state for their stability  and the reorganization of funds; therefore their activity should  be put on a civilized track.    Continued state support of check funds is needed, fund  departments must be created in every joint stock company, and  support in developing the whole stock market in Tatarstan and  Russia must be provided.    The All-Russian Fifth Conference of Check Funds held  recently  in Izhevsk, where the problems of post-voucher privatization  were discussed, confirmed that our position in regard to state  support and the creation of better conditions for the activity  of check funds on the republic's territory was right.    The first annual meetings of stockholders of check funds  showed that funds like the following are most trusted among the  population and have the greatest potential to pay the largest  dividends: Zolotoy kolos (400 percent annually), the National  Fund (250 percent annually), Obrazovaniye (210 percent  annually), APK-Invest [Agroindustrial Complex-Invest] (200  percent annually), and Doveriye (200 percent annually).    We understand that the least protected categories of the  population (pensioners, disabled persons, budget sphere  employees, and employees of the military-industrial complex,  public organizations, and other enterprises which are not to be  privatized) are the stockholders of check funds. The issuance of  some of the stock of privatized enterprises to stockholders of  check funds at face value and their exemption from tax on  profits and dividends, even for just the first 2 years (or until  the effective period of the IPV's runs out), will be the minimum  support needed for this group of the population.    Funds must allow transactions practiced in the West and  remove the enormous number of restrictions. This was also  discussed at the all-Russian seminar. Among other things, the  use of debt obligations must be permitted. For example, the  bills of exchange ["veksel"] of Tveruniversalbank [Tver  Universal Bank] suggest that such a category of securities is  promising. The opportunity to buy back one's own stock must be  granted and there must be the possibility of changing into other  investment forms, merging must be promoted, and the most  important thing, the offices of check funds must be extensively  used in the councils of directors of joint stock companies. The  egoism of labor collectives must be overcome and private capital  and the development of a civilized stock market and a secondary  securities market must be set in motion.    The first results of the work of the National Investment  Fund, which has more than 5 billion rubles in assets and  integrates capital of other funds under conditions of  consolidation, shows that we have the potential for  entrepreneurship. Today the National and a group of other funds  have created an investment bank and a nonstate pension fund and  have formulated a number of interesting, socially oriented  investment projects and are forming an insurance company. All  this increases the turnover and stability of personal  investments.    The question of protecting the rights of all stockholders  and  insuring their investments is becoming most important. In our  republic we have not had cases such as those involving  Tekhnicheskiy progress [Technical Progress], Privat-Invest  [Private Invest], and Neft-Almaz-Invest [Oil and Diamonds  Invest], but that does not mean that we should lessen control in  this direction. It is also important to create conditions to  lessen the difficulty of transactions with securities in the  work of check funds. So, we will support check funds, but we are  for tougher control over the capital of the collective investor,  the stockholders of the funds.</p>

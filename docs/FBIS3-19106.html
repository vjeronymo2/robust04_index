			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- After the defeat in the Lower Saxon  election, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Chairman Klaus  Kinkel appealed to his party to mobilize all forces now for the  coming elections. The election result is sad and there is no  reason to extenuate it, Kinkel said on Monday [14 March] in  talks of FDP leadership bodies in Bonn. Nevertheless, he sees  no reason "to repent in sackcloth and ashes." One must now roll  up one's sleeves and look ahead and fight for better results.  Kinkel said that he was anything but pessimistic and was  certain that better results would follow.    According to Kinkel, the FDP's poor result also had  something  to do with the "dilemma" into which the FDP has been forced in  the coalition in Bonn. On the one hand, it wants to complete  the full term of the coalition in an orderly way, while on the  other, it also wants to prove its independence. Moreover, the  governing parties, especially those in Bonn, are currently  blamed for all things negative. Asked whether support for the  nursing-care insurance contributed to the FDP losses, Kinkel  said that it was he, in particular, who wanted the nursing-care  insurance. One must not put off such an important issue merely  out of consideration for election results. Only if one keeps to  one's course in difficult days and situations can one prove that  "one has got some backbone."    In Lower Saxony, the FDP lost 1.6 percentage points, only  achieving 4.4 percent, and is no longer represented in the  Landtag. FDP Honorary Chairman Lambsdorff rejected blaming  Chairman Kinkel for the defeat. Kinkel is a generally  respected, good foreign minister, and a greatly liked and  confident personality for the FDP. Kinkel's deputy, Irmgard  Schwaetzer, said that although she was sad, the result was not a  disaster. Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag  group, said that it was not obvious what the FDP's function  should have been in Lower Saxony.</p>

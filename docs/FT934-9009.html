			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Observer: So farewell, Shearson Is it goodbye Shearson? One of the household names in the US stockbroking industry which has been proudly paired with a Hammill, a Hayden, a Stone, a Loeb, a Rhoades, an American Express, a Lehman, a Hutton, a Lehman Brothers, and (finally) a Smith and a Barney, may soon disappear 91 years after it first surfaced on Wall Street. It seems likely that the Shearson will be dropped from Smith Barney Shearson when parent Primerica completes its Dollars 4bn acquisition of the Travelers Corporation. Although Smith Barney Shearson would only confirm that dropping the title was under consideration, the betting is that it is a done deal. The decision would finally kill off a name that first appeared in 1902 when a Canadian called Ed Shearson set up the firm of Shearson Hammill. Shearson, however, will not be alone in the dustbin of history - it can take its place with pride alongside such great names as Hammill, Loeb, Rhoades, Bache, Hutton, Harris, Upham, Halsey and Kuhn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- The office of the Russian  Federation Procurator General "was forced to take steps  immediately to release those amnestied" after the State Duma's  resolution on the amnesty was published and thus was entered  into force. Deputy Procurator General Vladimir Kravtsev said  this in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS observer. In  this context, he denied allegations that he had acted with undue  haste with respect to the inmates at the remand center at  Lefortovo prison and described such statements as "attempts of  the president's entourage to shift all the blame for the  implementation of the amnesty resolution, which had come into  force, onto the bodies of the procuracy." Incidentally,  Procurator General Aleksey Kazannik explained his decision to  resign by the fact that "a prosecutor in Russia does not have  the authority to suspend an act of amnesty. Neither does he  have the right of legislative initiative, so he could not  request the State Duma to reconsider its own resolution."    According to Vladimir Kravtsov, at 1100 on 26 February  "Procurator General Kazannik signed an official request to the  State Duma to clarify a number of questions which were unclear  to us as executors of this law. That evening we received an  official response signed by two chairmen of Duma committees,  Vladimir Isakov and Ilyukhin," to the effect that there was no  need whatsoever "to make special additional clarifications of  the procedure of the execution of the State Duma resolution on  the political and the economic amnesty."    Vladimir Kravtsev also described some details of the release  of the inmates from the remand center at Lefortovo prison. On  that day, he asserts, "the prosecutor's office, with no rush at  all, acquainted all eligible inmates with the full text of the  resolution and learned their opinion, as required by Article 5  Point 4 and by the note at the end of this article, whether they  agree that this act of amnesty be applied to them personally."    "They all agreed, though not unequivocally," Vladimir  Kravtsev said. Thus, Ruslan Khasbulatov wrote that "I have not  and am not pleading guilty" but, in view of the direction and  the essence of the State Duma resolution, "I agree that this act  of amnesty should be applied to me." Other expressed similar  views. Altogether, throughout the day on 26 February the  General Procurator's office sanctioned the release of 16 of  those accused in organizing the tragic October events in Moscow,  Kravtsev said. He also acknowledged that he had personally  signed all the instructions of the prosecutor's office on the  release.    "I would like say on my own behalf" that now "the  president's  team is simply looking for someone to blame," Vladimir Kravtsev  stressed. He went on to say that the resignation statement of  Aleksey Kazannik, made on Saturday, is "his personal decision.  He did not urge us (deputies-Eds) to join him and so on."  However, "should such methods of putting pressure on the  prosecutor's office, among others, continue, it is our duty and  responsibility to resign," Kravtsev said. He also stated, on  the instruction of his colleagues, that deputies of Procurator  General Aleksey Kazannik would not resign before the Federation  Council had made a decision over the dismissal of Aleskey  Kazannik. They had jointly made this decision after internal  consultations on 27 February. Vladimir Kravtsev did not  preclude the possibility of "the Federation Council not  accepting the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik" but added to  this: "I am almost convinced that it will be accepted and  immediately effective."</p>

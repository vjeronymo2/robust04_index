			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE GROVE EXTENDS SEASON FOR SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS  </P> <P> The Grove Shakespeare Festival, which is facing a revenue shortage, will extend  its current season by two months, through mid-February, to accommodate a change  of venue for its annual production of "A Child's Christmas in Wales" and the  cancellation of a planned outdoor Winter Festival.  </P> <P> Artistic Director Thomas F. Bradac said Thursday that the programming changes  at the county's second-largest professional theater company reflect "prudent  management" and were decided well before the revenue shortage developed.  </P> <P> He denied, moreover, that staff layoffs are under consideration and labeled as  "totally erroneous" a report to that effect in the Orange County Register on  Thursday. That report also claimed that no scheduling changes were being  contemplated.  </P> <P> The Grove had planned to stage "A Child's Christmas in Wales" at the outdoor,  550-seat Festival Amphitheatre in Garden Grove from Dec. 1 to 24 as the  highlight of an experimental Winter Festival. The adaptation of the Dylan  Thomas story has been staged indoors since 1986 at the adjacent 172-seat Gem  Theatre.  </P> <P> Bradac hoped to increase single-ticket sales by capitalizing on the  non-subscription show's popularity, in addition to accommodating theatergoers  who have had to be turned away from sold-out performances each Christmas at the  Gem.  </P> <P> "We decided to move the show back indoors because we do not want to take a  chance on the weather," Bradac said. "It has nothing to do with our cash  problems."  </P> <P> The scheduling change has caused the postponement of Shakespeare's "Twelfth  Night," which had been planned to run at the Gem while "A Child's Christmas in  Wales" was at the amphitheater. Instead of running Nov. 21 to Dec. 23 at the  Gem, as previously announced, "Twelfth Night" will run there from Jan. 19 to  Feb. 17. "A Child's Christmas in Wales" will be at the Gem from Dec. 1 to 24.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Bradac said the theater's cash-flow problems have resulted chiefly  from a shortfall of "about $40,000" in season subscriptions and not from a  decline in overall single-ticket sales, which have come "within $300" of  projections.  </P> <P> The revenue crisis has been compounded, however, by a loss over the past two  years of nearly $150,000 in contributed income from two major sources: Rancho  Santiago College, which withdrew an annual grant of $105,000 to invest that  money in its own theater program, and the Garden Grove City Council, which is  phasing out its annual appropriation.  </P> <P> "It's hard to take a hit like that," Bradac said. "We're still reacting to that  shortfall, even though our budget tried to take it into account."  </P> <P> The Grove's annual budget leaped to $850,000 for fiscal 1989-90 from $570,000  the previous year. The increase came from sweeping changes connected with the  theater's continuing professionalization and its maiden effort to consolidate  separately subscribed indoor-outdoor seasons into a shorter, more concentrated  season of subscription offerings in a single repertory setting.  </P></p>

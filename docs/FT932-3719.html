			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar down on inflation data THE DOLLAR lost 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after May's producer prices figures in the US showed that the rate of inflation was far smaller than had been anticipated, writes James Blitz. Last month's producer price index showed a month-on-month rise of 0.6 per cent, raising strong speculation that the Federal Reserve would tighten interest rates later this year. However, the May figure showed producer price inflation unchanged, with the ex-food and energy figure up 0.2 per cent. As if this were not enough to dash thoughts of an interest rate rise, the May retail sales figures also underlined that the US does not need policy tightening at the moment. Retail sales rose 0.1 per cent on the month, with the ex-autos figure unchanged. This compared with a much higher market expectation of a 1.0 per cent rise in the figure. Before the figures were released, the dollar was bid as high as DM1.6335. But it quickly dropped back to bottom out at DM1.6180, closing in London at DM1.6255. The market will wait for next week's consumer price inflation figure before giving its final verdict on US interest rate moves. Further confirmation could also come from the Michigan consumer confidence survey for June, due on Friday, which will show whether these inflation figures are a blip. The dollar lost a little less ground against the Japanese yen, following the onslaught it has received in recent days. Dealers awaited the outcome of yesterday's trade talks between the US and Japan, at which the US was expected to push for a reduction of Tokyo's trade surplus. Unless these talks produce a startling result, the yen is likely to retrace a little. But a focus for the market next week will be the Japanese trade balance figures for May, which again should show a powerful surplus. The yen closed at Y106.05 from a previous Y106.20. In Europe, sterling was again a strong performer, amid a growing belief that the UK will not reduce interest rates later this year. However, after peaking at DM2.4960, the pound fell by two pfennigs in the late afternoon amid rumours that a British newspaper will soon report a new scandal at the heart of Mr John Major's government. The pound closed at DM2.4750, down  3/4 of a pfennig on the day. Trading inside the European exchange rate mechanism was quiet yesterday. But most currencies have performed so well against the D-Mark in recent days, that there were strong rumours last night that France, Spain and Denmark could cut interest rates again next week.</p>

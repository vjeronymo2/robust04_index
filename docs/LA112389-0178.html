			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> GRANDIOSE: Everything about the Randy Kraft trial has been bigger than anything  before in Orange County -- most murders (16), most expensive ($10 million at  least, most believe), longest (13-month trial, five years in preparation). . .  . Now it's the first capital case in the county under the 12-year-old death  penalty law to take two days just to sentence him. . . . The lawyers will argue  motions Wednesday, and the judge will sentence him Thursday. Dana Parsons  </P></p>

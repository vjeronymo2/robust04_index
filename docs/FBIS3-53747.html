He added: "Lebanon  welcomes any meeting that pushes the peace process forward,  especially the meeting between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad.  However, one should wait before drawing quick conclusions,  especially as Israel has a fundamental say in this connection.  And we have not yet heard any Israeli reaction.    "I believe it is our duty to wait in view of the experience  learned from previous peace initiatives, as only those which  resulted from direct dialogue between Israel and the other  party, like al-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem and the Oslo meetings  between the PLO and Israel, have succeeded."    He went on: "In the next weeks or months we should find out  whether the Geneva agreement was held merely to save face and  keep Syria in the negotiations, or whether it actually  represents an advance toward peace. The answer to this question  will be in the results of the next meetings between Israel and  Syria."    Asked whether Lebanon's fate was discussed in the summit, he  said: "Any talks on Lebanon's fate that are not conducted by  the legitimate owners of the house, who are elected freely and  democratically by the people and who know the internal affairs  of the house better than anyone else, are not binding on the  Lebanese people, who will continue to struggle -- no matter how  long it takes and regardless of the pressures -- to restore  their free decisionmaking and secure their higher interests."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunming, June 13 (XINHUA) -- The Xishuangbanna  Nature Reserve, China's major protection and research center for  tropical and sub-tropical plants and animals, has stepped up  co-operation with overseas organizations to better protect the  precious animal and plant resources.    The nature reserve has been admitted to the international  network of biosphere reserves of the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) along with nine  other such reserves in China.    Since 1988, it has co-operated with the worldwide fund for  nature to protect wild elephants and study the breeding of  insects, and the development of forestry and farming outside the  reserve as well as the relationships between tourism and  wildlife protection.    Meanwhile, it has started a training class in the management  of wild animals in co-operation with experts from the  association of wild animal protection of the United States.    Established in 1958 in a remote part of southwest China's  Yunnan Province, and known as "the kingdom of plants", the  nature reserve is made up of five linked reserves with a total  area of 240,000 ha.    Specially designed to protect the local ecosystem of  primeval  forests, and rare animals and plants, the reserve boasts 4,000  kinds of tropical forest and rain forest. So far, a total of  341 wild plants are cultivated in the reserve, 52 of which are  under special protection from the central government.    In addition, 99 wild animals in the reserve are under top  protection from the Chinese Government.    Some 150,000 Chinese and foreign tourists, many of them  experts and scholars, visited the reserve last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar  has said that when he returns to Lima he will announce whether  he will run for president of the Republic. In an exclusive  interview with Radio Programas del Peru, Perez de Cuellar said  he will arrive in Peru at the end of July or beginning of August.    [Begin recording] [Perez de Cuellar] You probably remember  that as the UN secretary general I traveled to Lima during the  months of July and December. This year I will do the same. I  will probably arrive in Lima toward the end of July or beginning  of August and I will remain there for the time necessary.    [Unidentified reporter] Will you announce your candidacy  while you are in Lima?    [Perez de Cuellar] I believe it would be the correct thing  to  do should I decide to run for the presidency. [end recording]    Perez de Cuellar said that no one, not even the president of  the Republic, can tell him that he does not know Peru.    [Begin Perez de Cuellar recording] The current president has  been in office for only four years and I have been serving Peru  for more than 40 years. The ratio is 10 to 1. Thus, I should not  take lessons from anyone concerning the country's interests. I  have tried to give prestige to the country. It is not fair to  say that I do not know Peru. I repeat, from every country in the  world I have always followed very closely my country's problems  and I will not allow anyone, not even the president of the  Republic, to say I am unaware of Peruvian problems. [end  recording]</p>

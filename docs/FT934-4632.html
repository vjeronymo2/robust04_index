			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (18): When men get a chance to dress up Zurich's own festival, called Sechselauten, (six o'clock chimes), is played out on the streets of the old city every year on the third Monday of April. According to a 650-year-old tradition, the (male) pillars of the city's business establishment dress up in extravagant medieval garb and, having had slap-up lunches in the halls of their various guilds (zunfts), they parade down the streets on foot or on horseback. Lining the streets are mainly the men's wives, mistresses, secretaries and other female friends and acquaintences, many of whom will have been dragooned into being there. Their role is to throw flowers at their preening menfolk. The man who accumulates the most flowers by the end of the parade gains new prestige. He is easily identifiable because he will have acquired a woman assistant along the way to help carry his flowers. The procession ends in a city park where a symbolic figure of winter, known as Boogg and capable of being pronounced only by Swiss, is put to the torch.</p>

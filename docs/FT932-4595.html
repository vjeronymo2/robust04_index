			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (29): Weapons guided to mergers - Restructuring in the US and Europe creates new giants ON BOTH sides of the Atlantic, the guided weapons industry is in mutation. The announcement that British Aerospace and Matra of France have been negotiating a missile merger is expected to spur wider restructuring of the sector in Europe, based on one or two major groupings. In the US, further consolidation is also expected after the purchase of General Dynamics' missile interests - including such familiar products as the Stinger ground-to-air weapon and the Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missile - by General Motors' Hughes subsidiary last year. The takeover has created a second giant in the US and world league alongside Raytheon, producer of the Patriot missile which became a household word in the 1991 Gulf war. Also in the last year, Loral took over LTV's missile business after acquiring Ford Aerospace in 1990. The number of competitors is likely to be further reduced in a climate of tighter defence budgets. However, Mr Dan Tellep, chairman and chief executive of Lockheed, maker of the Trident nuclear missile, warns: 'Size, of itself, is not a guarantee of success.' He believes companies can still survive in niche markets. The BAe-Matra plan took shape after BAe abandoned efforts to forge a missile merger with Thomson-CSF, the French electronics company, in 1991. The joint venture plan, expected to be completed early next year, will create a company with annual sales of more than Pounds 1bn. This would be several times more than any other European company in the field, and if others were brought into the project could surpass the leading US manufacturers in missile sales. The door has been left open to Aerospatiale, now due for privatisation, and Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary. These two have already been talking about deepening their 20-year association in Euromissile, the joint venture responsible for the Milan anti-tank weapon and the Roland ground-to-air system. The question remains, however, of where Thomson-CSF would fit in the French scheme of things. The announcement of Matra's plans with BAe came shortly after Thomson-CSF linked forces with Short Brothers in very short range air defence weapons. This was a direct challenge to Matra. A further question concerns GEC-Marconi, traditional supplier of guidance systems for UK missiles. It was at one stage thought likely it might absorb BAe's Dynamics division. However the latter's sagging fortunes took a turn for the better last year, particularly when it won the UK contract for a short-range air-to-air missile - ASRAAM - against a rival project by GEC-Marconi and Matra. Matra and BAe hope to strengthen their presence on world markets with largely complementary product lines. The main area in which their products overlap is medium-range air-to-air missiles. But the two could combine efforts in this sector to field an alternative to Hughes' AMRAAM to equip the Eurofighter 2000. BAe is already working with Saab of Sweden on a new generation missile in this category, and has been looking at using a Thomson-CSF seeker. BAe could also back up Matra's bid to sell its Apache air-to-ground weapon to the UK. Competitors are likely to include Hughes, with a version of the Tomahawk, McDonnell Douglas, Aerospatiale and GEC-Marconi with a weapon that Abu Dhabi has so far paid to develop. BAe does not have its own product to enter into the competition. Two other major UK projects are potential victims of the government's current budget review. A new air defence programme to replace the obsolete Bloodhound missile may be cancelled or staggered, and a Pounds 3bn nuclear missile plan for the RAF could well be abandoned. In this climate, companies are counting to a greater extent than ever before on overseas markets.</p>

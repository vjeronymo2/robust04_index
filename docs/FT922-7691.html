			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: The growing struggle for pole position - Notice a switch by marketing-minded watch manufacturers from sports to arts sponsorship WHEN NIGEL Mansell wins a Grand Prix and Nick Faldo holes in one they do it for love of the sport, for prize money - and for the watch manufacturers. In recent years the watch companies have become very marketing minded, spending lavishly on advertising, on sponsorship, and on corporate hospitality. Many major sporting events, and some in the arts, are underpinned with watch money. To a great extent this is a natural consequence of the watch manufacturers' successful development of ranges of sports watches; it adds conviction if their brands can be seen on the wrists of successful sportsmen and women. Zeon, which expects to sell 2m watches in the UK this year, confirming its status as market leader in terms of units sold, attributes much of its growth to its decision to sponsor racing driver Nigel Mansell in 1988. The advertising campaign built around Mansell and its range of sports watches, secured Zeon the retail distribution and window displays which powered its growth. However, it is alive to the fact that Mansell might retire after this Grand Prix season, and it is investigating links with other sports personalities. Zeon also supports motor cross from its Pounds 500,000 promotional budget. At the other extreme from Zeon is Cartier. It sponsors uremittingly up-market events - like the Cartier International day at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor Great Park - where it would expect to meet existing or potential customers. Just to make sure the audience meets its needs, Cartier jets in guests from throughout the world who are more than happy to rub shoulders with the Royals who regularly turn up in force. Cartier has extended its sponsorship into its Racing Awards, which are unusual in that the accolades go to the best horses of the year rather than trainers or owners. The company is also unusual in backing the arts through the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art, an arts centre on the outskirts of Paris, which it is stocking with modern art. Generally, while arts sponsorship has grown rapidly, watch manufacturers have preferred to concentrate their money behind sport. This is changing. Raymond Weil backs the arts in Switzerland and Belgium and Patek Philippe celebrated its 150th anniversary with a gala concert in Geneva. Its UK operation entertained guests at Garrards, the Bond Street jewellers, with music by the London Symphony orchestra. Given the up-market profile of the arts, and its ability to cross frontiers, stronger links with the watch manufacturers seem certain. In the meantime, the obsession with sport continues apace, mainly because it is proving good for business. TAG-Heuer provides an obvious example. It has stormed ahead in a generally static market with a heavy promotional drive for its range of sports watches, much of it built around its sponsorship of sport. It has not been half-hearted. Just before the start of the current season it took over from Longines as the sponsor of Formula One motor racing. The price was high - the company admits that its annual budget has risen from Dollars 8m to Dollars 10m - but the global coverage, and the identification of prospective customers with the sport, make the connection ideal. It is unlikely to be taken for a ride: it knows something about motor sport from its previous sponsorship of the McLaren team. In the US, where Formula One is not so renowned, TAG-Heuer links with Indianapolis, while on the continent, especially France, it panders to the national obsessions with skiing and yachting. The expenditure seems to be paying off. The company has managed to move up market, brand awareness has grown, retailers, who love to be invited to a sponsored event, are stocking the sports watches, and sales are higher. Not every watch company is going for big glamorous events. Sector, with its slogan 'No Limits', concentrates on off-beat sponsorships in which its watch is identified with really challenging exercises, such as speed ski-diving, trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific rowing, Antarctic exploration and the like. It identifies with interesting personalities rather than stars, and expects a public relations spin-off from the media coverage of their exploits. This marketing concept was pioneered in Italy, where it has proved successful, so much so that there is now a magazine, No Limits, which retells the adventures of these hardy types with copious plugs for Sector. The aim is to sell its brand of sports watches to armchair travellers (prices range from Pounds 115 to Pounds 500) who like the knowledge that their are 'no limits' to the hardiness of their watch. Most other watch makers choose their sport and stick with it. Ebel backs the Professional Golfers Association. It is the official time keeper for its event, and leading players wear Ebel watches. Once again there is a natural link between golf and potential customers (to say nothing of the corporate hospitality of retailers at major tournaments.) Seeing Ian Woosnam or Sandy Lisle swinging away with an Ebel watch on their wrist is excellent publicity. For Corum the link is with the Admiral's Cup. It has been supporting the event since it first produced a nautical watch, with the hours marked by flags, in 1983, and is so happy with the connection that it has extended its sponsorship to the French national team, which repaid its confidence in winning the Cup in 1991. Just as Corum hopes it has the backing of the world's sailors, so Breitling is indelibly associated with aviation. It backs all the big flying events, from the Jersey Air Fair to the Biggin Hill show, and has the Breitling pilot on hand to perform stunts. But Breitling has added other sports to its range: white-water rafting in France and three-day eventing in England. And so it goes on. Audemars Piquet sponsors golfer Nick Faldo; Hublot is big in golf and Alfred Dunhill in polo and golf. As the watch manufacturers discover the commercial joys of branding, creating watches aimed at specific markets, watches for golf, for tennis, for sailing, for sports generally, but with spin-offs for the man in the street (or the woman buying a watch as a present), so the links with sports organisers and sports men and women grow ever closer. As well as the potential of free television coverage for big events, the sponsors also obtain attractive entertainment facilities, both for trade guests and existing and potential customers. Sponsorship by the watch trade is now a multi-million pound business. But the biggest coup of all - official timekeeper for the 1992 Olympics - has cost Seiko nothing. It won this accolade in direct competition with Swiss Timing, which handled events last time. Along with IBM, which provides the computer data, it is the only brand name to be seen on screen as the Barcelona games are transmitted throughout the world. It will cost Seiko a great deal of investment to ensure that its system works. It will be spending millions promoting the link. But it is ironic that the ultimate sports event should be beyond the sponsors' purse.</p>

USC will go against Penn State at  the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  </P> <P> Kickoff is at 12:30 p.m. The game will be televised live by ABC (KABC, Channel  7 in Los Angeles). UCLA will challenge Stanford at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.  The game will begin at 3:30 p.m. and will be televised live on Prime Ticket.  </P> <P> Here's a glossary of some of the moves the two squads will perform:  </P> <P> Basket Toss: When a cheerleader is tossed 10 to 20 feet into the air from the  interlocked hands of two to four people. While in the air, the cheerleader  executes a pike or a somersault and is caught by squad members.  </P> <P> Cradle catch: Occurs when the catcher or catchers, with palms up, catches the  top cheerleader of a formation by placing one arm under that person's back and  the other arm under the thighs.  </P> <P> Extension: A stunt in which a cheerleader's arms are extended above his head  and another cheerleader is standing on his hands.  </P> <P> Pop: A controlled pushing motion used to propel a cheerleader into the air.  </P> <P> Pyramid: Also known as a mount, the pyramid is any type of stunt in which  cheerleaders are stacked on each other's shoulders.  </P> <P> Spotter: A cheerleader who assists with any tumbling stunt or in the building  or dismounting of a pyramid.  </P> <P> Suspended split: When a top person is in split position suspended on the  shoulders of two cheerleaders.

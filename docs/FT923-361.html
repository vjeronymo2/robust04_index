			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: World trade deal hangs on oilseeds row HOPES of an agreement on the Uruguay Round world trade talks depend on the outcome of today's council meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to try to resolve the EC-US dispute over oilseeds. European Commission officials say that US interest in getting an overall Gatt settlement will be measured by its attitude to the bilateral row over the EC oilseeds regime, and whether or not Washington is prepared to open hostilities over it. If it does not, talks on the Uruguay Round are expected to resume at senior level. The US is holding in abeyance punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 585m) worth of EC food exports, after both sides agreed at the beginning of this month to seek a resolution by today's meeting in Geneva. This truce coincided with a softening of both sides' positions on the extent to which farm subsidies should be cut, the issue which has held up conclusion of the Uruguay Round for 20 months. Hopes were also raised in Brussels that President George Bush might be moving to bolster his fading chances of re-election through an October deal on Gatt. Negotiations between top officials have proceeded intermittently all month, and were not blown off course even by the US announcement that its beefed-up export enhancement programme would raise subsidised wheat exports from 17m to 30m tonnes. Wheat and soya - the main commodity in the oilseeds row - are at the heart of the Uruguay Round impasse. But recent indications that Washington is seeking a halving of EC production of oilseeds have tempered the optimism of those in Brussels who were relatively bullish about concluding the round. The EC maintains that US soya producers have lost market share in the EC to lower-cost producers from Argentina and Brazil. It proposes to compensate US producers, nonetheless, under Article 28 of the Gatt code, and argues that as long as it is observing Gatt disputes procedures, the US can not retaliate unilaterally. Most senior officials in Brussels have always believed the oilseeds dispute could only be settled within a deal on the Uruguay Round. Although the row has grown, one official said both sides were still preparing to meet to discuss a deal on the Uruguay Round. Frances Williams adds from Geneva: In Geneva, both sides seem to want to play for time, in the process invoking arcane procedures that take Gatt into uncharted legal territory. The US will today ask for an arbitration panel to decide within 30 days on the amount of trade lost by oilseeds producers because of the EC's subsidy regime. In the meantime, it says it is ready to go on with the talks. Washington has put losses at Dollars 2bn for all the countries affected. In negotiations the EC has offered compensation of no more than Dollars 400m. The EC, which opposes arbitration, will try to activate a rule allowing Gatt members as a whole to try to resolve the compensation dispute if the protagonists fail to agree. The oilseeds dispute is just one of a number of rows that are directly related to the continued stalemate in the Uruguay round of global trade talks. Also on today's Gatt council agenda are the recent US decision to increase wheat export subsidies, which has angered other grain-exporting countries, and the EC's proposals to restrict banana imports from Latin America. The Gatt council is today likely to approve establishment of working parties to draft membership terms for Ecuador and Taiwan. It is also expected to approve applications for observer status from Latvia, Lithuania and Kazakhstan. Editorial Comment, Page 24; EC banana plan, Page 36</p>

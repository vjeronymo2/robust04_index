			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 17 (AFP)--Yemen's oil sector, its  only way out of poverty, could become the latest victim of the  civil war as northern troops appear to set their sights on major  fields in their push south.    But oil analysts in the region believe a disruption of  Yemen's crude supplies would not have a major impact on the oil  market given its relatively small exports and lower world demand  in the second and third quarters.    "A loss of around 250,000 barrels per day will not jolt a  market already awash with crude," an expert said. "Even if the  market felt the loss, it could be more than offset by  neighbouring Gulf oil-producers."    In some of the latest fighting, northern troops loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have said they were pushing to  capture the southern province of Shabwah, where Yemen's main  oilfields are located.    Diplomats said a confrontation in the area, 300 kilometres  (185 miles) northeast of Aden, could damage oil facilities and  disrupt crude exports as most of them come from Shabwah.    "I don't think capturing the oilfields is easy. It could be  very costly for Yemen as the fields would not be spared in the  fighting," one diplomat said.    Western sources in the southern port city of Aden said  Monday  that the Canadian firm Canoxy, which has been operating in Yemen  for five years, had suspended operations in al-Masilah.    They said tankers had stopped loading from the southeastern  al-Mukalla terminal, where the al-Masilah crude arrives by  pipeline, because of higher insurance premiums.    However, Yemen's oil facilities in the south have not been  damaged by the fighting, the sources said.    According to independent industry estimates, the Shabwah and  al- Masilah fields produce around 140,000 barrels per day (bpd),  accounting for almost all crude output in the south.    Another 195,000 bpd come from Ma'rib fields in the north.    Yemen's oil exports have steadily grown over the past years  as the country at the tip of Arabian Peninsula pressed ahead  with exploration and development of its fields.    From an average 100,000 bpd in 1988, oil exports increased  to  130,000 bpd in 1992 and 170,000 bpd in 1993.    Before the civil war erupted on May 5, they were projected  to  exceed 250,000 bpd in 1994 as the French Total and other  international oil companies embarked on plans to develop their  fields.    "Such plans mean oil production could exceed 400,000 bpd in  1994 and 500,000 bpd in 1995," a Gulf-based oil executive said.  "But this will not be possible if the war spreads to the oil  areas. On the contrary."    Yemen's crude reserves are estimated at four billion barrels  but the figure is expected to rise as the more than 20 Arab and  foreign companies operating in both sectors have not yet covered  all areas.    Major discoveries have also boosted Yemen's gas reserves  from  198 billion cubic metres (6.6 trillion cubic feet) in 1990 to  362 billion cubic metres (12 trillion cubic feet) in 1993,  according to official Arab figures.    After the north and south merged in May 1990, their leaders  promised to use the growing oil wealth to raise living standards  and tackle economic problems caused by a debt of around 6.5  billion dollars, high inflation rates and unemployment, slow  growth and deficits in the budget and balance of payments.    "Oil is Yemen's only hope for the time being to ease its  economic difficulties," a Gulf-based Arab diplomat said.    "Yemen is not like Kuwait, which had massive investments  abroad" during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, he said. "Damage to  its oil sector would mean serious economic deterioration, and  recovery could become more remote."</p>

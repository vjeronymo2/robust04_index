			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: First price manipulation charges filed by CFTC The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has made its first-ever financial futures price manipulation filing, charging two former floor traders with depressing US Treasury bond prices by a full point for their own profit during 31 minutes of trading in October 1992. Both former traders are currently subject to criminal indictments by the US Attorney's office in Chicago and both have already been expelled from CBOT membership and fined Dollars 2.25m. The CFTC complaint is the first to address the subject of price manipulation during the incident, a potentially embarrassing issue which the CBOT was careful to sidestep in its actions against the traders. The CFTC found that the two ordered the sale of 13,000 bond futures and the purchase of 31,000 put options, for a face value of Dollars 4.4bn. At this point exchange security guards intervened. The two had less than Dollars 30,000 in trading capital between them and one had been an exchange member for just one day. One former trader netted a profit of Dollars 1.5m which was impounded by the CBOT. The other's positions resulted in Dollars 8.5m of losses which were absorbed by L. B. Stern, the Chicago firm that guaranteed his account.</p>

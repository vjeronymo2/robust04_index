			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / German pay accord in sight: Hopes of averting strike by engineering workers rise after last-ditch talks GERMANY'S threatened engi-neering industry strike appeared to have been averted early this morning after two days of intense negotiations between employers and trade union leaders. A deal was announced at 12.30am in the region of north Baden-Wurttemberg, the last region of the country not to declare the negotiations failed and to call a strike ballot. Traditionally this region has reached the accord later adopted by the rest of the west German engineering sector. The deal agreed is for 21 months. It involves a pay rise of 5.4 per cent for 12 months, backdated to April 1, and an increase of 5 per cent in special payments, amounting to an estimated 5.8 per cent for the year. For the remaining nine months of 1993 the pay rise will be 3 per cent, with a similar increase in Christmas bonus and other payments - amounting to 3.4 per cent. The contract will also cut the working week to 36 hours from the present 37 from April 1 next year. If the agreement it is accepted by the national wages commission of the IG Metall trade union, and by the leadership of Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, it will have prevented a potentially disastrous strike in Germany's most important industrial sector. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG Metall, who was present in Karlsruhe outside the direct negotiations, was quoted expressing his support. The agreement was reached after four separate rounds of secret talks between the two key negotiators in the region, where 700,000 of Germany's 4m engineering workers are employed. The region is also the headquarters of Daimler-Benz and Robert Bosch, two of Germany's most powerful engineering groups. The same region, and the same two negotiators - Mr Dieter Hundt for the employers and Mr Walter Riester for the trade union - have produced the final deal in the past two years of wage talks for the industry. This time they apparently performed the impossible against all the indications. Gesamtmetall had hitherto resolutely refused to improve its 3.3 per cent pay offer, in response to the union's demand of 9.5 per cent, and IG Metall was all set to call a selective strike ballot this morning. Mr Hundt, as chief negotiator of the employers, said the deal would give the engineering industry 'a clear situation . . . free of pay policy battles'. Union leaders had let it be known, although later denying it, that a deal of around 6 per cent - compared with the public sector's 5.4 per cent - might be acceptable. Opinion polls showed a broad public majority believed a deal of around 5.4 per cent would be justified. Throughout the day hopes for a settlement had see-sawed as the negotiators shuttled between bilateral talks and their parent organisations. Several times they expressed pessimism about the chances of reaching agreement. Finally, just before midnight, Mr Riester announced: 'There is an agreement that I can accept.' He left to present the deal to his negotiating team. If it is approved, the pay deal will relieve the increasingly tense industrial relations climate in Germany, paving the way for similar awards in other industries such as printing and construction, where strikes are also threatened. A pay rise of under 6 per cent will also reassure most economic observers, who had built such a level into most projections of German economic growth, currently forecast at between 1.5 and 2 per cent this year.

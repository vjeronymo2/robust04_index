			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Chae-mok] </F>   [Text] It was confirmed on 24 June that the ROK Government  has established a policy to take the initiative to support the  construction of light-water reactors for North Korea and is  examining various concrete measures.    It is anticipated that President Kim Yong-sam will actively  propose the ROK Government's policy to President Kim Il-song if  the summit talks are realized.    The government policy is one of the active initiatives for  assuring North Korea's nuclear transparency and providing a  breakthrough in economic cooperation between the North and the  South. Whether or not North Korea will accept the proposal will  be noteworthy.    A high-ranking government official said on 24 July: "North  Korea has explained to the United States about its plan to  convert the current graphite-moderated reactors to light-water  reactors and requested the United States to support this but the  United States is having difficulties in providing actual support  due to its domestic laws even though it agrees to the plan in  principle. In this context, our government is preparing  measures to take the initiative to participate in the  construction of light-water reactors in North Korea."    The official also said: "It is inevitable that North Korea's  light-water reactor construction will be a multinational project  involving the United States, Japan, and Russia. The ROK  Government will soon begin discussing detailed support measures  with the United States and Japan."    Another government official said: "The core question of the  North Korean light-water reactor project is who will provide the  capital. The ROK Government is examining a plan to assist North  Korea in obtaining construction funds from the Asian Development  Bank by guaranteeing the repayments."    Meanwhile, during a meeting with Selig Harrison, senior  fellow of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, North  Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu said: "The United  States could request Russia to provide light-water reactor  technology to North Korea, and South Korea and Japan could  provide the capital."    In the event that the ROK, the United States, and Japan  reach  an agreement to support North Korea's light-water reactor  construction project, the project could begin upon the signing  of a bilateral or multilateral treaty on nuclear power  assistance.    It is estimated that the construction of one light-water  reactor in North Korea would cost $1 billion to $1.5 billion for  a period of over 10 years.</p>

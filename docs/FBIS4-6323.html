			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is  expected to permit additional IAEA (International Atomic Energy  Agency) inspections of its nuclear facilities soon, an American  researcher on Korean affairs, said here Tuesday upon arriving  from Pyongyang.    William Taylor, vice president of the Center for Strategic  and International Studies, told YONHAP in an exclusive interview  that he expects North Korea to allow further IAEA checks in the  near future, though he cannot tell exactly when.    Taylor visited Pyongyang from April 12-19 at the North  Korean  Government's invitation for President Kim Il-song's 82nd  birthday and met with Kim for three and a half hours.    He said that during the meeting he got the impression that  an  inter-Korean summit would take place if the North and South  relaxed their bureaucratic rigidity, though Kim did not make any  direct mention of a summit.    Facing the United States, Japan and South Korea which he  said  have "strong hands," North Korea has only one card to use,  staking everything on its nuclear program; to spur the North  Koreans toward settlement of the dispute, the United States,  Japan and South Korea should first prepare to offer economic  assistance and diplomatic recognition, observed Taylor, who has  visited Pyongyang four times.    He revealed that he is carrying a message from Kim Yong-sun,  chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Unification Policy  Committee, which he will personally deliver to a ranking South  Korean Government official on or after Thursday, but he declined  to comment on the message's content.    Taylor thus suggested he will convey Pyongyang's official  position on resuming inter-Korean dialogue ahead of a summit and  the nuclear dispute to Seoul later this week.    Taylor said North Korea would announce "very soon" a set of  opening measures exceeding the existing joint-venture law in  scope.    Chinese, Japanese and German companies already sell products  to North Korea and its trade with third world countries is  brisk; should this situation continue, South Korea and the  United States would be the last in line for North Korea, he  observed.    Denying western reports that North Koreans lead a miserable  life, Taylor said the people looked healthy and happy despite  President Kim's admission of food, clothing and energy shortages.    He said he had not conveyed a message from President Bill  Clinton to Kim during his stay in Pyongyang nor was he carrying  a message from Kim to either Clinton or South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam.    Taylor leaves for Seoul on Thursday and will stay there  until  next Tuesday.</p>

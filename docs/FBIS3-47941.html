The HANGYORE SHINMUN said Woolsey flew into Seoul in secrecy  on Tuesday to discuss the Korean situation amid international  efforts to persuade North Korea to "abandon its nuclear program."    Woolsey had a breakfast meeting with the president on  Wednesday and also met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and  Defense Minister Yi, apparently focusing on North Korea's  alleged nuclear weapons development program, according to the  daily.    The newspaper also said Woolsey conveyed to his South Korean  counterpart Kim Tok the U.S. position that any imposition of  sanctions on North Korea in regard to its nuclear program would  be difficult at present.    It quoted an "authoritative" source as saying that South  Korean Government officials, including President Kim, have  raised the possibility of imposing economic and diplomatic  sanctions as a way to force Pyongyang to improve the  transparency of its nuclear development program.    The daily quoted a government official as saying that  Woolsey  also asked about South Korea's attitude to the possible  normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations.</p>

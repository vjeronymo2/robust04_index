			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Miniature barcode takes your order A company in Japan has shrunk the ubiquitous barcode to one tenth of its normal size. Because the micro barcodes can be squeezed into catalogues or directories instead of order numbers, the codes, along with their hand-held scanner, could be used for ordering from catalogues or stock lists, or even for phoning numbers directly from a phone book. Developed by Neorex, of Nagoya, with its international development handled by Foxmark International, of Tokyo, the micro barcode scanner incorporates a specially developed lens which has to be placed in contact with the tiny barcode but can read it even if the lines are not entirely clear. It can also read the barcodes if they have been faxed. The lens could be incorporated in a telephone handset for less than Pounds 30, enabling companies or consumers to read and then dial a number quickly or transfer order information down the phone line to a central database.

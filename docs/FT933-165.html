			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Through train for Hong Kong OCTOBER looks like being a blustery month for the people of Hong Kong. Tomorrow Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, meets Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in New York for the latest stage of talks about the colony's political future. On October 6, Hong Kong's governor Chris Patten opens the new session of the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's lawmaking body. There are hints that Mr Patten may be considering a dash for limited democracy without Beijing's agreement ahead of the Chinese takeover in 1997. Recent events have done nothing to diminish anxiety in the colony that China and Britain will fail to agree. To Mr Patten's high-profile populism has been added Mr Hurd's attack on Beijing's claim to the Olympics. Beijing's response last week was to publish Deng Xiaoping's 1982 demarche warning that China might take early control of Hong Kong in the event of 'disturbances'. Perhaps this impasse was inevitable. Mr Patten feels that he is locked into a timetable and that Britain has made significant concessions without response from Beijing. He must give soon an indication of his plans for the extension of democracy in the colony. There must be a bill in LegCo before the year-end to prepare for municipal elections next year. LegCo is, however, divided between those who fear Mr Patten may dump democracy and those who chiefly want a quiet life with Beijing. Mr Patten thus finds ranged against him that part of the colony's Chinese population which regards reunification as desirable on almost any terms and a business community which believes more or less unanimously that China's economic and political progress guarantees a satisfactory future for Hong Kong. Many feel Britain should accept that there is no merit in forcing Beijing to swallow western-style aspirations which London itself thought fit to visit on the colony only as an afterthought. Political institutions Mr Patten has a case when he argues that Hong Kong's political institutions have nurtured excellent conditions for business and prosperity. Hong Kong, more than most other Asian centres, offers sound legal institutions, an honest bureaucracy and a free press. But the governor's best defence against his critics is that they are not necessarily best placed to judge the people's interests. Opinion polls continue to show majority support for Mr Patten's approach, although behind this sentiment may lie yet another bargaining position: Hong Kong people undoubtedly want as much democracy as they can get, but they also crave a peaceful transition to Chinese control. The governor will need to attend with the utmost sensitivity to any shift in the popular mood and to avoid overplaying his hand. Board democracy It is quite possible for example that in next year's municipal elections, even if conducted on a broader franchise, the pro-democracy United Democrats will do less well than in the last LegCo poll. They are unable to field enough candidates to win a majority, and may encounter a sense that many Hong Kong people are more concerned about services than about district board democracy. More fundamentally, as 1997 approaches the Hong Kong people may well feel disinclined to 'vote against China', knowing where their destiny lies. What they most want is a political 'through train' - a pattern of enfranchisement for LegCo with which Beijing can live after 1997 in the context of its 'one country, two systems' formula. It remains overwhelmingly in the interests of Britain, Hong Kong and China that this through train runs on schedule, underpinning Hong Kong as a financial and commercial centre whose strength has already proved of inestimable value to China's modernisation. Common sense suggests that a deal ought to be inescapable: China needs a vibrant and confident Hong Hong every bit as much now to assist in the difficult task of engineering a 'soft landing' for its economy; Britain and Hong Kong need a smooth transition which takes reasonable account of popular aspirations. Mr Patten still has time to persuade the Chinese that it would be in their interests to take over a Hong Kong with a constitution broadly acceptable to its own people, but persuade them he ultimately must.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCRIPPS HOSPITAL PROGRAM;  </P> <P> STUDENTS LEARN OF CAREER CHOICES  </P> <P> Although some are lured by stories of the gore in the pathology lab, the chance  to learn firsthand about doctors is the major reason dozens of students at  Chula Vista Junior High School sign up for a special program at neighboring  Scripps Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> Once a month, a group of students walks next door to "shadow" professionals --  pediatricians, pathologists, pharmacists, accountants -- as they work,  one-on-one. The 12- to 15-year-old students also are introduced to careers that  do not necessarily require a college education, such as food preparation.  </P> <P> "They don't think of it as a field trip, which students usually regard as a  license to screw up," said Rick Benedict, the school's outreach adviser. "The  kids are thinking of the hospital as part of the school."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Return Trips  </P> <P> Benedict said many students who have participated in the school-hospital  partnership, which began in December, are signing up to go again.  </P> <P> Eighth-grader Reagan Lefeber, 13, toured the radiology lab and learned X-ray  techniques on her second visit to Scripps last month.  </P> <P> "Everybody's talking about the trips," she said. "The people at school who are  selected to go are really excited. I was happy when I found out I could go  again.  </P> <P> "I think it's a really good thing the hospital is doing because a lot of people  I know want to be doctors, and it's interesting to them how the hospital works.  I'd like to be an anesthesiologist or a pediatrician." Because of the trips,  many pupils have been inspired to consider a medical career, teachers said.  </P> <P> By adopting Chula Vista Junior High, Scripps Memorial Hospital joined a host of  businesses participating in the county's Partnership in Education program,  which began in 1981.  </P> <P> Although the goal is to allow all the school's students to participate, the  Scripps program targets seventh- to ninth-graders who are considered to be  working below their potential.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firsthand Look  </P> <P> One seventh-grader, described by Benedict as "a good kid but not up to snuff,"  tagged along with a pathologist last month. The student was particularly  attentive when the pathologist opened a lab drawer containing a human brain and  began to describe its regions.  </P> <P> In a welcome twist, Benedict recalled, the student was fascinated with the  explanation. The beauty of what is happening, Benedict said, is that students  are learning without the elements that some dread most: classes and textbooks.  </P> <P> First impressions sometimes focus on the glances at brains and refrigerated  limbs, administrators acknowledge. But the long-lasting value, teachers and  counselors said, is sparking students' interest in one of the hospital's many  occupations -- medicine, business management, office work, food preparation or  nursing.  </P> <P> Although hospital officials at first were hesitant to allow more than a few  students to visit at one time, groups of 15 now travel to the hospital once a  month in lieu of their science courses.  </P> <P> "We figured, we've got this hospital next door with all these resources -- we  decided to get the kids involved in the community," said Benedict, who together  with a fellow counselor recommended the Scripps' partnership to the principal,  Ramon Leyba.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Trip for Many  </P> <P> For some students, the trips are an opportunity to visit a hospital for the  first time, at least since birth.  </P> <P> "We've had kids that have never been in a hospital before, so we hope the  visits will reduce the stigma hospitals usually have," Benedict said.  </P> <P> "One kid got stomach cramps. He'd never been to a hospital before -- he thought  it was only a place for dying people to go. It scared the hell out of him."  </P> <P> The partnership goes both ways. Students in two classes are raising money --  more than $200 so far -- to help equip a new nursery that opened recently at  the hospital. The hospital now can treat up to 10 critically ill infants that  would otherwise have to be taken to Children's Hospital or UC San Diego Medical  Center.  </P></p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Independent lifts circulation 18% The Independent newspaper said yesterday that its circulation had increased by up to 45,000 copies, or 18 per cent, in the first three days after it cut its cover price from 50p to 30p. The Independent imposed the temporary cut on Monday, in response to the Daily Telegraph's week-day price reduction from 48p to 30p in June - followed immediately by The Times' reduction from 30p to 20p. The move could cost The Independent the equivalent of Pounds 14m a year in revenue. Mr Ian Jack, editor of the Independent on Sunday and acting editor of the daily paper, said sales had increased from slightly above 240,000 copies a day in late July to well above 280,000 this week. Mr Jack said: 'We were ahead by between 16 per cent and 18 per cent on Monday and Tuesday, although we were down slightly on Wednesday because of the rail strike.' His claims were backed by WH Smith, the UK's largest newspaper distributor, which said sales of The Independent were up about 16 per cent or 17 per cent. Another distributor reported increases of between 16 per cent and 19 per cent from Monday to Wednesday. The distributors said that no single paper had been particularly badly affected by The Independent's circulation increase, with sales of all other national broadsheets down by between 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent. WH Smith said: 'The price cuts have probably caused some quality newspaper buyers to start buying more than one paper a day.' The Independent's increase puts it only slightly above the circulation of 277,000 it was achieving in June before its rivals cut their prices, and is below its 346,000 daily sales in the six months to June 1993. The Times would not give figures for this week but Mr Alasdair MacLeod, marketing manager, said there was 'absolutely no evidence that The Independent has taken readers from The Times'. Mr Jeremy Deedes, editorial director of the Daily Telegraph, said he did not have circulation figures for this week. He said any rise at The Independent was more likely to affect The Guardian and The Times than the Daily Telegraph. Mr Deedes added that The Times and The Independent could not trade profitably at their new prices, although the Daily Telegraph could make a profit at 30p. 'But we have no wish to continue at this level,' he added. 'It was Mr Murdoch who began the price-cutting.'</p>

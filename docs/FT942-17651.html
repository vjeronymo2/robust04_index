			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Central bank chief resigns in Malaysia Mr Jaffar Hussein, governor of Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, resigned yesterday after taking responsibility for losses amounting to billions of dollars due to trading in foreign exchange markets. Presenting its 1993 annual report on Thursday, Bank Negara disclosed that it lost more than MDollars 5.7bn (Pounds 1.43bn) through foreign currency transactions last year. That followed a loss of nearly MDollars 10bn in 1992. Mr Lim Kit Siang, a Malaysian opposition leader, said that Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, should also resign and that a royal commission should be appointed to investigate the latest losses by the central bank. 'This is the greatest financial scandal in Malaysian history,' said Mr Lim. Bank Negara has long been known as an aggressive player in foreign exchange markets. Mr Jaafar said he took full responsibility for the loss. 'In the absence of perfect hindsight, mistakes will be made - indeed they were made,' he said. Mr Jaafar said there had been inadequate monitoring of the bank's foreign exchange activities. 'The system is put right now  .. an unfortunate chapter in the bank's history is now closed,' he added. Bank Negara says that the 1993 losses were caused mainly through unwinding forward positions taken up the year before. The bank's losses in 1992 were mainly due to the bank's ill-fated foray into sterling, in the days before the withdrawal by Britain from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and the subsequent devaluation of the pound. Losses also came through trading in the German mark. Mr Jaafar said that all forward trading positions had now been unwound. He said that, in future, the bank would confine itself to spot trading in managing its international reserves. However, Bank Negara's 1993 accounts reveal further contingent liabilities of MDollars 1.41bn. Banking analysts also point out that, but for a steep depreciation in the ringgit (the Malaysian dollar) during the last days of 1993, foreign exchange losses in Bank Negara's accounts would have been up to MDollars 3bn greater. Analysts say Bank Negara forced the ringgit to fall by more than 5 per cent against a basket of currencies at the end of 1993 by selling large amounts of the Malaysian currency and buying in US dollars. The move improved the 1993 accounts by raising the value of foreign currency in Malaysian dollar terms. However, it also tempted speculators, who felt that the ringgit was undervalued, to charge into extensive buying of the currency. Over the last three months, Bank Negara has introduced a series of measures to try to force the speculators out of the market. Bank Negara also announced a net operating loss for 1993 of MDollars 712m, the first in the bank's history. The bank said the loss was mainly due to the 'phenomenal cost' of mopping up excess liquidity in the market caused by the very large inflows of foreign funds attracted by Malaysia's strong economic fundamentals and its rapidly growing stock market. The bank said inflationary pressures had been succesfully contained. News of the foreign exchange losses and the resignation of the bank's governor have overshadowed the bank's upbeat message about the Malaysian economy. For the sixth successive year, the economy grew in 1993 by more than 8 per cent. The bank said 1994 'promises to be yet another good year.' It added that Malaysia's real gross domestic product was likely to grow by 8 to 8.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fine Art up 11% at Pounds 5.5m While pre-tax profits at Fine Art Developments, the mail-order and greetings cards group, increased 11 per cent from Pounds 4.95m to Pounds 5.51m in the six months to September 30, turnover declined almost 4 per cent from Pounds 120m to Pounds 115.4m. The shares fell 18p to 556p. The profits rise was helped by reduced interest charges of Pounds 2.99m (Pounds 4.84m) - thanks to lower rates, said Mr Keith Chapman, chairman - and a Pounds 565,000 three-month contribution to operating profits from James Galt, the toymaker acquired in July for Pounds 13.5m cash. Also, last time there was a Pounds 2.17m profit from the sale of Fine Art's stake in Next. Group operating profits on continuing operations was up 4.3 per cent to Pounds 7.94m (Pounds 7.61m). The mail-order division, and Express Gifts in particular where sales were 9 per cent lower, had been constrained by the problems of consumer spending, said Mr Chapman - 'there's an awful lot of concern out there'. Excluding Galt, the division's sales fell 4 per cent to Pounds 54m. Mr Chapman said that by next year Express' mail-order system would be 'one of the most sophisticated and efficient' and would be able to dispatch personalised items along with other goods. Fine Art had spent Pounds 1.5m more this time on 'an aggressive marketing campaign' backing Express - some Pounds 15m was spent last year - though with less benefit than expected. The marketing strategy will be radically changed next time. It was 'a tough time for charities', said Mr Chapman. In this sector, sales fell 9 per cent as a result of the planned contraction in trading by Fine Art's largest customer. Excluding this one account sales were up 4 per cent. The particular charity has 'reversed its decision and next year will seek to rebuild its volume', said Mr Chapman. Sales of the cards and paper products division were Pounds 55m, also down 4 per cent. Hambledon Studios and Gallery Studios, the wholesale supply companies, continued to perform well. The branded business of Britannia Products had been the star performer, though its private-label side encountered 'problems of our own making', said Mr Chapman. By delaying order information, 'we shot ourselves in the foot and the warehouse systems didn't help either', he added. The interim dividend is lifted to 3.3p (3p), payable from earnings per share of 4.87p (4.54p).</p>

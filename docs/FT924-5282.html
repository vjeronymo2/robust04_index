			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Green concerns Farmers and food retailers have every reason to play down devaluations in the green pound. After all, any downward adjustment in the EC's funny money  -and there was another small one yesterday taking the cumulative total to 12 per cent since September - boosts rural incomes and puts up prices in the shops. No doubt a Chancellor striving to stay within his new inflation ceiling will want to keep mum. Northern Foods, in the form of its chairman Mr Chris Haskins, is effectively crying foul. Mr Haskins, of course, is playing to the gallery too: in his case the supermarket customers who he fears will not enable him to pass on the extra costs. But his assertion that green currency changes may add up to 8 per cent to some food prices next year is a timely warning of the pressures which the food industry will be labouring under. With retailer competition and trading down by consumers intensifying, it is just as well that Northern is highly geared to lower interest rates and will soon start reaping the benefits of its massive restructuring. Solid earnings growth is assured for the next couple of years, but there is a question mark over where the momentum comes from thereafter. The market, though, has already taken some of the froth off Northern's rating, with the shares now 16 per cent below their relative high. The company is probably better placed than most to stand up to its customers.</p>

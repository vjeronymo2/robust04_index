			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Associate will turn against Collor THE MAN alleged to have fronted the corruption scheme which brought the current suspension from office of Brazil's President Fernando Collor is planning to turn against him today during Latin America's first impeachment trial. Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, known as PC, seems to be furious over Mr Collor's defence so far, which tries to pin all the blame on him. Today, he will end his long silence over his former boss, hoping to reduce any forthcoming criminal charges against himself. Mr Augusto Farias, his brother and a congressman, was yesterday reported as saying: 'The ex-president is treating my brother as an enemy and not as the dedicated and loyal friend he has always been. PC has no option but to unleash all his fire on Collor.' The hotly awaited hearing may well be crucial in forming a verdict by the Senate, which is trying Mr Collor on corruption charges and will impeach him if it finds him guilty. The trial started last week. Yesterday, the first prosecution witnesses were called to testify before a packed Senate. They include Mr Luis Motta Veiga, former head of Petrobras, the state oil company.</p>

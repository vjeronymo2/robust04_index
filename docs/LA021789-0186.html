			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST EUROPE'S FIRST;  </P> <P> HUNGARY OPENS SCHOOL OF WESTERN-STYLE BANKING  </P> <P> Hungary today opened Eastern Europe's first school of Western-style banking,  the latest sign of its determination to push toward a freer economy.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth told the opening ceremony of the school, a joint  venture with a French organization, that what he called "distorted ideology"  had taken Hungary away from the main lines of development in Europe.  </P> <P> "We would now like to come back to the main road," he said.  </P> <P> Hungary's banking system must be re-evaluated and entrepreneurship should no  longer be viewed with suspicion, Nemeth said, adding that he hoped the center  would become a focus of banker training in Eastern Europe, and later Central  Europe.  </P> <P> International Training Center for Bankers Ltd. is a joint venture of 28  Hungarian financial groups and the Paris-based Center International de  Formation de la Profession Bancaire.  </P> <P> Representing the French partner, Jean Montgaillard said the Hungarian and  French banking systems were part of the same family but had been "separated"  for some time.  </P> <P> "Now I have the feeling we are meeting again," he said.  </P> <P> The center is another step toward Hungary's desire to re-adopt a market economy  with tools and instruments usually regarded as capitalist.  </P> <P> Hungarian, Italian and U.S. businessmen founded a business school in November  to train Hungarians as Western-style managers. A stock exchange, suppressed  after the Communist takeover 40 years ago, reopened in January.  </P></p>

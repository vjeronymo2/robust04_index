			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Gas production rise helps Seafield leap to Pounds 1.08m A sharp jump in gas production helped Seafield Resources, the USM-quoted exploration company, to announce a fivefold increase in net profits from Pounds 216,000 to Pounds 1.08m for the six months to June 30. Turnover rose 40 per cent from Pounds 3.01m to Pounds 4.2m. The company warned that annual profits would not show such a substantial rise, owing to the nature of its gas contracts. The profits had been helped by a 60 per cent increase in production from its main producing asset, the Victor field. However, this was sold at an average annual rate and so profits in the UK were expected to be similar to those achieved last year. Profits were also helped by higher gas prices and lower losses in the US after disposals. Earnings per share rose from 0.4p to 2.1p. As in previous years, there was no interim dividend. Mr Roger Witts, finance director, said the group was encouraged by its exploration success so far this year. Seafield made its second discovery on the 21/16 North Sea block and won an interest in neighbouring acreage that was 'potentially very significant for the company'. Seafield plans to participate in the drilling of a further 16 wells in the UK and overseas before the end of 1995. The drilling activity is expected to erode the group's net cash position, although it Mr Witts said it would 'remain cash positive' at the year-end. The Schooner field, in which Seafield has a 0.69 per cent fixed equity interest, is on track to produce its first gas in 1996.</p>

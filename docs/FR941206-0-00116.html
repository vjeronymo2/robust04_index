			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. ``Going Forward'' price cap structure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operators electing to use the new rules may adjust their rates between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1997, by up to 20 cents, exclusive of license fees, for each new channel added to CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, subject to the Operator's Cap and the reserve for license fees, described below. Operators are not required to raise rates, but rather are permitted to do so. Operators may add channels under the new rules at any time from May 15, 1994, to December 31, 1997. They may not, however, raise their prices as a result of channel additions by more than $1.20 per subscriber per month between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, and by more than $1.40 between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997 (``Operator's Cap''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators may use may portion of the Operator's Cap to pay for license fees between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for channels added between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1996. Moreover, operators may recover an additional amount of not more than 30 cents per subscriber per month for license fees (the ``License Fee Reserve'') between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, for channels added between May 15, 1994, and December 31, 1996. After December 31, 1996, license fees may be passed through to subscribers pursuant to the existing rules, except that, as described below, operators will not be allowed the current 7.5% mark-up on programming costs for channels on or after May 15, 1994. The Operator's Cap and License Fee Reserve only apply to costs associated with new channels on CPSTs and do not affect the ability of operators to obtain rate adjustments for inflation or changes in external costs other than increases in programming costs of channel added under the new going forward rules. See 47 CFR 76.922(d)(2), (3). The new going-forward rules for channel additions should benefit consumers by increasing their viewing options on existing CPSTs, while avoiding unreasonable price increases for those tiers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Per channel adjustment factor.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated, the Commission establishes a ``per channel adjustment factor'' of up to 20 cents per channel for channels added to CPSTs. Operators may increase rates by up to 20 cents, exclusive of programming costs, for each channel added to a CPST on and after May 15, 1994, subject to the Operator's Cap of $1.20 on rate increases attributable to channel additions through December 31, 1996, and $1.40 through December 31, 1996, and $1.40 through December 31, 1997. An operator may choose a lower per channel adjustment, if that would further its business plan by, for example, allowing it to devote a portion of the Operator's Cap to license fees. An operator that added a channel on or after May 15, 1994, and raised pursuant to the existing rules, may revise its rates after December 31, 1994, using the new channel addition rules. As noted, an operator must use either the existing or the revised rules consistently for all channel additions on and after January 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per channel adjustment factor will compensate the operator for its costs of adding the channel plus a reasonable profit. Twenty cents falls within the historical range of 15&hyph;22 cents by which operators in a competitive environment would adjust rates for the addition of a new programming channel, exclusive of programming costs. The methodology the Commission used in deriving the 15&hyph;22 cent range is set forth in the Technical Appendix to the full text of this Report and Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

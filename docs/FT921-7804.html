			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Role of voluntary sector stressed THE government yesterday published a plan to encourage the voluntary sector to play an 'increasingly important part in society' in the 1990s, Alan Pike writes. In the plan, the government undertakes to establish an 'appropriate framework for partnership' between the public sector, businesses and voluntary organisations. It is keen to encourage the voluntary sector to take over services and other responsibilities traditionally provided by public authorities. Voluntary organisations, however, are concerned that the government's enthusiasm for the plan is not backed up by adequate financial support. The Home Office says it would be 'unhealthy and damaging to its independence' for the voluntary sector to depend too heavily on government money. It sees the government's role as encouraging the development of a climate favourable to support from other sources. Among initiatives which the government says it will take to achieve this climate will be a drive to encourage individuals to engage in voluntary activity and become active in the community. It also intends to promote improved management in the voluntary sector and identify ways of encouraging employees to give more to charity through workplace-based payroll schemes. The document says government departments will work in partnership with businesses and voluntary organisations. Ministers will consider ways of increasing the number of civil servants seconded to the voluntary sector. Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, said the sector had a vital role. 'We have a voluntary sector of a size, energy and range which is unique in Europe, and the pace of change and development makes it one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of activity within our national community.'</p>

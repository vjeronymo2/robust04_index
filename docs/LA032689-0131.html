			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE VERDICT AGAINST SHERIFF BRAD GATES  </P> <P> The Times' article (March 16) spoke of the jury verdict against Orange County  Sheriff Brad Gates in the Guillory case. The jury felt that Gates had abused  his powers. An accompanying article spoke of the views of some Orange County  Republican politicians regarding that verdict.  </P> <P> In that accompanying article, state Sen. Marian Bergeson stated that Gates was  " . . . not going to be hurt in the long run. . . . I think he's pretty well  entrenched." Mission Viejo City Councilman (Robert A.) Curtis doubts that Gates  need worry much about the verdict and County Supervisor (Thomas F.) Riley spoke  only of the money involved.  </P> <P> As a longtime registered Republican, I ask those politicians when they are  going to address themselves to their responsibilities as leading residents (not  Republicans) of Orange County to see that the people get a sheriff-coroner who  doesn't abuse his powers? These aren't slip-and-fall lawsuits out of some  supermarket! How many abuse-of-power lawsuits does it take? Without their (and  other civic leaders') support or neutrality, Gates wouldn't make it in any  election.  </P> <P> The mind-set of "my party right or wrong" has no place in civic leadership. The  county paid off $357,000 in the first suit (the Wright case) because it didn't  want the facts of that suit to be revealed in the newspapers and it feared a  far greater judgment. The Guillory suit with attorney fees will probably equal  that. What makes politicians so blase about a sheriff-coroner who abuses his  powers and then gets the taxpayers to bail him out? Twice! And one to go!  </P> <P> I strongly suggest that they inquire about the evidence of the case pending  against Gates and that they then stand up to be counted.  </P> <P> NICK NOVICK  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

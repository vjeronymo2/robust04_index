			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Outdoors: The lure of black pudding - Fishing The expert whispered: 'Keep it under your hat.' 'What?' I asked. 'Black pudding,' he hissed. I was silent. 'As a bait,' he added. 'It's absolutely deadly.' I am a complete sucker for this kind of sales talk. Reason tells me the notion of the novel, sure-fire fish attractor is an absurdity. But there is a credulous, naive side to me which longs to believe it. And when the secret is passed on with the right evangelistic conviction, I believe it. So there I was, a day or two later, sitting beside the river Kennet and moulding a sticky ball of pig's blood and guts to my hook. I chucked it in to a promising place and waited for the action to begin. Nothing happened, and my faith began to ebb as swiftly as it had been engaged. I reeled in and looked at the lump of black pudding. How ridiculous, I decided, to imagine that any self-respecting fish would eat such a thing? I concluded that what my prey wanted was something less exotic and more familiar. So, I opened a tin of luncheon meat, chopped it into cubes and, within 45 minutes, had captured four good chub - the best of them a stout, dignified alderman of a fish which pulled my spring balance down to 4 3/4 pounds. Now, give me black pudding any day for my own taste. Luncheon meat - that pink, greasy, poor cousin to Spam - is really pretty vile. But the fish, particularly chub and barbel, think highly of it. Indeed, so vast have been the quantities thrown into our rivers to titillate the fishes' appetites that some strange side effects have been observed. It is claimed that barbel have grown additional appendages as a result of the hormones used to fatten the porkers. In olden days, there was no such thing as luncheon meat; or, if there was, it certainly was not fed to fish. The way anglers caught barbel then was like this. Having identified a likely barbel-bearing stretch of river, you would buy several thousand lobworms from Nottingham (why Nottingham should have been the worm capital of England, I know not - but it was). You would chop up these worms - say, 500 or so at a time - roll them into balls of clay and deposit them in the chosen spot. Having done this on a daily basis for a fortnight or so, you would sally forth to fish, confident in the knowledge that if the barbel hadn't arrived yet, they never would. You would drop a Nottingham lob into the hole; there might be a savage tug, or there might not; and you might catch a barbel, or you might not. Even to me, this seems an awful lot of trouble. Fortunately, luncheon meat is a good deal easier to get than a wriggling, heaving package from Nottingham; and the barbel seem to find it just as tempting. Not that they are easy to catch; at least I do not find them so. But they are well worth the persistence required, for there is no coarse fish which fights harder, nor one which is more splendid to look at. Having pigged out on chub that November afternoon, my thoughts turned to barbel. So, I took my tin of meat down to the mill pool, where the water foams and roars in a manner pleasing to this battler of the depths. By now, full darkness had fallen. I stuck a lump of plasticine on my line (a brilliant tip from Channel 4's Screaming Reels, just in case I might be accused of originality) and a lump of meat on the hook. I cast to the edge of fast water and soon felt that thrilling tremble which is the first contact of the fish's mouth, followed by the solid pull. No other fish communicates such an immediate sensation of strength as the barbel. You can feel the head boring, the great muscled tail and fins driving it down. Back and forth that fish charged until, at last, its bull-like power drained and I saw its gleam on the surface. Seven pounds it weighed: not big as barbel go. As I slipped it back, and watched it fade into the inky water, I blessed it and the toothsomeness of pig flesh. As for the black pudding, I haven't given up. Like the rest of us, barbel just need educating.</p>

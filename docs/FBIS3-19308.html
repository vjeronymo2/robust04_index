According to the most recent white  paper entitled "On the security of the FRG and on the situation  and the future of the Bundeswehr," which will be presented by  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe on Tuesday [15 March], the German  armed forces will consist of 39,700 officers, 133,300  noncommissioned officers, 38,000 privates who sign up for a  certain period of time, and 155,000 conscripts doing basic  military service. A total of 4,000 reserve duty training places  will be available.    As DPA learned from reliable sources today, the  establishment  of the crisis reaction forces will be given top priority.  "Together with its partners, the Bundeswehr must be in a  position to transfer, deploy, control and support troop  contingents to a limited extent but within a short time under  extreme environmental conditions across long distances," the  white paper stresses. The climate and geographic conditions  outside Europe require suitable material equipment and personal  outfit for the soldiers. To control operations of the crisis  reaction forces of the Bundeswehr, far-reaching reconnaissance  resources and communication are required.    Air transport will play a major role in supporting the  operations of the crisis reaction forces. "Air transport is an  essential precondition for the extended tasks of all military  services that support the operations of the crisis reaction  forces, peace missions, and humanitarian operations," the  comprehensive report points out. Regarding the future transport  requirements of the crisis reaction forces, one must bear in  mind that the bulk of the equipment and part of the personnel  are usually transported by sea, but it must be possible to  transfer troops with several battalions and their support units  quickly and on a large-scale basis by air.    According to the white paper, Germany's full sovereignty,  resulting from the unification of both parts of Germany, and the  extended tasks of the Bundeswehr represent a new challenge for  the command and control organization of the armed forces. To  make participation in peace missions under UN auspices and in  humanitarian operations possible, the Federal Government must be  able in the future to control the Bundeswehr as a sovereign  army. The leadership structures in the Defense Ministry must be  streamlined. The number of staff sections, subdivisions, and  other sections will be "clearly reduced."    The white paper contains clear support for compulsory  military service because it ensure the operational readiness of  the Bundeswehr. Because of the tight financial situation, the  armed forces renounced important projects. For the period  between 1995-1997, the defense budget will involve 47.5 billion  German marks. The Bundeswehr will keep the three military  services; army, air force, and navy.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Tower Hamlets has problems, but potential too Sir, Your recent article relating to the report on urban trends and inner-city decline made very interesting reading ('Decay eats away at inner cities', July 14). It is the case that Tower Hamlets ranks third from the top (or is it bottom?) of the most deprived areas in Britain. However, to give the impression that Tower Hamlets is an inner-city wasteland with no hope for the future could not be further from the truth. My borough is an area of immense potential, a mix of old and new. City fringe developments in Bethnal Green and proposals involving the local community in the City Challenge area of Spitalfields offer real opportunities to tackle inner-city decay in an area most in need. Docklands developments have many critics, but nobody can deny that a great deal has happened in the area. Tower Hamlets Council has strongly voiced its views on the over-development and design of many of the schemes. The council takes the view that the mistakes of their past would be compounded now if Docklands failed. Many, like the civil servants, view Tower Hamlets and the East End as a backwater, devoid of community, law and modern technology. We believe these views stem from ignorance and misinformation. My fear is your readers, after reading your article, may also take this view. I am not trying to pretend Tower Hamlets does not have more than its fair share of problems. However, this is an area of enormous potential. It is better than it was, still greatly improving and will be the place to be in the future.

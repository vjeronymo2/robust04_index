			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE COLD, MAGIC IS HOT IN LAKER WIN OVER TRAIL BLAZERS  </P> <P> This being the flu season, which naturally coincides with the National  Basketball Assn. season, Magic Johnson took all the necessary measures to play  on a rainy night when he probably felt like calling in sick.  </P> <P> Feeling ill, Johnson missed the Lakers' morning workout, but hardly anything  else Friday. Johnson drank plenty of fluids, then sank plenty of shots. He fed  the cold, as they say, and generously fed the ball to teammates.  </P> <P> In the end, however, it was the Portland Trail Blazers who felt worse. All  Johnson did was score 17 of his 29 points in the first quarter, as the Lakers  recorded an easy 140-129 victory before a Forum crowd of 17,505.  </P> <P> Clutching a cup of orange juice and sniffling while sitting at his locker  afterward, Johnson certainly did not look well. But, on the court, he was as  strong as ever in helping the Lakers build a comfortable early lead that they  never relinquished.  </P> <P> "I've been kind of sick," said Johnson, who made 10 of 15 shots. "I was just  hoping I'd have the energy to play. You never know until you walk out on the  court.  </P> <P> "But once I'm out there, I don't even think about being sick. Once you hit the  floor, you do your job. I still don't feel well, but I'll be all right.  Hopefully, it won't go into the flu stage."  </P> <P> On this night, quality performances were contagious. In addition to Johnson's  29 points, 8 assists and 8 rebounds, James Worthy had 21 points, A.C. Green 20  points and 11 rebounds and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 15 points.  </P> <P> So dominant were the Lakers that Coach Pat Riley went to his bench early and  often, and the bench responded by not letting Portland seriously threaten.  </P> <P> It was the Lakers' third consecutive victory over the Trail Blazers at the  Forum this season, their second straight blowout win. This one enabled the  Lakers (31-14) to increase their Pacific Division lead to 3 games over the  Phoenix Suns and the Seattle SuperSonics. Both lost Friday night.  </P> <P> "It was a bounce-back game at home for us," said Riley, referring to Wednesday  night's 17-point loss at Phoenix. "Our first half was about as good as we  played all season, I have to say that. We kept driving the ball to the basket  and kept the pressure on.  </P> <P> "I didn't want any lingering effects from the Phoenix game. It was a matter of  coming in mentally tenacious."  </P> <P> The only thing Johnson brought back from the just-concluded trip, in which the  Lakers won 2 of 3 games, was the beginnings of a cold.  </P> <P> "I started feeling ill on the road," Johnson said. "But I wanted to play  tonight."  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers wish he had stayed home.  </P> <P> Johnson made all 5 shots in the first quarter, 1 coming from 3-point range. He  also made all 6 free-throw attempts, and ended the quarter by making a  behind-the-back pass to Mychal Thompson underneath for an easy basket.  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter, the Lakers pulled away and Portland was well on its way to  losing for the 23rd time in the last 24 games against the Lakers at the Forum.  </P> <P> The Lakers had a 22-point halftime lead, extended it to 25 early in the third  quarter and, despite liberal use of the reserves from that point, never saw the  lead dip below 12.  </P> <P> In totaling 140 points, their second-highest total this season, the Lakers  received 47 points from their bench.  </P> <P> Leading the reserve charge was guard David Rivers, who played 15 minutes in  Johnson's place and had 10 points and 5 assists.  </P> <P> Third-string center Mark McNamara made a rare third-quarter appearance and  finished with 7 points, and Thompson (9 points), Orlando Woolridge (9) and Tony  Campbell (8) also contributed. Going mostly with reserves to start the second  quarter, the Lakers increased the lead from 9 to 15 points.  </P> <P> It was 52-41 when Riley re-inserted 3 starters 5 1/2 minutes into the quarter.  </P> <P> Then, in the third quarter, a 22-point Laker lead dipped to 16 when Riley used  Thompson and McNamara in place of Green and Abdul-Jabbar.  </P> <P> "The hope is (Riley) gets enough confidence in us so that he can go with us in  key situations," McNamara said. "Then, we could keep things status quo for a  while. That helps all of us. We (the reserves) get some minutes, and (the  starters) get some rest."  </P> <P> Rivers, playing more lately because of the illness that has sidelined Byron  Scott, is starting to show signs of improvement after a rocky first half of the  season. Friday night, Rivers made 5 of 7 shots, and his 5 assists offset 3  turnovers.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to live with that up and down (performances) with David,"  Riley said. "There are three things he has to show us to be a good point guard  in this league. He has to penetrate and finish off plays, hit the open jumpers  and make his free throws.  </P> <P> "We know he can penetrate and make free throws, but he's got to prove he can  make the jumper."  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers, led by center Kevin Duckworth, who had 25 points, and Kiki  Vandeweghe, who had 20, made 53% of their shots. But still, the Lakers  dominated by holding a 45-35 rebounding advantage and forcing 11 first-half  turnovers.  </P> <P> "You can see it in their faces, in their eyes," Portland Coach Mike Schuler  said of the Lakers. "At home, the Lakers are tough to beat. They are always  focused on what they have to do. Our players had to be ready for that, ready  for their pressure. They weren't."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 15 points left him 1 shy of 38,000 for his career. . . .  Byron Scott, out with internal bleeding, will work out on his own today and  will be evaluated before Sunday's game. . . . The Lakers have outrebounded  opponents for the 10th time in the last 11 games. . . . Mychal Thompson made  just 3 of 8 shots, lowering his NBA-best field-goal percentage to 59.1%.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Tirana Court of Appeal reports  that an appeal was held in Tirana on 15 February against the  criminal convictions of defendants Qirjako Mihali, Pali Miska,  Besnik Bekteshi, Vangjel Cerrava, Prokop Murra, Llambi  Gegprifti, Muho Artunda, Hajredin Celiku, Foto Cami, and Lenka  Cuko .    As senior political and government leaders at the head of a  dictatorship, by deliberately abusing their positions the  defendants granted economic privileges to themselves and their  families, thus causing serious economic damage to the state and  the people's interests.    For these reasons, under Articles 106 and 31, Paragraphs B  and D of the Penal Code, the defendants were convicted as  follows:    Qirjako Mihali -- eight years of imprisonment; Pali Miska --  six; Besnik Bekteshi -- five; Vangjel Cerrava -- five; Prokop  Murra -- five; Llambi Gegprifti -- seven; Muho Artunda -- five;  Hajredin Celiku -- five; Foto Cami -- six; Lenka Cuko -- seven.  They were also stripped of their decorations and honorary  titles.</p>

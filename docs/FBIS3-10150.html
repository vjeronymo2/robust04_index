This means that we will be able to have access to credit  facilities, different from bilateral cooperation, for financing  investment projects.    Jaililie moreover explained that the $410 million deficit in  the balance of payments that had to be covered in 1993 -- which  entailed having recourse to the second Support Group -- was  overcome thanks to the aid granted by Japan, which was the only  country that fulfilled its promise of help in time.    Jaililie pointed out that Japan was "the only country that  staked everything for Peru, and that disbursed exactly the $110  million it had pledged to give us." He added that this  contrasts sharply with the United States' attitude, as its  Congress has raised a number of objections to disbursing its  $105 million share.    As is public knowledge, last year Peru called on countries  with which it has friendly relations to help it overcome the  deficit it would incur in its balance of payments. The United  States and Japan answered this appeal by committing themselves  to granting us $210 million [as published] of the $410 million  we needed. The United States would disburse $105 million, and  Japan $110 million. Some European countries would contribute  with a smaller share.    And yet a year has elapsed, and the United States has not  yet  disbursed the promised $105 million because the U.S. Senate has  charged Peru with violating human rights. Japan on its part has  punctually paid out its share.    Jaililie stated that negotiations with the United States are  in the hands of Finance and Economy Minister Jorge Camet. The  only thing that is known about the progress of these  negotiations is that the U.S. Government -- through AID -- will  soon disburse $35 million, but nothing has been said about the  rest of the money.    It should be pointed out that the United States is not the  only one that has failed to honor its commitments. Some  European countries and international organizations have been  delaying the disbursement of the funds agreed upon at the  meeting of the Donors' Board held in Paris in June 1993.    To date, the only thing that Peru has been granted is a  cancellation of its debt with Germany and Switzerland, amounting  to some $300 million.</p>

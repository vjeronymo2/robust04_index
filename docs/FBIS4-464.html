			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman of the Somali National Alliance [SNA]  has said today that lately there appeared troublemakers opposed  to the peace of the Somali people recently agreed upon in  Nairobi, Kenya by Somali organizations with the intention of  weakening and undermining the various settlements of Somalia.  He added that the Somali people are not ready today to go back  to the civil war and, hence, the SNA leadership is calling on  the Somali people to take the following steps:    1. The peace-loving Somali people are being called upon to  remain vigilant and counter these troublemakers wherever they  may be.    2. The SNA warns those undermining the peace to stop  meddling. Their actions will not be tolerated any longer.    3. The communities which have no peace among themselves  should solve their problems as soon as possible in their  settlements so as to contribute to overall peace in the country.    The spokesman concluded his speech by saying that the Somali  people should join together and do away with whatever happened  in the past.</p>

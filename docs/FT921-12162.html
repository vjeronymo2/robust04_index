			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Observer: Looney Toons As Boris Yeltsin announces that his missiles are facing away from US cities, what better way to celebrate than by sitting down with a six-pack and pizza and tune into Time-Warner's 18 hours of television offerings? 'Warner Week' is currently beaming into 200m homes in the erstwhile Soviet Union on Ostankino's Channel 1 (formerly Gostelradio). Highlights of the night shows include the gangster action movie, Bonnie and Clyde, and the The Postman Always Rings Twice, a cinematic tale of murder and betrayal. Ostankino gets the programming free; Time-Warner gets three minutes of advertising each hour. The Looney Toons cartoons are on future menus for the hapless ex-Soviets. Clearly, the lessons of capitalism are being learnt fast.</p>

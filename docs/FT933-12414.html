			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Reform moves put squeeze on LDP JAPAN'S leading opposition parties yesterday moved closer to forcing the Liberal Democratic party out of office by agreeing to political reform proposals that would be the policy priority of a seven-party coalition government. The parties have yet to agree on the fine details of the co-operation but generally accepted the introduction of one-seat constituencies and proportional representation to replace the present scandal-prone, multi-seat constituency system. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New party, proposed the new system in tandem with the New Harbinger party, but also indicated that a coalition government would need a coherent economic policy to deal with the present downturn. Four other parties  - Komeito, the Japan Renewal party, the Democratic Socialist party, and the United Social Democratic party  - supported the proposal, while the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, agreed, but needs formal approval from officials next week. The parties must also agree on a candidate for prime minister, as a vote will be taken during an extraordinary session of parliament early next month. It appears that either Mr Hosokawa or Mr Tsutomu Hata, the JRP leader, will be chosen as the representative, but the SDP, hit by a bitter internal struggle, could still bring the coalition undone. LDP officials plan to choose a prime ministerial candidate next Friday, but the agreement among the opposition parties yesterday will make it more difficult for the LDP to find a partner to ensure success in the parliamentary vote. The LDP won 223 seats in last Sunday's election, while the seven opposition parties collected 243 and expect support from independents in the 511-seat lower house. However, if the SDP pulled out, the coalition would have only 173 certain votes, and the LDP candidate would win. Japan's need for political reform was highlighted again yesterday when public prosecutors arrested another provincial governor suspected of allegedly receiving Y30m (Pounds 186,000) in illegal donations from construction companies.</p>

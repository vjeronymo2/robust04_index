			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Thomas Mayer report on interview with European Parliament </F> Deputy Yiannis Sakellariou; place and date not given: "Huge  Majority for Austria"]    [Text] "I assume that a huge majority of deputies will  support Austrian European Union [EU] accession." This was  stated by Yiannis Sakellariou, one of the most important  deputies in the European Parliament (EP) from Austria's point of  view, in an interview with DER STANDARD on Thursday [7 April].  According to the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany  official--who is of Greek descent--"85-90 percent of the  deputies welcome the enlargement."    In the EP's Foreign Policy Committee, Sakellariou is  "rapporteur" on Austria's EU entry -- that is, he is responsible  for working out all legal questions.    Only two weeks ago, he was rather pessimistic as a result of  the EU internal controversy on the blocking minority and the  British stalemate on the issue. The EP would "certainly not  have supported" a de facto lowering of the veto threshold in the  Council, Sakellariou said. Yet now, "the last hurdle" has been  overcome.    Sakellariou now believes that the only remaining possibility  for a failure of the vote on Austrian accession is that there  might not be a "quorum" in the EP on 4 May. The quorum requires  the presence of more than half of all deputies, at least 260 of  the 518.    Even if he regards it as unlikely that such an "embarrassing  situation" might really occur in view of a decision that is of  such significance for the Union, one will have to try very hard  to call the European deputies to Strasbourg.    "After all, there are insecurities," Sakellariou said. "More  than one-third of the deputies will resign from parliament after  the 12 June European election." It is hard to anticipate how  many of them will meet their political obligation.    Moreover, there are differing situations in the various  countries. The majority of the Italian Eurodeputies have  meanwhile lost their party, "because these parties have ceased  to exist." One day before the vote on enlargement, national  elections will be held in the Netherlands. There is, of course,  great interests for them "among our colleagues from the  Netherlands." Regional elections will be held in Britain.  Despite many imponderabilities, Sakellariou is optimistic that  some 350 deputies will show up.    In the EP there are obviously no problems on substance  regarding Austria's accession that might point to a negative  vote. A motion for a resolution, which has widely been  completed by the Foreign Policy Committee, and which should be  adopted along with the membership resolution assesses as  "absolutely positive" the result of the negotiations in Brussels.    Particular mention is made of the "historic effects of the  enlargement for Austria and the Union." Austria is expected to  be "a faithful partner" in the Union.</p>

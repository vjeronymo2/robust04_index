			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: All over Europe, the don't Knows have it MORE than 40 per cent of the population in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain have not the slightest idea whether the Maastricht treaty on European union is a good or bad thing, the latest batch of opinion polls shows. Only in France, where a referendum on the treaty is due on Sunday, is the Don't Know category down to a mere 15 per cent. That is the conclusion of five co-ordinated polls, published yesterday by Germany's Infas research group, which show that the Yes vote in France is still ahead of the No vote - but only by 3 points. The figures, published from a poll taken on September 6 and 7, are 44 per cent in favour, 41 per cent against, and 15 per cent undecided. Only in Britain would the No vote in a referendum be higher than the Yes vote - if all the Don't Knows abstain. There were 24 per cent in favour, 31 per cent against, and no less than 45 per cent undecided. In Germany, there is still a majority in favour, according to Infas: 36 per cent would say Yes, 24 per cent No, and 40 per cent Don't Know. Italy and Spain are by far the most positive: 45 per cent Yes, 14 per cent No and 41 per cent Don't know in Italy; 40 per cent Yes, 19 per cent No and 41 per cent undecided in Spain.</p>

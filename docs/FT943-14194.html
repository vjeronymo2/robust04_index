			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Druck gains 14% to Pounds 5.36m - Export growth leads the rise in orders as sales to Japan double Druck Holdings, the Leicester-based manufacturer of electronic pressure measuring and control devices, yesterday reported a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.36m for the year to March 31, up from Pounds 4.69m the previous year. Turnover grew by 10.7 per cent to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 27.9m) with exports accounting for about three-quarters of sales. Earnings per share advanced by 12 per cent to 53.7p (48.1p) and the board is recommending a final dividend of 7.1p (6.6p) making a total of 10.8p (10p) for the year. Mr John Salmon, chairman and chief executive of the USM-quoted group, said Druck had again 'strengthened its competitive position in the measurement and control of pressure throughout the world by the continued development of new products and the establishment of new markets.' Operating profits increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 5.37m (Pounds 4.82m) and the operating margin edged up to 17.4 per cent (17.3 per cent). Druck, the main operating company, increased its contribution to group profits by 30 per cent on turnover which grew by 14 per cent. Orders increased by 13 per cent with export orders growing by 16 per cent to Pounds 24m. The main contributions to the increase in orders were from Japan, where exports more than doubled, and to the rest of the world where orders grew by 29 per cent. The group spent Pounds 1.8m on research and development during the year and ended March with net cash of Pounds 1.7m having used its strong positive cash flow of Pounds 2m to eliminate gearing.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: Charming, but charm is not enough - Ballet There is an odd moment of adjustment when you return from a holiday. Instead of mountains or monuments, there - from train or aircraft - you see the neat, quilted English countryside, carefully laid out, domesticated. Of course it is 'home' - but rather enclosed, and somehow tame. I felt this on Monday night while watching The Sleeping Beauty with which the Birmingham Royal Ballet opened its Covent Garden season. Last week, at the Coliseum, the Kirov had shown us their Beauty. Tired and cursory as some of its components looked, it was still a grand and spacious work of art, its manner resonant with the importance of classical dancing. Its cast had an assurance born of the knowledge that their theatre had seen Beauty's first performance, and this gave dignity and clarity to their dancing. The BRB staging has many virtues. As an exposition of the text it is, in fact, superior to the Kirov's version: the prologue and first act, albeit numbers are reduced, maintain a shape lacking in the Kirov's touring production, and the Hunting scene is charmingly done. In everything, Sir Peter Wright (and how good it is to acknowledge his recent knighthood) has made intelligent choices in editing the ballet for his company's touring needs. The greatest merit, though, lies in Philip Prowse's designs which still, after a decade, strike one by their beauty, and by their wit and thrilling sense of history. Not, I believe, since Leon Bakst's 1921 designs for Diaghilev's Beauty staging, has costuming so brilliantly evoked a period through the most acute sense of historical shape. Drapery, pleating, skill in cutting, provide theatrically vivid yet accurate silhouettes. Fantasy becomes history: figures once painted by Nattier or Rigaud come dazzlingly alive on Prowse's own terms. Colours - gold, black, porphyry, rose Dubarry - all contribute to the feeling of splendour. It is a superlative example of the designer's art. The problems of acclimatisation arrive with the dancing. The BRB artists work well as an ensemble, and dramatic nuance is deftly pointed  - how acute is Desmond Kelly's view of the king. But dance-style is vivacious where the Kirov's is serene, and cosy where it might instead show us the broad horizons of classic manner. There is something breathlessly determined about the soloists: their dancing is ingratiating rather than commanding, as if trying to win us on everything but dance terms. And charm is not enough. The honourable and golden exception was Miyako Yoshida as Aurora. Here was a radiant, absolutely assured interpretation. Yoshida's dancing is ravishing because precise, delicate, pure. Nothing is fudged or fussed; everything looks elegant, with artistry dedicated to the service of the choreography. The reading is gentle, beguiling, a portrayal that must stand among the very best the Royal Ballet has shown us. Yoshida's prince was Kevin O'Hare, giving a gentlemanly account of the role, but careering through his solos as if fleeing in disarray from an insurrection. The score, from Philip Ellis and the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, sounded somewhat boxy and harried: we needed more of the Mariinsky orchestra's grandeur. The performance running time seemed a race against the clock. And I protest against the eliding of the first and second acts of the ballet. An interval after Aurora's birthday celebration is essential to enable the public to sense the passing of a hundred years. A single, helter-skelter passage of dancing, lasting nearly 70 minutes, is like having indigestion on the Cresta Run. Birmingham Royal Ballet is at Covent Garden, with varied programmes, until August 7.</p>

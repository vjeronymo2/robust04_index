			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michael Zantovsky, ambassador to the United </F> States, by Jana Smidova; place and date not given: "Czech-U.S.  Relations Are Not Encumbered by Serious Problems"]    [Text] Czech Ambassador to the United States Michael  Zantovsky returned home in connection with the visit of  President Clinton. He remained in Prague longer than the U.S.  President and, before his return to the United States, granted  LIDOVE NOVINY an interview on Clinton's visit and on relations  between the Czech Republic and the United States.    [Smidova] These relations give the impression of being like  a staunch friendship between the Czech and the U.S. people. Are  there any problems here at all?    [Zantovsky] The only place where there are no contentious  issues is heaven. I consider that we are managing, regardless  of the change in the U.S. Administration, to maintain an  atmosphere of intense friendship to be paramount. This is  something of an exception in normal contacts between states.  The fact that the preparation of treaties, such as on the  taxation agreement, is a matter for discussion is also part of  such a close relationship. It falls to diplomacy, however, to  allay any differences. Nonetheless, I am unaware of any serious  problems in mutual relations.    [Smidova] Some time has already passed since Clinton's  visit. What is your assessment, after such a short time, of its  significance?    [Zantovsky] The visit was extremely useful for us, according  to both our own assessment and the reactions from around the  world. The Partnership for Peace plan was at the center of  attention, but, apart from this dominant issue, the visit  enabled us to gauge U.S. views on the Central European region,  the Czech Republic, and U.S. policy toward Russia in the  security sphere. It also gave us sufficient opportunity to  acquaint the United States with Czech views on the issue. The  situation seems different up close than it does from overseas.    The fact that millions of Americans had an opportunity to  get  to know our capital city and to see the U.S. President in Prague  is also not insignificant. This is something that can be put to  very good use and that, of course, we will use, whether in the  tourism or the investment spheres. The results of Clinton's  visit can simply be turned into ready money.    [Smidova] The U.S. President often travels all over the  world. In your opinion, was this visit something special, or was  it just a routine visit to a small Central European country?    [Zantovsky] It is true that U.S. presidents travel all over  the world, but, in President Clinton's case, this was his first  visit to Europe and thus, of course, his first mission in the  Central European region. This visit more or less dispelled the  speculation that U.S. attention is turning away from Europe and  that it will be focused on only the Pacific region. This was an  important signal and confirmation of the continuing U.S.  interest in Europe and in the stability and security of Central  Europe.    [Smidova] The Partnership for Peace plan is being assessed  in various ways. Some see it as a mere gesture, while others see  it as a well-thought-out and forward-looking strategy. What is  your personal opinion?    [Zantovsky] It is essential to realize that, since November,  when outgoing Defense Secretary Aspin formulated this idea for  the first time, its contents have changed considerably. This  was also confirmed in Prague by President Clinton--that is, the  issue is not whether the Czech Republic and the other countries  of Central and East Europe will join NATO, but when and how.  And that is per se very important. If, however, anyone  imagined that we would be given automatic security guarantees  immediately without any effort on our part, the plan will indeed  mean very little to him. The Partnership opens the way for  specific possibilities that, given our endeavor, will in the  foreseeable future--in a few years--actually lead to the  structure of the Czech Armed Forces becoming more compatible  with that of the NATO armies. This, in turn, will lead to a very  intense exchange of personnel, their coordination, and policy  planning. And, last but not least, even the guarantee of  consultations contained in Article 4 of the Washington Treaty is  not insignificant. This is not, of course, a complete security  policy. Nevertheless, any potential aggressor has to take into  consideration the fact that this element exists. As far as I am  concerned, the success of this plan depends primarily on us.  After several decades in which we did not have any influence on  our own security, no matter what we did, this is an invaluable  factor.    [Smidova] A Czech expatriate, U.S. Ambassador to the  United Nations M. Albright, played a significant role in the  Clinton visit. Do you think she kept her fingers crossed more  for us than for the other postcommunist countries?    [Zantovsky] It would certainly be naive to think that Mrs.  Albright is our man in the U.S. Administration, even though,  during Clinton's visit, commentaries were published joking that  now, with Karel Kovanda presiding over the Security Council, the  Czech Republic is the only country in the world with two  representatives on this body. Mrs. Albright is, first of all, a  U.S. politician, someone who very assiduously defends White  House policy and U.S. interests in general. It is invaluable  for us that, in view of her origins, she is acquainted in detail  and professionally with the political trends and situation not  only in our country, but also throughout postcommunist Europe.  Her views may be an asset to the U.S. President and  Administration and, thus, also to us. It is not by chance that  President Clinton sent her on a trip to all of the  posttotalitarian countries before his visit, although, from a  purely bureaucratic point of view, this was not her task. This  was an expression of his faith in her knowledge of the region.    [Smidova] In connection with asserting Czech interests in  the United States, it is said that the Czech lobby is weak and  that it does not have the same influence as the Polish or  Hungarian special-interest groups....    [Zantovsky] Reference is often made to this. The situation  is, after all, somewhat different from the Polish exiles because  the Czechs arrived in several distinct waves. These are people  who brought with them an image of their homeland belonging to  their own time. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult for them  to share the same views on an issue. Despite this, a number of  expatriates are very actively helping the Czech Republic, among  other things, by supporting its interests in political circles.  Above all, I would mention Charles Vanik, the coauthor of the  Jackson-Vanik amendment. Moreover, the national lobby is not the  only or necessarily the most effective force that could act on  our behalf in U.S. politics. It is equally important for us  that, owing to the influx of U.S. investment in the Czech  Republic, there are now a number of businessmen in the United  States interested in ensuring that we are successful, that they  are successful with us, and that relations between the two  countries are the best they can be. These people appeal  actively to their congressmen. This is another force on which  we can rely.</p>

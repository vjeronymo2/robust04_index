			<p>BFN     [Text] Nago -- The existence of a U.S. Forces nuclear and  chemical arms unit, which is stationed at the Henoko Ammunition  Storage [HAS] in Nago, has again become a controversy in  connection with the issue of a secret agreement on the  deployment of nuclear arms in Okinawa concluded before Okinawa's  reversion to Japanese administration.    Japan Communist Party [JCP] member Keijin Oshiro (Nago City  Assembly member) demanded on 11 May: "The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs [MOFA] acknowledged during Diet deliberations in 1981  that a U.S. Forces unit specializing in poison gas and nuclear  arms is stationed at HAS. However, the U.S. Forces have so far  not answered questions on the existence or withdrawal of this  unit. Now is the time to thoroughly investigate this  allegation."    At a session of the House of Councilors Committee on Foreign  Affairs on 8 September 1981, MOFA acknowledged the deployment of  a maintenance unit specializing in special weapons, including  nuclear arms, at HAS.    This unit is called Detachment I (DET I) of the Third Marine  Amphibious Force headquartered at Camp Courtney. The then MOFA  Counselor Matsuda said at the Diet session: "DET I is capable  of maintaining chemical and nuclear weapons. However, it does  not mean that DET I possesses nuclear arms."    Oshiro pointed out: "So far, the U.S. Forces have not  answered questions concerning the withdrawal of DET I at all.  The secret agreement issue has further deepened suspicions."</p>

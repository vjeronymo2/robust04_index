			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has had a telephone conversation  with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Christopher  called President Izetbegovic to inform him about the U.S.  standpoint on the resolution of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United States believes the Bosnian side  will not miss this opportunity for peace and that a solution can  be found in the plans put forward by the international  community's contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina. President  Izetbegovic reiterated our resolve to persevere with the peace  process and said that the Bosnian side was very clear on this  subject and that at the same time, it also demanded respect for  the vital interests of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary state.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> KLON CONCERT REFLECTS L.A. MUSIC HISTORY  </P> <P> Segregation was so much a way of life in Los Angeles in the 1950s that two  largely separate musical styles evolved. One, predominantly white and low  calorie, was represented in a marathon concert dubbed "West Coast  Jazz"presented Sunday by KLON at the John Anson Ford Theater. The other,  generally more aggressive sound will be represented May 28 at a "Central Avenue  Revisted" concert with a virtually all-black cast at the same venue.  </P> <P> This is not a value judgment. What was heard Sunday involved nine groups. Only  two of the leaders were born and raised in Los Angeles, and only five now live  here, but the opening set by Shorty Rogers' Giants was typical of the neatly  packaged, good-humored sounds Rogers built around an instrumentation similar to  that of Miles Davis' "Birth of the Cool" group.  </P> <P> The French horn and tuba were put to good use in "Bunny," with Bill Perkins'  alto replacing that of the late Art Pepper, for whom it was written. The  10-piece band came alive more vividly with Bud Powell's "Un Poco Loco," and  showed its blues credentials in "Martians Go Home," with a minimalist clarinet  solo by Jimmy Giuffre.  </P> <P> The planning left much to be desired. Three long sets by Bob Brookmeyer,  Giuffre and Bob Cooper, all using the identical rhythm section, could better  have been combined into a single, more diversified set using all three horns.  However, Cooper's solo set was distinguished by his reading of Duke Ellington's  "Prelude to a Kiss," an eloquent offering that was clearly the crowd's favorite  of the exceedingly long event.  </P> <P> Hersh Hamel, a bassist, almost brought the show to a halt with his endless gab  about the Chet Baker years. Finally, he played a decent enough Mulliganesque  set with Bill Perkins as Mulligan and Bobby Shew as Baker.  </P> <P> The Dave Pell Octet was a trimmed-down version of the laid-back Shorty Rogers  California trip, with Lucy Ann Polk recalling the era vocally.  </P> <P> A set by trumpeter Jack Sheldon, whose quintet was recently reviewed in the  Times, was followed by a reunion of the Chico Hamilton Quintet, whose members  deftly rekindled the spirit of that original group with handsome readings of  "My Funny Valentine" and Buddy Collette's "Blue Sands."  </P> <P> Saxophonist Bud Shank had the dubious honor of closing the concert, which was  running nearly two hours late; but he managed to maintain interest with a  spirited, if somewhat dated, revival of his 1957 quartet.  </P></p>

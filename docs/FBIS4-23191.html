			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 27 SAPA -- South Africa has been  formally invited to join the Southern African Development  Community [SADC], Minister of Trade Mr Trevor Manuel said on  Friday [27 May]. He was speaking after a lunch at Tuynhuys with  an SADC delegation, which was also attended by President Nelson  Mandela.    Mr Manuel said the purpose of the delegation's visit was to  deliver a letter from SADC Chairman and Botswanan President  Quett Masire inviting South Africa to "seek accession" to the  SADC. "It's an invitation that is more than welcome," he said.  It would merely formalise a de facto situation and the fairly  strong relationship that already existed between most of the  members of the government of national unity and the Frontline  States.    The letter referred to the fact that an SADC summit of heads  of state and government would be held in Arusha, Tanzania, on  August 29. The formalities of South Africa's admission would be  dealt with there. The delegation was led by Botswana's Vice  President Mr Festus Mogae and SADC Executive Secretary Dr Kaire  Mbuende.</p>

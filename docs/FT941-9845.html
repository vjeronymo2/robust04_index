			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Premium pledge for Sunday work Eight of Britain's biggest retail chains yesterday pledged to pay premium rates to employees who work on Sundays. Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, met representatives of retailers Argyll, Asda, Boots, Dixons, Kingfisher, Sainsbury, Tesco and W H Smith who reaffirmed their agreement to pay premium rates - at least time and a half - to Sunday workers. The employers also agreed that an employee need only give one month's notice of an intention to opt out of Sunday work, rather than the statutory three months.</p>

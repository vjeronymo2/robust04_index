			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN WHO KILLED INFANT SON ALLOWED TO GET MENTAL HELP ON OUTPATIENT BASIS  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Friday ignored a recommendation that Sheryl Lynn Massip  be confined to a state mental hospital and ordered her to undergo at least a  year of outpatient therapy to determine whether she has recovered from a  psychosis that led her to kill her infant son two years ago.  </P> <P> Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald appeared to have based his unexpected ruling on an  11th-hour disclosure that a Los Angeles County man in circumstances similar to  Massip's had been allowed to undergo outpatient therapy at a clinic in  Fullerton, contrary to what was described as established procedure in Orange  County.  </P> <P> Under those procedures, psychologists and an administrator for county mental  health programs testified, they are required by law to confine and evaluate for  at least six months anyone found guilty of certain violent crimes by reason of  insanity.  </P> <P> The only facility designated as appropriate for such confinement -- even if the  person had shown significant progress toward recovery -- is Patton State  Hospital in San Bernardino County, they said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exception to the Rule  </P> <P> The psychologists, during a lunch break in the court proceeding, however,  checked and disclosed that they had found an exception to that rule, which  involved a man who had been found not guilty of assault by reason of insanity.  </P> <P> The man, they said, had been undergoing outpatient therapy in Los Angeles  County and then was transferred in 1980 to an outpatient clinic in Fullerton.  </P> <P> "If we can accept transfers from Los Angeles" into the outpatient program, "we  can accept this woman," said Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> The judge's decision stunned the 24-year-old La Palma woman, who said later  that she was prepared to be sent to a mental hospital.  </P> <P> Massip said she intends to get a driver's license and look for a job as a  beautician.  </P> <P> Asked if she planned to have more children, Massip responded, "Absolutely not.  That's a very futuristic question at this point."  </P> <P> </P> <P> National Attention  </P> <P> Her case attracted national attention because of her contention that she was  suffering from a severe case of post-partum depression -- or "baby blues" -- in  April, 1987, when she ran over her 6-month-old son with the family car, then  tried to cover up the killing.  </P> <P> A jury last year found her guilty of second-degree murder. But Fitzgerald, in  an extraordinary action in December, set aside that verdict and ruled that  Massip indeed had been insane at the time of the killing, and therefore was not  responsible for her actions.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris, who prosecuted Massip, said after  Fitzgerald's ruling that the judge's action on the jury verdict is in the  process of being appealed. He does not know if Friday's ruling also will be  appealed, he said.  </P></p>

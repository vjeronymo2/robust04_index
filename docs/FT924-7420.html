			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Clinton seeks to mend fences: Pledge to end cold war between Congress and the White House MR Bill Clinton, the president-elect, and Democratic congressional leaders yesterday pledged 'an end to the cold war between Congress and the White House and a new era of co-operation' on plans to tackle economic and health care problems. Mr Clinton and his wife, Hillary, met vice-president-elect Al Gore, Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House, Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority Leader, and Mr Dick Gephardt, the House majority leader on Sunday night. 'We're off to a good start,' Mr Foley said in Little Rock yesterday morning. He promised the House would move more swiftly than at any time in recent history to organise for action on the new president's proposals. Only a few notes of discord marred the pronouncements of harmony. Mr Clinton called 'intriguing' a plan by Mr Foley to allow the new president to 'line item veto' parts of bills, still giving Congress the power to override the veto by a majority vote. This means, said Mr Clinton, 'you can't just bury something of questionable merit in a big, omnibus bill.' However, Mr Mitchell, withheld his support from the proposal, saying once the economy had improved 'matters of process will be less important.' Mr Clinton reaffirmed his intention of lifting the ban on homosexuals serving in the US defence forces - a move opposed by Sen Sam Nunn, the powerful chairman of the Senate armed services committee. This promise could haunt him, particularly if military leaders resign over it, as some have threatened to do. On foreign policy, the president-elect refused to talk specifics, but on Bosnia, he said there were 'many options short of sending troops in but beyond where we are now'. On improving relations with Vietnam, he stressed the need for a full account of those American troops missing in action. Mr Clinton said his wife - whose role in the administration is being closely watched - had stayed for the entire meeting with the congressmen and that 'she knew more than we did about some things'. The Clintons are due to make their first post-election trip to Washington on Wednesday where they will meet with the Bushes and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.</p>

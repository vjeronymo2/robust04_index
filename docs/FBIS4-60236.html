			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F> domestic correspondents at the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv -- live]    [Text] [Rabin] Two events have taken place: one on  Friday [20 May] and one on Saturday. On Friday, there was a  murderous event in which two IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  soldiers were killed at the Erez checkpoint after the IDF's  redeployment -- an event we will not be able to ignore.  Therefore, the exit from Gaza has been closed until units of  the Palestinian police are stationed 200-300 meters from the  passages used by the Palestinians. The Palestinian police will  be responsible for making sure that nobody crosses its  checkpoint bearing weapons.    Moreover, the test of the Palestinians today is their  takeover of Gaza and Jericho and their ability to demonstrate  full control over those areas. If they do not prove it, it will  be hard for us to continue to carry out the additional stages in  the implementation of the Declaration of Principles we signed.    Last night, the IDF carried out an operation -- an operation  which the IDF, the State of Israel, and lovers of freedom and  the fight against terror can be proud of. The operation was  unanimously approved by all the members of the inner cabinet in  a meeting on 19 May. Its purpose was to bring here the man who  today heads a terrorist organization operating against us in the  security zone -- the Believers Resistance -- and who held Ron  Arad for at least two years and who, I hope, will definitely be  able to give us information about the period during which he  held him and perhaps about his condition later on.    The operation was conducted on the basis of our  responsibility for the MIA's and the POW's. This time, the  reasons I had for submitting my recommendation to the inner  cabinet were not the same as those I had at the time when I  recommended to the inner cabinet to bring Shaykh 'Ubayd to  Israel. At that time, I had hoped that Shaykh 'Ubayd would  serve as a bargaining chip in the negotiations. I no longer have  any illusions that anybody can be used as a bargaining chip in  the negotiations -- certainly not Mustafa al-Dirani. Our goal  was to further exhaust the chances of obtaining information  about what happened in the past and the current fate of Ron  Arad. This operation was also part of our fight against  Lebanese terrorism directed at the security zone.    I would like to express my deep appreciation to the IDF, the  intelligence community, the special units, the Air Force, the  Intelligence Corps, and others who participated in an operation  that once again proves the IDF's greatness as the Army  responsible for the defense of Israel. To my regret, in the  last six and a half years, the IDF has been carrying out  policing duties and has been used as an Army imposing Israel's  rule on another people. It has been carrying out tough policing  duties which were unavoidable, escorting convoys, guarding  roads, escorting school buses -- missions which could not supply  a full answer in the face of a people's uprising.    I would like to seize this occasion to point out that some  right-wing extremists claim that the blood that is being shed is  being shed for peace. There can be no grosser lie. The blood  being shed is because of our rule over another foreign people.  Peace is the only chance -- not a certainty -- of ever  attaining an end to this bloodshed or definitely a significant  reduction of it. As long as the occupation rule continues and  as long as there is growing resistance to it by extreme  elements, the murderers of Israelis and murderers of peace --  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad -- we  will have to pay a bloody price. The IDF and the security  branches will do their best to reduce it, but the bloody price  is the price of ruling over another people that is rebelling  against our rule -- and this point must be understood. I am  sorry that the IDF bears the tough mission of policing a large,  rebelling population that is causing fatalities among civilians  and soldiers. I hope that as the peace process continues, the  IDF will go back to being a defense army rather than an army  ruling over another people.    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's political  correspondent Gadi Sukenik] Mr. Rabin, with all due respect to  those who executed the operation, of course, could not such an  operation have been carried out during the seven years that Ron  Arad has been in captivity and to this day in order to extract  information from people such as al-Dirani? To this day, is  there any certainty that Ron Arad is alive?    [Rabin] As far as certainties go, I have no clear-cut proof  that he is alive, and there is definitely no clear-cut proof  that he is not alive. In the IDF, an MIA is any soldier or  officer who is considered to be alive as long as it has not been  proven otherwise.    As for the second part of your question, we have taken  people  in the past. This operation could have been carried out a few  months ago, but it was put off because of intelligence  considerations and chances of obtaining information. It was  designed to be carried out in a specific area -- in that area  where the operation took place. Therefore, the timing chosen was  the first possible time after another channel and hope of  obtaining information through other means were blocked.    [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Dov Gilhar] Mr. Rabin,  what is the next stage? Assuming that Mustafa al-Dirani  confirms that he handed Ron Arad over to the Iranians, is it now  a question of international pressure on Tehran? What are the  next moves?    [Rabin] At the moment, I do not want to say what we will  find out in the course of his interrogation. Furthermore, I  should say that the unit, which carried out the operation  admirably -- I would like to congratulate the chief of staff,  the General Staff, the chief of intelligence, the Air Force  commander, and particularly the soldiers who carried out the  mission and the pilots who flew them -- also brought with it a  considerable amount of written material which will certainly  throw light on some points. When I presented my recommendation  to the inner cabinet two days ago and asked it to approve the  operation, I said that we must exhaust any lead and any way that  will offer us more information. I cannot assure you that we  will get conclusive information about the whereabouts and  condition of Ron Arad today. I can assure you that such  operations will also be carried out in the future, if they are  necessary and if possible, because we bear responsibility for  all the MIA's and POW's whose fate has not yet been conclusively  determined by Israel and the IDF.    [Unidentified Tel Aviv IDF Radio correspondent] Mr. Prime  Minister, this daring operation notwithstanding, did you take  into account the possibility that the decision to carry it out  could lead to a flare-up or perhaps a new war with Hizballah  along the northern border?    [Rabin] We took everything into consideration. I  recommended it, and it was planned by the IDF. When it was  ready, I presented it to the inner cabinet with the realization  that we must take risks for the sake of the heavy responsibility  we bear for the fate of the POW's and MIA's. The problem is not  to put up bumper stickers [calling for Arad's release] but to do  the things that give us a better chance of getting more  information, even if they entail risks and uncertainties.    [Unidentified Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el correspondent] Might  this operation not affect the U.S. secretary of state's efforts  to resume the peace talks?    [Rabin] I do not see why. After he returned from Damascus,  I asked the secretary of state what he had brought back as a  result of President Clinton's appeal to President al-Asad in  Geneva to take action to provide information, through the  Americans, about the MIA's and the POW's -- not just about Ron  Arad, but about all of them; about those about whom we have no  information, particularly Ron Arad and the MIA's from the  al-Sultan Ya'qub battle: Baumel, Katz, and Feldman. The U.S.  President again sent Dennis Ross to another meeting in Damascus,  and we in fact received no additional information. The U.S.  congressional delegation that visited Syria did not produce any  trace of new information. Therefore, Syria has no right  whatsoever to complain about it. It was not carried out on its  soil. It is true, however, that it was carried out in an area  controlled by the Syrian Army and where Syrian troops are  deployed.</p>

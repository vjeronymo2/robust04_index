			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: Behind the Arab Legion GLUBB PASHA: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SIR JOHN BAGOT GLUBB by Trevor Royle Little, Brown Pounds 20, 525 pages JACK GLUBB played a notable role in modern Middle East history - not as overtly spectacular as that of TE Lawrence, but in many ways more influential. Most attention is paid to Glubb Pasha's development of the Arab Legion which he commanded between 1939 and 1956 in what is now Jordan. In the author's words, this is a 'political biography', and while it goes over ground made familiar in an earlier account of Glubb's life by James Lunt, Royle has drawn on more recently released government documents in addition to Glubb's extensive collection of private papers. More importantly, Royle puts Glubb into broader historical and social perspectives. Glubb followed his father into the British army, becoming like him a sapper. He was horribly wounded in 1917 in the Battle of Arras: the injury's legacy was the Arabs' epithet of Abu Hunaik - 'he of the little jaw'. His Middle East experiences started in Mesopotamia, operating with the Bedouin on the border with Saudi Arabia. He pioneered sky-spying and bombing from DH9A aircraft, thereby giving British forces and their allies a distinct edge over Arab rebels. But it was in Jordan that he made his name, building up the Arab Legion, the only Arab army to emerge from the 1948 war against an embryonic Israel with any military credit. But Glubb's position was an extraordinary anomaly. Employed by King Hussein, 38 years his junior, he was still expected to supply intelligence to the British government. He was a good intelligence-gatherer, a prolific writer of memos, but an isolated and introspective man who was at his most relaxed with the Bedouin. He was no politician. Although Eden saw Nasser's hand behind his abrupt dismissal by King Hussein in 1956, it was almost certainly not the case, rather a sign that an era had ended. Had Glubb been more politically astute, he might have retired earlier and of his own accord. The writer is correctly careful not to make a martyr of his subject, whose return to Britain was met with wrangling over his official pension. He made his subsequent living writing and lecturing. Today in Jordan, he is scarcely an historical footnote. But through developing the Arab Legion he helped to lay down the foundations on which King Hussein could rely for his country's continued existence.</p>

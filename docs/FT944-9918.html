			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Good food for free - Cookery It is an ironic fact that foods for free from the wild seem to be relished more by the rich than by the poor in late-20th century Britain. Samphire and laver are prized highly. Even nettles are relished. By common consent, though, the greatest treasure trove at this season is ceps, or porcini. I use the French and Italian names sadly but deliberately, for the charming old English name is all but forgotten. Penny bun. The very name is indicative of the low esteem in which we once held this lovely fungus. Re-christened ceps or porcini, it commands respect  -and premium prices, fresh or dried, in specialist shops. Happily, though, whatever you chose to call it, the fungus continues to flourish in Britain. It is a question of knowing where to look for it, and recognising it when you find it. For a millionaire/peasant food treat, you could hardly do better than slice these best of all mushrooms, saute them in olive oil with garlic and parsley and serve them on a pool of polenta. Anglo-Saxons too nervous of Nature to risk picking a poisonous variety of fungi by mistake, will feel happier gleaning or scrumping for sweet or Spanish chestnuts. Roasted, peeled, wrapped in blanched Savoy cabbage leaves and braised they make an excellent dish - comforting to serve on its own, chic as a partner for game birds. The only bore is that roasting and peeling chestnuts is such a tedious and lengthy business. I suggest you reserve chestnuts for leisurely fireside eating. Then each person can peel his or her own as the chestnuts emerge roasted and charred from the embers; drop the skinned kernels into glasses of desert wine to cool a little, and fish them out with a teaspoon to eat. Cabbage is, in theory, a terrible turn-off: it stinks of penny- pinching and sulphurously inept cooking. The same is true of carrots. Neither ingredient is intrinsically dull, of course, but to shrug off the dread image and to be voted instead as star treats calls for considerable care and imagination in cooking and in presentation. Cabbage can be, as already mentioned, splendid when stuffed and braised with chestnuts. I also recommend shredding cabbage very finely and deep frying it until frizzy and crisp, a jade green 'seaweed' to serve with Chinese dishes or as an appetite-whetting alternative to crisps. Carrots look much improved if cut into neat little batons rather than plain rounds, and they respond well to turning in warm olive oil. Add a bay leaf or two, several sprigs of thyme, a mere splash of sherry vinegar, cover tightly and leave to cook in their own steam in a heavy based pot until aromatic and just tender. Serve (reheated if cooked ahead) as a salade tiede, best of all if garnished (not so cheaply I agree) with a few black olives stoned and cut into strips. For a sophisticated sweet alternative, grate long carrots into vermicelli and blanch them in a rich sugar syrup scented with orange flower water and cardomom seeds or star anise. Served alone or with sliced oranges and a bowl of fromage frais maybe, this makes an exotic dessert. Whisked egg whites and hot air are invaluable allies to the cook with more dash than cash. Souffles, so easy and so cheap, never fail to delight and impress, best of all if sauced - think of spinach souffle with anchovy cream, cheese souffle with a coulis of leek flecked with green coriander, and prune souffle sauced with armagnac-flavoured cream. Profiteroles are another good way to share a few ingredients between several people - bubbles of choux pastry stuffed with a dab of fromage frais, pyramid piled, capped with melted chocolate or coffee sauce, and swirled with a web of spun sugar for extra sparkle. Even easier, and less often seen, are dolls'-tea-party-sized meringues made with brown sugar, piled high with creme fraiche cementing one to the next, the whole towering edifice scattered with toasted and chopped nuts and served with a runny, agreeably tart dried apricot puree to sauce them. Mussels, squid and herring roes all make inexpensive treats, and since mussels are now predominantly farmed, the effort of cleaning them has been greatly reduced. Few foods make more glamorous soups and soups-cum-stews than mussels, and I love them in rice dishes, for the blue of their shells and for the sake of their juices which seem to taste both briny and winey. There is really no need to uncork a bottle to slurp into the pan when cooking them. Soft herring roes have made few dinner party appearances since the demise of the after-dinner savoury. They warrant reconsideration now as savoury starters. I recommend pureeing them and whipping them delicately with egg white and cream to bake as mousselines. Alternatively, dust herring roes with flour, saute them in butter until they stiffen and curl, toss with lemon or lime juice and pile them into fried bread tartlet cases. In this case a seasoning of cayenne and paprika, or a mixture of chives, green coriander and capers will finish them nicely. Most soothing of all, and a useful trick for frozen roes which may be a bit broken up, is as follows. Stiffen the roes in a smallish pan in a little hot butter until just cooked on both sides. Then pour on some eggs beaten with sea salt, black pepper, fresh chopped dill and a little parsley. Quickly draw the pan to one side and stir and turn the contents until the eggs are scrambled and the roes are semi-crushed into them. 12oz herring roes and three eggs are enough for six people.</p>

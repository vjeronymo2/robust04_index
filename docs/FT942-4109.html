			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Rail regime tested in payout row A stretch of waterlogged signal cable near Edinburgh is set to pose the first serious test of the decentralised railway system which is being created from British Rail. Intercity East Coast, which runs trains between London and Scotland, is seeking compensation from Railtrack, which has taken over BR's signalling, track and stations, for the signalling failure. This is the first time, since Railtrack was created on April 1, that a significant disagreement has arisen between it and a train-operating company. The east-coast company has been forced to terminate its London-to-Glasgow service in Edinburgh because of the failure of a 20-year old stretch of signal cable just outside the Scottish capital. Water has penetrated a section of cable and work on replacing it is expected to take at least another 10 weeks, the east-coast company said. Customers from London who would normally take the east-coast route have been switching to the slower west-coast line. 'We face the prospect of losing our core Glasgow service during the summer peak,' the east-coast company said. It was speaking to Railtrack to seek compensation, it added. Railtrack said passengers would face diversions. The company said it was talking to Intercity East Coast about the amount of 'rebate' it should pay but said it was not required to pay compensation. If the Edinburgh-Glasgow section remains closed through the summer the east-coast line faces a loss of more than Pounds 1m in revenue. The train operators have complained that the track-access agreements are drawn up in Railtrack's favour and impose insufficient penalties for any failures of track or signalling. Some operators, which are engaged in preparing for privatisation, have said that the impact on their finances of a lengthy line closure could be disastrous. Under British Rail, losses could be absorbed by the organisation as a whole. Critics of privatisation have argued that the new system would lead to legal battles between the different companies in the railway system. Mr Roger Salmon, the railway franchising director, says he has devised a framework of contracts designed to avoid litigation. Railtrack has reached an agreement with Boots the chemists to treble the size of its shop at London's Liverpool Street station. Boots will spend Pounds 1m to extend the store in return for a 21-year lease.</p>

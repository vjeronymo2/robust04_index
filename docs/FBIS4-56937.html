			<p>BFN     [Text] (NA-DYN) -- The patents bill currently before the  Senate is being revamped by the Foreign Ministry and the  Justicialist Party bloc of senators so as to bring it into line  with the GATT agreement and to make it similar to intellectual  property-rights legislation being used in Brazil.    At the same time the Senate's Industry commission confirmed  yesterday that Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will be giving  his view on the issue before the Commission on May 19.    Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday that the  government's intention is not to send a new law to Congress --  which would take even longer to be passed -- but to reach an  agreement with the Radical Party on a patents protection law  that would fall within the framework of the GATT treaty, of  which Argentina and the US are both signatories.    The government's intention is to obtain, at the least, a law  that is in accordance with GATT terms and at the most, one that  grants foreign pharmaceutical companies greater protection as  Mexico did so as to obtain its membership in the NAFTA North  American free trade agreement.    Notwithstanding the GATT treaty, the US has been carrying  out  bilateral talks in an effort to obtain even further benefits.    The Foreign Ministry is now advising the Party Senators on  how best to modify the current bill so as to comply with  international trade regulations as well as to make it as similar  as possible to Brazil's laws in view of the Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] southern-cone common market integration.    Some of the modifications to be included will be a  transition  period, already in the official text but much shorter than the  10 years contemplated by the GATT treaty.    There will also be a monopoly on imports to benefit the  patent holder, except when it is imported raw materials from  Mercosur member countries.    One of the pending issues which will be heatedly debated in  Congress is the automatic manufacturing licences being demanded  by local pharmaceutical companies in order to avoid a monopoly  situation.    If the new patents law meets US pharmaceutical company  demands half way as well as taking into account GATT rulings and  domestic company demands, then the law could be acceptable to  the local pharmaceutical companies Pablo Challu said yesterday.    He added however that the patent life should only last for  ten years, and not the 20 years that is being demanded by US  pharmaceutical companies.    Argentina is being heavily pressed by the US to have a  patents law in place within the next 60 days, a deadline  extension that was officially announced last Wednesday by the US  Embassy.</p>

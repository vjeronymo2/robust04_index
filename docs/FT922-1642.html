			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil Dollars 150m preference issue ENTERPRISE Oil, the independent UK oil producer, said yesterday that it had raised Dollars 150m (Pounds 81m) via the issue of fixed-rate US dollar preference shares. The company gained shareholders' approval last month to allow it to issue up to Dollars 300m of the shares. It initially intended to offer Dollars 100m, but this was raised to Dollars 150m in response to investor demand. Mr Andrew Shilson, treasurer, said an over-option facility of up to 15 per cent could boost the final size of the issue to a maximum of Dollars 172m. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes and for its long-term investment programme - particularly in Europe and the Far East. The shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and were priced to yield an annual net dividend of 7.88 per cent, equivalent to a gross yield of 10.5 per cent. Enterprise is the first UK non-bank company to raise equity capital through preference shares in the US. Preference shares pay a fixed coupon like a bond, but rank below all debt holders in the event of the company being wound up. Aviva Petroleum, the US-based but London-quoted oil company, said yesterday that it had re-scheduled its term loan with the Royal Bank of Scotland and converted interest due to the bank of Dollars 1.17m into ordinary shares at 58p each. It is also selling its 70 per cent holding in Aviva Petroleum Canada to Gulf USA for Dollars 2.5m. Aviva said the moves solved the company's short-term cash problems and would help meet development costs in Colombia.</p>

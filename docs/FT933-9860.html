			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Gardini 'admitted irregularities' MR Raul Gardini, the Italian entrepreneur who commited suicide last month, reportedly confirmed in a letter to Milan magistrates many alleged financial irregularities at Ferruzzi, Italy's second-biggest industrial company, while he led the company. The allegations were made in leaked testimony by Mr Giuseppe Garofano and Mr Carlo Sama, two former Ferruzzi executives arrested last month. The letter, extracts of which were released yesterday before publication in the Panorama news magazine, appear to confirm allegations of a substantial shortfall in Ferruzzi's accounts as a result of undeclared borrowings and attempts to cover up losses. Mr Gardini's letter admits to a shortfall of Dollars 250m to Dollars 270m (Pounds 181.2m) in Ferruzzi's accounts by July 1991. That was when Mr Gardini's wife, a daughter of Ferruzzi's founder, sold her shares in the family holding company which controls Ferruzzi. Mr Gardini is reported to have admitted in his letter that the shortfall corresponded to losses Ferruzzi had incurred in US commodity futures trading in 1989. Only about Dollars 150m of the losses were disclosed in Ferruzzi's 1990 accounts. Other executives have alleged Mr Gardini authorised them to cover up the remainder. The losses were hidden by so-called 'back-to-back' financings, using a Swiss-based financial intermediary who had traditionally worked for the Ferruzzis. The system worked by using non-consolidated subsidiaries of Ferruzzi's Montedison industrial subsidiary to take out bank loans, which would then be used either to plug losses elsewhere in the Ferruzzi business or to finance projects which Mr Gardini wanted to keep off the group's balance sheet. The admission explains the surprise revision in June of Montedison's 1992 accounts. Shareholders were shocked to see the group's consolidated losses rise by L435bn to L1,679bn (Pounds 701m) because of mysterious 'credits', unexpectedly deemed to be irrecoverable, by an obscure Curacao-based subsidiary. Mr Gardini's letter confirms the steady use, from 1988, of 'back-to-back' financing to boost the group's resources. By 1991, the letter says the undeclared borrowings had risen to about L1,000bn. The letter adds that Ferruzzi used the Swiss intermediary to buy shares in a number of takeover deals.</p>

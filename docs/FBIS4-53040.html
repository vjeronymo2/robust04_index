			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Tomomitsu Oba, director of the Japan Center </F> for International Finance, by reporter Hideyuki Konaka; place  and date not given]    [Text] The "Ad Hoc Committee on Foreign Financial  Transaction Issues" of the Foreign Exchange Council chaired by  Gaishi Hiraiwa will compile a report by June on the subject of  "Integration of Domestic and Foreign Economies and Global  Financial Transactions." Prior to that report, the ad hoc  committee had engaged in a survey of changes in the role of the  yen and activities of Japanese businesses in Southeast Asia,  which is undergoing rapid economic expansion. An interview was  conducted with Toshimitsu Oba, Japan Center for International  Finance (JCIF) director and ad hoc committee chairman, who  inspected the ASEAN nations of Thailand, Malaysia, and  Singapore, and Hong Kong to seek information on the recent  currency situation in those areas.    [Konaka] What sort of problems exist in markets of the  Southeast Asian nations?    [Oba] The finance ministers of each of the nations are  troubled by the high volume of capital outflow and inflow from  abroad. Gross domestic product (GDP) of Thailand, Malaysia, and  Singapore was growing at about 8-10 percent on the high side  last year, but such growth supported a massive flow of capital  into their stock markets from overseas, and stock prices doubled  in the last year. However, once stock prices reached a  profitable level, moves took place to reap the benefits and  stock prices dropped substantially.    Government authorities of the various nations consider such  huge movements of capital as detrimental to the smooth  management of their economies and are exercising increasing  interest in how they might restrain such capital movements. In  some cases, they have the perception that controls are necessary  and embrace views which are somewhat different from those of  advanced nations.    [Konaka] Have there been any changes in situations  concerning  currency because of the evacuation of U.S. military forces?    [Oba] The various nations exercise care in ensuring that  major fluctuations do not take place in dollar exchange rates  because the dollar continues to play a prevalent role in that it  is easy to procure and manage. In contrast, there is a tendency  to avoid the yen which suffers from sharp changes in value  against the dollar. The various governments have displayed  sensitivity to a strong yen because of the fact that they hold  major liabilities in yen-denominated debt instruments. ASEAN  regional trade is in the process of increasing and you would  think that greater use could be made of the various nations'  currencies, but it seems that these nations do not favor the  globalization of their currencies. I imagine that they take such  a stance because globalization would impose a burden on their  financial policies.    [Konaka] What do you think of Japanese corporate investments  penetrating the local economies in the form of newly constructed  factories?    [Oba] I visited a Japanese corporation's color television  factory, but it was more modern than the company's domestic  plants and its parts vendors had also located themselves in  Southeast Asia. On the other hand, wages are low. For example,  labor rates in Malaysia are 1/12th those in Japan, and in  Singapore they are 1/7th of Japanese rates. In 1993, Japan  became a net importer of color television sets and in some  categories Japanese domestic plants are no longer competitive.  Even the position of producing domestically that which is to be  sold in Japan will probably have to undergo inevitable future  modification.    [Konaka] However, what do you think of the seemingly  unchanging Japanese trade surplus with Asia, even if local  investments increase because of the strong yen?    [Oba] Ever since 1988, Japanese investments in manufacturing  in Southeast Asia grew because of expansions in local production  facilities. Initially, these investments were followed by  increased exports of parts and materials, causing a phenomenon  whereby exports grew instead of falling. If investments in  manufacturing facilities take place after a strong yen, exports  of parts and materials will not be restricted to 12 or 18  months, which means that the impact of a strong yen will not be  seen for about five years. For example, if corporate overseas  investments were to accelerate with a dollar-yen exchange rate  of $1 to 100 yen, effects will not be seen for another five  years and the interim will witness a repeat of the vicious  cycle. I believe the cause of the huge trade surplus has a more  fundamental cause.    [Konaka] Are you saying that you question any efforts to  reduce trade surpluses based on the strong yen?    [Oba] Yes. Up until now, it was felt that if manufacturing  facilities were transferred overseas to places such as Asia,  that the trade surplus would disappear. However, if we were to  view the Southeast Asian regional example, we'd have to say that  the formula does not necessarily apply.    The study objective of "integration of domestic and foreign  economies," in the ad hoc committee report put another way  addresses the globalization of economies and I believe we must  view international trade issues of this nature not from the  perspective of bilateral relationships, but from the perspective  of individual regions. I realize we are speaking of a difficult  technical approach, but I think if we were to examine economic  flows on a detailed basis and conduct a detailed analysis, we  just might come up with the desired answers.</p>

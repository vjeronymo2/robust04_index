			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDISTRIBUTING FOREIGN AID  </P> <P> U.S. foreign aid is stingy? Nonsense! Over the past few decades, America gave  Israel more than $45 billion in foreign aid. No benefits were realized by the  U.S. For the past 2 years, U.S. aid funded the human rights violations  perpetrated by Israelis against Palestinians.  </P> <P> The largest recipients of foreign aid receive the aid year after year. What  plans do those nations have to become independent of U.S. aid? Reallocating aid  now will:  </P> <P> Help the emerging democracies; jolt the largest recipients into the realization  that U.S. foreign aid is not an entitlement program, and provide the President  with the flexibility and authority to effectively allocate aid funds.  </P> <P> Under-funding is not the problem. The problem is ineffective distribution of  foreign aid by Congress.  </P> <P> DON BOWERS  </P> <P> El Segundo  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Growth in world trade doubles The growth rate of world trade in goods is expected to double this year to around 7 per cent from 3.5 per cent in 1993, according to Gatt economists, The increase reflects economic recovery around the world, especially in the European Union and Japan. Giving these preliminary estimates, Mr Andras Szepesi, chairman of Gatt's contracting parties (members), told the Gatt annual meeting that significant cuts in trade barriers negotiated in the Uruguay Round would give the international trading environment a new dynamism and vitality. However, in a reflection of widespread concern among Gatt members, he said more attention should be paid to scrutiny of regional trading arrangements and called for a review of the Gatt working party system which will be carried over into the World Trade Organisation. More than 50 working parties have failed to agree on whether individual free trade pacts are consistent with Gatt.</p>

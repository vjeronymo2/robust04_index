			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: KING SOLOMON'S MINES BY H. RIDER HAGGARD (OXFORD: $2.25)  </P> <P> First published in 1885, "King Solomon's Mines" still ranks as one of the great  adventure stories of all time, rivaling "The Man Who Would Be King" and "Beau  Geste." The quest for a fabulous cache of diamonds takes three English  adventurers to the imaginary kingdom of Kukuanaland.  </P> <P> The overthrow of the cruel despot, Twala, by his virtuous nephew, Ignosi,  embodies the 19th-Century British beliefs in the noble savage and the  civilizing effects of European culture. Modern readers will be amused to  discover that Allan Quartermain, Haggard's reluctant swashbuckler, is the  obvious ancestor of Indiana Jones, Jack Flashman and countless other  tongue-in-cheek heroes. Although the casual slaughter of African wildlife by  Quartermain and his friends seems appalling by today's standards, even  ecological activists will find this dashing saga hard to resist.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLEMAN BOARD CONSIDERS BUYOUT BID BY CHAIRMAN  </P> <P> Coleman Co., the outdoor equipment maker whose sturdy lanterns and stoves are  standard American camping gear, said Tuesday that its board is considering a  possible $450.6-million management buyout offer.  </P> <P> Shares of the Wichita, Kan.-based company soared $21 to $70.125 on the New York  Stock Exchange, above the $64-a-share buyout price. Analysts said the stock  jumped on a belief that another suitor may emerge.  </P> <P> "My view is they can go higher," said analyst Daniel Coleman of Seattle firm  Ragen &amp; Mackenziean. "It is worth between $65 and $70 a share."  </P> <P> "It's a management leveraged buyout and all management LBOs are eventually  sweetened," said one trader.  </P> <P> The offer, led by Coleman Chairman and Chief Executive Sheldon Coleman,  consists of $54 cash and $10 a share in preferred stock. Coleman's board was  scheduled to meet late Tuesday to discuss the proposal and expects to make a  further announcement this morning, the company said.  </P> <P> The analyst Coleman, who is not related to the chairman, said the camping  concern has many desirable brand names in its Coleman lanterns, stoves and  coolers, Mastercraft ski boats and O'Brien water skis.  </P> <P> "It has great brand names," he said. "Most leveraged buyout firms will have to  look at it, as well as foreign investors and maybe leisure products companies  like Brunswick Corp. or Outboard Marine Corp." Brunswick declined comment,  while Outboard Marine was not immediately available.  </P> <P> Traders said the company might be auctioned off to the highest bidder. "The  chairman may be putting the company in play to solicit other bids for it," one  trader said.  </P> <P> Coleman earned $22.7 million, or $3.23 a share, on revenue of $517 million for  the nine months ended Nov. 30. Its chairman said in November that the company  should earn between $3.40 and $3.50 a share for the full year.  </P></p>

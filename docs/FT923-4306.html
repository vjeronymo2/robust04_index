			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Coach travel company collapses MED INTERNATIONAL, a North Yorkshire coach company, collapsed yesterday. It was the 43rd member of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) to go out of business this year. Abta said, however, that this figure represented a considerable improvement over 1991. By this time last year, 78 of its member companies had collapsed. Med International, based in Selby, North Yorkshire, had 300 travellers on holiday. Its sister company, Impact Holidays, based in Carlisle, collapsed last Friday with 3,000 customers still on holiday. As both companies had bonds arranged through Abta, none of the customers will lose their money. Those already away will be able to complete their holidays - ferry companies and hoteliers will be paid from the bonds. Those that have bookings will receive refunds. The collapses come just a few days after the Civil Aviation Authority announced that DHG (UK), a bonded tour operator which specialised in package holidays to Turkey, had ceased trading. The CAA said an estimated 3,000 customers abroad would be able to complete their holidays. Abta said eight of the 43 companies which had collapsed so far this year were tour operators, 31 were travel agents and four performed both functions. Of the 78 which had gone out of business by this time last year, 14 were tour operators, 60 were travel agents and four were both. Last year's casualties included Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, then the second-biggest tour operator. This year's Abta figures do not include Land Travel, the Bath-based coach company which went out of business in July. As it was not bonded, more than 40,000 customers who had booked holidays have no possibility of receiving any money back through Abta. Throughout the summer, travel industry executives have warned that a relatively large company might go out of business as a result of the excessive number of holidays being offered for sale and also the fierce price-cutting. Although the number of companies that have ceased trading this year is lower than in 1991, the autumn represents a dangerous period for travel groups. Bills from hoteliers and other suppliers fall due during this period, while the money companies receive in deposits and advance payments falls as the season draws to a close. Warnings of further collapses resulted in the government announcing last July that it intended to impose a levy on the travel industry to replenish the Air Travel Trust Fund, which repatriates air charter holiday-makers and provides refunds if company bonds prove inadequate. The CAA, which administers the fund, said yesterday only Pounds 3m remained. The government has said that until the levy is imposed, the fund will be able to borrow money if necessary.</p>

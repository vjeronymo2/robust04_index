			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 23 (YONHAP) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said Tuesday that Beijing would draft a resolution stating  its position on the North Korean nuclear dispute in case the UN  Security Council takes up the issue.    At a press conference after the close of the National  People's Congress meeting, Li reiterated that China believes the  problem should be solved through dialogue and negotiation,  rather than pressure, when asked to comment on recent  developments.    He clearly reaffirmed China's opposition to the UN Security  Council taking up the problem, because pressuring North Korea  would not help the security of Northeast Asia but would only  complicate matters and heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula.    He also stressed Beijing's desire for a nuclear-free Korean  peninsula, noting that China as a signatory to the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty would never support an arms race.    Li hoped other permanent members of the UN Security Council  would support China's resolution on the North Korean nuclear  issue.</p>

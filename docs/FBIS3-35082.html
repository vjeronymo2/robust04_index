Shalom to you, sir.    [Peres] Shalom.    [Zelinger] An Israeli delegation -- albeit one consisting of  Israeli Arabs -- is due to depart for Syria. Will you ask  Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah or any other delegation  member to convey any message to President al-Asad?    [Peres] I do not think that is necessary, because the  purpose of this visit is to convey condolences. That was the  reason cited in the application for permission to visit, and I  think it should be honored. There is no need to turn a  condolence visit into something else. Moreover, sending  messages is not a problem. There are constant exchanges.    [Zelinger] I know Israel has been trying to open more than  one channel of negotiations with Syria.    [Peres] That is correct. I know that on this occasion,  however, the visas were granted for the purpose of calling on  the bereaved family, and this should be honored.    [Zelinger] Would you like to comment on the very fact of the  visit? Is the departure of an Israeli delegation to Damascus an  important event?    [Peres] I think it is a positive signal and I welcome it,  although it has its limitations. It does not yet herald a burst  of possibilities. It is a signal -- a positive and not at all  negligible one -- but that is all it is. [passage omitted]</p>

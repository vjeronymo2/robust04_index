			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHANG NOT UNHAPPY ABOUT LOSS  </P> <P> Michael Chang lost two tiebreakers and with them his second-round match, bowing  to Mark Kratzmann of Australia, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3), at the Manchester Open  grass-court tournament Thursday in England.  </P> <P> Chang was the third-seeded player.  </P> <P> Pete Sampras, the second-seeded player, beat fellow American Joey Rive, 4-6,  6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Chang did not seem unhappy. He wanted to travel the 200 miles south to London  Saturday to complete his training for Wimbledon.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, in the next few days I can work well before Wimbledon, because I'll  now go down to London, where the grass is that little bit harder," he said.  </P> <P> Chang saved seven match points before Kratzmann, better known for his doubles  play, finally served the winner.  </P> <P> Julie Richardson of New Zealand was slightly injured when high winds toppled a  tent pole as rain washed out play at the women's grass-court tournament at  Eastbourne.  </P> <P> Richardson sustained minor cuts and bruises when a pole supporting the players'  tent at Devonshire Park blew over in winds of more than 30 m.p.h.  </P> <P> She was treated on the site.  </P> <P> The washout at the warmup for Wimbledon caused rescheduling of quarterfinal  round matches to today, with semifinal matches also on the program.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the product is unacceptable to consumers, they may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose to purchase used, traditional walkers. In this event, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of incidents addressed by a larger diameter walker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be significantly less than 82 percent_at least for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time that used, traditional walkers are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wheel-Stop Mechanisms. One manufacturer is marketing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walker with a wheel-stop mechanism which retails for around $55.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consumer can use the wheel-stop mechanism to manually retract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all eight wheels so that the walker is stationary. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer marketed a walker with an automatic wheel-stop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism, which retailed for $60&hyph;$80. This product had the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wheels arranged so that if one wheel passed over a step, a second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wheel would retract, causing the base ring to drop, grip the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor surface, and restrict further mobility of the walker. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product was discontinued due to limited sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products with wheel-stop mechanisms provide all the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and features of a traditional walker. The staff does not know how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective passive or automatically retracting wheels can be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing stair and step fall injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Walkers with Mobility Limited to a Confined Space. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer plans to introduce a new walker with limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobility in September 1994. This product is expected to retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for $80&hyph;$90 initially, with a goal of lowering the retail price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to $69 with a higher sales volume. With this walker, a child can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walk, clockwise or counter-clockwise, around the circumference of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 36 inch stationary base. The child can also rotate the seat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 360 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a patent pending on a walker with a pivot point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and control arm that converts a traditional walker into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tethered walker. A child can travel in a circle, clockwise or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counterclockwise, around the weighted central pivot point. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control arm can be adjusted to increase or decrease the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumference of the walker's path.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stationary Alternatives. A nonmobile product is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketed that retails for around $50. This product has a 28-inch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diameter saucer base and a seat that the child can bounce up and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> down and rotate 360 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;. Three legs can be lowered to stop the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rocking motion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another nonmobile product is marketed that retails for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> around $70. This product has a seat that the child can bounce up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and down and rotate 360 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Theoretically, walkers with limited mobility or stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative products could address almost all deaths and injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with walkers. With restricted mobility, a child would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have access to stairs, steps, hot surfaces, uneven floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces, or other hazards. However, mobility is a unique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic of a walker that is attractive to consumers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toddlers. Sales of traditional mobile walkers have always  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially exceeded sales of stationary products such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jumpers and bouncers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The staff does not know whether stationary alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products or walkers with limited mobility can provide levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stimulation comparable to mobile walkers. If such products are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable to consumers, they may choose to purchase used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional walkers. In this event, the percentage of incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed could be significantly less than expected_at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the period of time that used traditional walkers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Labeling and instructions. Another alternative is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling the product to warn against its hazards and providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the risks in the product's instructions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's staff is working with members of the ASTM Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Infant Walkers to revise the current labeling on baby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers. However, labeling and instructions alone are not likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adequately reduce the risk and should be used in conjunction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with product modifications, where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Voluntary standards. As noted above, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary standard in existence that would adequately reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of injury from stair falls in walkers. Even if a voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard were developed, the Commission has no basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluding that the standard would be conformed with generally by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walker manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> H. Solicitation of Information and Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This ANPR is the first step of a proceeding which could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a mandatory performance, design, or labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for baby walkers that present an unreasonable risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falling down stairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All interested persons are invited to submit to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission their comments on any aspect of the alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above. The Commission is interested in any information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the ability of stationary alternative products or walkers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with limited mobility to provide levels of stimulation comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to mobile walkers. In addition, in accordance with section 9(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the FHSA, the Commission solicits:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Written comments with respect to the risk of injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified by the Commission, the regulatory alternatives being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered, and other possible alternatives for addressing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any existing standard or portion of a standard which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be issued as a proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A statement of intention to modify or develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary standard to address the risk of injury discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this notice, along with a description of a plan (including a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule) to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

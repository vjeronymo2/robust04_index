			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>   [Text] Why has Croatian President Franjo Tudjman still not  paid a visit to Sarajevo, even though President Izetbegovic has  asked him on two occasions. Is the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] behind this? Are UNPROFOR generals preventing the  Croatian president's visit to Sarajevo and the forming of the  Croat-Bosnian federation? The question is not entirely  unfounded, and here is why. During a recent interview for  Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television, in the course of a  private, very engaging conversation, and in response to my  question why he still has not visited Sarajevo, the Croatian  president literally said: You have to ask UNPROFOR why I still  have not been to Sarajevo -- therefore, firsthand information  from the highest place in Croatia. Moreover, it is also  possible to hear the following on the Croatian political scene:  Now that they have tragically solved the fate of Gorazde,  UNPROFOR generals may be [words indistinct] and we can expect  all kinds of things from them, even the prevention of a  normalization of relations between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    However, there is yet another question to which it is  currently impossible to get an answer in Zagreb. Why has the  Croatian media published an AFP report on President  Izetbegovic's latest letter once again inviting President  Tudjman to visit Sarajevo? Why was there no public statement  from the presidential palace, which is the usual procedure? Was  the letter intended only for Dr. Tudjman's private perusal,  which is how a Croatian opposition member picturesquely  commented on this. Is it really only UNPROFOR that is  preventing Tudjman's visit to Sarajevo, or is there a lack of  goodwill in the presidential palace?</p>

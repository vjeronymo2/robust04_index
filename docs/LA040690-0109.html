			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSBURGER: CBS FIRING A 'VENDETTA';  </P> <P> TELEVISION: OUSTED ANNOUNCER TELLS ABC AUDIENCE HIS FORMER BOSSES ARE  'SPREADING VENOM.'  </P> <P> Ousted CBS sportscaster Brent Musburger told a national television audience  Thursday night that the network's decision not to renew his contract was the  result of a vendetta against him by CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and  executive producer Ted Shaker. Musburger claimed they are "spreading venom" and  out to "defame" him.  </P> <P> "They conspired to get me out of CBS," Musburger told ABC's Sam Donaldson in an  interview broadcast on "PrimeTime Live." "These two men decided I was too big  for my britches, and that they were going to take me down a peg or two, that I  was uncontrollable."  </P> <P> Reaction from CBS was muted.  </P> <P> "It was disappointing to watch," Pilson said in a statement released by the  network.  </P> <P> "I wish to remember Brent the way he was Monday night, gracious and  professional," Shaker said.  </P> <P> CBS announced Sunday it was not renewing Musburger's contract, which runs  through July. Monday's NCAA championship basketball game was his final  broadcast on the network at which he worked since 1975.  </P> <P> Musburger had sought a new contract, with his brother, Todd, handling the  negotiations.  </P> <P> "It was a sham, a setup all the way -- a charade, unethical," Musburger said.  "They led us on all the way. They sent somebody to my brother's office in  Chicago and then pulled him off. They never intended to sign me."  </P> <P> Musburger denied reports that he had sought to raise his $2-million annual  salary to $3 million. "We never got to money," he said.  </P> <P> During a 15-minute interview, Musburger spent much of his time attacking  Shaker, a five-time Emmy winner.  </P> <P> "He wants puppets for announcers," Musburger said. "He doesn't want people to  think for themselves."  </P> <P> Musburger charged that after Loyola Marymount's 62-60 victory over Alabama in  the NCAA West Regional semifinals March 23, Shaker, through a producer, told  Musburger not to mention the late Hank Gathers, the Loyola star who died March  4, on the next broadcast.  </P> <P> Shaker has worked for CBS Sports since 1978. His assignments have included  producing "The NFL Today" and CBS' NBA and NCAA tournament coverage. Musburger  has served as host or announcer for all those events.  </P> <P> Musburger had been under fire from television critics for several years for  appearing on too many events. In recent years, CBS had reduced his workload,  dropping him as the play-by-play announcer from the NBA and as the host of the  Masters golf telecasts. However, Musburger told Donaldson it was not his idea,  but requests by CBS executives that led him to broadcast more events.  </P> <P> "Frank Chirkinian (who produces and directs CBS' golf telecasts) came to me and  said we lost Vin Scully (to NBC) and needed a story-teller. 'Would you come in  and help out?' " Musburger said. "On (tennis') U.S. Open, Van Gordon Sauter  (then-CBS Sports president) said we've got to put together a half-hour show."  </P> <P> Musburger's future has been the subject of much conjecture.  </P> <P> "I'm going someplace," Musburger said. "I'll sit back and take a look at the  offers. You don't have to pay me $2 million a year."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 SANTA ANA INCUMBENTS WILL FACE 6 CHALLENGERS  </P> <P> Six candidates, including a school board member and the president of a  countywide Mexican-American women's organization, will challenge three Santa  Ana City Council members and the mayor in the upcoming November city election.  </P> <P> As the filing period closed Friday, incumbent councilman Ron May appeared to  face his toughest challenge from Robert L. Richardson, a school board member  and executive assistant to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. Santa Ana city employee  Robert Banuelos, who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1986 and 1988,  is also in the race.  </P> <P> In June, Richardson announced his candidacy by accusing Santa Ana planning  commissioner Don Sizemore, May's campaign manager, of illegally soliciting  funds for the councilman. The next day, Sizemore responded with a charge that  Richardson had failed to file certain campaign statement forms.  </P> <P> May, a Santa Ana High School teacher, represents a district that includes some  of the poorest sections of Santa Ana; one that has been plagued by overcrowding  and crime problems.  </P> <P> Richardson contends that May has not been a leader on the council in pushing  for solutions to those problems. "He's a passive participant on the council  instead of an active member," Richardson said.  </P> <P> May asserts that Richardson is a "bureaucrat" who "thinks in terms of process.  He's very methodical. But in terms of creativity, spontaneity and vision,  there's no comparison between Rob Richardson and Ron May."  </P> <P> May and Richardson say the city should enact stricter limits on neighborhood  overcrowding, while Banuelos says he wants to study the problem further before  taking a position.  </P> <P> Councilman Richards L. Norton has drawn two challengers: Irene Martinez, who  hopes to be the first Latina on the council, and attorney Glenn Mondo, who is a  member of the mayor's task force on transportation. Both challengers have never  run for public office.  </P> <P> Martinez, the president of the Mexican-American Women's National Assn. of  Orange County, is a program coordinator for a social service organization in  Santa Ana. She acknowledges that she moved from La Mirada to Santa Ana a month  ago specifically to run against Norton.  </P> <P> "People need to see they can identify themselves with someone on the council,"  Martinez said. "I'm not a politician. I'm not someone striving for power. I  work here and now live here and I see what needs to be taken care of."  </P> <P> Mondo says Norton is too combative to be an effective representative.  </P> <P> "Rick's a loner," Mondo said. "He's up there making his own proposals without  background material or coalitions. It takes more than throwing out proposals to  do a good job."  </P> <P> Norton said such a criticism "doesn't bother me. The old guard resists change  and creative ideas. I'm not part of the old guard."  </P> <P> Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr., meanwhile, faces opposition from Coween A.  Dickerson, a member of the city's cable television advisory board and a  self-employed business systems analyst.  </P> <P> Dickerson says that the city needs more police officers in its 351-member  department and fewer high-density buildings.  </P> <P> In recent months, Pulido has been under fire from the Latino rights group  Hermandad Mexicana Nacional. The group's director, Nativo V. Lopez, promised to  picket the councilman's family business weekly until the election because of a  disagreement over the distribution of city-controlled federal funds. Pulido  says the picketing now occurs only once a month.  </P> <P> Pulido says his reelection campaign will focus on neighborhood issues as well  as citywide problems such as gangs and graffiti. Over the past four years, he  has been instrumental in lobbying against placement of a new centralized jail  in Santa Ana and pushing for an anti-gang program in city schools.  </P> <P> "I've been able to bring access to City Hall," Pulido said. "When I was running  for office four years ago, it was difficult to even talk to the council. Now,  you can sit down and meet with council members."  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young, a developer who has served on the council since 1982,  faces virtually unknown challenger Richard G. Moser, an automotive engineer,  who says he plans to run a low-budget campaign.  </P> <P> Moser believes he can moderate the council better than Young. Moser also  dislikes the proposal for building a sports arena in Santa Ana and thinks the  city can better spend tax dollars elsewhere.  </P> <P> "I like him (Young) personally," Moser said. "But he's been in there a long  time and he's become part of the problem.  </P> <P> Young says he will concentrate on improving neighborhoods in the city and push  for a monorail system in the county.  </P> <P> The remaining council members -- Daniel E. Griset, Patricia A. McGuigan and  John Acosta -- are not up for election this year.  </P></p>

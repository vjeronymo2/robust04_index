Rybkin told a press conference that the actions of the  international community could not be undertaken by-passing  Russia. In this, he added, I agree with President Boris Yeltsin.    NATO has said Monday that its F-16 U.S. planes downed early  on Monday four Galeb type aircraft near Banja Luka, a city in  northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina, which were found in violation  of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The identity of the downed  planes has not been established, but the world media hurried to  claim they belonged to the Bosnian Serbs.    The authorities of the Bosnian Serbs denied these claims,  while Maj. Obaydul, who heads the UNPROFOR monitor mission at  the Banja Luka airport, the only airport the Bosnian Serb army  has, said Tuesday his team already sent to the main headquarters  three reports that there were no take-offs nor landings at the  airport, not only at the time the planes were downed but also  over the past few days in general.    The NATO action was criticized Tuesday in a statement to the  INTERFAX news agency also by a ranking Russian Defense Ministry  official. He assessed that this action was not only directed at  the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina but even more so against Russia,  and all this because it has of late achieved much success in  pacifying the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.    'The Americans have no wish to talk and behave as if the  cold  war has ended with their victory,' an unnamed Russian official  told the agency.</p>

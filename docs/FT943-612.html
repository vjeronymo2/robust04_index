			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Polish banks plan cross shareholding venture Two large Polish banks yesterday announced plans to purchase cross shareholdings as part of the continuing consolidation of the sector inspired by the government's bank disposal programme. Under the agreement, the state-owned PowszechnyBank Kredytowy, based in Warsaw, is to increase its 8.5 per cent stake in the private Kredyt Bank to between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the bank's equity following a new share issue. Meanwhile, the Kredyt Bank, founded four years ago, has pledged to buy up to 25 per cent of the PBK's equity when it is privatised. The PBK which is capitalised at 3,975bn zlotys (Dollars 176m) is Poland's second largest bank and one of the nine commercial banks hived off from the central bank in 1989. Two of these have since been privatised and a third, Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH), based in Krakow, is to be sold later this year. The remaining six are to be sold off by the end of 1996. The PBK said yesterday the move formed 'the basis for establishing a strong Polish financial group able to compete with foreign banks which are becoming increasingly active in the domestic market'. The Kredyt Bank, which floated its shares on the Warsaw stock exchange earlier this year, is capitalised at 1,011bn zlotys. The PBK share purchase would come out of a planned new stock issue of between 3m and 11m shares with the Kredyt Bank's strategic partner pledged to buy between 1.9m and 4.4m shares. Kredyt Bank has 11.4m shares priced at 137,000 zlotys each. After six months of this year the PBK reported a net profit of 1,532.8bn zlotys on a balance sheet worth 46,602.1bn zlotys while the Kredyt Bank's net profit reached 81.6bn zlotys on a balance sheet worth 6,304.3bn zlotys.</p>

			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Devaluation pressures lead to different effects RENEWED currency tension and the possibility of devaluation had different effects on continental bourses last week. Swedish equities soared after Sweden abandoned efforts to peg the krona to the European currency unit, but other markets fell as their currencies came under pressure. According to FT-A World indices, Stockholm jumped 16.3 per cent in local currency terms on the week as investors bought the market's international blue chips in the hope of improved competitiveness and currency translation effects. But the market only rose by 2.2 per cent in dollar terms , reflecting the effective devaluation of the krona against its major trading partners. Sweden has had plenty of experience in using devaluation, particularly in the early 1980s; the beneficial effect on the stock market, therefore, is widely known. Unibors Securities notes that when the krona was devalued by 16 per cent in October 1982, the return on the Affarsvarlden general index over the next 12 months was 107 per cent, with the forestry index benefiting the most with a return of 141 per cent, followed by the capital goods index with 117 per cent. Mr Henrik Breum at Unibors does not expect the same kind of return following last week's devaluation, due to the weak position of both the domestic and the US economies. However, he believes that the Affarsvarlden general index could reach 950 over the next six months from its current 844.9, and reach 1,000 on a 12-month view. Equities in neighbouring Norway jumped by 7.3 per cent in local currency terms (but by a more moderate 6 per cent measured in dollars) on hopes that Norway would also be forced to devalue its currency. Spain, up 6 per cent in local currency terms in the wake of better-than-expected inflation data for October, was also seen as a candidate for devaluation last week. This duly occured over the weekend when the peseta was devalued by 6 per cent along with the Portuguese escudo. Goldman Sachs says that while the gains for Spanish equities in the way of export or translation effects are relatively small, the realignment would probably attract foreign investors and trigger a correction in what it considers to be an undervalued market. However, fears that their currencies would also come into the firing line contributed to the 3.6 per cent decline (5.6 per cent in dollars) in France and the 3.6 per cent local currency fall (6.3 per cent in dollars) in Denmark. The fall in France also reflected a belief that interest rates are unlikely to to fall further for some time, as well as disappointment with the recent nine-months results season. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Securities says that investors are preoccupied with four themes: a cut in rates, the recovery in the dollar, the parliamentary election next March and a new government's privatisation candidates. Furthermore, a number of company chairmen have cautioned that 1993 may remain difficult. By far the greatest faller on the week was Hong Kong which dropped 8.2 per cent in local currency terms following China's sharp rebuttal of Governor Chris Patten's call for political reforms in the colony. Hoare Govett does not expect an early easing in the political friction and adds that uncertainty remains in the forefront of market sentiment. However, the broker believes that the resulting volatility may provide some excellent buying opportunities, since corporate fundamentals remain sound, with EPS growth forecasts of 24 per cent this year and 19 per cent next. The fluctuations in Sweden and Hong Kong failed to have much impact on regional aggregates last week, with Europe up 0.4 per cent and , the Pacific Basin up by 0.1 per cent. The FT-A World index rose 1.1 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change    % change in               % change in local currency**       sterling** US Dollars**              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                           1992      1992        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +1.94    -2.30    -19.26   -10.75    +4.70       -14.92 Belgium       +1.00    +2.19     -0.30    -0.60   +16.53        -5.29 Denmark       -3.55    +6.23    -27.45   -25.07   -12.11       -28.57 Finland       -2.31   +11.27     -6.02    +4.74    +4.61       -15.00 France        -3.64    -1.75     -2.21    -2.25   +15.54        -6.10 Germany       -0.34    +0.72     -7.66    -5.17   +11.09        -9.72 Ireland       +1.69    -1.99    -21.39   -20.24    -7.24       -24.62 Italy         -0.95   +10.19     -6.49    -6.00    -3.41       -21.50 Netherlands   -0.45    -0.41     +1.46    +2.87   +20.69        -1.92 Norway        +7.32    +3.84    -18.95   -15.61    -4.00       -21.98 Spain         +5.99    +7.11    -12.82   -12.72    -8.94       -26.00 Sweden       +16.26   +16.19     +6.98    +7.42    +9.27       -11.20 Switzerland   -2.12    -1.68     +8.47   +10.25   +28.37        +4.31 UK            +1.25    +2.56     +9.65    +9.60    +9.60       -10.93 EUROPE        +0.37    +2.03     +1.34    +2.09   +10.55       -10.16 Australia     +3.21    -4.10    -16.56   -17.38    -8.40       -25.56 Hong Kong     -8.23    -7.91    +36.45   +33.97   +65.77       +34.71 Japan         +2.85    -0.85    -26.32   -24.52    -6.52       -24.02 Malaysia      -1.57    +6.28    +24.53   +19.93   +59.13       +29.32 New Zealand   +4.19    +6.18     -8.02   -11.76    +3.52       -15.86 Singapore     -3.44    +5.85     -7.96   -11.11    +8.34       -11.95 Canada        -0.08    +0.44     -8.92    -8.44    +2.00       -17.11 USA           +1.02    +3.24    +13.27    +2.70   +26.37        +2.70 Mexico        +0.53    +5.49    +18.86   +11.98   +34.60        +9.39 South Africa  +0.03    -0.43    -15.79   -15.47   -33.10       -45.64 WORLD INDEX   +1.13    +1.54     -3.57    -6.21   +11.15        -9.67  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on November 20th 1992.

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Piper Alpha action outlined OCCIDENTAL, operator of the Piper Alpha oil platform, yesterday denied that it was suing any survivor of the disaster that killed 167 men in July 1988. It confirmed that it had started legal action against contractor companies, in accordance with indemnity obligations common in North Sea operations at the time of the accident. A lawyer for the contractors said they were defending the actions and would argue that the indemnity was invalid and did not apply in the circumstances. The cases are due to be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh next March.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: CODERCARD GOVERNMENT DIVISION CHIEF FIRED 1 WEEK AFTER BOSTON DEAL  FAILS  </P> <P> Codercard Inc. said Monday that it has fired the head of its federal government  business operations because of "irreconcilable differences."  </P> <P> The Santa Ana developer of computer security systems said that Robert J. Gray  was fired Friday and that no permanent successor has been named.  </P> <P> Willis Marsing, Codercard vice president and manager of operations, will  temporarily assume Gray's duties.  </P> <P> When contacted Monday, Marsing declined to provide further details about Gray's  departure.  </P> <P> Gray joined Codercard in 1985.  </P> <P> The company is searching "for a qualified manager with experience in computer  security (who) will be acceptable to our management as well as our customers  within the federal government," Marsing said.  </P> <P> Gray's firing followed Codercard's announcement Wednesday that its discussions  with a Boston venture-capital company, concerning a $3-million financing  package, have fallen through. The Bank House Exchange suspended talks with  Codercard because its corporate and marketing structures did not meet the  Boston firm's requirements.  </P> <P> Marsing declined to comment on whether the financing problems and Gray's  departure are related.  </P> <P> Codercard has developed and is trying to market a computer security device that  uses a plastic card with an embedded microchip that prevents unauthorized users  from gaining access to computers.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana firm has been concentrating on selling its device to the federal  government but has so far been unable to land any government contracts.

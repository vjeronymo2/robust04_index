			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK OKS INCREASES IN CITY FEES  </P> <P> Despite continuing objections from representatives of the city's business  community, the City Council has given final approval to across-the-board  increases of fees for services, including business licenses, library use and  tennis lessons.  </P> <P> The 4-1 vote last Monday reflected the same breakdown as when the council last  month tentatively approved the fee increases. City officials said the increases  will generate an additional $1.2 million in revenues each year.  </P> <P> This additional money, city officials said, will be used to make up a shortfall  in the general fund budget. (On Tuesday night, the council gave final approval  to a $16.8-million general fund budget for the coming fiscal year, which  represents $4 million in cuts from this year's budget.)  </P> <P> But Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, the lone dissenting vote each time on  the fee increases, maintains that the council should have taken more time with  this "very, very complicated problem."  </P> <P> One of his main complaints, he said, centers on city officials' failure to  involve members of the business community as well as a broad, cross section of  residents in the decision-making process. The city, he said, should have put  together a blue-ribbon committee.  </P> <P> Barbara Rossman, incoming vice president of the Monterey Park Chamber of  Commerce, said she wished that city officials had given notice earlier that the  fees might be increased. "The business community just wanted to have more of a  voice in this," said Rossman, a promotion manager for AT &amp; T in Monterey  Park.  </P> <P> She additionally questioned the soundness of the utility tax on interstate and  overseas business phone calls. Merchants also had registered their complaints  about increases in the hotel and motel room tax and the installation of parking  meters.  </P> <P> However, Mayor Barry L. Hatch, referring to all of the increases, said "the  fees are very fair." He noted that many had not been increased in eight to 10  years.  </P> <P> He did acknowledge a communication problem among city officials, council  members and the business community.  </P> <P> "But rather than to put up fences, we need to start fresh. We need to work  together and make it one community. We could have perhaps made more of an  effort to contact (business leaders) earlier," he said.  </P></p>

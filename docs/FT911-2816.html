			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / How To Spend It: Drapes with a touch less debt IF YOU HAVE tried to order custom-made curtains recently you will know that they command the kind of prices that once attached to family heirlooms. Apart from the cost of the fabric, curtain-making has come to be regarded as a contemporary art-form with swags and drapes, buttons and bows all being invested with a certain esoteric mystique. If you can't pay such prices, what other options are there? Well, you could try making them yourself - KLC, 5 Blythe Mews, Blythe Road, London W14 tel: 071-602-8592 remember, runs excellent classes - or you could buy them second-hand. Fashionable interior decorators have been buying second-hand curtains for years - usually from grand houses in the grandest of grand fabrics  - not because their clients couldn't afford new ones but because they preferred them old and slightly faded. All the auction houses regularly hold sales of old textiles but it is a haphazard business hoping for something suitable to turn up. A much more regular source of second-hand curtains, some grand, some not so grand, is The Curtain Exchange, which was started by Liz Meston, Juliana Galvin and Jackie Horsford. What is available on a given day depends on what customers have brought in but it could be anything from cheerful gingham to chintzy Colefax &amp; Fowler. Most looked to be professionally made - some are curtains that didn't fit in to new colour schemes or didn't fit into a new house, others were designers or decorators' 'mistakes' and yet more came from show flats and exhibitions. The prices seemed a fraction of the newly-made price. Those who want to sell their own cast-offs can take them along in person or, if within a reasonable distance, the shops will collect. If The Curtain Exchange agrees to sell them the client gets 40 per cent of the selling price once they are sold. There are three shops: 133, Stephendale Road, London SW6 (Tel: 071-731-8316); 19 Stone Street, Boxford. Nr. Colchester, Essex CO6 5NR. (Tel: 0787-211065); and Townsend, Poulshot, Nr. Devizes, Wilts. SN1 OSD. (Tel: 0380-828008). The Egyptian Hall in London's Mansion House is about to be closed for four years for a make-over, but on Wednesday May 1 there is a last opportunity to see it when there is a May Day Fair in aid of the Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund. The tickets cost Pounds 20 per person which includes a salmon, salad and wine lunch if you choose the first reception (11 am to 3.30 pm) or canapes, a whisky tasting and wine if you choose the evening session (5.30 pm to 8.00 pm). It's also a chance to buy presents (splendid men's shirts, foods, women's clothing) from a big selection of attractive stalls - anything from a water colour to a piece of antique jewellery. The Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund helps care for and support people with cancer, primarily by funding Macmillan nurses to look after patients either at home or in special units. For tickets, ring Henrietta Gordon Lennox on 071-352-3291.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Fears on N-plant safety: Nuclear watchdog questions Sizewell B computer systems NUCLEAR ELECTRIC has been asked to consider strengthening the back-up safety system at Sizewell B, Britain's most advanced nuclear reactor, after fears over the principal computer-controlled safety system. The state-owned power generator, intended Sizewell B in Suffolk to be the first UK nuclear power station to rely on a computer-controlled primary system to detect faults and shut the reactor down if necessary. The station is due for completion in 1994. But the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, part of the government's health and safety executive, has asked Nuclear Electric to examine extending its back-up system, which is not computer-controlled, so that it could also carry out the functions of the main system. Nuclear Electric said last night that the back-up system at Sizewell, which will be the UK's first pressurised water reactor, operated on the same principle as those used at existing nuclear stations. The computer-controlled primary system was an additional safeguard aimed at protecting against more remote risks. The company said that human operators would be able to override the computer-controlled system and shut down the plant at any stage if they suspected a fault. The computer would prevent them only from taking action that would compromise the plant's safety. Today's Computer Weekly magazine reports that the inspectorate asked Nuclear Electric to consider increasing the scope of its back-up safety system at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations at Sizewell last month. Nuclear Electric said yesterday that the costs of extending the secondary safety system at Sizewell would be considerable. The costs have already risen from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 2bn. Nuclear Electric said the NII had said it would license the Sizewell B plant without extending the secondary system if the company could substantiate the validation tests it was performing on the computer-controlled system. Radioactive waste should not pose a serious health risk to more than one person in 100,000 per year, according to new objectives laid down by the National Radiological Protection Board, David Lascelles writes. The board also said that future generations should not be exposed to any risks which would be considered unacceptable today.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM RETAIL PROJECT WILL INCLUDE HOUSING  </P> <P> Ground breaking is set for spring 1990 on Lincoln Village, a $40-million,  21-acre mixed housing and retail project that will provide 388 housing units in  downtown Anaheim.  </P> <P> The variety of uses in the project are designed to encourage downtown workers  to live near the downtown businesses district.  </P> <P> Architect for the retail and apartment properties is Klages, Carter, Vail &amp;  Partners. Architect Michael McHale is designing the single-family, duplex and  townhouse properties.  </P> <P> Lincoln Property, the contractor, will also serve as property manager.  </P> <P> The project was developed by Lincoln with the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency. The  agreement between the city and the developer requires the developer to give  priority to the purchase or lease of housing units to individuals employed in  downtown Anaheim.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easing Traffic Congestion  </P> <P> The requirement is intended to ease traffic congestion in the downtown area by  encouraging pedestrian traffic.  </P> <P> Housing types incorporated in the project include single-family detached homes,  duplexes, townhouses and rental units, and a combination of retail and rental  units.  </P> <P> Lisa Stipkovich, Anaheim's director of community development, said Lincoln  Village is intended to add to the mix of retail, residential and civic uses  downtown.  </P> <P> Eventually, the project will be linked to other downtown sites by a planned  vehicular- and pedestrian-oriented esplanade that will extend from Harbor Place  east past the Civic Center and along Center Street.  </P> <P> "The architectural style shows a sensitivity to the surrounding neighborhoods,"  Stipkovich said. "We hope this new development will encourage continuing  restoration of homes in the original Craftsman style."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Completion Estimates  </P> <P> The project will be developed in one phase, and construction of the for-sale  properties properties is expected to be completed six months after ground  breaking. Rental properties will be completed in 15 months.  </P> <P> Scott Davis, partner with Lincoln Property Co., said rents will range from an  estimated $725 for one-bedroom, one-bath units to $875 for two-bedroom,  two-bath units.  </P> <P> Single-family homes will range from 1,500 to 1,900 square feet and sell for  $183,500 to $221,500. Sales prices for duplexes and townhouses, ranging in size  from 1,250 to 1,600 square feet, are estimated at $156,500 to $178,700.  </P> <P> Commercial retail rents are projected at $1 a square foot.  </P> <P> The area being developed as single-family homes and duplexes is on the north  side of Lincoln Avenue to Cypress Street on the north, and includes townhouse  units south of Center Street, between Olive and Atchison streets.  </P> <P> Mixed apartment and commercial development will be located in the area bounded  by Lincoln Avenue, Olive, Center and Philadelphia streets.  </P></p>

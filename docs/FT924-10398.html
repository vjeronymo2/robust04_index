			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Age-old question - in or out of Serps? EARLIER this year the Financial Times paper repeated what I have heard before, namely that women over 40 and men over 45 are better off opting back into Serps. I took this up with my financial advisers but they say the FT is working from the wrong premise and that the ages are 46 and 53 for women and men respectively. The article was merely quoting the opinion of one actuary in one insurance company on the optimum ages for contracting-out. As your adviser has explained there are differences of view based on the method used. There are other considerations such as the nature of your own arrangement. Some schemes provide better benefits than others. There is also a political risk in Serps. It has been cut once and the escalating cost to Government of providing future Serps benefits without corresponding increase in revenue (it is pay as you go) could well lead to further cut backs. If you are already in a good scheme of your own there is a strong case for keeping it going. You are building up a fund of real money which many experts believe will provide a more secure guarantee of future income than paper promises from the state which can be altered by any future Government in a tight financial corner. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

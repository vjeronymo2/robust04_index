			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Case for new budget procedure BY PROPOSING a Budget covering both expenditure and revenue, the chancellor is, as he claimed, replacing a system that is 'not only illogical', but 'also had a number of highly undesirable consequences'. He promptly proved himself to be absolutely right. If this had been one of the proposed December budgets, with the 'more informed and focused debate' mentioned in the accompanying White Paper, Mr Lamont might have been warned off his new lower rate band of 20p. This year, as it happens, the election stands in the way instead. The peculiar British practice of presenting two half-budgets a year - one, covering spending, in the autumn, the second, covering revenue, in the spring - is a relatively recent innovation. It was the result of a change that was itself desirable: the publication of plans for public spending well before Budget day. What the chancellor proposes is to bring the two together once more, this time in December. This would provide all the advantages laid out in the White Paper: better decision-making; improved presentation; more informed debate; and better planning for taxpayers. The main point is that tax proposals would come three months earlier. This would have three main effects. Modifications could be made in the course of parliamentary debate without, as now, requiring changes in fiscal policy after the beginning of the financial year. Lobbies would have a longer period to mobilise against proposed changes, but this potential disadvantage should be offset by the benefits of more open government. Policy would be made in greater ignorance of the fiscal out-turn for the current year. Real advantage The last of these, far from a disadvantage, could be a real advantage. By making macroeconomic fine-tuning still less credible, the focus would fall on the proposed fiscal structure, precisely where it should fall. If one wanted an argument for a longer period of reflection, one need look no further than the proposed lower rate band of 20p. If the government wishes to offer the flattery of imitation, it should restrict itself to Labour's good ideas, not its bad ones. For most taxpayers the value of the lower rate of tax will be Pounds 100 (5 per cent of Pounds 2,000), but for those who fall within the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income it is less. For the same cost, the chancellor could have increased the personal allowance by enough to give Pounds 92.50 to all basic rate tax payers, including those who fall within the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Taxpayers' headache The 4m people who fall within the new band will also now have to reclaim the difference between the new lower rate of tax and the basic rate on their investment income. The main result, apart from headaches for taxpayers, will be 800 additional jobs in the Inland Revenue. What then of incentives? Roughly half of those on the new marginal rate are pensioners, for whom incentive effects are largely irrelevant. Those on family credit will face a marginal tax rate only 1 1/2 percentage points lower, because their benefits are calculated on a net of tax basis. Even for those not on benefits, a change of 5p in the pound in the marginal rate of tax will not represent a noteworthy change in incentives. The chancellor also presented the new lower rate as a step on the path towards a 20p basic rate. But the basic rate of tax is not a significant distortion. Moreover, given the deteriorating fiscal position, tax increases, not cuts, may soon be required. Finally, the greater simplicity and transparency that have resulted from reduction in the number of tax bands are major benefits of the reforms under previous chancellors. To throw this away for political advantage must be foolish. On the lower tax rate, Mr Lamont may prove to have been too clever by half. But the new budgetary timetable should endure. If so, Mr Lamont's procedural reform will still be remembered long after the main feature of his budget is deservedly forgotten.</p>

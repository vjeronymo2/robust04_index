			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANYON'S DEFENSE STYMIES FOOTHILL FOR A 12-3 VICTORY  </P> <P> Canyon's Darren Lish threw a pair of second-half touchdown passes to George  Garcia to lead the Comanches to a 12-3 victory over Foothill in the Century  League opener for both teams Friday at Tustin High School.  </P> <P> Canyon's offense sputtered in the first half, gaining only three first downs  and committing three turnovers.  </P> <P> But the Comanche defense held Foothill scoreless until it surrendered a 26-yard  field goal by Keo Powell with 33 seconds left in the half.  </P> <P> "I told our kids that everything that could have gone wrong for us in the first  half did go wrong and we were only down three," Canyon Coach Loren Shumer said.  </P> <P> And the offense did get it together. Canyon (3-3 overall, 1-0 in league), after  forcing Foothill (1-5, 0-1) to punt, took the ball at the Knights' 37. Lish hit  Jeff Brunswig for a 54-yard completion that set up a Canyon first-and-goal at  the nine. A holding play pushed the ball back to the 19, but two plays later  Lish threw 16 yards to Garcia for the score. Greg Lawrence's extra-point  attempt hit the crossbar and bounced back, making the score 6-3.  </P> <P> The Canyon defense forced another Foothill punt, giving the Comanches the ball  at their own 41. Brunswig did most of the work for Canyon as he carried four  times for 39 yards on the nine-play drive. Garcia capped it when he caught a  21-yard pass from Lish. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bowing to the new orthodoxy - The Conservative Euro-Sceptics THE Conservative minister was quite definite. 'There is a peasants' revolt taking place across the Continent,' he said. 'What is more, for every doubter on the back benches, there is another in the government. Euro-scepticism is the new orthodoxy.' As the prime minister flew into the sublimely irrelevant Colombian capital of Bogota yesterday, he left behind him a party rank and file openly plotting rebellion and confident that many cabinet ministers are wishing them well. All eyes are now on an embattled government or, more specifically, on Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr John Major, architects and chief advocates of a treaty that now straddles a political fault line down the centre of the party. But with the party leadership all but frozen by the political and diplomatic hurdles at home and abroad, the initiative, for once, lies with the opponents of any ratification of the treaty. These are believed to include at least six junior ministers, along with Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary. Other rightwingers such as Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, are at the very best 'don't knows' on how Britain should proceed in the European Community's presidency. Not a single cabinet heavyweight has yet spoken up loudly for the official steady-as-she-goes line. Meanwhile, Mr Hurd himself - only six months ago Britain's newest statesman hero - is increasingly being characterised as a stooge of Europhile civil servants, loftily out of touch with sentiments in the party and the country. 'Douglas made a fundamental error when he argued for ratification,' a colleague said. 'At the very least, he could have talked about fine-tuning.' So close to a famous election victory, the parliamentary Conservative party is a long way from issuing a humiliating rebuke to its leadership. Yet yesterday, an inner circle of backbench MPs met in Westminster to draw up a plan of action to halt the Maastricht bill, now shelved until autumn. Furthermore, some wiser and greyer backbench heads have signalled their readiness to oppose. As Mr George Walden, the intellectual MP for Buckingham, wrote yesterday the party must now move away from the treaty as a united body or risk 'a rift far deeper than anything that has been seen up until now.' He added: 'It would be a fundamental mistake to believe that, once the Community has engineered some arrangement for the Danes, ratification can proceed in the Commons and that the Conservative party will toe the line as it nothing has happened. It won't' Mr Major, ever an advocate of the long game, must be well aware of that. Equally, he must be more than conscious that every twitch of the British body politic, soon to take up the EC presidency, will be being relayed by teams of diplomats back to the capitals of the UK's European partners. That is to his advantage. In any future negotiation, he can warn his European colleagues that it is not merely the Danes who need to be mollified. Already, some senior Tories are counselling that a British presidency can justifiably demand that Brussels devolves powers back to member states as an act of contrition for its arrogance - an abuse of power, they claim, that provoked a Continent-wide backlash. Yet none of that resolves the UK government's two-tier conundrum: how to resolve the international impasse and hold the party together at home. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, made clear yesterday that the government could expect no help from the opposition benches. Labour's price for supporting the government - a British signature to the social chapter of the Maastricht agreement from which the government took pains to opt out - is unpayable. The view of tougher Tory Euro-sceptics is that the government must seize on Danish obduracy to insist on a full renegotiation of the treaty. Moderates recognise this may be impossible, but will require at the very least some form of words imposing enforceable checks and balances on the Brussels bureaucrats. But will that be enough to keep the party at least sufficiently united to see off a Labour alliance with Conservative backbench rebels? With no obvious routes ahead, the ever-cautious Mr Major may well decide to use his EC presidency simply to pose his quandary to his European colleagues  -themselves equally lost in the post-Maastricht maze. Armed with the goodwill gleaned from his pro-Maastricht stance, honest John as honest broker is an unhurried act he may find tempting to play.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F> Laurent Maudit; place and date not given: "No Panic, Recovery  Is Solid"]    [Text] It was a tough week on the financial markets.  Following setbacks on the stock exchanges at the beginning of  the week, the dollar experienced a sudden plunge until the  situation was reestablished on most markets yesterday. Economy  Minister Edmond Alphandery draws here the lessons from these  successive jolts. He replies in passing to businessmen who are  requesting further measures to bolster economic activity.    [Maudit] Were you in a cold sweat this past week?    [Alphandery] No, not really. Now that things have started  going better, now that the real economy is picking up, and the  international environment is improving, we must keep cool and  not give too much importance to financial movements that were  clearly amplified by exaggerated psychological reactions.    [Maudit] You speak as if no serious jolts had been  experienced this week on the market.    [Alphandery] Of course there have been. There was some  turbulence. But it will be overcome because the basic economic  trends are positive. Recovery is being confirmed in Europe.  Japanese plans to boost the economy are beginning to have  effect, beyond expectations. Finally, the American economy is  still growing, though more slowly than before. The good news is  that the three great locomotives of the world economy are now  pulling again in the same direction. What is more -- and this  had not happened for a long time -- they are doing so  synchronously. This is why I feel calm.    [Maudit] However, the drop of the dollar is rather worrying.    [Alphandery] This is an exaggeration. It is true, however,  that the dollar has dropped considerably, which has given rise  to certain questions being posed in the United States, Japan,  and Europe. No doubt, this weakness partly explains the recent  tensions over long- term interest rates. But I am not worried  about the future, because I believe that economic reality will  prevail.    [Maudit] So you remain an optimist, despite and against  everything?    [Alphandery] Not an optimist, but rather, cool-headed. There  are as many explanations for the dollar's drop as there are  economists. Nevertheless, two major factors are often  pinpointed to explain this trend. To begin with, the U.S. trade  deficit, which this year may amount to as much as $150 billion  (more than 820 billion French francs). Second, there are fears  that inflation may reappear in the United States. In both  cases, we should not overestimate the dangers involved. With  recovery under way in Europe and Japan, America's deficit should  gradually decrease. Besides, I agree with Federal Reserve  chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen, with whom I had long conversations this week, in  believing that there is no risk of inflation getting out of  control. I am therefore convinced that the markets over-reacted  in the short term -- as they often do -- and that the situation  will develop favorably.    [Maudit] Are you also minimizing the importance of the stock  exchange crisis?    [Alphandery] I am not minimizing anything. I am simply  saying that when long-term interest rates tend to increase, they  necessarily have an impact on the stock markets. However, I see  no reason why long-term interest rates should continue to remain  high in European countries overall. In fact, we began to  observe an easing up by midweek. It is only natural: There is  no risk of inflation; the economy is healthy and there is a  strong savings base to finance investment.    [Maudit] So why did the stock exchange plunge? Are the  markets blind?    [Alphandery] They sometimes amplify the movements, but they  are not blind. This is why I would not be surprised if the  stock exchange bounces back up again. Let me tell you, on the  other hand, that according to a study conducted by the "Associes  en Finance" [Financial Partners] research institute on the main  companies quoted on the Paris stock exchange, CAC 40 [Paris  Stock Exchange index] companies may well see their profits  increase by 31.2 percent this year. In 1995, they may even  surpass the record levels achieved in 1989.    [Maudit] Do you not feel that the markets are particularly  concerned about the situation in France? Is this because of the  problems with public finances, or because of political  uncertainties?    [Alphandery] I do not share this feeling in the least. For a  very simple reason: In the field of the government deficit, 15  months ago we opted for a very clear line -- namely,  restructuring. In particular, although nobody was forcing us to  do so, we drafted a five-year law setting our objectives with  regard to reducing the public deficit. Everybody knows this:  France has now taken the management of its deficit in hand    [Maudit] Nothing, then, is likely to hamper economic  recovery?    [Alphandery] I do not think so. If you look at the latest  indicator available to us -- namely, the consumption of  manufactured products -- the May results are of course not quite  as good as the exceptionally high April results, but they are  better than the results obtained in March. The underlying trend  is therefore positive. Overall, I believe the growth rate of  economic activity in the second quarter will be higher than in  the first quarter, which leads me to confirm my expectation that  our 1.4-percent growth forecast will be surpassed this year.    [Maudit] This outlook is not shared at all by employers, who  believe recovery is rather too slow and are requesting further  measures to boost economic activity.    [Alphandery] It would be best to ask employers individually  what they think about the situation. I meet many of them in the  field who tell me that things are definitely getting better. I  believe that when the figures for the second quarter are  published, everybody will be able to realize that this is in  fact the case. What satisfies me most is the fact that we are  getting quicker results than expected with regard to the  employment situation. We are getting there: The French economy  is again creating jobs. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached  the stage where we can absorb the number of new arrivals on the  labor market, but let us be patient, we will eventually get  there! I do not believe I have misled anybody through my  forecasts so far.    [Maudit] Is there no need, then, for the further support  measures demanded by employers?    [Alphandery] You know, I am sure, that I pay a lot of  attention to this issue. For example, early in the year I felt  it was necessary to bolster the automobile industry. The  economy was recovering, but not in this particular sector. We  therefore advocated support measures for the car industry, and  these measures achieved the expected aim.    [Maudit] So, are you basically telling employers that there  will be no new measures?    [Alphandery] Future measures to consolidate growth? Such  measures have already been planned and will take effect in the  second half of 1994. They will include, in particular,  increased financial allowances for students returning to school  after the summer vacation. In addition, thanks to a more  buoyant European environment, demand for French products will  continue to increase. The CNPF [National Council of French  Employers] can therefore say what it likes, there are no dark  clouds on the horizon.</p>

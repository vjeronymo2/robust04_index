			<p>BFN     [Text] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of  Croatia, held talks with Charles Redman, the U.S. President's  special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, and U.S. Ambassador to  Croatia Peter Galbraith in the Presidential Palace in Zagreb  this evening.    They exchanged opinions on the political and economic  situation in Croatia and the peace process in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked if they had discussed the territorial  division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereby the Croat-Bosniak  Federation would be given 51 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent, the Croatian president said that  is the only reasonable solution.    Redman said that they had discussed the division only in  general terms, while President Tudjman was informed about what  is being attempted by the contact group and with ministers [as  heard]. We are not at the stage where we can propose anything,  Redman stressed, but we are working hard at it.</p>

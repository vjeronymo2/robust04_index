			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: String quartets - Goldsmiths' Hall The contest that since 1979 has been held at three-year intervals in Portsmouth has now shifted northeast, to become the London International String Quartet Competition. The final round took place on Sunday, when five competing young quartets remained. Since Beethoven was prescribed for this round, and each team had had to declare a choice long before, we heard opus 95 and the First 'Rasumovsky' twice each. In the event, the order in which the teams appeared was an uncanny match for what proved to be the winning order in reverse, almost as if someone had pre-guessed the result. (The sole discrepancy lay in programming the second and third prizewinners the wrong way round). This year none of the British or German ensembles had reached the finals, nor the Italian one nor the French. Of several USSR teams only the Moscow-based Russo Quartet came through, but the notably large American contingent supplied three challengers. Like the Russian quartet (and the Werethina Quartet from Germany, whom we didn't hear but who won the Artistic Director Yehudi Menuhin's special prize for promise) the Americans are all led by women - and every member of the Lark Quartet from LA is female. It was the Czech all-male Wihan Quartet, however, who won, playing the second First 'Rasumovsky'. On the strength of what we heard they seemed a fair enough choice, though it was faintly surprising to hear it reported as 'unanimous' among the 11 judges: evidently this year has enjoyed a strong field, and all the quartet-finalists merited keen attention. No doubt the earlier rounds made the difference. The Lark Quartet took second prize, but performed like the other American teams before the interval. After it we heard the Russians (third prize) and the Czechs, which threw an intriguing point into sharp relief. Every American quartet shared a collective rhythmic impulse, strongly theatrical, which neither of the Eastern ensembles sustained: in both their performances there were momentary disorders that betrayed failures to listen to each other. What distinguished the Wihan players was their cultured address, judiciously weighted note-by-note and productive of beautiful effects in their 'Rasumovsky' middle-movements; beautifully taught, certainly. Yet their opening Allegro was staid, and Beethoven's teasing string of mock-closes in the Finale po-faced and tedious. On the other hand, in that same op. 59 no. 1 the Lark players had been so light and speedy, with plenty of bright ideas and some fetchingly lyrical playing, as to jettison some of the robust gravity of the work. In Beethoven's F minor quartet op. 95 - the other direct comparison here - the hell-for-leather intensity of the Miami Quartet (fourth prize) rode roughshod over some details, but it was more faithful to the drama of the work than the earnest Russo Quartet ever were, despite their big, satisfying sound and well-honed rhetoric. In the Scherzo their dotted-note rhythms were slack and casual, a fault one doesn't expect from the Russian school. The odd Beethoven out was the Third 'Rasumovsky' in C, with which the Fidelio Quartet (Florida and California: fifth prize) began this final contest. Many lively, fluent ideas, but no firm grasp of the larger structure, opaque and knotty as it is - until their brilliantly risky, all-in-one-breath Finale. It would be comforting to believe that the well-taught Wihan and Russo Quartets may one day try on risks like that.</p>

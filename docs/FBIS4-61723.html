			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko on interview with </F> Ukraine President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk by various  unidentified correspondents in Kiev on 6 May; Kravchuk remarks  recorded]    [Excerpts] The president of Ukraine was asked many  questions, touching on various aspects of the political,  cultural, and social situation in Ukraine, our state's mutual  relations with Russia, the world and European communities, the  processes of nuclear disarmament in Ukraine, and so on. Next  week, Leonid Makarovych was asked, Ukraine's new parliament will  begin work, and you are intending to make an initiative to  postpone the June preterm presidential elections. Has this  initiative already been fully prepared, or will it require some  explanations of your standpoint? This is the Ukrainian  president's reply:    [Kravchuk] Not only how we will elect a president, but also  what people, and with what powers, and what power we will form.  This is a fundamental position. They say we have the law on the  president [words indistinct], and that the president's status is  determined. I am not saying that [word indistinct]. But in  this case, all structures, all the way down to village council,  should be compatible with each other.    For example, if there is the president in Kiev with his  present powers, that is, he is the head of the state and the  executive power, while oblasts will have parliamentary  structures -- which is actually the case, because according to  the adopted law on formation of the power, it is purely a  parliamentary structure -- then we have the president in Kiev,  but without leverage and structures in the provinces.  Therefore, one should change either the adopted laws or the law  on the president. That is, the draft constitution says that the  president is the head of state with certain powers, so we should  coordinate these two laws: the law on the president and the law  on forming self-governing and [word indistinct] power structures.    There are no ambitions here. One just has to do it. If one  doesn't, then the executive structures will be ruined after the  elections. No vertical chain of command is envisioned. The  adopted law does not so much as mention the president, if you  read it carefully. At some point, it only says that state  functions will be delegated to local government institutions,  and that in this respect they will be answerable to the Cabinet  of Ministers, but not to the president.    In other words, when this law was examined by the Supreme  Council, there was a revolutionary hatred for the president, and  one could already feel that the president is not necessary as  such and that his powers should be reduced, if any remain, to  those of a representative figure. At present, however, things  are different. So, this is why I say: let us bring everything  down to a logical structure, changing either this or that. Then  one could go to the elections.    As for my position, why exactly I decided to run in the  presidential elections. First, it is everyone's right to make  such a decision, and it is not prohibited either by the  constitution or by the law. Second, I began to be accused of  supposedly opposing elections because I was said to be afraid of  elections, and this idea has now gone spread through the  country. Thus, in the present case I am going to speak in favor  of canceling the elections (?at the level of) [words  indistinct], who has decided to run as candidate for president.    These are the main points, but there are also other ones. I  just want us to make a responsible decision based on democratic  principles. Why am I turning to the Supreme Council? But who  else if not the newly elected Supreme Council can today resolve  those issues? Can the new Supreme Council avoid reforming the  power, the political reform in Ukraine? It cannot. This is its  obligation, responsibility, and right. It is normal when the  newly elected parliament initiates a relevant action based [word  indistinct] on the law, order, and constitution.    [Naumenko] The president of Ukraine was asked to explain  the situation connected to the forthcoming visit to Kiev by  Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin -- this was agreed  by Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow during the last  meeting of CIS heads of state and heads of government -- and  also the statement by Crimea's President Meshkov that the Black  Sea Fleet supposedly comes under the exclusive authority of  Russia and Crimea's government.    [Kravchuk] I consider that our relations with Russia, with  Russia's president, and with the Russia Government, are  constructive. As to the fact that there was a (?corresponding)  statement, it was interpreted slightly incorrectly. Boris  Nikolayevich did not refuse to visit; he said only that he will  pay the visit when the acute problems have been resolved.    Then there is the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. I think  (?he did the right thing). When there is much that has not been  resolved, it is somewhat illogical to sign, for example, a  treaty on friendship, partnership, and cooperation when there  are acute problems. Well, I support the Russian president's  view that a treaty can be signed only when all the issues have  been resolved.    Anything said by other persons, including Crimea's  president,  is merely a personal position, his personal viewpoint. This  personal viewpoint cannot be the fundamental one in relations  between Russia and Ukraine today. I have always stressed, and I  stress now, that I would very much like (?Crimea), its  president, and the [word indistinct] officials to understand  that relations between two states, two peoples, [words  indistinct]. Whoever wants this relationship to be one of [word  indistinct] and partnership should make efforts to bring this  about, and anyone doing this will be a source of pride and a  person of great significance for his people, but not [word  indistinct] if he makes matters more acute and creates  confrontations.    [Naumenko] Do you consider, Leonid Kravchuk was asked, that  the previous years of your presidency were years of constructive  cooperation with the previous Ukrainian parliament, or was it  time wasted in fruitless arguments and in the inefficient  opposition of legislative and executive structures. Here is the  head of state's reply:    [Kravchuk] I have said already and have no other point of  view on this, that if we had managed from the very beginning,  from the very first steps, to reach accord -- it cannot be a  consensus, this is ruled out -- but accord and constructive work  in parliament, constructive work between the parliament and the  government, between the president and parliament, I am convinced  that we would have done far more, far more, in the area of  legislation, in the area of executive discipline, in the area of  reforms, market reforms, and in setting up democratic power  institutions. We would have done much more. But this did not  happen.    All the time and in most cases [word indistinct], our  relations were (?based) on mutual accusations. The executive  structures blamed the legislative structures, sometimes simply  undeservedly, and the legislative structures blamed the  executive structures. This then became a kind of norm. Meetings  began, sittings began, but everything proceeded in an atmosphere  of mutual accusations. This did not bring any benefit.    I hope, I want to believe, that this parliament (?will take)  its first steps toward constructive work. There can be no unity  there, because there are different people with various views.  But what is fundamental is to attempt and see the necessity for  constructive [word indistinct] with the government, the  president, and with all other power structures. This is the  main thing needed to achieve progress in solving economic and to  social problems, and foreign economic problems [words  indistinct].    [Naumenko] As is well known, the left-wing forces won a  considerable number of deputies' seats at the elections. What  is Leonid Kravchuk's attitude to the communist idea in general,  the president was asked, has it changed at all?    [Kravchuk] The Communist Party, the communists, and the  communist idea are different things. I have never been a  resolute opponent of, let us say, the right, (?if one may put  this question), the right of the individual to believe in one or  another idea, be it in communism or capitalism. This is  everyone's right.    There is the organization of the Communist Party itself.  This is now a structure. There are (?all sorts of) structures,  which arm themselves with an idea and want to put it into  practice. No one can prevent anyone doing this in a  constitutional way and within the laws of the state. As you  have probably observed, when I (?left the party) in (?1991), I  never [words indistinct], did not say that the communist  ideology is an (?enemy ideology), that the Communist Party is a  criminal organization. I have not said this. [passage indistinct]    As far as individuals are concerned, some individuals of the  current Communist Party are (?a worry), because they are of the  red mayor type, that is they want revenge at any cost. If (?for  example), you did not defend the Communist Party, then you are a  traitor. If you left the Communist Party, you are a traitor.  [Words indistinct] because the party envisages the right to join  the party and to leave the party, and no one has the right to  apply pressure. If this is democratic [words indistinct].    This is my attitude. I have an appropriate attitude to  individuals, and I consider this a [word indistinct] standpoint.  If one is to take this position, then the prospects [words  indistinct]. (?He knows) that if he wants to leave he will be  insulted, revenge will be taken, pressure will be applied, he  will be called a traitor and then even persecuted [words  indistinct]. Who will join such a party?    We simply cannot generalize about this, but should look at  specific things. This is my position. I cannot speak against  any organization which acts within the framework and the  boundaries of the constitution and the law. If an organization  does not obey the constitution and the law, there is the  procurator's office to deal with it, there is the Justice  Ministry, and there are other legislative, legal, and law  enforcement bodies to handle matters within the framework of the  law and the constitution. [passage omitted]    [Naumenko] On the eve of possible presidential elections,  the relationship between Leonid Kravchuk and [former Parliament  Speaker] Ivan Plyushch is a matter of great interest among  people. What can the head of state say about this? This was  the next question to Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukraine president was  also asked to comment on the fact that for some reason our  Ukrainian listeners, the Ukrainian audience and population  receive most new information on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament  from the newspaper IZVESTIYA.    [Kravchuk] Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] has said that he will  declare his candidacy and I told him that everyone has the right  to run president. Ivan Stepanovych and I were together for four  years in all. We sat at the table together for one and a half  years, I as chairman and he as first deputy. In the last few  years he was chairman [words indistinct], and naturally there  were contacts between the chairman and the president. I know  that Ivan Stepanovych has his standpoints, his point of view.  This is normal. In my speeches I have never made any kind of  personal observations regarding the Supreme Council chairman,  regarding Ivan Stepanovych -- not once; nowhere; never --  because I believe that debates should be direct. [Word  indistinct] debates do not bring any benefit. If there is no  (?reply) when people sit opposite each other and have the  possibility [words indistinct] to exchange points of view, this  is normal. One has his point of view, the other has another  point of view. [passage indistinct]    I would say that the [trilateral nuclear] agreement is being  implemented, that none of the three sides has any [words  indistinct] to cast doubt on the agreement, which (?has been  signed). Let us say that Ukraine is fulfilling its obligations,  Russia is fulfilling its obligations, and the United States its  fulfilling its obligations. Whether their dates coincide,  whether their volumes coincide, sums of money, warheads, fuel  elements, dates, and times is another matter. There are  corresponding problems here. There are both objective and  subjective problems. But they (?are being resolved).    As far as deactivation is concerned, we are acting in  accordance with the agreement. The agreement does not envisage  complete deactivation; [words indistinct] gradual  (?deactivation) is envisaged for the present. But we are  fulfilling those obligations we have assumed, and will continue  to fulfill them in the interests of (?this) trilateral  agreement. This deactivation does not mean the withdrawal of  warheads, you understand; it means their stockpiling  [skladuvannya], if one can use this word, at S facilities. We  are interested in these warheads being stockpiled. We are also  interested, because, not having a direct and full control over  silos, over nuclear warheads -- I do not have full control, I do  not have technical control, because this technical control is  located directly in Moscow -- I am interested in their not being  on alert status [na boyevomu cherhuvanni] because this is more  peaceful both for Ukraine and for the United States, especially  as they are all aimed [word indistinct] at the United States of  America. That is, I am in favor of deactivating them,  deactivating them.    As for what the state of play is today, on today's date,  [words indistinct], I do not know exactly whether [word  indistinct] 46, 36, or 26. The point is not [word indistinct].  The point is that we are fulfilling our (?contractual)  obligations.    [Naumenko] One of the questions to the Ukrainian president  contained a request to comment in detail on a package of US  assistance to Ukraine, dealt with during the Ukrainian head of  state's March visit to Washington. Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk  explained in this connection, as follows:    [Kravchuk] It can be said that this has been discussed --  our  problems and mechanisms for implementing the documents we signed  in Washington, as well as Bill Clinton's letter -- during  yesterday's meeting with the delegation headed by Burns. The  point of the letter is that we should begin to act in three  primary directions. The first direction is to use the $350  million designated for economic assistance -- not the $350  million for the dismantlement of nuclear weapons -- the $350  million for economic assistance. This is the first direction.  The second one is the development of investment programs --  where could these funds be used directly. The third direction is  the development of trade between Ukraine and the United States.    Bill Clinton believes that this delegation should work in  Ukraine in these three directions. During the meeting, we  conceptually worked out our proposals, and, before the meeting  with me, the delegation had had appropriate negotiations and  consultations with governmental structures, including the  Foreign Ministry. Thus, the point is how to use the $350  million, beginning immediately, without further delay.    There was another proposal. You will recall, when the U.S.  President was here, he said that the United States would grant  this loan to support small business. Now, this figure has been  put at $150 million. Then, the talk was about $50 million, now  the amount has increased to $150 million. However, I want you,  all of us and all those who are listening to us, to understand  one thing. There is state assistance, state loans granted by  other countries to Ukraine. These loans are granted under  guarantees. They must be returned, and of course, the interest  must be paid. The level, or the specific gravity of these forms  of assistance is dozens, or even hundreds times lower than  private companies' investments.    For instance, Hungary recently received assistance from  other  states amounting to five [words indistinct] well about (?$150  million), while private investments have up to date come to $3.5  billion.    Every year, the United States invests more than $50 billion  abroad. However, who does it? General Motors, General  Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Pepsi Cola, and others do it,  meaning companies which have colossal capabilities. These  investments are of a different nature. They come to a country,  set up enterprises and joint ventures, with the state in such  cases not undertaking any immediate guarantees. That is up to a  joint venture. It is either viable and competitive, trading,  selling and earning money, or its competitors and [word  indistinct] (?displace it).    I want you to understand that this is not the most important  thing. The most important thing is to create in Ukraine  conditions for investments of private capital.    [Naumenko] (?On the subject of) plummeting production and  inflation processes which, it is true, have lately been  successfully placed under strict state control, the Ukrainian  president was asked about his vision of economic development in  Ukraine (?in the very near future).    [Kravchuk] [passage indistinct] Comparing statistics, it is  even greater, rather than less severe, in other CIS countries.  However, I would like to say one thing which is very important.  For instance, Ukraine was the first CIS state to have suffered  a blow of the energy crisis, (?which called into question our  very independence). You may remember how quickly prices,  inflation etc. rose. Today, we (?have reached), let us say,  [word indistinct]. It is simply impossible for energy and other  prices to rise any higher because nobody will any longer buy the  goods that are manufactured. If it is twice (?the price) [words  indistinct], it is simply impossible.    We have withstood that (?pressure). (?It is over now). We  have withstood it. Now at rock bottom, as they say, we can and  have begun gradually to advance. What does advancing mean?  This means, and you can see for yourselves, that inflation has  now fallen. Production in some areas is still falling, but there  are increases too. New sectors are appearing.    Last year, for example, 22 percent of industrial output was  produced by lease enterprises. We now have up to 4,000 large  enterprises that are subject to corporatization, i.e. setting up  (?public limited [vidkrytyy]) companies. As many as 2,000 or so  medium- and large-size enterprises have been privatized. In  other words, there has appeared (?a demand) for the  establishment of new economic forms and new forms of  relationships, which enables me to speak of our ability to  contain the situation and advance toward the unification of  [words indistinct]. We should advance, and we have the  opportunity to do so in the (?present) situation. I understand  that it will be not easy, difficult [words indistinct].    [Naumenko] Because Ukraine will shortly have a newly formed  government, the Ukrainian president was asked to dwell in  greater detail on possible key personnel changes and  replacements in the make-up of the government.    [Kravchuk] You see, choosing people now and [words  indistinct] cannot be a purely personal matter of the president.  I believe that when we begin nominating a prime minister, I  think it will happen before the presidential elections -- a  newly elected legislature has to nominate a prime minister -- I  will hold the widest-possible consultations with the various  factions, the deputies' groups, and I will not only hold  consultations but I will have to know the distribution of  forces; that a particular candidate will be accepted and voted  for because, to put it simply, I can nominate just anybody.  However, where are the guarantees that this person will be  accepted?    Therefore, after the consultations, after such far-reaching  discussions, I believe this could be done with respect to any  name. Currently, we have no big claims, let us say, to such  candidates as, well, just to anyone who is [word indistinct]  submitted for the consideration of the Supreme Council and  receives the Supreme Council's approval. However, I must know  the opinion of the deputies' corps and the factions' --  socialist, communist, or democratic -- standing on the issue.  All this should be agreed upon.    By the way, there are no specific paths for Ukraine. In all  countries of the world, before a candidate is nominated for a  post, the nomination should be discussed and agreed upon. When  the voting is held, I am sure that this candidate will receive  an acceptable number of votes. The other thing is that I will  convince the deputies, the factions, and groups that this  candidate is the most proper person for this reason or that. I  will convince them, but not simply by saying that I want just  this man and nobody else, and if you do not agree, I will not  nominate anyone else. This cannot be done.    I did not have the opportunity to discuss with the deputies  the question of a candidate for prime minister. I want to  invite on 10 May, firstly, the group of deputies who proposed  moving the date of elections, and also those who want to come to  me on 10 May and hold an open discussion. I will elaborate on  my position, why I think such and such, and they can speak out  on their positions, and ask me questions. Well, they could  raise the issue of the prime minister; perhaps this question  will be raised.    Therefore, we should not make a secret out of this. If we  go openly to the Supreme Council, this cannot be a secret:  These are not -- how should I put it -- palace tricks, this is  a serious position which should be (?occupied by a person who is  capable of holding this position). This is not simple. This  person should be ready [words indistinct]. What I am saying now  is that this will be done on the basis of urgent consultations  with all factions, leaders, and groups. After this, a joint  decision will be adopted.    [Naumenko] The problem of housing in Ukraine's armed forces  is certainly one of the most acute problems of our society.  [Words indistinct] my journalist colleague thinks, reducing  officers personnel.    [Kravchuk] We need our armed forces to ensure the protection  of the state. This corresponds with, let us say, our (?concept)  and doctrine approved by the Supreme Council. [passage  indistinct]    As for social security, we have a program to provide  officers  [words indistinct] the armed forces, and also a program to  retrain them. [passage indistinct]    That was the leading topic in the United States of America:  Of the money we are being allocated to eliminate nuclear  weapons, the main proportion today has to be used to provide  officers with (?proper housing). [passage indistinct] There are  many opportunities for construction. There are building  contractors who can now do this immediately [words indistinct].  So I cannot say that everything is ideal there, but the program  [words indistinct].    [Naumenko] In the range of economic issues, the condition of  government settlements with the agrarian sector of the economy  is of key importance. The following is the Ukrainian  president's answer:    [Kravchuk] [passage indistinct] So, we are capitalizing on  every opportunity to solve as fully as possible the problem of  settling debts to the countryside, of supporting the miners,  (?and of) subsidies we have allocated. [passage indistinct]    We will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of  Ukraine and next year the 50th anniversary of the victory. I  would like to say -- (?I have already said) -- that Ukraine will  fully participate in all actions within the framework of the  CIS. I now have an appeal by (Ivan Oleksandrovych Herasymov's)  organization of veterans to determine our position with regard  to decorations and medals, and this we are working on. So, it  is about support both material and moral, because the people who  were in the war at that time deserve that attitude toward them.  By the way, the last shots fired in Ukraine -- I mean in combat  operations -- were heard in 1944; fortunately none have been  fired since then.    [Words indistinct] we have not yet fully realized what it  means that whole generations -- let us say, (?several  generations) -- have not seen and do not know what war is [words  indistinct]. This is our great victory -- that we maintain  peace and calm in Ukraine. (?Credit) here, you know, must in  honesty be given to the veterans. [Words indistinct] and know  what those people lived through and how much they suffered and  how many wounds they bear today. [passage indistinct] This will  enable them to speak out and tell us about their hard life and  about what they lived through, so we can make everybody respect  them. This, you know, is the culture of our society and its  future. [passage indistinct].</p>

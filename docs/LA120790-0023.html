			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WASTE FIRM WINS REDONDO BEACH CONTRACT  </P> <P> Western Waste Industries, which already has an exclusive contract to pick up  trash and recyclables from single-family homes in Redondo Beach, this week was  awarded the contract to service most of the city's businesses.  </P> <P> The firm, however, had to make several concessions to the city, including a  promise that none of its new commercial clients will face a rate increase when  the contract takes effect in April.  </P> <P> The City Council also exempted two of the city's largest waste generators, TRW  and the Galleria at South Bay, which will be free to negotiate their own trash  collection contracts.  </P> <P> Currently, businesses solicit trash collection services from about 11  companies, but the council this year decided on an exclusive contract to better  regulate the industry and to ensure that the city would be able to comply with  state-mandated recycling programs.  </P> <P> Western Waste, according to a study done by the city's Resource Conservation  Commission, was rated the best of the four trash haulers that had bid for the  commercial contract. Browning Ferris Industries came in second, followed by  Waste Management Inc. and Haig's Disposal Co.  </P> <P> Still being negotiated is the trash hauling contract for Redondo Beach's  apartments and condominiums, which have not yet been included in the city's  curbside recycling program.  </P></p>

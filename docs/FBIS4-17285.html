			<p>BFN     [Text] On Thursday Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin reported at the sitting of the Cabinet's presidium  that the government had received a letter from the president  which contains direct instructions regarding the situation in  the state economy and in the country as a whole. Chernomyrdin  noted that "the president's concern is not ungrounded" and "his  attitude towards the instructions of the head of the Russian  state is always a very serious one."    In Chernomyrdin's words, the document received from Yeltsin  was already considered on April 19 and the issues defined in it  would be solved in the near term. Chernomyrdin reported that  Vice Premier and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin had been  commissioned to fulfill the president's instructions.    The sitting of the government's presidium approved the  principal trends of the Cabinet's social policy for 1994. The  social policy gives priorities to the following: prevention of  any lowering of the population's level of incomes, preserving of  the balance between economic interests and material  opportunities of three major population groups: hired workers,  entrepreneurs, and disabled citizens.    To this effect Chernomyrdin indicated that the tax reform to  which he pays the greatest significance is to be the key element  of the social policy. In his words, "taxes should not bring  damage to people."    The government's presidium returned for revision the draft  of  the federal program on assistance in the population's employment  in 1994 prepared by the Federal Employment Service. As  Chernomyrdin said, the document does not properly point out  measures for helping in the employment of those who graduate  from educational institutions, does not take into consideration  investment programs the implementation of which the unemployed  can be involved. A governmental commission headed by Vice  Premier Yuriy Yarov has been formed to revise the federal  program.</p>

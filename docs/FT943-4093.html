			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Virtuality sees 1995 profits Virtuality Group, the designer and manufacturer of virtual reality computer games which floated in October, yesterday forecast that it would move into profit next year. In the six months to June it recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 695,000, after spending Pounds 880,000 on development, compared with a profit of Pounds 65,000. But Mr David Payne, chairman, stated:'I am confident that the existing core business and the signing of further licensing agreements will enable Virtuality to report a profitable outcome for the 1995 financial year.' First half sales jumped to Pounds 4.12m (Pounds 2.44m) as a result of unit sales of entertainment systems more than doubling to 184, against 75 and a total of 183 sold during 1993. Mr Jon Waldern, chief executive, said sales of its second generation machines, introduced in January, were on target. The second half should benefit from the recent launch of its second generation seated machine and from first sales of a low cost system developed with IBM for commercial users of virtual reality. Virtuality's shares, which were floated at 170p, reached a high of 364p before falling back on worries about cheap competition. They slipped 2p to 197p yesterday. Mr Waldern dismissed announcements by potential rivals as 'a lot of hot air'. 'Nobody has brought together a whole product that matches our products in the arcade market.' He said Virtuality was also well-placed to take advantage of the potential home market when the computer games manufacturers launched their new generation of machines.</p>

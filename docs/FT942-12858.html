			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (15): Watchdogs do their best - A look at the record of the market regulators Hong Kong's regulators have notched up an impressive tally of opponents spanning small brokers, predatory companies and corporate giants, but the scorecard of wins suggests high profile actions have not always led to retribution being delivered. Lengthy and costly investigations have not stood in the way of business for companies that have continued to divest themselves of assets and holdings even as inspectors were delving into transactions. Meanwhile, investors continue to fall foul of scams and unlicensed operators. However, in its biggest battle the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, is generally agreed to have come out on top. The row over the application of the Hong Kong takeovers code pitched the SFC against Jardine Matheson, the HKDollars 39.9bn trading company generally regarded as one of the most powerful bodies in the colony. Jardine had argued that shareholders were adequately protected by the Bermuda takeovers code, tailor-made for the group by the authorities in its country of domicile. The SFC refused to grant a waiver, leading Jardine Matheson and its associate to quit the colony's stock exchange from the end of this year. The SFC was backed by the stock exchange, underlining the new era of co-operation between the two. Giving his support Mr Charles Lee, stock exchange chairman, said: 'We have done so much in trying to build our reputation. With one stroke of the pen we could have destroyed it. This is something we just can't entertain.' But the row with Jardine is not over. The SFC says that the company - as a Hong Kong company, listed or not - still falls within its jurisdiction. Jardine disagrees. Where the track record has perhaps been less impressive is in the handling of Hong Kong's smaller fry. The past year has seen two spectacular swoops on companies, complete with hundreds of uniformed policemen and vanloads of potential evidence, but little more than a sheaf of paperwork has resulted from either. Mr Nicholas Allen, who works for Coopers and Lybrand, was appointed by the government to investigate the corporate activities of Lee Ming Tee's Allied Group - companies which had interests in metal trading, printing, seafood processing and properties - in August 1992. When the investigation started, the 10 companies making up the official and unofficial Allied Group had a combined market capitalisation of HKDollars 7.6bn. Mr Allen's 688-page report was released more than a year later. It details mechanisms through which, it claims, Mr Lee Ming Tee, then chairman, syphoned shareholders' funds into activities such as the undisclosed control of listed companies, share price manipulation and the funding of stock purchases by the controlling shareholders. However, as yet Mr Allen's endeavours and HKDollars 46m of taxpayers' money have done little to dent the ebullient Mr Lee, who has since stood down as chairman but whose business activities are as prolific as ever. Moreover, Mr Lee sold subsidiaries of the Allied Group throughout the investigations, so that today it is a much slimmer animal than the one which came under scrutiny in August 1992, A similar investigation targeted the corporate affairs of the World Trade Centre Group, a company previously controlled by the Australian Bond Corporation and two associated companies. Publication of this report - which will run to more than 1,000 pages, including an appendix - is expected next month. In December, the Commercial Crime Bureau seized crates of possible evidence from the three companies plus four others largely under the helm of Mr Stanley Ho, a Macau tycoon whose empire ranges from ferries to casinos. As with the Allied Group, the World Trade Centre Group has undergone a metamorphosis since Mr John Lees, the government-appointed inspector, started delving into its affairs. Nevertheless, market players are concerned that failure to act on the second report will lead to a replay of the investigation into the 1983 collapse of the Carrian property empire, which gobbled up HKDollars 100m in public money but delivered little by way of justice. If the SFC is to send a message that will be heeded by corporate Hong Kong and international investors, it will have to show that, this time, money has not been spent in vain. More successful has been the onslaught on activities such as trading practices at odds with the interests of the investing public, market manipulation, window dressing and false accounting. Among the bigger fish caught, Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong securities house, was disciplined for misconduct concerning three of the flotations it handled. The SFC last September accused the banking arm of engaging in stock trading 'which was likely to be prejudicial to the interests of the investing public'; contributing to a restricted free-float in the shares of three newly-listed companies; and failing adequately to monitor client trading activities. Peregrine agreed to pay HKDollars 3.5m to a stock exchange fund. Over the past year, the SFC has also forced up the price of bids in a number of the takeover situations it has swooped on; and has acted as the saviour of the minority shareholder by pulling significant corporate transactions deemed to be potentially detrimental to small investors. It has completed 'numerous' prosecutions for unregistered dealing, marketing of unauthorised investment products, short selling (covered short selling has now been legalised) and failure to meet disclosure of interests requirements. New regulations have been brought in to protect clients of foreign exchange agents. The new capital requirement for brokers, allied to other controls, is expected to see up to half the existing Forex brokers go out of business. At the stock exchange itself - to which direct powers have been devolved from the SFC - big steps have been taken to tighten up on malpractices and to create an environment where both domestic and overseas investors can deal confidently in Hong Kong and China securities.</p>

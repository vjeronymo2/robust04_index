			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: IFS queries tough curb on public expenditure Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is proposing a public-spending squeeze far tougher than anything achieved in the 1980s, Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said yesterday. Questions must be raised, he said, about the feasibility and desirability of these plans. One consequence, under plausible assumptions about local authority spending, is that council tax bills from local authorities might have to rise by 15 per cent. Otherwise local authority pay or services would have to be severely cut, he argued. The government plans to increase the real level of the non-cyclical elements in public spending, contained in the 'new control total', by a cumulative amount of only 3.8 per cent between 1992-93 and 1998-99 (see chart). By contrast, between 1980-81 and 1986-87, when Baroness Thatcher was prime minister, - and Lord Howe and Lord Lawson were chancellors of the exchequer  -comparable spending rose by 12.5 per cent in real terms. The government also plans to reduce real non-cyclical spending by 1.3 per cent between this year and next, before it starts to rise once more in line with former chancellor Mr Norman Lamont's plans. Mr Dilnot said it was far from obvious that such a cut was the best way to squeeze greater efficiency out of the public sector. Local authority spending could lead to political difficulties soon. Total central government support for local authorities is set to decline by 2.4 per cent in real terms between 1993-94 and 1994-95. Mr Michael Ridge of the IFS noted in particular, that the revenue from the uniform business rate was set to decline from Pounds 11.6bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 10.7bn in 1994-95, an 11 per cent fall in real terms. Mr Dilnot was particularly critical of the government's failure to set priorities. He said that too much emphasis was placed on control of public-sector running costs, mainly pay, which is to be fixed in nominal terms for three years, implying a real fall of almost 10 per cent. Furthermore, government plans implied that the shares of national income being spent on health and education would fall even though people would want to spend a higher share of their growing incomes on them.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SCANDALOUS VINTAGE;  </P> <P> WINE COUNTRY; A HISTORY OF NAPA VALLEY, THE EARLY YEARS: 1838-1920 BY WILLIAM  F. HEINTZ(CAPRA PRESS: $29.95; 310 PP., ILLUSTRATED);  </P> <P> NAPA BY JAMES CONAWAY (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $24.95; 506 PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> If two new books on the Napa Valley were wines, you'd sip one slowly and gulp  the other. William F. Heintz's history of the region from 1838 to 1920, which  is to be followed by a second volume, would be a cabernet in the traditional  style, heavy and full-bodied. I wouldn't order a case, however, because even a  scholarly work such as "Wine Country" needs more color and flair.  </P> <P> James Conaway's "Napa" resembles a sparkling wine. It's bright, brassy and  slips right down but reads more like a gossipy novel than a journalistic  account of events. While both books include photographs, Conaway's should have  a fold-out map showing where the bodies are buried.  </P> <P> Heintz is a former corporate historian who'd done prodigious amounts of  research. "Wine Country" traces the origin of viticulture in the Napa Valley to  1838, when George Yount, the first white settler, planted a small vineyard. The  grapes were intended for eating. Young and like-minded pioneers, most of them  Midwestern farmers, came from religious/fundamentalist backgrounds and believed  that grapes "were to be eaten for food and not, God forbid, for the making of  wine." They changed their minds when the Gold Rush of 1849 brought hordes of  thirsty miners to California, clamoring for something alcoholic to cut the  dust.  </P> <P> The settlers displaced the native Wappo Indians, of whom the "Nappas" were a  small band, and in two decades, killed off almost all of them. Cholera and  smallpox finished what rifles began. Heintz notes that before their people were  completely decimated, Indian laborers in George Yount's employ may have planted  the first of the grapevines destined to cover the land.  </P> <P> During the Gold Rush, the Valley's population swelled, creating a huge demand  for food. The region became a county and agriculture replaced cattle raising as  its chief industry. Traces of a wilder West remained, though. When a cannon  exploded during a Fourth of July celebration, according to an 1854 account,  "blowing off the arm of one man and destroying the sight of another," the event  merely "dampened temporarily the pleasure of the afternoon."  </P> <P> Heintz credits Simpson Thompson from Bucks County, Pa., a nursery owner, with  introducing the system of cultivating fruit without irrigation. Anton  Haraszthy, John Osborne and Charles Krug, names better known to future  generations, experimented with varieties of grapes and with wine-making  techniques.  </P> <P> By the late 1850s, a publication called "The California Farmer" vigorously  promoted "The Commerce of the Vine, Olive and Mediterranean Fruits," the  importation of which, into the eastern United States, offered a lucrative  market. Napa and nearby Sonoma counties caught "wine fever," consigning acreage  to grapes at such a pace that the number of vines planted jumped from 22,000 to  55,000 in one year. The wine "could not have been of very high quality," Heintz  writes discreetly, but at least there was lots of it.  </P> <P> "We are to make wine as common an article of consumption in America as upon the  Rhine," one booster wrote in 1864, but even with a respectable product, thanks  to the planting of European root stock, vintners had a rough row to hoe.  Eastern snobs insisted that only French wines were fit to drink, a prejudice  that proved dismayingly durable.  </P> <P> Working from an impressive range of source materials, Heintz charts the Napa  Valley's evolution into a prestigious wine-growing region. It's a solidly  capable job, but italics and exclamation points pepper every page, and the  over-emphasis grates: "Cooper fails to mention if Yount served any wine at  dinner!" "McIntyre . . . seems to have become the first winery architect in the  entire United States!" Enthusiasm is a fine thing. One still wants to tell  Heintz "Calm down!"  </P> <P> "Wine Country" also could use pruning, the cutting away of extraneous details  and digressions. But it's a valuable contribution to California history.  </P> <P> In "Napa," James Conaway sets out not just to inform but to entertain. The  one-time wine columnist for the Washington Post succeeds on both counts. He  writes well, understands the region's politics and social structure, and has a  novelist's eye. If "Falcon Crest" hadn't gotten there first, he'd have the  makings of a TV series in which Joan Collins could play any number of roles.  </P> <P> Betty Naylor, for example. Wife of John Daniel, who inherited Inglenook, Naylor  humiliated her husband with a series of love affairs and terrorized her  children. Conaway describes her hitting one young daughter so hard on the back  of the neck, at a dinner party, that the child fell unconscious into the soup.  Whereupon her mother stormed out, presumably yelling "No wire hangers!"  </P> <P> Helene de Pins, daughter of the founder of Beaulieu Vineyards, was another  tyrant and a penny-pincher. Too cheap to invest money in the business after her  father died, although she had plenty, she sold the prestigious estate, famous  for its premium wines. The new owner was Heublein Corp., producer of "an ocean  of pop wine, not just Cold Duck and the standby sweeties but also Bali Hai,  Zapple (made of apples) and a cola-flavored creation called I Love You."  </P> <P> Albeit in drag, Collins even could play Ernest Gallo, whom Conaway describes as  ruthless. "Remember," Gallo instructs a young sales manager, "people aren't led  -- they're driven!"  </P> <P> And we've only begun to dish. Gleefully recounting the rift between the  brothers Peter and Robert Mondavi, which ended up in a lawsuit, Conaway  describes a fight between Robert and his mother Rosa, in the matriarch's  kitchen, and all but accuses Robert of killing her:  </P> <P> The two argue in Italian, in the presence of an old friend who can't understand  what they're saying. "Finally Robert said something that made Rosa fall off her  chair. Her friend rushed forward to help her while Robert stood staring down at  his mother as if at a stranger. . . .  </P> <P> "After Robert was gone, Rosa said 'I have two sons. One has short legs and he  is a saint. One has longer legs and he is a devil.'  </P> <P> "She died shortly thereafter."  </P> <P> A group of wine makers who call themselves the GONADS, short for the  "Gastronomic Order of the Nonsensical and Dissipatory," hold their monthly orgy  of gorging, drinking their brains out and telling coarse jokes. These gents  greet one another with "How're they hanging?"  </P> <P> Another wine maker, Joe Heitz, has little use for wine tastings, considering  them a waste of time. "But after someone asked him for his autograph, Heitz was  seen more often in the midst of swirling, sniffing devotees of the ultimate  beverage."  </P> <P> Some real-life characters come off well. Others are greedy parvenus, whose  pretensions Conaway exposes in long, "re-created" conversations, as if he'd  been a fly on the wall. The hybrid of history and fictional techniques raises  credibility problems; I'll believe some of these conversations only when I hear  the tapes.  </P> <P> That said, there's no resisting "Napa," and along with shaking up the Valley --  bookstores can't keep this one in stock -- Conaway makes a serious point. If  Napa Valley can't be saved from developers, who are steadily gaining political  clout, no place can.  </P></p>

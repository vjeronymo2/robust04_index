			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FROM DICKENS TO PINK PANTHER;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY EVENTS: PROGRAMS RANGE FROM CLASSICAL TO COMICAL, FROM MUSICAL TO  DRAMATIC, FROM TRADITIONAL TO POP.  </P> <P> Try as it might to finally overtake the holiday season completely, pop culture  is still dominated this year in the San Fernando Valley by more traditional  arts and entertainment events. Contemporary music and even some cartoon  characters join in the celebration, but it's such vintage standbys as "The  Nutcracker" and Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" that set the tone.  </P> <P> The holiday-themed events this month are scattered across a wide spectrum,  including the re-creation of a Christmas dinner in the court of a 17th-Century  English monarch at Cal State Northridge, assorted plays and carolers, and an  all-star "Country Christmas" at the Universal Amphitheater.  </P> <P> * Headlined by mother-and-daughter country music duo the Judds, the "Country  Christmas" concert Saturday will benefit the Love Is Feeding Everyone charity.  Also on the bill are Charley Pride, Garth Brooks, Hoyt Axton, Jim Stafford and  others. On Dec. 19 and 20 at the Amphitheater, Mannheim Steamroller performs "A  Fresh Aire Christmas." For information on both programs, call (818) 980-9421.  </P> <P> * At CSUN, the 11th annual "Madrigal Dinner" transforms visitors into the  dinner guests of a medieval queen. While seated in a room decorated with  banners, shields, candles and Christmas holly, visitors are fed and entertained  by a costumed cast of 30, all acting out parts of the royal entourage,  including jesters, musicians and other entertainers.  </P> <P> Presented in and by the University Student Union, the dinner is open to as many  as 240 guests for each of its six nights. Visitors are encouraged to dress in  period costume, particularly on "Costume Night" on Dec. 22.  </P> <P> "Basically, it took me out of the time period where I was," program director  Sharon McKenzie said of her first "Madrigal Dinner." "I thought, 'How strange  to be back in the 17th Century.' It took me out of modern times to another time  and place."  </P> <P> The program will be presented Dec. 15, 16, 18, 19, 21 and 22. Doors open at 7  p.m. for the 7:30 p.m. show. Tickets are $26.50 and $30.50, $20 and $22 for  students. For ticket information, call (818) 885-2488.  </P> <P> * Another tradition is continued at the Glendale Centre Theatre, which is  offering its long-running production of "A Christmas Carol" through Dec. 22.  The two-hour, theater-in-the-round presentation features a 30-member cast, many  wearing vintage costumes of Dickens' late-1800s.  </P> <P> This three-decade-old version of "A Christmas Carol" was originally adapted by  Ted Lehmann, a former director-actor at the theater, who filled the role of  Scrooge until the mid-1970s. The program begins with a group of carolers  singing traditional holiday songs, and they return during set changes in the  play, theater spokeswoman Robyn Sunshine said.  </P> <P> "We are very close to being sold out," she said. "It's because of the longevity  of the show. We have been putting it on for so long, people know it is always  going to be here.  </P> <P> "The audiences love it. They call as early as June to get tickets. It provides  a good Christmas atmosphere during the hectic holidays."  </P> <P> The Glendale Centre Theatre is at 324 N. Orange St. For information, call (818)  244-8481.  </P> <P> * "Humbug!" is a musical adaptation of the Dickens classic at the Actors Alley  Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood. Featuring music by Barry Fasman, Arthur  Hamilton and Robert Caine, the play is being performed through Dec. 16 at the  theater, 12135 Riverside Drive. Show times are 8 p.m. Tuesdays through  Saturdays, 2 and 7 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $15. For information, call (818)  508-4200.  </P> <P> * The Valley College stage presentation of "A Christmas Carol" offers the same  Dickens story, but with a twist. Using an adaptation by Pete Parkin, the tale  unfolds in a contemporary alley on Christmas Eve with a group of homeless  people who have found the Dickens book. They decide to act out the story rather  than burn the book for warmth. The play is performed at 8 p.m. Thursdays  through Saturdays through Dec. 15 in the Little Theater on the Van Nuys campus,  5800 Fulton Ave. Admission is $5, $3 for students and seniors. At Thursday  performances, a can of food will be accepted for use by the North Hollywood  Food Pantry to feed the homeless during the holiday season. For information,  call (818) 781-1200, Ext. 353.  </P> <P> * At the Granada Theater, "A Christmas Carol" is presented as if being told in  the home of Dickens in 1843. Performances of the Michael Paller adaptation  begin Saturday and continue through Dec. 23 at the theater, 10648 Balboa Blvd.,  Granada Hills. Show times are 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, 7 p.m. Saturdays, 1  and 5:30 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $8 and $10, and includes refreshments at  intermission. For information, call (818) 363-6887.  </P> <P> * Meanwhile, it's "A Pink Panther Christmas" at the Shinbone Alley Gallery in  Studio City, where animation cels on display through January have the sly  cartoon character dressed as Santa Claus and in other disguises. There are so  many Pink Panther cels, gallery owner Celeste Wilson said, that a good portion  of her animation and fine art gallery is smothered by them.  </P> <P> "I have Christmas panthers, and panthers taking baths, and skiing panthers and  panthers with real long tails because dogs have pulled on them," she said,  laughing. "I have all kinds of panthers."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, this pink-hued monument to American pop culture has done little to  diminish her fascination with the gallery's other featured exhibit, a show of  Ukrainian animation cels.  </P> <P> Shinbone Alley came into possession of the works after the gallery owner's  husband, animator John David Wilson, traveled to Kiev to aid Soviet animators  in their work for Fox Television's daytime cartoon show "Peter Pan and the  Pirates." What he brought back were cels displaying a rare intricacy little  seen in modern Western animation.  </P> <P> "When you look at it, you know it's not from here," Wilson said. "It doesn't  look Western, it looks sort of eastern European. Also, they don't have any of  the modern technologies to make cels like we have. So every single thing, from  a shadow or special effect, is painted right on the cel, which makes for  beautiful, beautiful work."  </P> <P> A total of 25 Soviet cels from an original cache of about 60 remain on the  gallery's walls, accompanied by a small display of Ukrainian folk art also  brought back by Wilson's husband. Among those are miniature watercolor  paintings, hand-painted eggs and ceramic figures, and wall hangings.  </P> <P> "The animation is what strikes me the most," Wilson said. "It's what is  beautiful and exciting. It's fine art, and it's not just for the animation  collector. There are some of these animation works that would be wonderful  hanging in someone's home."  </P> <P> In addition, the gallery is presenting a small display of oil and watercolor  paintings by John David Wilson depicting mostly urban scenes of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The show opens today with what the gallery owner is calling a "Panther Party,"  highlighted with a free drawing for a Pink Panther cel, from 7 to 9 p.m.  Shinbone Alley is open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, and is at  4350 Tujunga Ave. Admission is free. For information, call (818) 506-0095.  </P> <P> * The Westside Ballet brings its 17th annual production of Tchaikovsky's "The  Nutcracker" to Burbank for two performances Saturday. The classic holiday story  is directed by Yvonne Mounsey, the company's artistic director and a former  ballerina with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and the New York City Ballet.  Rotating in the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy this year are 15-year-old dancers  Christina Gibbs and Romanian-born Anna Liceica.  </P> <P> The Westside Ballet is the training company for the Westside School of Ballet  in Santa Monica. It will appear at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Saturday at John Burroughs  Auditorium, 1920 Clark Ave. Performances will continue Dec. 15 and 16 in Santa  Monica's Lincoln Auditorium. Admission is $10 adults, $5 children. Parking is  free. For information, call (213) 828-6211.  </P> <P> * The Santa Clarita Dixieland Jazz Club celebrates its Christmas party on  Sunday with six live sets of jazz music from the 1920s, '30s and '40s. The jazz  concert-dance at the San Fernando Elks Lodge, 804 Pico St., will be presented  from 1 to 5:30 p.m., with food available. Admission is $3 club members, $5  non-members. Organizers request that those attending bring a child's gift for  the Elks' children's Christmas party the next week. Parking is free. For  information, call (213) 256-5828.  </P> <P> * Also Sunday is the seventh annual Christmas concert by the Granada Hills  Chorale at Granada Hills High School. Accompanied by harpist Elaine Litster,  the 35-voice chorale will perform classical and international holiday carols,  director Maryann Mendenhall said.  </P> <P> Among those is Randall Thompson's "Alleluia," the traditional Spanish carol "Ya  Viene la Vieja" and a Sioux tribal song titled "Stars Lead Us Ever On."  </P> <P> "I built a chorale that would have some diversity," Mendenhall said. "I think  it's culturally sound to present music from various ethnic backgrounds to our  people to promote understanding."  </P> <P> The Granada Hills Chorale was founded in 1984 when the retirement of local high  school vocal teacher Jean Chamberlain left a musical void in the community,  Mendenhall said. Chamberlain was then urged by former students, parents and  local music lovers to organize the new group. And in its first six years, the  chorale has performed at the Hollywood Bowl and Los Angeles Music Center. In  July, the chorale will perform at New York's Carnegie Hall as part of an event  marking the venue's 100th anniversary.  </P> <P> The Christmas concert begins at 6 p.m. in the school's Highlander Hall, 10535  Zelzah Ave. Admission and parking are free. For information, call (818)  360-2209.  </P> <P> * "The Advent Concert" presents the Santa Clarita Symphony Orchestra and  Community Chorus on Sunday at St. Clare Catholic Church, 19606 Calla Way,  Canyon Country. Conducted by Kenneth Knight, the program includes Rutter's  "Gloria," Mendelssohn's "Psalms 42" and Bach's "Christmas Cantata." The chorus  comprises singers from several area church choirs and the Santa Clarita Chamber  Singers. The program begins at 7:30 p.m., with a suggested donation for  admission of $7.50, $5 seniors and students. For information, call (805)  296-1188 or (213) 656-7343.  </P> <P> * St. Mel Catholic Church in Woodland Hills presents "Rejoice" at 8 p.m. Dec.  20 at the church, 20870 Ventura Blvd. The 90-minute program, conducted by  Sheldon Cohen, assistant music director for "The Tonight Show" on NBC-TV,  features 200 voices in the church's combined adult and children's choirs and a  25-piece orchestra. The program is a parish tradition -- the church's choirs  have presented a holiday concert for 15 years.  </P> <P> "We get a capacity crowd, believe me," said Cora Neely, church secretary. "The  concert has been here a long time and people like the music." Tickets are $8  adults, $6 children and seniors. For information, call (818) 887-9326 or (818)  340-6020.  </P> <P> * The Pierce College Premiere Chorale and Orchestra, directed by Terry Danne,  presents a "Messiah Sing-Along" at 8 p.m. Tuesday, with a suggested donation of  $8.

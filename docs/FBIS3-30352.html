			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Pol Mathil </F> in Warsaw; date not given: "On the Polish Left and the World"]    [Text] [Mathil] One hundred days after taking office as  prime minister of a government of the left in Poland, you are  making your first visit to Brussels. How are you going to  explain to your Western interlocutors that Poland, the most  anti-communist of the former Soviet bloc countries, has  replaced, after four years, a regime born out of Solidarity with  a government formed of two parties with their roots in the  former regime?    [Pawlak] My generation is fortunate to enter upon the  political scene at a time when we ourselves are deciding our  fate, while our parents and grandparents were forced to live  under the constraints of the Communist regime and look for their  spot in the sunshine. Certain people now say that we must do  away with Communism in the country. But we cannot do away with  Communism in a country which never accepted the Communism in the  first place. We were the only Eastern bloc country to have  maintained intact its national memory, private agriculture,  church and intellectual elite. Within the group which was,  apparently, condemned to uniformity, we were different. This  aspect is an essential element of the present situation.    [Mathil] You do not therefore like the definition of your  coalition as "post-Communist"?    [Pawlak] No, I find it anachronistic, dating from the former  era in fact. Also, the past history of politicians and  political parties in Poland, of the people from Solidarity also,  is very complicated.    My party, the Peasant Party, began well before the Communist  era. It has been active in Polish politics for a hundred years.  Such a party cannot be described as "post-Communist."    [Mathil] And the reasons for your electoral success? An  ideological vote?    [Pawlak] No, I don't believe so, it was a pragmatic vote. A  signal that the economy is more than statistics and abstract  accounting, it is above all people. I believe the vote  indicated that, for the Poles, the affairs of the present and  the future are more important than those of the past, and  day-to-day problems eclipsed any ideological debate. The 1991  elections had already signalled that certain consequences of the  reforms were hitting the population very hard. But this signal  was ignored. As the government did not change course, the 1993  elections showed that the political climate had changed  radically.    [Mathil] Alternating governments is in fact a quite normal  phenomenon in a democracy, but not when it brings to power two  parties as burdened by the past as your own. You are accused of  rebuilding a model of the past?    [Pawlak] That is the view of people who have not noticed the  far-reaching changes in the structures and generations in our  parties. Also, virtually all those who are involved in the  exercise of power have been confirmed in their position by the  ballot box.  <H5>  Cohabitation With Lech Walesa </H5>   [Mathil] Poland is the first country with cohabitation  between a government of the left and a president of the right,  like in France, but in reverse. What are your relations with  Lech Walesa?    [Pawlak] Good. I believe that it is in the interests of the  country for them to remain as good as possible. We do not deal  with symbols, but with specific, concrete questions. On any  important and urgent matters, I never have any problem in  gaining access to the president.    [Mathil] After three months of cohabitation, has there been  no major conflict between the president and the prime minister?    [Pawlak] Even if there had been, I would not tell you.    [Mathil] The fact remains that three key ministries,  defense,  foreign, and the interior, remain the reserve of the president.  Do these ministers remain outside the control of the prime  minister?    [Pawlak] They are members of the government which I head.  Under the Constitution, the government is appointed by the  parliament, but the individuals who head these three departments  are chosen in consultation with the president. Admittedly, this  is a situation with the potential for conflict, but Polish  cohabitation makes it possible to arrive at a compromise.    [Mathil] The Solidaruty governments, from Mazowiecki to  Suchocka, pursued a policy of reforms admired in the West but  rejected by the voters. You described it as a "vehicle heading  for the abyss." What do you do to stop it?    [Pawlak] The sentence is not complete, I was alluding to the  abyss of social conflict. An "active economy" is required, in  which not only a few monetarist instruments but all the players,  and notably the government, must play a role. We must  understand that there is a limit to social resilience, beyond  which there is the danger of provoking an explosion,  destabilization, and the end to reforms. That is why we have  begun by looking at the situation of the most underprivileged.    [Mathil] Your critics claim that carrying out your election  promises will threaten the cause of reforms and trigger rising  inflation.    [Pawlak] For the moment, inflation is lower than expected  and  in any event it can only be meaningfully discussed after a  certain period of time.    [Mathil] You are arriving in Brussels the very day after the  entry into force of the association accord with the European  Union negotiated by previous governments. Does your government  of the left have any reservations regarding this treaty?    [Pawlak] It is enough to look at our foreign trade debt, one  half of which, or more than one billion dollars in 1993, stems  from trade with the EEC. It is not of question of listing  preferences on paper, but of achieving real cooperation.    [Mathil] Do you mean to say that Poland is discriminated  against in terms of access to Western markets?    [Pawlak] That is putting it in strong terms. But you could  say that the European Union applies solutions to Poland which it  would not like to see applied to itself.    [Mathil] You have the reputation of being a protectionist.  Why?    [Pawlak] I don't know. I have simply asked the question:  Why has not Poland so far used all available means in order to  defend its interests as the countries of the European Union have  done?    [Mathil] In Brussels, you are going to sign Poland's access  to the Partnership for Peace. Is it true that as recently as  last Friday you were not sure that you would be able to do it  this Wednesday?    [Pawlak] The decision to sign was taken at a summit with Mr.  Clinton in Prague. But it was a question of having the full  backing of the government. This was obtained on Friday.    [Mathil] This agreement has been strongly criticized in  Poland, notably by your president. Is the partnership  considered to be insufficient?    [Pawlak] It is a complex matter. Apart from the external  dangers which could be posed in the future, there are more  immediate aspects of internal order. This is why we formulated  the idea of a "Partnership for Development." And Mr. Clinton's  statement on the need to enlarge access to Western markets by  the countries of Central Europe shows a similar thinking.  Security is a very broad concept which goes beyond bilateral  relations between Poland and NATO for example.  <H5>  The "Partnership" Creates A Draught Zone </H5>   [Mathil] Do you agree with Henry Kissinger for whom the  "partnership" creates a no man's land between Russia and NATO?    [Pawlak] I prefer to say "a draught zone" where you might  catch a cold. The situation is characterized by uncertainties  which the ambiguities of the "partnership" do not remove.    [Mathil] What dangers would you cite to show the fragility  of  the situation?    [Pawlak] I would begin by the elements of internal  stability,  social and economic. The quicker we achieve this stability,  notably through international cooperation, the easier it will be  to solve wide, long-term problems. But I do not believe we are  under a direct threat in our international environment.    [Mathil] So how do you see events in Russia and above all  the  results of the recent elections?    [Pawlak] I see it as further proof that reforms cannot be  achieved independently of the social climate.    [Mathil] But do you see in this result a danger to Poland?  Belarus and Ukraine, two buffer states between Poland and  Russia, are being slowly "sucked in" by Moscow. What do you  think of the idea of Russia's "legitimate interests" in the  "near abroad"? Do you feel this is relevant to or even targeted  at Poland?    [Pawlak] Our present relations with Russia's president and  government are not of a nature to justify such fears. In any  event, we take our decisions in complete sovereignty and we have  no reason to believe that Russia does not respect this. But of  course time will tell.    [Mathil] Exactly, you have time. At the age of 34, you are  certainly one of the youngest prime ministers in the world.  People say you are very ambitious. Is it true that you will be  a candidate against Lech Walesa at the next presidential  elections?    [Pawlak] I have a job now which is very interesting and  which  I find totally satisfying. I do not know if I am an ambitious  man, but I am certainly not a man in a hurry.</p>

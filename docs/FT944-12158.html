			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (21): Nightmare at a top American school - The first three terms are portrayed with wit and self-deprecation as a gruesome mental assault course / Business education 'SNAPSHOTS FROM HELL (THE MAKING OF AN MBA)' By Peter Robinson Nicholas Brealey Pounds 9.99, 286 pages Perhaps the most surprising thing about Peter Robinson's book is that it is actually a rather entertaining read. One could imagine lots of MBA students recounting the experiences of their first year at business school and the results being decidedly dull. Robinson, however, enjoys a number of advantages. For a start, he can write, a skill no doubt developed in his earlier White House job drafting speeches for President Reagan. He also describes an interesting business school era (1988-90), when the yuppie union card, as he calls the MBA, was already starting to lose some of its shine, as well as an interesting institution (Stanford University Graduate School of Business) which, by his account, appears to have been in some turmoil at the time. Above all, however, Robinson is a sufficiently sympathetic and sensitive character for readers to want to know whether he survived his nightmare, how it changed him and what judgments on business education he ultimately made. Many of Robinson's difficulties arise from the fact that he is a 'poet'  - Stanford-speak for students with degrees in subjects such as history or English as opposed to engineering or mathematics, and who instinctively prefer ideas rather than numbers. Large parts of the more mathematically-based bits of the syllabus are therefore at best baffling, at worst likely to make him 'flunk' the whole programme. He has periods of relaxation, elation and joy but on the whole the first three terms of a full-time MBA at one of America's top schools are portrayed with wit and self-deprecation as a gruesome mental assault course - at least for poets, that is. There is some interest in the other characters - Conor, a fellow poet with spouse and family in tow, struggling with 27-hour days; Zen, a Japanese who finally cannot bring himself to make the cultural leap and work for a US firm; and Mr Cool and Mr Perfect who, as their nicknames imply, found it all easy enough to womanise and improve their suntans. Generally, though, Robinson's classmates are types one might recognise anywhere. What is more provoking is the light this book sheds on the value of an MBA. Things have moved on on both sides of the Atlantic since the author's graduation - a pity, in fact, that he wasn't a bit quicker on the draw with his pen - but the observations are still instructive for anyone contemplating business school today. Even a school with Stanford's reputation is sometimes guilty in Robinson's view of sloppy and ill-focused teaching (the class is in open revolt at one point), close friendships are hard to forge, especially in the early pressure-cooker days, and the networking-job-seeking mentality is even more obsessive than one imagines. Robinson cites an iconoclastic member of the faculty who dreams of running two MBA classes side by side: one would follow the normal curriculum, the other would do no work and spend the time playing golf or on the beach. His point is that given many employers' starry-eyed attitude to the MBA, the more leisurely lot would be just as successful in the job market as the 'genuine' students. Robinson's own search to some extent proves the point - an offer from Robert Maxwell during a meeting in which he literally did not have to open his mouth. Wisely, he turned that one down, although the subsequent decision to accept Rupert Murdoch's shilling was scarcely more auspicious. Robinson later fell victim to a cost-cutting programme implemented by the Australian tycoon. Based on the class of 1988-90 as a whole, the conclusion is that business school is not necessarily a straight and easy road to riches. But in the end, Robinson betrays an affectionate regard for the institution which put him through hell: he says the union card, the broadening experience, the self-confidence, the contacts and (in his case, at any rate) the perspective on life, are all worth having. A case, perhaps, of not biting too hard the hand that feeds you.</p>

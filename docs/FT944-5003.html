			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Technology: Science offers an improved service - The direction of UK government research As the industrialists, officials and academics engaged in crystal ball gazing for the UK's Technology Foresight Programme begin to draw up their conclusions, some themes are emerging. One likely outcome of the programme, a wide-ranging examination of future technological trends designed to guide research, is that more research will be devoted to the needs of the service sector. Some officials think that as much as 10 per cent of the government's Pounds 3.3bn civil research budget could be redirected over the long term towards projects relevant to service industries. This is partly because the exercise has opened up new lines of communication between the government and the service sector. Robert Hughes, the junior science minister, describes the Foresight programme as 'breaking new ground by covering financial services, retailing and leisure . . . which use huge amounts of technology but which have not before been closely involved in science and technology policy.' Another reason why more attention is being focused on the service sector is the rapid pace of technological change. In financial services, for example, the stockbrokers working on the floor of the London Stock Exchange before 1986 had little use for new technology. Their modern counterparts, however, are avid consumers of information technology and recruiters of physicists and mathematicians. Recent advances in communications and electronics are likely to make a significant impact on service companies. The way that services are delivered could be transformed by developments such as the information superhighway and the increasing use of personal computers in the home. Although some of the technologies expected to influence the coming decades are already in use, others sound like science fiction. Topics discussed include miniature robots to unclog diseased arteries, automatic translation of telephone conversations in different languages, and business meetings conducted in virtual reality. But even the most ambitious ideas may be more realistic than non-technologists would imagine. Michael Hughes, a director of BZW, the broker, who is chairman of the financial services Foresight panel, said the results of the exercise pointed to faster change than expected. 'A lot of what we felt would be there within 10 to 15 years will be there in five.' The Foresight panel, with representatives from banks, actuaries, universities, the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry, identified 68 issues, including the impact of multimedia on retail banking and using data encryption for greater security in transferring money. Its early findings predicted technological change concentrated in the retail side of the financial services industry, which would be affected by developments such as multimedia and the information superhighway, rather than the wholesale sector which has already seen rapid changes. The work of the Foresight panel goes beyond examining the technological feasibility of potential developments to considering the potential social, skill-based and regulatory constraints. When the conclusions of the Technology Foresight Programme are published in a few months, its findings will affect the research priorities of government departments, research councils and higher education funding councils. Most areas of government research will be affected over the next few years. Other predicted outcomes of the programme are less obvious and do not depend directly on government action. The programme is expected to give companies a greater understanding of research conducted by the government, academics and other companies. Increased awareness of work in other sectors has been particular-ly valuable, says Hughes: 'One of the greatest values of this exercise is the networking among people from different industry groups.'</p>

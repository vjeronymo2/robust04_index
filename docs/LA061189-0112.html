			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HERMOSA BEACH TO BUY SURPLUS SCHOOL SITES  </P> <P> The Hermosa Beach school district is selling two surplus school sites for at  least $3.2 million, and the city plans to buy them for park use, city and  school officials said last week. Offered for sale are the 4.5-acre South School  on Valley Drive and five lots adjoining the Edith Rodaway Park on Prospect  Avenue next to the closed Prospect School. Mineral rights are not included.  </P> <P> School officials said income from the sale will be used to continue remodeling  and other improvements at the 700-student district's only remaining campus,  Hermosa Valley School.  </P> <P> Officials expect to complete the sales by the end of the year. Under provisions  of the proposed sale agreement, ownership of the sites would revert to the  school district if they are ever used for any purpose other than public open  space.  </P></p>

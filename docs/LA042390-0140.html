Late at night he plays in a jazz band  in a restaurant in Hollywood and in the morning he is a custodian for an office  building in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Since he doesn't require a lot of sleep, he goes to the track during the  afternoon and mingles with his cronies, who discuss the horses and music while  waiting between races.  </P> <P> If his friends should ask, the Music Man will tell them that he has been  playing the horses for the past 30 years and has experimented with every system  imaginable.  </P> <P> Also, he has followed the touts who sell their selections outside the tracks  and has followed the various professional handicappers who select horses for  the local newspapers.  </P> <P> As a result, he has discovered that neither the touts nor the newspaper  handicappers really are winners.

In addition to betting the Consensus nag,  he uses a money management system. To end up with a profit during the day's  nine-horse card, the Music Man maintains that he needs only one winner.  </P> <P> Once he achieves that winner, he leaves the track and goes home. If he feels  extremely lucky and the winner comes early in the day, he might stick around  and start his betting system over again. Most of the time, however, he'll take  his winnings and run.  </P> <P> On March 8, 1990, at Santa Anita, the Consensus in The Times came up with one  winner.

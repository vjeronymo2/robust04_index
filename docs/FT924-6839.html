			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Observer: Eurospeak? 'Subsidiarity' is child's play compared with some of the Eurospeak terms bandied about by former top OECD official David Henderson in his lecture on European Community developments at the London School of Economics. One was 'deepening', approfondissement in French, signifying a strengthening of central control in the EC so decision-making does not become paralysed by being spread among too many member states. Another he cited was acquis communautaire - the principle that new entrants to the Community must accept everything countries already in it have previously agreed. Not content with those, however, he suggested that at least two more will be needed if the EC continues to expand. The first was desacquisition, or ditching unwanted acquis such as the Common Agricultural Policy. The second was deprofondissement, the opposite of deepening. Although Observer's pedantry specialist thinks the latter should be desapprofondissement, it's to be hoped that Henderson proves right.</p>

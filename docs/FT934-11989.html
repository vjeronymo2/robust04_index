			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Telmex climbs 15% in quarter TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's largest private company, reported net profits of 2.38bn new pesos (Dollars 765m) in the third quarter, a 15.3 per cent increase in real terms over the same period last year. Telmex benefited from a strong gain in local and long distance telephone traffic in the third quarter, despite Mexico's sluggish economic growth. Local revenues rose in real terms by 12.1 per cent compared with the third quarter last year, long distance revenues by 9.3 per cent, and international revenues by 5.1 per cent. The monopoly telephone company installed 194,000 new lines in the quarter, bringing the total in service to 7,276,528. New line installation is running slightly ahead of the 12 per cent growth required under the government concession. Operating profits rose by a more modest 3.5 per cent in the quarter after a 37.8 per cent advance in operating and maintenance expenses. The increase in costs pushed margins down to 42.8 per cent from 45.6 per cent in the third quarter last year, according to Baring Securities. Telmex said costs rose largely because of its programme of renovating outside cables, replacing obsolete equipment and substituting analog with digital lines. It said there were additional third-quarter costs from training its workforce. Telcel, the cellular subsidiary, which faces tougher competition after Bell Atlantic took a stake in the rival company Iusacell, increased subscribers to 193,851. This was just 2,547 more subscribers than in the second quarter, suggesting that the phenomenal growth of the company in past three years is coming to an end.</p>

The representative of the opposition group, Jacques  Bihozagara, was met at the airport by Maria Pia Fanfani,  president of the Insieme per la Pace (Together for Peace)  organisation which managed to get the refugees, which included  75 orphaned children and the Rwandan national soccer team, out  of the war-torn country.    Bihozagara said he was in Rome "to thank the Italian  Government and people, which have already done so much for  Rwanda, but also to explain the situation in my country, and the  need to get medicines, healthcare aid and food as soon as  possible."    Fanfani said that her organisation was working with the  Italian Government on plans to send aid ships to Rwanda.  [passage omitted]</p>

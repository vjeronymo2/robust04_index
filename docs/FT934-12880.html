			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Brazil's budget moves backed MR Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, has won limited support from President Itamar Franco for a set of measures designed to balance the country's budget. But there is concern among business groups and foreign investors that Mr Cardoso is acting too slowly and that his measures will be insufficient to tackle Brazil's annualised inflation rate of close to 2,000 per cent. Following a meeting of senior ministers late last week, President Franco said he would support the extension of Brazil's privatisation programme and stressed the need to wipe out the government's budget deficit, otherwise expected to reach Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.5bn) next year. Details of the new measures are due to be published soon. The president's announcement was seen as only a partial victory for Mr Cardoso, who faces strong opposition from other ministers. The privatisation programme, which has successfully sold off Brazil's steel industry, is now expected to be extended to the electricity sector as well as the state railways. But Companhia do Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining concern, is unlikely to be included, as it appears to be too divisive politically. The two most sensitive state monopolies, the telecommunications and petroleum companies Telebras and Petrobras, are protected from privatisation by the 1988 constitution. A constitutional revision now under way has been delayed by a corruption scandal and Congress is divided on whether the companies should be opened to competition. Mr Cardoso and his economic team are expected to try to wipe out this year's budget deficit of about Dollars 6bn immediately through tax measures. Steps to address next year's shortfall will need the approval of Congress, which will be difficult in an election year. One idea being considered is a new, higher-rate tax bracket to target the country's wealthy. 'The minister felt he was successful. He would have liked more, but that is politics,' one of his assistants said. Mr Cardoso's moves were cautiously welcomed by the business community, although there is concern about the privatisation programme and that spending cuts are more important than tax-raising measures. 'Brazil is already one of the most heavily taxed countries in the world. What we need is political agreement on cutting government's costs,' one Sao Paulo businessman said.</p>

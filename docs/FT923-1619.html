			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Sterling weakness hits punt THE prospect of a realignment of the Irish punt, despite emphatic rejections of such a measure by the Dublin government, continued to put the currency and Irish government bonds under pressure yesterday as markets grappled with the implications of France's narrow Yes vote. The punt fell to its floor of DM2.619 in the European exchange rate mechanism again yesterday, in thin trading, but heavy dealings were reported in government stock. The weakness in sterling is the key factor bearing down on the Irish currency. More than 30 per cent of Irish exports go to the UK. Mr Brendan Lynch, a senior economist at the specialist bonds trading firm Bloxham in Dublin, said: 'The market is very bearish. There is a prospect of realignment hanging over the market. Where sterling is going is very important to us.' He said trading in Irish government bonds yesterday was again high. The benchmark nine-year 2001 stock, in which German investors are most active, has seen its yield rise by 0.6 points to 9.57 per cent in the last week, indicating heavy selling pressure. The longer-term stocks, mostly held by Irish institutions, have seen yields rise by around 0.3 points in the past week. 'There are similarities between now and 1986, when tremendous weakness of sterling forced a unilateral realignment of the punt within the ERM,' Mr Lynch said. Sterling fell by some 16 per cent against the punt in late 1985 and early 1986, before a devaluation of the punt was forced on the Irish authorities. Sterling has now fallen by almost 12 per cent against the punt since the summer. Mr Alan McCarthy, chief executive of the Irish Trade Board, said: 'It is clear the profitability of Irish exporters to Britain will suffer in the short term and there will be increased pressure in the Irish market as British firms become more competitive here.' He said that over the past five years Irish exports to Britain, excluding automatic data processing equipment, had increased by 83 per cent. For indigenous Irish companies the UK market accounts for 45 per cent of exports, and 30.7 per cent of Irish exports overall. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, again emphasised yesterday there would be no devaluation of the punt and said the turbulence of recent weeks 'demonstrates the need and benefits of a single European central bank and a single European currency'. The sooner there was a single currency the better, he added. He conceded at the weekend, however, that should sterling fall by more than 14 per cent against the punt this would erode all the margin of competitiveness that Ireland had built up against the UK economy over the past five years.</p>

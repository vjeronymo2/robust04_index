"We now have firm control of our army and we can guarantee  the safety of foreigners in our republic, but in the event of an  attack elements of chaos would emerge and I am not sure that any  foreigners in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be safe -- not because we  would issue such orders, but because the people would treat  foreigners as enemies, which they really would be, in a way,"  Karadzic said.    Speaking about the letter sent to NATO by UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali, Karadzic said that such a reaction in fact  encouraged the Muslims to reapply the same war methodology, for  -- as he put it -- this was not the first massacre, and it was  established that some had been committed by the Muslims  themselves [sentence as received]. Karadzic said that the Serbs  completely understand the emotional side of this tragedy, which  they have condemned in the most vehement terms.    "We demand a rigorous investigation to identify the  perpetrators of the crime -- once that has been done the  international community will not have to grope in the dark.  This is why this case should be investigated in great detail,  not only from the ballistic, but also from the forensic aspect  for there are some indications that this was another case of a  stage-managed event," President Karadzic said.</p>

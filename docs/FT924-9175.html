			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Putting a reputation on the line - Greg Hutchings, the man behind the latest RHM bid MR GREG Hutchings has a very clear idea of what the conglomerate he has been building for the last nine years is in business to make. It is not bicycles from Tomkins' Murray operation in the US; it is not hand guns at Smith &amp; Wesson; and it will not be cakes or bread should his Pounds 935m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall be successful. 'What we are trying to do is create a better product than other companies. The product is better capital growth and dividend growth,' says the 45 year-old Hutchings. 'Our investors are our customers.' To drum home this message Hutchings has been criss-crossing the City with evangelical zeal preaching the Tomkins gospel to institutional investors. After initial concern, many are born again believers or at least swinging round to give him the benefit of the doubt. It is therefore all the more surprising that he is so shaken and angered by dissenters in the flock. One adviser said Hutchings was 'outraged', another that he was 'stunned', when Tomkins' share price dropped 20 per cent last Thursday after he announced the recommended bid and accompanying rights issue. His former boss, Lord Hanson, yesterday said he would not increase his own Pounds 790m bid as Tomkins' bid was already too high. Hutchings put together his strategy 11 years ago after a clinical analysis of what the stock market craves and how best to feed that craving. 'It is better to pay a low price for something that is average and improve it than to pay a high price for something that is growing very fast,' he says. Mature businesses spread across a broad spectrum offered the lowest risk way of providing growth. In a sense he and Tomkins are a creation of the City. The investors fund his deals and he sings their tune or, as he says, recognises that 'every quarter the fund manager has to report to a man above him.' A normally affable man, his composure has, however, been upset during the bid; he testily rejects criticism he thinks is coming from some quarters that Tomkins' impressive earnings and dividend growth has been achieved 'with mirrors.' He steadfastly refuses to make any comments about Lord Hanson, having had to live with the headline 'son of Hanson' since he arrived in the City. But like it or not, comparisons are inevitable between the old and the new masters of the takeover game. When discussing Tomkins, however, he is usually relaxed, almost clubby. It is a manner that many older captains of industry would simply not be able to carry off. Probe his strategy, however, or question whether making commodity bread or branded groceries is really the same as selling bicycles and hand guns and Hutchings becomes distinctly prickly. Advisers say Hutchings, though a good listener, is simply not used to his approach being questioned as rigorously as it has been since the bid. The share price fall may have grated for another reason. Hutchings is intensely competitive, and not just on the hockey field or at the table tennis table. As one adviser says, 'he has a tremendous rivalry with Williams Holdings.' For a long time there were two charts on Hutchings' Putney office wall - one for Tomkins, one for Williams. Hutchings denies it was there and says he is sick and tired of the comparisons. The origin of this rivalry stems from the two groups' climb to FT-SE 100 status in the mid 1980s. The two have since parted company, with Williams' star in relative decline after its failed bid for Racal Electronics last year. But they share common origins. As one Hutchings' adviser says, 'Hutchings was one of the 1980s young turks - there were the Abdullahs at Evered; there was Williams Holdings; there was Suter and David Abell. They were all small acquisitive companies paddling around with high p/e's and they all had to make a big jump.' The jump that took Hutchings into the big time was the acquisition in 1986 of Pegler Hattersley, a huge Pounds 190m buy relative to Tomkins' then size. One Hutchings characteristic that came through strongly during this bid, and started to distinguish him from other young turks, was the meticulously prepared presentation of his case to institutional shareholders. This approach has not changed. Always the emphasis is on the strength of management. Until now, he has successfully argued that this is why Tomkins is rated at a premium to the market rather than as a group comprising mature companies. His presentational skills did not, initially at least convince Mr Ian Duncan, the financial brain who is a crucial element of the Tomkins success. Now Tomkins' managing director of finance and 'Greg's harshest critic as well as his greatest fan,' Duncan had the opportunity to hire Hutchings but turned him down. 'I had just started as the group finance director at Pentos in 1981,' he says. 'Greg had a nice shiny MBA and wanted to get into corporate finance. He had not got any experience but there was something about the guy. I told him you are one of the few MBAs who looks like you will go off and buy a company and run it but in the interim I suggest you go off and get some experience.' While Hutchings has clearly borrowed Hanson's clothes - in the way he buys and manages mature companies, squeezing cash and keeping a tight control on investment - there are important differences. Tomkins, for example, has sold less than Pounds 10m worth of businesses since 1984 while it has spent over Pounds 750m on acquisitions. But this is where non-believers part company, questioning whether Tomkins actually grows businesses after the initial phase of stripping out costs and installing better financial control. Hutchings says there is ample evidence to the contrary. The approach has not changed since his first acquisition in 1984 of Ferraris, a run-down car pistons distributor supplying a declining market. Firstly, new reporting systems were put in and management incentives were increased. More importantly, in the second phase, the management was encouraged to find new markets. Ferraris is still growing, Hutchings says. Hutchings' sensitivity is perhaps understandable. 'I love Tomkins and there are people who are out to destroy it,' he says. For a conservative man who is a self-confessed worrier, the RHM bid constitutes the biggest risk since he bid for Pegler Hattersley five years ago. And then, he had a smaller reputation on the line.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgium is withdrawing its blue helmets from Rwanda.  This has just been decided by the Council of Ministers. The  government will however consult with the United Nations about  the practical implementation of that decision.    The Council of Ministers judges that the UN mission in  Rwanda  has become pointless. Because of the recent dramatic events,  the peace and democatization process in Rwanda has come to an  end. That is why the government urges the suspension of the UN  mandate. Moreover, the anti-Belgian witch-hunt makes the work of  the blue helmets impossible, the Council of Ministers argues.</p>

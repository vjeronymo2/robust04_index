			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Putting all the potatoes into one frying basket - Bensons Crisps' plan to centralise its production MR SIDNEY Benson was not the kind of man to let the second world war deprive the people of Wigan of their crisps. When Smiths, virtually the only UK volume crisp maker in the 1940s, slashed production because of a wartime shortage of vegetable oil, the fish and chip shop proprietor used lard to make his own, and Bensons crisps were born. Today Bensons Crisps is the fourth-largest quoted savoury snack maker in a UK market, worth about Pounds 1.4bn. The company, however, has recently launched an ambitious investment programme to try to secure its future. It is moving the bulk of its production from three factories and a warehouse in Kirkham, Lancashire, to a purpose built plant nearby to increase output and raise efficiency to match that of its much larger competitors. Bensons believes it will be one of the most efficient snack producers in the country when production begins at the end of this year. The investment will total about Pounds 9.7m, funded by a Pounds 5.3m rights issue topped up by lease finance. The plant will help Bensons, which ceased to be a family-owned business in the late 1970s, to overcome its main problem - lack of size. It claims a 5 per cent market share compared with the top three crisp makers, which are all multinationals. Pepsico and United Biscuits are vying for market leadership, and both claim more than 40 per cent. Dalgety comes a clear third with 13 per cent. Without the efficiency gains from volume production available to its larger rivals, the company's capacity to remain competitive is questionable. With operations split between two factories and a warehouse site in Kirkham and one factory in Newport, Gwent, the question marks over its future had multiplied. Then also, in the late-1980s, the market began changing rapidly and Bensons did not. Consumers moved away from the company's tradi-tional sales ground of independent retailers selling single packets of crisps and began choosing instead lower margin multipacks sold through supermarkets. The big multiples now account for almost 50 per cent of retail sales. In 1992 pre-tax profit margins were 1.5 per cent, against 6.9 per cent in 1989. Pre-tax profits dropped to Pounds 500,000 from Pounds 1m in 1991 while turnover advanced more than a quarter to Pounds 33.2m. Over the past five years Bensons has seen a number of independent operators absorbed by larger competitors. Mr Malcolm Jones, managing director, considered but then abandoned the idea of selling up. He says: 'We knew we would have to do something, and we really had two options: sell up, or invest in a greenfield site. We chose to invest. It is the option that is four times harder, but we think it could be more than four times as rewarding for shareholders and employees.' Bensons has spent more than Pounds 5m in the past six years on re-equipping, and will transfer much of that machinery to the new plant. The total investment, however, is less than three quarters the sum that the Snack Factory, a privately-owned company 40 miles away, has spent on a greenfield plant in Skelmersdale, which it claims is Europe's most efficient snack producer. Bensons' new 9.8 acre site will allow for improved materials flow and greater capacity. It will replace, for example, an existing 700kg per hour fryer with one that can handle 2,000kg per hour. The fryer will feed automated packaging systems which can respond flexibly to the order flow. Bensons hopes the greater efficiency will allow it to make cost savings of between 10 and 13 per cent, or roughly Pounds 1m a year. The new facility should mean a changed sales mix. It now sells 40 per cent of its turnover to supermarkets, another 10 per cent of sales are made through van rounds, with the remaining 50 per cent to wholesale cash and carry businesses. It is negotiating with the big multiples and says it has had encouraging signals about increasing supplies. When the new plant is in operation Bensons expects 60 per cent of its turnover will go to supermarkets, with 40 per cent sold through the independent sector. It is a bold strategy, which although based on sound assumptions about how technology can improve efficiency, depends crucially on factors which Bensons, like everyone else in the market, cannot control. It will remain vulnerable, though, to aggressive pricing by a small number of large competitors and the significant price pressures exerted by the leading multiples. Bensons argues, however, that its increased competitiveness will mitigate the effect of external pressures. Mr John Hase, savoury snack specialist with PA Consulting Group, said: 'It is a very competitive business and the big players are very serious, particularly Pepsico and United Biscuits, about dominating the market. With competition like that it will not be an easy job to carve out and maintain an adequate and profitable market share.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by "P.S."; </F> place and date not given: "Moralism Is Often an Easy Way Out"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LIBERATION] Why did you  decide to normalize relations with China as soon as you took  over at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] in April 1993?    [Juppe] You cannot continue a quarrel with a country like  China for many obvious reasons -- economic, political,  strategic, demographic, and so forth. In addition, the dialogue  had been broken off without there being any major difference  between our foreign policies. It was a question of aircraft and  frigates -- an issue which was certainly not inconsiderable for  our industries, but which did not justify this quarrel lasting  more than two years. Especially in view of the fact that it is  not impossible to gain on this side (China) what we have lost on  the other (Taiwan).    [LIBERATION] And yet no promise of contracts is expected  from this visit.    [Juppe] It is not a commercial visit. There is a great deal  of work to be done to regain ground and that will take time.  The aim is simply to improve a political climate which had  deteriorated greatly.    [LIBERATION] Are you writing off human rights and the memory  of the 1989 massacre in Beijing?    [Juppe] No. We will be accused of that, of course. But I  will discuss it as I have already done each time I have received  Mr. Qian Qichen (Chinese foreign minister). When Vietnam  becomes one of our foreign policy priorities, in what terms is  the human rights problem raised? We condemn the situation, we  express our demands, but we are nonetheless making Vietnam one  of our main targets.    [LIBERATION] Does that not present you with a problem?    [Juppe] Does it present a problem to the United States,  which has still not questioned the most favored nation clause  which it has granted to China? It has already closed the  Tienanmen Square chapter. I met with the Dalai Lama (spiritual  and religious leader of Tibet living in exile in India) during  his stopover in Paris. What we are saying is clear, we are not  abandoning any of our principles. But I do not conclude from  that that we should close the door on China. Or, if we do, we  would have to quarrel with three-fourths of the world. We would  be on our own.    [LIBERATION] In practice, what are you going to do?    [Juppe] Tell the Chinese leaders during our talks that this  problem worries us. Possibly give lists of names (of political  prisoners) to draw attention to particular prisoners, as we have  done in many other countries.    [LIBERATION] Why impose sanctions on South Africa, propose  sanctions against North Korea, and not against China?    [Juppe] No country in the world has suggested that the  Security Council should impose sanctions against China. In  South Africa's case, there was a consensus on the part of the  whole international community. Why stand alone in the case of  China?    [LIBERATION] Do you think that China is moving in the right  direction in this sphere?    [Juppe] Compared with the Tienanmen Square period, the  progress is inadequate but it exists. But I believe very firmly  in the logic of modernization and development. What is  happening in China will make the system of repression untenable.  It is this card we must play. While, of course, ensuring that  it does not take another 50 years. Even if the Chinese time  frame is not exactly the same as ours.    [LIBERATION] Do you think France was wrong to welcome and  help the Chinese dissidents after 1989?    [Juppe] No. We can help them, and the Chinese must be told  that we are not happy with the current situation. We must find  a balance between indifference and excessive zeal. Of course,  it is not easy. Moralism is often an easy way out.</p>

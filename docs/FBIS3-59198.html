			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Large losses in its  steelmaking division pushed the entire Thyssen group deep into  the red last year. Thyssen AG announced today when presenting  its annual accounts for the financial year, which ended on 30th  September 1993, that its losses of 994 million German marks [DM]  represented a new record in the company's history.    A year ago, the group, with its three divisions, steel,  capital goods, and commerce, generated an annual surplus of  DM348 million. Thyssen cut around 12,000 jobs in its domestic  companies, and employed a worldwide workforce of 133,800 at the  end of December. The steel and capital goods divisions were  particularly affected by job losses. Staff cuts would continue  in these sectors, Thyssen said.    The board of management described the results as "wholly  unsatisfactory." The company added that its worldwide turnover  during the 1992/93 financial year fell 6 percent to DM33.5  billion. However, turnover during the first quarter of the  1993/94 financial year rose again by 1.2 percent to DM8.1  billion. Turnover shrank in the steel and capital goods  divisions by 7 and 10 percent respectively. Economic results  for the period October to December 1993 remained marked by high  steel sector losses. The company is expecting largely negative  results for the whole of this year, albeit with "continuous  improvement each quarter."</p>

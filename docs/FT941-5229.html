			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Housing starts increase by 16% The number of new homes started by builders is still well ahead of the levels of 12 months ago, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. Builders, started work on 41,000 houses and flats - allowing for seasonal adjustments - during the three months to the end of January. This was 16 per cent more than the corresponding period a year earlier. The rise is from a very low base and compares with a deeply depressed housing market at the end of 1992 after Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. Since then there has been a steady rise in house building although the increase in general house sales has been less marked. Private and public-sector house starts last year rose by 18.5 per cent, the first annual increase since 1988. Private-sector starts for the three months to the end of January fell by 1 per cent compared with the previous three months but were 27 per cent higher than the corresponding period a year earlier. Work began on 31,900 private-sector homes - accounting for three-quarters of all starts made by builders. Starts made on housing association homes - most of the rest of the market - were marginally higher than the previous three months but 8 per cent lower than the corresponding period 12 months ago. Spending by housing associations is expected to fall this year following public-spending cuts announced in the Budget. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest housebuilders, said yesterday: 'The environment department figures confirm the uplift we are currently witnessing which we expect to continue on the basis that affordability in real terms is at its lowest for at least a decade.'</p>

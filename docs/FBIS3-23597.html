			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel A. Piskunov, candidate of economic </F> sciences, senior instructor, Frunze Military Academy, under  rubric "Military Economics"]    [Text] The cessation of global confrontation of the two  superpowers is noteworthy in the fact that assurance of national  security today is linked to a large extent with resolution not  so much of military as of economic problems. The concept of  economic security has appeared in this connection;  its content encompasses a wide spectrum of purely economic  phenomena affecting survivability, strengthening of society's  social and political stability, and strengthening of the state's  international positions.    Military, technological, raw material, ecologic and  sociopolitical components of Russia's security largely form  under the influence of government economic policy and of  processes occurring in the national economy (see the functional  diagram of conversion). Therefore it is quite an obvious fact  that conversion also may substantially affect both  national security as a whole as well as its components. The  problem is to ensure that transformations in the  defense sector contribute most effectively to realization of  Russian Federation national-state interests.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-62A>           Functional Diagram of Conversion </FIG>          It may appear that a reduction in military production that  is  forced (not so much politically as economically) will entail an  inevitable weakening of national military might, but let us  recall that it was this might that for decades undermined the  foundations of the civilian economy, which was not only  administrative-bureaucratic, but also simply poorly developed  and technologically backward. Under these conditions a  very important requirement of economic security is  that reduced military production volumes be compensated through  modernization and growth of the civilian sector of the economy  by concentrating the "conversion potential" in those sectors of  the national economy which set the tone for S&amp;T progress and  determine prospects for society's industrial and social  development.    Let us recall that we began conversion with neither a  serious  theoretical foundation nor substantiated plans and programs.  This determined the complexity of its practical implementation.  In essence, our conversion strides ahead of theory with but one  purpose--to close gaping breaches in the economy as quickly as  possible and at any cost.    But we already are seeing a transition from general euphoria  concerning the socioeconomic capacities of conversion to more  weighed assessments of the costs of its implementation, its  speed and its depth. Calculations show that it is  implausible to expect a serious return in the next 2-3  years. Costs of renovating and changing the specialties of  enterprises will be rather considerable in many cases. The  depth of conversion is no simple matter. What is its  optimum value that ensures a socioeconomic effect and preserves  sufficient mobilization readiness of the military sector of the  economy?    The question of the speed of conversion also is no  less important. The opinion of specialists is that if we act in  a vigorous, considered manner, then conversion of the defense  industry will take at least 5-6 years.    A number of stages is envisaged. The first (1.5-2 years) is  passage of legislative measures, scientific substantiation of  programs and plans, and creation of conversion management  structures. The second (3-4 years) is development of the  economic machinery of conversion with consideration for ensuring  the necessary level of mobilization readiness. And the third (in  6 years) is real economic return.    The present conversion is for now very far from its  principal objective of strengthening national  economic security based on increased competitiveness of domestic  products on the world market. The obvious interrelationship of  conversion and economic aspects of national security makes  transformations in the defense complex a task of strategic  importance. In carrying out conversion one must not lose  sight of ensuring the necessary level of Army and Navy combat  readiness.    From a military-economic standpoint, conversion  effectiveness can be achieved only if  military-economic principles are implemented along  with socioeconomic ones in conducting it: Assurance of a  sufficient level of mobilization readiness in conversion  enterprises; flexibility of conversion programs and plans for  accomplishing a possible maneuver; optimum combination of the  interests of national socioeconomic development and an increase  in qualitative parameters of the Armed Forces; priority  orientation of conversion enterprises in the military sector of  the economy toward satisfying socioeconomic needs of servicemen  and their families.    Consideration of these principles will permit minimizing  conversion's negative influence on material foundations of Army  and Navy combat effectiveness and combat readiness.    The role of conversion in Russia's economic revival and  national security grows even more as a result of the delay in  the West giving financial aid to our reform. In the opinion of  many domestic and foreign experts, granting of a credit of three  billion by the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and creation of  a ruble stabilization fund are being postponed for an indefinite  period. Under these conditions Russia simply has no one to count  on except internal reserves. The production and S&amp;T  potential of  conversion enterprises thus can become the key to solving  economic security problems. Here are just a few figures: Up  until recently the defense complex produced 92 percent of  equipment for light industry, 76 percent of equipment for  agricultural machine building enterprises and 83 percent of  medical equipment. As of the beginning of 1993 the defense  complex provided 100 percent of television sets, sewing machines  and cameras; 98 percent of tape recorders and refrigerators; 95  percent of computers; and 81 percent of motor units [motoblok].    Considering the enormous importance of the defense complex  for the Russian economy as a whole, it is legitimate to view  conversion essentially as a synonym for a structural policy  followed within the scope of economic reform. In essence we are  speaking of a dual understanding of conversion. Viewed in  the broad sense, it coincides in content with  transformation of the entire economic system and represents a  transition from a deeply militarized state economy to a market  economy. But in the narrow sense conversion usually  is interpreted as a structural perestroyka affecting only  military production.    But economic reform in Russia is slipping. In excluding  serious state intervention and effective structural policy for  now, it essentially caused spontaneous, poorly  regulated conversion which has given rise to a threat not only  to national defense capability, but also to the entire  industrial and technological potential.    In our view, in the situation at hand it is necessary to  localize military production at a limited number of enterprises  forming the nucleus of the defense complex. That is  first. Second, no more than ten percent of existing specialized  enterprises should be included in this nucleus. A second layer  (approximately 30 percent) should be made up of enterprises with  "mixed" production, and the order for their manufacture of  products should be formed primarily on a contract  [kontraktnyy] basis. The other defense complex enterprises  receive full independence, with fulfillment of military orders  on an agreement [dogovornyy] basis.    Third, the nucleus of defense complex enterprises, which is  concentrated in Russia, should have a territorially closed  technological cycle for selected models of weapons and military  equipment. Participation of enterprises of other CIS countries  in cooperation in arms production is advisable based on ordinary  contractual [dogovornyy] relations, but it is also necessary to  take into account here the risk of destroying inter-republic  economic ties and deliveries because of a complication of  political relations. That is fourth.    Fifth, it is reasonable to reject today's existing demands  for keeping reserve capacities in readiness and localize this  problem in the defense complex nucleus. And sixth is the  activation of arms and military equipment exports as an  important factor of supporting the Russian defense complex.    All this dictates the need for changing general approaches  to  conversion. What can be done in today's far from simple  situation?    Appropriate conditions must be created for  reliable functioning of defense enterprises in a transition to  the market, and their support, including direct and indirect  measures, must be ensured. Direct measures are state  budget appropriations for creating arms and for conversion,  state orders, and requirements established by directive on  certain kinds of activity connected with strengthening defense  capability. Indirect measures take in many spheres:  Economic (determining benefits and so on); organizational  (creating public and commercial organizations to assist  conversion enterprises); legislative (adopting laws, edicts and  other legal documents regulating the sale of stocks and  privatization and conversion of enterprises); information  (creating data banks, advertising) and so on.    It stands to reason that implementation of these measures  requires formation of a conversion market  infrastructure, including such elements as, for example,  commodities and raw materials exchanges which resolve  problems of material and technical supply and sale of products  of conversion enterprises. Financial support  organizations (investment funds, specialized banks which  guarantee investments, provide insurance, and conduct securities  operations) also are called upon to play an important role. One  cannot get by without functional cost-accounting  organizations, which will assume responsibility for certain  kinds of activity--foreign economic (including the weapons  trade), reference information, marketing, advertising and  publishing, security measures and so on.    Independent organizations and councils (a unique  "conversion lobby") should develop priorities and an agreed-upon  policy on conversion directions and assist in passage of  appropriate bills, and consulting bureaus should  assist in developing and implementing conversion programs  through various services: Information analysis, consulting,  auditing and so on. The State Committee on Conversion Affairs,  the IMF, the VPIK [Military-Industrial Investment Company] and  the RIAO [Russian Investment Stock Company] already are  functioning in Russia. According to estimates made by these  organizations, the volume of capital investments for conversion  during 1991-1995 is projected to be R50 billion (in 1990 prices).    Analyzing results of the first stage of reform, it can be  said that "shock therapy" hardly is applicable for such a  rigidly centralized formation as the defense complex. In our  view, a well thought out, echeloned conversion program would  allow not only preserving and transforming the defense  industry's scientific research and technological nucleus, but  also would help strengthen the economic foundations of national  security.    Specialists call breaking out of the crisis by using  capacities of the defense complex the "conversion  leap" of the economy. Such "leaps" were observed in the  United States, Germany and Japan following World War II. The  present Russian economy also retains potential capabilities, but  it should be borne in mind that, as we already noted, conversion  requires enormous outlays. In this connection I would like to  cite one more opinion of experts: Under present conditions a  reduction of 1 ruble in the military order involves 1.5 rubles  needed to finance conversion measures. Hence the growing  importance of commercialization and self-financing of defense  sector enterprises which are changing specialization.    The following conclusions can be drawn from what has been  said: Conversion of military production must be given the status  of state economic policy. Attempts to orient the  production and economic might of the military-industrial complex  toward consumer goods production must be precluded, for this  would signify destruction of our national wealth.    A portion of the military-industrial complex (the "defense  nucleus") should be preserved in its initial purpose of  strengthening Russia's new defense policy. And the main  thing at which conversion enterprises should be aimed is  the use of technological and professional potential for  designing, manufacturing and introducing supermodern  technological systems for manufacturing civilian products. In my  view, taking these suggestions into account will permit ensuring  Russia's dependable military-economic security.    COPYRIGHT: "Voyenno-ekonomicheskiy zhurnal", 1993.</p>

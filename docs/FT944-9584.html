			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survival of Irish coalition comes under growing threat The survival of Ireland's Fianna Fail-led coalition government was under increasing threat last night, with senior government officials predicting its collapse. The crisis throws fresh doubt over the future pace of the Northern Ireland peace process. As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was outlining proposals to bring Ulster's loyalist groups into the talks process in a speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, was preparing for a parliamentary showdown today with his Labour party partners. The crisis, triggered by Labour's opposition to Mr Reynolds' proposed appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court, looks certain to end the 22-month coalition. Mr Reynolds was in consultation with his Fianna Fail ministers yesterday. If the crisis is unresolved and Mr Reynolds loses a vote of no confidence he could seek the permission of Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, to dissolve parliament, and call early elections. Alternatively, and some political observers believed this more likely yesterday, Mrs Robinson could ask the opposition parties to form a government with Labour. Mrs Robinson is understood to have taken legal advice yesterday. The prospective collapse of the Dublin government threatens to halt progress on the joint framework document being negotiated by the UK and Irish governments for a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. But in a remark hinting at the possible break-up of the coalition, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister and Labour leader, said: 'The momentum towards peace this opportunity offers as a prospect is beyond attack by any form of government or political party.' After a meeting with Mr Spring in Dublin yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that progress had been made, although he refused to be drawn on a date for completion of the framework document. The UK government aims to start exploratory talks with loyalist political representatives before the end of the year, Mr Major announced yesterday. Speaking in London, he confirmed that the government was ready to begin talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, by the end of the year. His remarks were welcomed across the political divide in Ulster. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'These talks should happen as quickly as possible so that the preliminary elements can be dealt with.' However, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, described Mr Major's speech as 'wholly inadequate' and attacked him for 'still talking about talks'.

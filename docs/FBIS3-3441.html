			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- One cannot use human  rights as a pretext for sticking one's nose into the internal  affairs of other countries, according to a signed article in  today's "GUANGMING" DAILY [GUANGMING RIBAO].    While calling for an end to this practice, the article said  that some people abroad would always like to use human rights as  a pretext and flagrantly interfere in China's domestic affairs.    Time and again they put forward lists of names of allegedly  persecuted people of various kinds and ask, in disregard of the  laws of China, for earlier release of prisoners on the lists.  They threaten otherwise to impose sanctions on China or to  cancel certain favorable treatment.    A country must have its own laws and regulations compatible  with its internal conditions, the article said. "It is  universally acknowledged that people who break the laws must be  punished according to relevant laws in that country."    It is unacceptable, even though it is laughable, that the  lists of names of such alleged victims of human rights and the  so-called facts published are often based merely on hearsay and  rumors.    For instance, some of the people on the lists are just  described as having the name of so and so, with no other  detailed information such as age, address or origin.    On some occasions, the handful of overseas critics simply  distort the facts and stick labels of high-sounding noble causes  -- such as for the cause of democracy or for political  differences or for religious beliefs -- on listed criminals who  have actually been convicted in China of various crimes, such as  arson or murder.    These foreigners with ulterior motives falsely allege that  criminals who are actually receiving fair treatment and enjoying  sound health have been cruelly tortured and are on the verge of  death.    China rules itself, and will always do so, only in  accordance  with its own laws and regulations. Others may have different  opinions about such laws and regulations, but they can never be  authorized to change them or to ask China to handle its domestic  affairs in line with the laws and decrees of another country.    People abroad who would like to use the laws and regulations  of their own country as a model and to force other countries to  accept these laws are in practice interfering in other  countries' affairs.    A country, as well as its laws, has its dignity. Relevant  bodies in China will put on trial people who have broken the law  on the Chinese mainland, in accordance with the laws and  regulations of China. The Chinese Government does not allow any  other foreign country to interfere in such affairs. All these  efforts are aimed at safeguarding the dignity of the country and  its laws, the article said.    It is a right and proper duty of all governments of  different  countries to defend their own laws and order, and vindicate the  political stability of their countries, but it is not justified  for some foreign people to stick their nose in China's domestic  affairs, the article stressed.</p>

This multiproject EIS was noticed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 6, 1993, and includes; Wisconsin Valley Project No. 2113, Rothschild Project No. 2212, Kings Dam Project No. 2239, Centralia Project No. 2255, Wisconsin Rapids Project No. 2256, Port Edwards Project No. 2291, Nekoosa Project No. 2292, Jersey Project No. 2476, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is conducting scoping for the Wausau Project to identify any significant issues related to the continued operation of this project. You are invited to send your written scoping comments on the Wausau Project to the Commission (see below). Staff will review all issues raised in the scoping process. Comments for the Wausau Project will be integrated with those received for the ongoing Wisconsin River Basin EIS. A public scoping meeting will not be held for the Wausau project, and a separate scoping document (beyond this notice) will not be prepared for Wausau.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission previously conducted 3 public scoping meetings (the week of July 12, 1993) and issued scoping documents (Scoping Document 1 in June 1993, Scoping Document 2 in September 1993, and Supplement to Scoping Document 2 in October 1993) for the ongoing Wisconsin River Basin nine-project EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicant proposes no new construction or increases in hydroelectric capacity for the Wausau Project. The Applicant proposes only a minor change in project operations. A 25 cubic feet per second (cfs) minimum flow through a kayak channel is proposed to enhance recreation and aesthetics. The project would continue to be operated in a run-of-river mode and maintain headpond levels on a daily basis within +/^ 0.3 feet of normal headpond elevation. The Applicant would continue a 0.5 feet drawdown during the winter to prevent water from splashing over the Taintor gates and forming ice on the braces. The Applicant would provide a new barrier-free fishing area for the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Project Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission Staff (Staff) will consider alternatives, including enhancement measures not proposed by the Applicant. The Staff will review and consider alternative recommendations for additional resource protection, or enhancement measures that may be appropriate to include in a new license. Modifications could include recommendations by the agencies, the general public, and the Staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these alternatives, Staff will evaluate the no-action alternative, which maintains the existing environment or status quo at the projects. Under this alternative the projects would continue to operate as required by the original license on an annual license basis, and no enhancement measures would be provided. We use this alternative to set baseline environmental conditions for comparison with other alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Environmental Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The geographic scope of analysis defines the physical limits or boundaries of the proposed actions' effects on the resources. Since the proposed actions affect each resource differently, the geographic scope for each resource varies. For fishery resources, flow analysis, water quality, flood control, and power, the geographic scope of analysis will encompass the main stem Wisconsin River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The temporal scope includes a discussion of the past, present, and future actions and their effects on the resources. Based on the license term, the temporal scope will look 30 to 50 years into the future, concentrating on the effect on the resource from reasonably foreseeable future actions (e.g., the effect on water quality from potential future water withdrawals within the basin). The historical discussion will, by necessity, be limited to the amount of available information for each resource.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A preliminary list of environmental issues identified by the Staff for coverage in the EIS is presented in this section. The list is not intended to be exhaustive or final, but is an initial listing of issues that have been raised and appear to be important. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and make decisions as to the level of analysis needed. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in this scoping document have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following issues apply to the Wausau Project:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reservoir water level fluctuation and drawdown limitations and their effect on fish habitat, riparian wetlands, wildlife, cultural resources, recreation, and shoreline development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Minimum flow needs for protection or enhancement of recreation, water quality, and the riverine fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fish passage needs at the dam. Fishery protection and enhancement measures related to turbine entrainment and fish mortality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Effects of project operation on vegetation and wildlife resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Impacts of project structures on visual resources and potential for enhancements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Opportunities for recreational facility improvements and public access enhancements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will assess the project-specific impacts on the above resources and whether these impacts contribute to significant adverse impacts. Both project-specific impacts and cumulative effects will weigh in selecting an action to recommend for the licensing decision on the projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EIS Preparation Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preliminary schedule for preparing the EIS for the Wausau Hydroelectric Projects is:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s75,xls75  -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Milestones  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Target date <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Public scoping  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Early spring 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draft EIS  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Late summer 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final EIS  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Winter 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's scoping objectives are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify significant environmental issues,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

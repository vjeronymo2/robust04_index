			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPECTFUL THE WORD FOR SAN GABRIEL RACE  </P> <P> The lawn signs, advertising homeowners' allegiance to their chosen candidates,  are up again. The candidates and their supporters are knocking on voters'  doors. It must be election time in San Gabriel.  </P> <P> But wait. There's something missing. Unlike the last bitterly fought City  Council election in April, 1988, and the two most recent special elections,  there has been a jarring absence of vitriol.  </P> <P> Mary Cammarano and Norm Stabeck, competing in a Sept. 12 election for the  council seat vacated when Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak was successfully recalled  in May, have been downright respectful of each other. In fact, the most hotly  fought issue of the campaign so far has been the candidates' respective  experience and expertise.  </P> <P> "We've agreed that we want to keep it issue-oriented," said Richard Valverde,  Stabeck's campaign manager.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insults Traded  </P> <P> "You'd hardly know there was an election going on," added Stabeck. "When you go  out knocking on doors, people are saying: 'What? We have to go through this  again? We just went through one.' "  </P> <P> In the last council election, in which a slate of three slow-growth candidates  swept three incumbents out of office, competing sides called each other  "radical extremists" and "major developers." In the May recall election,  Blaszcak was voted out of office amid charges that he offered to sell drugs to  a Santa Ana police officer, charges that are now the subject of a libel suit.  </P> <P> "The people of San Gabriel don't deserve what's happened in the past," said  Cammarano, referring to recent mud-slinging campaigns.  </P> <P> Despite some disdain for each other's qualifications, Cammarano and Stabeck  have stayed low-key. At times, they sound remarkably alike. Both support open  government and restraints on some forms of development. And both are urging  that the faction-racked council stick to city business.  </P> <P> The City Council is approving a new General Plan for the city, which has  operated under a voter-approved moratorium on development for 20 months. The  moratorium is scheduled to be lifted in December.  </P> <P> Cammarano, office manager for Local 923 of the Cement Masons Union, moved to  San Gabriel from Buffalo, N.Y., 25 years ago. This is her first run for office,  but she has been involved in volunteer organizations since she arrived in the  city, starting with the PTA. All five of her children are grown.  </P> <P> She is president of the American Field Service, volunteer chairman for the  local chapter of the American Red Cross and a board member for the San Gabriel  Historical Assn. And she has been attending City Council meetings for 22 years,  always ready to speak out from the perspective of longtime San Gabriel  homeowners.  </P> <P> Cammarano supported Blaszcak's recall, publicly crossing swords with the  controversial vice mayor about, among other things, his purchase of a portable  telephone at city expense.  </P> <P> There are no radical differences between herself and Stabeck, Cammarano said,  except in their respective lengths of service to San Gabriel. "I've been in  town 25 years; he's been here three years," she said. "That's important."  (Actually, Stabeck has been a resident for seven years, three at his current  address in the northern part of the city.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not for Slow Growth  </P> <P> Despite being a former member of Citizens for Responsible Development,  Cammarano is not a slow-growth proponent, she insists. She favors "quality  development," though she wants to see more restrictions on oversized houses on  small lots. "With some of the homes they're building, you have to look twice to  see if they're really single-family," she said.  </P> <P> She also favors voluntary recycling and synchronizing traffic lights to improve  traffic flow.  </P> <P> Stabeck, a financial analyst with the Orange County Transit District, also  stresses his experience: 15 years of "professional experience in local  government." He has been a member of the city Planning Commission since the  beginning of 1988. He has worked for the Southern California Assn. of  Governments as a transportation planner, as well as for the city of Glendale as  a planner.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission has been unusually effective during his tenure, Stabeck  said. The commission has produced a new city sign ordinance and a design review  committee, and it has helped draft the new General Plan.  </P> <P> But the city is at a turning point, Stabeck said. Because of its location  "between residential communities to the east and employment centers in downtown  Los Angeles," he said, San Gabriel is having difficulty controlling its own  destiny.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tremendous Pressure'  </P> <P> "With increasing land values, there's tremendous pressure to increase the  apartment and condo supply, because developers can sell them," he said.  </P> <P> Stabeck vowed that, if elected, he will seek to maintain the city's small-town  character through new land-use ordinances and zoning codes and through  vigilance on the City Council, which is the court of last resort on zoning  matters.  </P> <P> Stabeck said the new General Plan and zoning ordinances will improve the  quality of life in the city, but he added: "If you assume the problems are  solved, they'll come back."  </P> <P> Stabeck, who has been endorsed by Citizens for Responsible Development,  supported Blaszcak in his unsuccessful campaign to keep his seat. "But from my  point of view, the recall was one event and (the election) is another event,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Long Learning Curve'  </P> <P> Stabeck suggested that Cammarano, because of her lack of experience in city  government, is not up to the task of protecting the city from developers.  "She's going to have a long learning curve," said Stabeck. "I've spent a lot of  time in graduate school, working in government and serving on the Planning  Commission. There's a hell of a lot to learn."  </P> <P> He also said Cammarano's job with a construction union has kept her from  supporting slow-growth positions. "If she's willing to take directions from the  union on something as important as that, what will she do in office?" Stabeck  said.  </P> <P> Cammarano denies that she has taken orders from the union. "I was never a  slow-growther," she said. She recognized Stabeck's extensive education but  suggested that she is more attuned to the voters. "That's fine," she said of  Stabeck's record. "But I've been here 25 years."  </P> <P> Stabeck proposes a program that would protect neighborhoods of single-family  homes from new construction of multifamily units, require developers to pay for  increased city services needed for new projects and add park space.  </P></p>

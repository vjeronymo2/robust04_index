This meant Gen Constand Viljoen's registration  of the Freedom Front would lapse if no list of candidates was  submitted by Wednesday, and the AVF would continue to set up  democratic alternative structures to secure a volkstaat  [homeland], he said. But reports and AVF sources said there was  agitation for rightwing participation in the elections.    Reacting to the Bophuthatswana cabinet's decision to follow  the AVF's example and boycott the election, Mr Jacobs said: "I  am not surprised."    The AVF's transitional representative council would meet  soon  to adopt the AVF's constitution and finalise the volkstaat's  borders, he said.    AVF Directorate member Gen Tienie Groenewald on Monday ruled  out participation in the elections "at this stage". He told  Radio 702 that due to Saturday's majority decision to boycott  the elections: "There is no doubt that the AVF will at this  stage not participate in the elections." He rejected talk of  AVF participation in the polls as speculation and issued a  statement saying suggestions to this effect were aimed at  driving a wedge in rightwing ranks.    There was lively debate in the AVF on the strategy to attain  an Afrikaner volkstaat, he conceded. In spite of differences on  how to attain a volkstaat, he said, unity among Afrikaners was  paramount. "If there is a split in our basis then our aim (of a  volkstaat) is not attainable."    "We must find a way to prove our support. We'd hoped for a  plebiscite or a referendum (to determine support and establish  the borders of a volkstaat) but that had not been agreed to by  the government," Gen Groenewald told the radio station.    The AVF sources said on Monday that pro-election elements in  the rightwing front argued that participation in the polls would  not constitute an endorsement of the interim constitution or  that they wanted to become part of the new South Africa.  "Participation would merely be to determine support and the  borders for a volkstaat and to show the world that we have broad  support for an Afrikaner homeland."    Emerging from Saturday's transitional assembly meeting Gen  Viljoen, defeated by hardliners, told a news conference that  "absolutely nothing would change the AVF's mind not to  participate in the elections unless there was finality on the  volkstaat itself".    AVF spokesman Stephen Maninger on Monday said he was not  aware of an alleged plot to assassinate Gen Viljoen. Mr  Maninger said the AVF's standpoint remained that people should  boycott the election, but should people insist on voting, they  should not support the National Party, which, he said, was  trying to gain rightwing votes through scare tactics.</p>

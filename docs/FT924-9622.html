			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Porters in rescue talks for LBC DAME SHIRLEY Porter, the controversial Conservative politician, and her son, John, are riding to the rescue of LBC, the London commercial radio station. The Porters are in advanced negotiations for the restructuring of Crown Communications, the loss-making parent of LBC. Under the deal now being discussed, Mr John Porter, a California-based wine maker and venture capitalist, would take a substantial stake in LBC in a deal that would swap debt for equity. Lady Porter, heiress to the Tesco fortune and former Lord Mayor of Westminster, would also be involved - possibly as an LBC director. The Radio Authority, the regulatory body for the commercial radio industry, has been informed about the plan is and believed to be enthusiastic. The deal would provide much needed financial underpinning for LBC until its franchise comes up for renewal next year. A source close to the Porter family said that the deal was 'a hard-nosed business venture' although Lady Porter would also be able to use her London contacts and knowledge to help the development of LBC, London's speech-based commercial radio station. Under the deal being discussed, LBC, which has been described by Mr Christopher Chataway, its chairman, as 'cash positive', would be clearly separated from loss-making Crown. It is not clear how much of Crown would then be left. The company has said it intended to sell off 'non-core assets' - everything apart from LBC. Lady Porter, who is still a Westminster City councillor, was a director of rival Capital Radio in London from 1982-88. She recently said in an interview that her ambition was 'to promote London'.</p>

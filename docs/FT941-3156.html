			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Schroders Now that Schroders has taken the plunge on disclosure it turns out that the company does indeed have much to boast about. Not only did profits rise 85 per cent last year; the quality is good too. Schroders is much less reliant than some of its competitors on dealing income. Fee income accounts for almost two-thirds of operating income. Schroders has been continuing to win new fund management business since the start of the year. That should help offset any fall in its income caused by weakness in financial markets. There must be more venture capital gains in the pipeline, although the timing is uncertain. Even without any increase in profits, Schroders would be on a forward multiple of less than 11 times. If that makes the shares seem good value, one is left agape at the 6.6 times dividend cover. There is clearly minimal constraint on dividend progression. But such high earnings retentions when the company already has surplus capital are where the strategic questions begin. A 23 per cent return on capital might seem low at this stage in the cycle, though Schroders is barely geared and its profits are less volatile than those of other merchant banks. Arguably Schroders missed an opportunity to enhance its return by buying back its own shares when the price was cheaper. It cannot accumulate capital for ever. The worry is that it may do something just to ease the discomfort. However, it has a record of getting the strategic decisions right.</p>

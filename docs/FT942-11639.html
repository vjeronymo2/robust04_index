			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Drug inquiry hits Thai MP The Thai government is investigating allegations that an opposition member of parliament has been involved in drug trafficking to the US, it said yesterday. The disclosure is the latest in a series of embarrassing drug scandals involving Thai politicians. Mr Den Tohmeena, deputy interior minister, said he would visit the US this week to seek details of the accusations against Mr Thanong Siripreechapong, an MP for the Chart Thai party, in talks with the US Drug Enforcement Administration. A US court last year ordered the seizure of Mr Thanong's Los Angeles home and a Mercedes Benz car on the grounds they had been bought with profits from narcotics smuggling. According to a US prosecutor, Mr Thanong earned more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) by arranging marijuana shipments to the US. Efforts to contact Mr Thanong yesterday were unsuccessful. Thai drug enforcement officials said yesterday that the US had asked the Thais to freeze the MP's assets in Thailand as well, but the US embassy in Bangkok could not confirm this. Western diplomats said the Thai authorities could seize assets under Thai law, but the US had simply asked the government to notify Mr Thanong of the seizure of his US assets. The timing of the accusations surfacing in the Thai press this week against Mr Thanong is convenient for the coalition government (its efforts to reform the constitution are being blocked by the opposition parties), but Mr Thanong is not the first Thai politician against whom such allegations have been made. Two years ago, Mr Narong Wongwan, a powerful businessman refused entry to the US because of his alleged links to heroin trafficking, was nominated by a group of pro-military parties as prime minister. But the accusations stopped him gaining the job.</p>

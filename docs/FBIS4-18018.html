			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Arif Useynov report: "Azerbaijan: Panic on the Black </F> Market"]    [Text] Baku -- It would appear that the situation that had  been long predicted has become a reality: The U.S. dollar has  shot up to 1,000 manats on the black market. Thus the  population is 20 percent poorer, since the day before the same  dollar could be bought for 800 manats. The same has happened  with the exchange rate of the Russian ruble -- on the black  market it is expressed in terms of the dollar rate and has  reached 1 manat to 2 rubles. The manat is clearly dropping away.    Correspondingly, prices of basic necessities also shot up,  getting beyond the reach of the majority of the population. The  opposition press believes that what is happening on the currency  market is the consequence of serious economic upheavals. In  particular, the opinion is being expressed that the financial  magnates who manipulate black market transactions are ready to  blow the situation in the republic apart from within. It is not  yet clear according to what scenario events will develop. The  population has been agitated by the explosion of prices on the  market -- a minimum salary today will only buy 1.5 kg of beef.</p>

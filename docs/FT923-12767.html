			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Manual workers' pay deal agreed UNION leaders representing 900,000 local government manual workers, the biggest bargaining group in Britain, yesterday claimed a 'major breakthrough' in improving the status of the mainly part-time manual workers. Employers and union leaders agreed a pay deal giving most workers a 4.1 per cent rise with 4.4 per cent for the lower-paid. For full-time manual workers, that means a weekly increase ranging from Pounds 5.69 to Pounds 6.44. Union leaders were keen to emphasise the non-wage benefits, which include: From January 1, the 540,000 part-time workers will have full access to the local-government sick pay scheme. The employers, balanced between Tory and Labour authorities, will examine moves towards single-status for all town hall employees and to establish a joint working party on equality. The employers have also agreed to review how to improve the training opportunities of the manual workers. Mr Roger Poole, of Nupe, the public-services union, and leader of the union side, emphasised also that the employers' side - including the Conservatives  -had committed themselves to maintaining and improving the collective bargaining institutions of local government with 'careful and comprehensive consultation'. Some local authorities have been dropping out of parts of the bargaining machinery they have found to be inflexible. The London borough of Harrow recently withdrew from the manual workers' negotiating machinery, while several local authorities have withdrawn from central bargaining with their white-collar emp-loyees However, yesterday's deal is unlikely to lead to many more authorities withdrawing on the ground that they cannot afford to pay what has been agreed. The pay deal adds 4.1 per cent or Pounds 183m to the pay bill, although it excludes the 0.2 per cent of the pay bill from extending the sick pay scheme.</p>

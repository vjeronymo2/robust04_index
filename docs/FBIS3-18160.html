			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Per Nordrum: "A Difficult Negotiation Day With </F> the EU"]    [Text] There was some tough jostling for position in the EU  [European Union] negotiations yesterday. While no real progress  was made, there was evidence of a final burst of speed down the  homestretch.    "Now we are starting to move! It has taken a long time to  obtain the EU's feedback on agriculture, for one thing. Now we  know a little bit more about its negotiating positions,  although, in the case of agriculture, it is couched in very  general terms. Still, the EU understands the need for having  northern agriculture and for transitional arrangements. What  form these arrangements will take is something we must tackle in  the upcoming negotiations," said Trade Minister Grete Knudsen  after her maiden speech yesterday at the EU in Brussels.    Nothing new emerged from the positions meeting yesterday.  Conventional Norwegian arguments on behalf of our agriculture  and foodstuffs industry were repeated. In contrast to the Finns  and the Swedes, the Norwegian team has put the best possible  interpretation on the EU positions.    "What we got today were positions that make it possible for  us to begin in much greater earnest to respond to this portion  of the negotiations. But it could also be that I approach this  with a feminine cunning the others lack," said the trade  minister.    Knudsen was even able to find loopholes that would make it  possible to evade EU farm prices in Norway from day one of  membership, a circumstance that Norway has rejected as wholly  unacceptable. Knudsen saw the potential for a gradual, product  by product reduction of import protections.  <H5>  Nothing Is Forever </H5>   "A loophole for avoiding price adaptations? That is possibly  Norway's opinion, but within the EU there is not a vestige of  doubt that we require full compliance on price adaptations from  day one," said Theodoros Pangalos, the EU Council chairman and  Greece's European minister. But he added philosophically:  "Nothing in life is forever. There is no final `yes' or `no.' We  have only begun the negotiations."    "We are determined to keep to the schedule and work hard in  the coming weeks," said Knudsen. "To emphasize crisis at this  stage would not be very wise."    On 17 February, Norway and the other candidate countries --  Sweden, Finland, and Austria -- will meet for deliberation in  Oslo before the next ministerial round with the EU in Brussels  on 21 and 22 February. Then there will be some tough, realistic  negotiations that will go directly into an uninterrupted "final  push" beginning on Friday, 25 February.  <H5>  District Policy </H5>   An internal EU conflict over what Norway and Finland should  be offered in terms of district policy for their northern  districts was responsible for the fact that the EU did not have  any negotiation posture ready for presentation yesterday. A long  night of tug-of-war led to a statement in which the EU nations  attempted unsuccessfully to camouflage their discord. The  disagreement is chiefly due to the fact that Spain feels that  Norway and Finland have been offered too much in the EU  negotiation draft paper. Norway will not be treated any less  well than the EU nations themselves have been treated, the  statement said.  <H5>  Intense Annoyance </H5>   Yesterday's negotiations left the Finns fuming with  annoyance. The Swedes also employed very tough, precise language  with the EU ministers. Austria hewed more to the Norwegian  position and said that they were optimists. But in head-to-head  conversation with colleagues from other applicant nations their  tone was quite different.    A source in the Swedish negotiations delegation remarked  that  "this is serious" after the EU had rejected Norrbotten as a  "target one area" in district policy terms. The hope is that the  EU can consent to the evaluation of other criteria besides just  the level of income.  <H5>  "Deeply Concerned" </H5>   "We are deeply concerned about the EU's negotiation posture  on agriculture," said Heikko Haavisto, Finland's foreign affairs  minister. The Finns did not receive an offer of a permanent  price support arrangement for agriculture, despite their efforts  to get it. Both the Finnish and Swedish team admitted that time  is beginning to run out, as 1 March is the target date for  ending the negotiations. Norway is in a worse position than the  other applicant nations and in the corridors of the EU, the talk  is increasingly that "the three" -- and that does not include  Norway -- may conceivably meet the deadline.</p>

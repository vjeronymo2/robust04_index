			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CONTROVERSY OVER BLACKS AND SPORTS  </P> <P> Howard Rosenberg's April 24 column, "A Compelling Case for Controversy Over  Black Athletes," misses a major point -- survival of the fittest.  </P> <P> It is estimated that of the tens of thousands enslaved in Africa's interior,  forced to walk to the coast and then shipped in ghastly conditions to the  United States, far fewer than half survived the long and horrible journey.  </P> <P> The weak died; the strongest lived. As a result, black Americans have a fitter  heritage, shown in the number of successful black athletes we have. There is  nothing racist about this; it is history.  </P> <P> CLEMENT SALVADORI  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

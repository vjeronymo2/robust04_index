			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Companies queue up for Caspian plunge - Steve LeVine on reserves that will be relatively easy to exploit THE CASPIAN Sea, at the centre of some of the most obscure states, is growing into an oil and natural gas producing region that is believed to be capable of rivalling some Gulf nations. Its prospects are making the names Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan familiar to oil men. 'Oil geologists are salivating at the formations they see,' says a western consultant in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku. Mr Dave Tayrien of Houston's Amoco Production Company, one of the western companies scouring the area, says: 'A lot of regions in the Caspian either have never been identified or never tapped. It's a highly prospective and exciting part of the world to be doing business in'. The development is likely to put pressure on other oil-producing countries as competition in the industry is increasing. At the same time, expected economic growth in the three republics, which together have just 28m people, could spill over and fuel expansion in two of the former Soviet Union's most backward regions, Central Asia and the Caucasus. The region has broad prospects. In addition to the oil and natural gas it boasts a wealth of non-ferrous metals and farm products. Large oil and natural gas reserves are already proven. The fields are not as vast as Siberia's largest, but they are almost as alluring because they are far easier to exploit. In Azerbaijan there are 7bn barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves; Turkmenistan has at least 10 trillion (million million) cubic metres of proven natural gas reserves and 1.6bn barrels of proven oil reserves; and two of Kazakhstan's fields are among the world's ten largest, with a combined 6bn-11bn barrels of recoverable oil and 20 trillion cu m of natural gas. The mostly undeveloped Caspian region could contain much more. 'Only the drill bit will determine how big the wells could be. There are always going to be surprises,' says Mr Tayrien. The Caspian Sea, the world's largest lake, covers 232,000 square miles (600,000 square km), but the geological region extends much further. The Caspian Depression reaches across the northern Caspian Sea into western Kazakhstan and includes the long-producing Russian oil and natural gas fields of Astrakhan, Orenburg and Volgograd. Another formation, the Northern Caucasian Mangeshlak plate, crosses the sea's mid-section, and encompasses the fields of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan and stretching to the Aral Sea. Because the republics are all but broke they have eagerly received the western oil executives that have poured into the region to compete for contracts. But, still in the process of breaking away from their Soviet past, they have been less eager to sign firm contracts. A problem hindering development of the Caspian fields is the absence of a good pipeline system to transport the oil and natural gas out of the area. Each of the three Caspian republics is discussing differing, multi-billion-dollar pipeline deals that probably will be financed as part of the western contracts. Azerbaijan has kept about half a dozen western companies on hold for months while officials have repeatedly studied an estimated Dollars 10bn worth of contracts for three large fields off the Baku coast. So far, the government has signed only a Dollars 25m contract with the Turkish company Attila Dogan Petrosan to refurbish the Neftchala field near Baku. Earlier this year, British Petroleum and the Norwegian company Statoil signed a 'declaration of rights' to develop the Chirakh oilfield, which, with 1 bn barrels of estimated reserves, is comparable with North Sea fields. A second field, the Azeri field, contains an estimated 1.8 bn barrels of oil, and an Amoco-led consortium of six companies is negotiating a deal that could be worth Dollars 6bn over 30 to 40 years. In addition, Houston-based Pennzoil and Aberdeen's Ramco Energy. have allied to refurbish the already-producing Guneshli field, which contains an estimated 1.4bn barrels and now produces 130,000 barrels a day. The deals are potentially bigger, but have been even more elusive, in Kazakhstan's Caspian Depression. There, political debates over exploitation of Kazakhstan's share of the Caspian's riches - and simple insecurity while negotiating with seasoned western lawyers - have made the government extremely cautious. British Gas and Statoil are negotiating to develop the enormous Karachaganak field. The Dollars 6bn deal was intended to be completed by April 1, but government officials say it probably will not be signed until the autumn. Chevron Corporation has closed a deal to develop the giant Tengiz oilfield, which geologists say contains up to 25bn barrels of oil. The sulphur content is high and the oil is under high pressure, so oil companies estimate that 6bn-9bn barrels - equal to Saudi Arabia's bigger fields - are recoverable. The deal could be worth Dollars 20bn over 40 years. Turkmenistan's fields have also attracted a lot of attention, but again nothing has been signed. Italy's Tecnologie Progetti Lavori has been negotiating for more than a year to build a Dollars 1bn oil refinery 180 miles (300km) north-east of Ashkabad, the capital. The possibility of becoming wealthy and self-sustaining has been an intoxicating experience in a region accustomed to surrendering its resources to Moscow. The republics' officials, intent on making the best of what is coming, are savouring the moment. Mr Ural Akchulakov, the Kazakh government's chief oil geologist says: 'The Caspian Sea's prospects could be richer than Saudi Arabia'.</p>

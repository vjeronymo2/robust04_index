			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / New president puts his stamp on the state Ukraine's newly-elected President Leonid Kuchma has taken a first bold step toward fulfilling his campaign promise of economic reform by unilaterally extending his own authority and tightening credits to the state sector, Reuter reports from Kiev. In an effort to break through bureaucratic gridlock and parliamentary obstacles, Mr Kuchma this week issued decrees to take effective control over the government and regional administrations. The measures are a challenge to the country's Communist-driven parliament, currently in summer recess. In the past leading MPs, many of them hostile to reform, have announced their aim of establishing a parliamentary republic and curbing presidential powers. In the decrees, Mr Kuchma has asserted his right to appoint officials, including deputy ministers and heads of committees, who are on the front line of implementing policy. He may also try to chair chair cabinet meetings on economic policy and reforms, thus curbing the role of the prime minister, Mr Vitaly Masol, elected by parliament in June. Local council and executive heads are now also required to obey presidential directives. However, the decrees are likely to run up against a growing movement toward greater regional autonomy, an idea which Mr Kuchma himself approved in his presidential campaign earlier this summer. In the credit tightening decree, cash-strapped state enterprises are being required to submit business plans which explain why the state loans are needed and how they will be paid back. The intention is for fiscal discipline to replace the previous, often haphazard process of issuing credits to enterprises' directors with good ministerial connections.</p>

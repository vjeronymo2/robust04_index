			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOURMANDS GO IN -- FEAST FIRST  </P> <P> "You can always spot the first-year people," said Sandy Stave as she surveyed  the crowd at South Coast Plaza's Jewel Court on Sunday. "First-year people are  real polite and they sit quietly. By the second year, they've got on running  shoes and clothes with elastic waistbands and they're on the move."  </P> <P> Before the night was through, though, 510 local gourmands had cruised the  buffet paradise of "Cuisine Fantasy VI," a fund-raiser for the Orange County  Philharmonic Society. Hosts are the Irvine Philharmonic and Las Canciones  Women's Committees.  </P> <P> This year's benefit raised an estimated $20,000 for the Philharmonic society's  music education programs. Featured were such delectables as roast leg of veal,  grilled beef tenderloin, linguine with prawns and sushi (not to mention the  variety of soups and salads and the wall o' desserts), all donated by local  restaurants.  </P> <P> The tables were covered with white cloths topped with snare drums loaded with  fruit juices, mineral water, French bread and tangerines -- the theme  centerpieces were to encourage guests to "drum up support" for the Philharmonic  society.  </P> <P> On the move through it all was Mitzi Tonai, who, with Mary Louise Smith, was a  co-chair of the event.  </P> <P> Asked why this year's Fantasy drew nearly 100 more guests than last year's,  Tonai spread her arms wide, laughed and said, "Because I have 280 friends and  relatives here tonight."  </P> <P> Across the street at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court on the night before,  more than 750 Performing Arts Center supporters gambled and danced the night  away at the Cabaret Chapter of the Guilds' "Casino Cabaret."  </P> <P> The guests, dressed in the requisite black or white (or black and white)  attire, munched on snacks as they tried their luck at blackjack, roulette and  craps.  </P> <P> Walking off with the raffle prize, a real 4-night cruise for two to Ensenada,  was Paul Joyce of Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the $60-per-person benefit (about 50 tickets at $75-per were sold  at the door) were about $30,000, event chairwoman Debbie Novak said.  </P></p>

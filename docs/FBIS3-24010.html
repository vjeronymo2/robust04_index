Is the Abkhaz Scenario Possible in Crimea?"]    [Text] The victory at the presidential elections of Yuriy  Meshkov and his confrontation with the Crimean Tatar movement,  which began immediately after this, are one further reminder  that the situations in the separatist formations that gravitate  toward Russia have much in common.    What do the situations in Crimea and Abkhazia have in  common?  The present situation in these two regions differs so much that  even the mere fact of a comparison of relatively prosperous  Crimea with semi-ravaged Abkhazia smacks at first sight of  blasphemy. But there are analogies, for all that.    Both in Crimea and in Abkhazia, the separatist movements  relied primarily on the "patriotic" forces of Russia. We would  recall that Zhirinovskiy collected a substantial number of the  signatures for his party's registration in Abkhazia. The  national patriots are quite popular in Crimea also. Thus, Sergey  Shuvaynikov, leader of the Russian Party of Crimea  (Zhirinovskiy's closest ally), amassed approximately 14 percent  of the vote at the presidential elections and came third among  the candidates. Although the present president of Crimea is more  guarded than his recent election rival, he is no stranger to  imperial ambitions either. It is notable that Shuvaynikov's  response during a television debate: "A great Russia, which  would include not only Ukraine and Belarus, but also the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia, could begin to be reconstituted  from Crimea," was supported by the present president of Crimea  also. And before the second round of voting, both the Russian  Party and the Crimean communists called for people who had cast  their votes for them to give them to Yuriy Meshkov.    But the solidarity of the leaders of the separatist  movements  with the Russian patriots has already become a commonplace. What  is far more interesting is something else--the similarity of the  processes in the two Black Sea republics. A new election law  providing for national quotas was passed in Abkhazia in 1991.  Thus the Abkhaz, who constitute approximately 17 percent of the  population, obtained 43 percent of the seats. The Abkhaz argued  the need for national quotas by the mass immigration in the 20th  century of the Georgian population onto the territory of  Abkhazia, which brought about an abrupt change in the ethnic  balance (in 1897 the Abkhaz had constituted more than 80 percent  of the population of the territory).    The parliament of the Crimean Tatars--the Majlis--also is  presenting a similar initiative. In the opinion of the leaders  of this organization, a bicameral parliament should be formed in  Crimea. One chamber, with the right of veto, should consist only  of the indigenous peoples of the Crimea--Tatars, Crimeans, and  Karaimy. Approximately 250,000 Crimean Tatars live in Crimea  today, which constitutes almost 10 percent of the population of  the peninsula. Approximately the same number of their fellow  tribesmen are forced, as before, to remain outside of their  historical homeland.    The election of Yuriy Meshkov--an opponent of privileges for  the indigenous people--as president of the peninsula could  transfer the thus far smoldering conflict to a new phase. We  would recall that at his first news conference, Yuriy Meshkov  declared that the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people should  register as a social and political organization, otherwise its  very existence would be illegal. The response was immediate:  "There can be no question of recognition of Meshkov as  president," Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Majlis, declared.  In the opinion of the leader of the Crimean Tatars, the demand  for registration of the Majlis is baseless and absurd. "Another  twist of the spiral of confrontation awaits us," Dzhemilev  concluded. The further course of events will depend not least on  the position in relation to the president of Crimea that will be  determined by the Majlis of Crimean Tatars which meets today and  on the reaction to its decisions of the new-fledged president.    But whereas the Abkhaz managed not only to occupy the key  positions in parliament but also to change in their favor the  ethnic balance in the republic, a similar victory by the  indigenous peoples in Crimea is unrealistic. A reason for the  victory of the Abkhaz is explained by the fact that Tbilisi's  ill-considered policy united practically the entire  nonindigenous population of the unrecognized republic (more than  50 percent of the population of Abkhazia). In addition, the  geographical location of the unilaterally abolished autonomy,  which is surrounded on all sides by kindred peoples, which did  not fail to come immediately to the assistance of their fellow  tribesmen, worked in favor of the Abkhaz movement. And, finally,  the most important point--the practically unconcealed assistance  to the supporters of separation from Georgia on the part of the  Russian Army.    Not a single one of the above-mentioned factors operates in  Crimea. The Crimean Tatars have found themselves in a minority,  having supported (as distinct from the vast majority of the  Russian-speaking population) Nikolay Bagrov, speaker of the  Crimean parliament, who aspires to "conflict-free" relations  with Kiev. The geographical isolation of the Crimean Tatars does  not allow them to look for sufficiently effective assistance  from kindred peoples. And, finally, the Black Sea Fleet, the  majority of whose officers, as Mustafa Dzhemilev maintains,  voted for Zhirinovskiy, would clearly not act on the side of  Ukraine.    I would like to emphasize that I by no means suspect the  leaders of the Crimean Tatar movement of an aspiration to  resolve the problem militarily (the Majlis is headed by quite  reasonable people). I have intentionally examined an obviously  utopian idea in order to show the impracticability of the  development of the Caucasus option in Crimea.    But it would hardly be appropriate to disregard the "Tatar  card" completely, for all that. There are in Ukraine many  organizations with an interest in an exacerbation of the  situation on the peninsula in order subsequently to attempt to  resolve it by the power method. Provoking a conflict is not that  difficult. The increasing confrontation between Yuriy Meshkov  and the Crimean Tatar movement is not the sole possible cause of  destabilization of the situation. Although today the Crimean  Tatars are not formally prevented from returning to the  peninsula, it is still hard to consider the problem resolved.  The quite complex political situation in the Central Asian  states (the main region of deportation of the Crimean Tatars)  and, as a consequence, the exodus of the Russian-speaking  population, have brought about a sharp drop in the value of  apartments in these states compared with the European part of  the former USSR. Whereas earlier the Crimean Tatar, having sold  his apartment in Central Asia, could with the money he made on  this easily have purchased the same type of accommodations  elsewhere, under the new conditions the money that he obtains is  frequently barely sufficient to cover his fare. In addition,  inflation has "eaten up" the savings accumulated over the years  by the Crimean Tatars for their return home. There is today in  Crimea a multitude of temporary settlements (people often live  in adobe cottages, even): Having begun to build, the Crimean  Tatars cannot put together the money to complete the job. In  this situation, people could resolve upon spontaneous protests.  And although their scale would not, of course, be comparable  with those of the Abkhaz, they would not add tranquillity to the  peninsula.</p>

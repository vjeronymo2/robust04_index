			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Observer: Homing in Despite the British broadcasting industry's state of controlled hysteria, the race for the network controller's post at ITV has reached the home stretch. An overseas choice looked on the cards when the company's bosses approached Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Ivan Fecan about the job of commissioning and scheduling Pounds 500m worth of programming yearly, under the watchful eyes of ITV chief executive Andrew Quinn. But Fecan has decided against. That leaves two obvious front-runners, both holding director of programmes jobs. One is Steve Morrison. The problem for him is that he works for Granada, where Quinn himself was chief executive. So the appointment of Morrison might mean Granada had too much central power. The same applies, albeit more remotely, to outside chance Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1, who was previously a Granada drama-producer. So the favourite must be second front-runner Marcus Plantin of London Weekend Television. If he wins, however, LWT would look to be gaining what Granada is being denied. For the chairman of the ITV association is LWT chief executive Greg Dyke.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / EC trade data hit by new system TRADE between European Community countries dropped in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, according to figures published yesterday by Eurostat, the EC's statistical office. However, Eurostat warned the statistics should be treated with caution because of the teething problems with Intrastat, its new system for measuring cross-border trade. The figures published yesterday, the first under the new system, show that some Ecu161bn (Pounds 125bn) worth of goods were dispatched in the first quarter of this year, against Ecu181bn in the equivalent period. However, the Community's trade deficit with non-EC countries narrowed from Ecu19.9bn to Ecu12.6bn in the same period. Intrastat, which measures trade flows across the barrier-free European market, is running about four months slower than the old system of measuring EC trade. EC statisticians say that as companies get used to it, and the system is refined, speed and reliability will improve. Under the old system, statistics were compiled from forms filled in as goods passed frontiers, and first-quarter figures for inter-EC trade would have appeared at the end of June. But the new system involves individual companies filling in the forms themselves, often without the help of customs agents who smoothed the administration at borders. As a result the level and reliability of replies has dropped.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fidelity launches new smaller Japanese trust Fidelity Investments is launching an investment trust specialising in smaller Japanese companies. Mr Simon Fraser, manager of Fidelity Japanese Values, said he believed such companies were poised to benefit from a cyclical recovery, as well as deregulation and other structural changes in the Japanese economy. Fidelity already has a unit trust covering this area but is hoping to attract more institutional investors with the investment trust structure. The minimum size of the fund will be about Pounds 25m, but Fidelity expects demand to be greater than that. The public offer period will run from February 22 to March 8 and dealings are due to start on March 15. Ordinary shares will be priced at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five shares, and issue expenses capped at 4.5 per cent. The trust will be between 20 and 25 per cent geared from the outset, using equity index-linked loan stock, tied to the FT-A Japan Index.</p>

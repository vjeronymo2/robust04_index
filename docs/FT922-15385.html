			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Observer: PJ on board Guess what? Guinness Peat Aviation, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, has added yet another well-connected politico to its pay roll. Not content with signing up such heavyweight names as Nigel Lawson, Garret Fitzgerald, and Peter Sutherland, GPA founder Tony Ryan has just hired Charlie Haughey's old pr man - PJ Mara  - as his new media relations adviser. As Haughey's press secretary for the past five years, Mara played a key role in Haughey's surprisingly long existence as Ireland's prime minister. However, even his legendary skills were not enough to prevent Haughey being forced out of office following a mounting series of financial and political scandals. PJ, as he likes to be known, is the consummate spin-doctor. He managed to keep his boss one step ahead of the baying hounds of the press corps, putting them off the scent with humorous, in-depth, off-the-record briefings, and even in Haughey's darkest hours managed to maintain a sense of bonhomie between his government and the fourth estate. He proudly recaps by saying: 'I never told a lie'. Nevertheless, it's a strange appointment. A bit like putting Sir Bernard Ingham, Mrs Thatcher's old mouthpiece, in charge of British Airways' public relations.</p>

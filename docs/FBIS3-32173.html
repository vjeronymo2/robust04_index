			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Teresa Fajardo from the "YSU Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Excerpt] Jorge Antonio Jean Mateu Aviles, vice president  of the Supreme Court of Justice, has avoided making any  statements that call into question or defend the Judiciary  Branch's handling of the murder of a Salvadoran citizen by U.S.  military officer Mike Lopez on 29 January. The magistrate  declined comment because public reports on the case are just  opinions and cannot form the basis of a legal position.    [Begin recording] [Mateu] The Court does not have a position  on this case. I understand the Court president has already made  statements reflecting the opinion of the Court.    [Unidentified reporter] Weren't Salvadoran laws violated in  this case, in the sense that, according to the prosecutor  general and the director of the PNC [National Civilian Police],  the judge was manipulated? They said that the supply of U.S.  aid was linked to the judge not indicting the U.S. citizen.  Aren't the nation's laws being manipulated?    [Mateu] The Judiciary Branch is not manipulating the law.  The judiciary is working to see that laws are fulfilled. But  as Supreme Court...    [Reporter, interrupting] Will you defend the Constitution of  the Republic? No statement has been made in this regard.    [Mateu] Once the recourse in this case is filed, we will  have  more details about this situation. But for now only opinions  have been aired.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] a case of real impunity?    [Mattei] Regardless of what I think, I cannot state my  opinion because a recourse may be filed with this office. It  would be inappropriate for me to give my opinion. [end  recording]    The Supreme Court official made these brief comments on this  case, after having announced plans to convene a special congress  of the Latin American Federation of Magistrates in this capital.

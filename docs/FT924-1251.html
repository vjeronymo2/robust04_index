			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / ProShare calls for 'MegaPep' tax change PROSHARE, the group which aims to promote wider share ownership, has called for a range of tax changes to encourage investors to move into the equity market. In a submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, ahead of next year's Budget, ProShare argues that the current personal equity plan should be replaced by a 'MegaPep'. This would allow investors to place Pounds 80,000 into equities over an eight-year period with, as now, all income and capital gains tax-free. The current system allows the investor to put a maximum Pounds 9,000 into a Pep in a tax year (Pounds 6,000 in a general, and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company plan). The 'MegaPep' would allow those with lump sums (perhaps as a result of inheritance or redundancy) to move all their capital into equities immediately rather than stagger the investment over several years. ProShare also calls for an equivalent to the French 'loi monory' with savers allowed to invest Pounds 1,500 in shares each year out of pre-tax income. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this would mean the Pounds 1,500 investment would actually cost Pounds 1,125. The organisation also said capital gains tax roll-over relief should be available on shares, and that self-administered Peps should be considered.</p>

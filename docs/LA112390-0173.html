			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FREEMAN ON CAMPAIGN TO 'HEAL'  </P> <P> Morgan Freeman wanted to be a movie star when he was a kid. Now that he is,  Freeman says, things have changed.  </P> <P> "Stardom is nothing," the actor says in this Sunday's Parade magazine. "I  decided I want to be a force, a catalyst. I want to change people's attitudes.  I want to make movies that heal, that mend us."  </P> <P> Freeman, the star of "Lean on Me" and "Driving Miss Daisy," says he chooses  roles that will educate people.  </P> <P> "I'm not a social do-gooder, but I find myself more and more a campaigner," he  says. "I want to change people's attitudes about black people, about us as  Americans.  </P> <P> "I want to give us a better historical perspective of ourselves which will make  us get along better."  </P></p>

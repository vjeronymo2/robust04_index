			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (1): Past and future state - This week's falling apart of the coalition Government in Dublin is evidence of deeper rifts within Irish society as a result of the pressures to create a modern and outward-looking European state. With an election now looming THE POLITICAL crisis of the past week that has brought about the collapse of Ireland's coalition government, and precipitated a general election, was not entirely unforeseen. Superficial strains have been evident in the coalition for months, but were warning signs that much deeper rifts exist throughout the country's body-politic. As 1993 and the Single European Market approaches, Ireland is living the trauma of a country torn between its past and its future. The traditional redoubts of power and paternalism - church, state and family business patriarchs - have in the past year found themselves under assault as never before, from the media, the courts, outspoken pop stars and disgruntled shareholders. The allure of European unity and its perceived promise of a fast road to affluence has made Europhiles of most of the population: 70 per cent voted in favour of the Maastricht treaty in the June referendum. Although by no means all that emanates from Brussels is viewed as desirable, the widespread wish to create a modern, outward-looking Ireland has meant that, in the process, a few sacred cows are being goaded in the direction of the butchers. At the front of the line is the church's moral authority. 'My father, the Bishop', said a banner headline in a Dublin tabloid last May, above a picture of a pudgy teenager who became an overnight celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic. The prelate in question was Bishop Eamonn Casey, the Bishop of Galway, who admit ted to having fathered a son 17 years ago, after his former lover, an American, decided to go public with her story. It was a salacious shock for Ireland's staunch Catholic society, accustomed to the moral strictures of its clergy on the multiple evils of abortion, divorce, contraception and homosexuality. Recommending that the clergy cast the beams out of their own eyes, Ms Sinead O'Connor, the outspoken, shaven-headed Irish singer, one of the avant garde of rebellious Irish women, last month tore up a photograph of the Pope during a live television performance in the United States, saying: 'Fight the real enemy.' There was public and political outrage over a High Court decision preventing a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. The ruling, and its overturning by the Supreme Court, forced the government into a public commitment to hold a new referendum on the abortion issue. If liberal European social and moral standards are weakening the Catholic church's traditional sway over Irish souls, so are traditional Irish political and business ethics being called into question. In the past four months serving and former prime ministers, and members of their cabinets, have been called to give evidence in the Beef Tribunal, a parliamentary inquiry into allegations of fraud, malpractice and political favouritism in the beef industry. The tribunal has given some insights into the inner workings of Irish government and its civil service. The public has heard of cabinet meetings at which no minutes were kept; no civil servants were present; ministers ignoring expert advice from their own departments; official documents altered or suppressed to avoid the cancellation of lucrative beef export contracts. In the event, the tribunal has been the stage upon which the death throes of the present administration have been acted out. Mr Albert Reynolds, the present prime minister, when called to the witness box ten days ago, accused his industry minister - and leader of the junior coalition party, the Progressive Democrats - Mr Des O'Malley of having been 'dishonest' in his criticisms of Mr Reynolds, when he gave evidence to the inquiry last June. That precipitated the present political crisis. Mr. Reynolds was the minister for industry and commerce during the period which relates to many of the allegations and Mr O'Malley had accused him of 'gross errors of judgment' in supporting beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988. The die was thus cast for a collapse of the coalition. The results of public inquiries into two other scandals - alleged insider dealing by top executives in two state-run companies - are also expected in the coming months. Mr John Bruton, the leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party, says: 'I think the tribunal will have a cathartic effect and will clean up Irish politics definitively. Corruption or the suspicion of corruption is most corrosive to any economy. Regardless of any findings, it will have had a very good effect in improving the probity of public life. It will have chastened politicians and civil servants such that they will in future be very wary of doing anything untoward.' The various inquiries have also added impetus to the pressure for changes in corporate management. The accountancy profession is about to introduce new guidelines and standards to close loopholes which have been exploited in the past by unscrupulous businessmen. Institutional fund managers and stock exchange officials have raised their voices in recent weeks to call for a greater onus of responsibility to be placed on non-executive directors. The image of Irish business practice has not been helped by the succession of scandals; nor has the image of Ireland itself been aided by the continuing trouble in Northern Ireland. Peace talks, in meetings involving the British and Irish governments and the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, have been going on since last April in an effort to find a solution to the 70-year-old conflict. The talks are on the verge of collapse because of the rival and incompatible constitutional claims to the province. The Unionists from Northern Ireland want the Republic to hold a referendum which would abolish or amend Articles II and III of the Irish constitution, the basis of the Republic's territorial claim on the North. The Unionists have threatened to walk out of the talks if there is no commitment by the Irish government to a referendum by the date set for the next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting - just ten days away, on November 16. Opposition parties in the Republic have called on the government to show flexibility in order not to lose what is, they say, an historic opportunity for peace. The talks are expected to wind up today with perhaps nothing more than a vague promise to return to the negotiating table some time in the New Year. Two referendums the government has committed itself to are those on abortion and divorce. Later this month voters will be asked whether they want constitutional changes to permit limited abortion in Ireland in cases of a life-threatening, as opposed to a health-threatening, risk to the mother. The convoluted wording of the referendum text, designed to appease both anti-abortion and pro-choice lobbies and aimed at winning a cross-party consensus, has failed to achieve any of these objectives. Even the erstwhile junior partners in Ireland's coalition government, the Progressive Democrats have expressed deep reservations. Womens' health should not be discriminated against, opponents of the wording say. The government argues that if a distinction is not made it will open to the door to abortion on demand. The planned divorce referendum has now been pre-empted by the general election and is unlikely to be held before the second half of next year. But the potent brew of abortion, Northern Ireland, the Beef Tribunal and deepening concerns over the government's ability to maintain its foreign exchange policy - and hence its economic policy - will provide plenty of ammunition for what is likely to be one of the most bitter election campaigns for some time. Mr Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, recently reorganised his shadow cabinet in preparation for such an eventuality. He said: 'We have had to work on the assumption that we needed to be ready for an election at any time.' Whether Fine Gael could do better remains to be seen, but for the sake of change the electorate might be willing to give it a try. If traditional values are coming under heavy fire there is no reason to assume that traditional party loyalties should remain sacrosanct.</p>

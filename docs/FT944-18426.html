			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Machine tool makers drill through to the light: Andrew Baxter finds market awakening after several false dawns There may be no smiles yet, but at least there is relief on the faces of machine tool company executives as the 'confidence factor' returns among customers in manufacturing industry. After the deepest, longest recession in living memory, and several frustrating false dawns, the market is finally moving. 'Things are picking up,' said Mr John Wareing, managing director of Leicester-based Jones &amp; Shipman, which makes grinding machines. Its UK orders are up 50 per cent so far this year - excluding a one-off Pounds 810,000 contract for eight machines which it announced this week. At Luton-based Bruderer, which sells precision presses, managing director Mr Bill Burrell said: 'Industry has decided it can't wait any more for help from the government, it just has to have the kit to be competitive.' Official figures earlier this month showed domestic sales of machine tools rose 12.1 per cent in the three months to July compared with the previous three months. A Financial Times straw poll of machine tool makers suggests the value of the UK machine tool market could rise between 15 per cent and 20 per cent this year from the Pounds 652m last year estimated by the Machine Tool Technologies Association. The rise could not have come a moment too soon for producers, although it would still leave the UK market some way behind the peaks of about Pounds 1bn in 1989 and 1990. In some cases, delivery times are increasing as machine tool builders and their parts suppliers work flat out to keep up with demand. After the swingeing capacity and job cuts of the past three years - which halved the industry's workforce to about 12,000 - extra workers are being taken on, but in very small numbers and as a last resort. The machine tool industry is normally one of the last to recover from a recession, and large machine orders and multi-million pound manufacturing projects tend to trail behind the less costly contracts for smaller, standard machines. All the machine tool builders contacted by the FT reported an upturn in UK business, but, as expected, producers of smaller machines are having the best of it. These include companies such as the 600 Group, a manufacturer of lathes whose UK machine tool orders are up about 40 per cent so far this year. 'Business is much better than it was, but it's not booming yet,' said Mr Tony Sweeten, managing director of the machine tool division. The upturn is spread across all industries, with customers focusing on machines that increase productivity. At Leicester-based Bridgeport Machines, which makes machining centres, business is up 25 per cent this financial year, managing director Mr Malcolm Taylor said. 'Projects that were sidelined a couple of years ago are coming to fruition.' Bridgeport's new business has come both from blue-chip companies such as British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce and small subcontractors. But there are some regional variations - the north-east, in particular was 'sluggish to say the least', perhaps a result of the knock-on effect for subcontractors of the Swan Hunter receivership. Mr Wareing at J &amp; S agreed that the upturn in orders reflected increased confidence among large and small customers. 'Most people are feeling pretty perky now in industry,' he said. Among producers of bigger machines and systems, Mr Don McBean, sales director at Merseyside-based Giddings &amp; Lewis, reported a 'definite increase in real inquiries,' and business up 10 per cent overall. Its standard machining centres in particular were selling well, but with large projects the main problem was anticipating when companies would place an order. At Swiss-owned Bruderer, order intake began improving last year and is now more than 80 per cent up on the average levels during the recession, Mr Burrell said. He saw this as a sign of confidence among customers that they can make new presses pay, because the strength of the Swiss franc has made it harder for machine tool importers to compete on price. Japanese suppliers have had the same problem. The one possible obstacle is increases in interest rates. Producers say the recent half-point rise has not affected customers' outlook, but are concerned about further rises. Mr Taylor at Bridgeport was worried about suggestions that base rates could rise between 7 per cent and 8 per cent next year. 'As soon as you start playing around with interest rates, it sends shudders through industry, which needs stability for a while,' he said. At G &amp; L, Mr McBean said: 'The last thing we would want to see is anything that would stop a customer making a decision.' Mr Wareing pointed out that, interest rates apart, 'all the signs are good for the UK economy'. After grinding their way through the recession, machine tool builders hope things will stay that way.</p>

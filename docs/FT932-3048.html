			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: Whistle stop Sir, Your article about the organisation Public Concern at Work, headed 'Solicitor launches group to protect whistle-blowers' (June 14), is premature and somewhat inaccurate. We have not been formed to protect 'whistle-blowers - employees who disclose confidential information in what they judge to be the public interest'. Rather our object is to develop alternatives where employee concerns about public dangers are first raised and addressed within their organisation. When we launch in the autumn, all will be clearer. Guy Dehn, barrister, Public Concern at Work, Lincoln's Inn House, 42 Kingsway, London WC2B 6EN</p>

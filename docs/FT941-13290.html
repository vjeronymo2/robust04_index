			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Domino Printing 24% lower at Pounds 9.1m - Growth expected to return this year, with first quarter well ahead Shares in Domino Printing Sciences rose 47p to 488p yesterday despite the Cambridge-based continuous ink jet printer manufacturer reporting full-year figures shy of expectations. Mr Roger Dye, finance director, said he believed the share movement reflected small trading volumes and confidence that the management had acted rapidly to reverse its profits decline. Profits before tax for the year to October 31 fell by 24 per cent to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 11.9m) on turnover 14 per cent higher at Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 71.6m). Earnings per share fell 23 per cent to 23.07p, compared with 30.02p. A final dividend of 5.3p is proposed for a total of 7.95p (7.2p). Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said the increase resulted from the board's belief that the company would return to its traditional rates of growth and profitability this year. The first quarter of 1994 had been well ahead of the same period in 1993. Domino reckons to be second to Videojet, a US-based company owned by GEC, in a market led by UK companies. Growth in recent years has been driven by UK and European legislation requiring products to be marked with sell-by dates and bar codes. Continuous ink jet machines are expensive, however, and sales were badly hit by recession, especially in the US where sales were flat. There was also renewed competit-ion from Videojet in the US. German sales proved disappointing and the company had merged its distribution activities there with those of its Swiss distributor to give better and more economic market coverage. A diversification into mimeographic carton printing, Packtrack, cost the company Pounds 1.1m after quality problems forced the delay of the new product. Mr Howard Whitesmith, managing director, said a new management team had restored quality and successful field trials had been completed in October. This year Domino will move into commercial laser printing. It has also developed a new ink with a smell more acceptable to food industries. COMMENT So rare is it for the UK to lead in an electronics technology that Domino's decline is disproportionately unsettling. The signs of recovery in the UK and US are moderately encouraging but much will depend on how rapidly the ink jet market is maturing as statutory labelling of produce loses its novelty. The company is keen to move into new technologies, however, has learned an expensive lesson with Packtrack and has Pounds 16.5m cash to spend. Negotiations are in progress on unnamed potential acquisitions. The market expects some Pounds 12m in profits before tax next year, giving about 30p of earnings and a dividend of 8.9p. At 485p, the shares are undervalued.</p>

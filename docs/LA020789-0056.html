			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU COACH UNHAPPY AFTER 91-82 VICTORY  </P> <P> Gary Zarecky watched his U.S. International University men's basketball team  lose most of a 24-point lead. Then Zarecky lost his patience, followed by his  voice.  </P> <P> About the only thing in the win column for the Gulls was a 91-82 victory over  Southern Utah State at Golden Hall Monday night. And that wasn't much to look  at.  </P> <P> "That was shabby," Zarecky said. "But there are reasons for it. We've run into  the layoff doldrums. We've played twice in the last 19 days.  </P> <P> "We seem to have lost the intensity you need at the end of the season. Ninety  percent of the teams are playing for something like a league championship. But  despite not playing for a league title or an NCAA berth, (the players) still  have to know they have to play to win."  </P> <P> The Gulls (9-14) rolled out to a 48-31 lead at the half and increased that to  64-40 with 14:20 remaining on a basket inside by Demetrius Laffitte. But then  it was a downhill slide for USIU, whose coach lost his voice about midway  though the second half.  </P> <P> The Thunderbirds (8-16) outscored USIU, 7-2, to pull within 66-47. The game  became uglier when the Gulls' Eddie Hodges got in a pushing match with the  Thunderbirds' Randy Simkins and then hit Simkins with a left cross. Hodges was  called for a foul and a flagrant foul and was ejected from the game and will  also have to sit out the Gulls' next game.  </P> <P> Laffitte had 20 second-half points and finished with a game-high 27 points and  13 rebounds.  </P></p>

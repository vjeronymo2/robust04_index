			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ifil earnings boosted by one-off gains IFIL, the listed holding company controlled by Italy's Agnelli family, reported group pre-tax profits of L221bn (Dollars 178.4m) in the first half of this year. Ifil has not previously given a consolidated first-half profits figure. Full-year group earnings in 1991 amounted to L180bn. At parent company level, net first-half profits rose by 18.6 per cent to L58.7bn from L49.5bn. The group's earnings were boosted by a L162bn one-off gain from selling 10 per cent of the Galbani foods group to BSN of France. Ifil sold the shares in Galbani, in which it was formerly an equal partner with BSN, to the French foods group, for around L300bn last June. Stefanel, the Italian clothing group, reported a fall in first-half net profits to L18.2bn, from L19.1bn in the same period in 1991. The decline stemmed partly from lower extraordinary gains, which amounted to L5.6bn in last year's first half. Sales climbed by 10.4 per cent to L215.3bn, while operating earnings rose by the same proportion to L22.2bn.</p>

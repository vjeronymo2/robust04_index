			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Pibs Building societies take pride in their solid, reliable image. Imagine then, popping in to your nearest branch to buy its irredeemable debt paper - one of the riskier investments around. Yet, the Building Societies Commission, which supervises the societies, has sent a letter to their chief executives outlining the procedures it would expect if they decided to sell permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs). To be fair, the letter aimed to highlight 'the need for special care in selling investment products', but at least one society was surprised that the commission was allowing the sale of Pibs over the counter. Pibs are a way for building societies to raise money. They have no maturity date, so the investor's capital cannot be guaranteed, and they are bought and sold in the market. In theory, they pay a fixed rate of interest indefinitely, but missed interest payments do not mount up for payment at a later date. Those holding Pibs are last in line for repayment in the event of a wind-up and are not covered by a compensation scheme. Leeds was the first to issue Pibs in July 1991. With a minimum denomination of Pounds 50,000 - roughly, the cost of a Mercedes 280SL - the issue was aimed at institutions. The market has since grown to Pounds 1bn. Private investors have been attracted to the shares because of their relatively high yield, as the table shows. The societies themselves are cautious about the idea of retailing Pibs. Martin Ritchley, the Coventry's chief executive, says: 'I would not want traditional building society investors to mistake Pibs for a traditional building society investment.' Bristol &amp; West says, however: 'We would be keen to see changes to widen customer choice and convenience, but we would want to make sure that customers understood them.' Michael Dyson, director of BZW Capital Markets, adds: 'Private investors should ignore the speculative motives for buying Pibs but, if they require a high income, concentrate on those that give the best combination of yield and quality. 'At present, these are Britannia and, for the large investor, the Leeds.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERMANENT INTEREST-BEARING SHARES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                 Coupon  Minimum   Issue    Issue   Price* Yield                    (gross %) (Pounds)    date    price  (pence) (gross                                                (pence)             %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires    9.38   1,000  16/12/93  100.17   86.50  10.83 Bradford &amp; Bingley     13.00  10,000   30/9/91  100.20  124.40  10.48 Bradford &amp; Bingley     11.63  10,000   29/6/92  100.13  113.00  10.29 Bristol &amp; West         13.38   1,000  11/12/91  101.79  123.75  10.83 Bristol &amp; West         13.38   1,000  31/10/91  100.34  123.75  10.83 Britannia (1st)        13.00   1,000   13/1/92  100.42  122.00  10.66 Britannia (2nd)        13.00   1,000   8/10/92  107.13  122.00  10.66 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs    11.75  50,000  21/10/92  100.96  113.75  10.33 Coventry               12.13   1,000   28/5/92  100.75  113.75  10.64 First National         11.75  10,000    4/5/93  100.25  100.25  11.72 Halifax                12.00  50,000   23/1/92  100.28  117.75  10.19 Halifax                 8.75  50,000    7/9/93  100.62   86.50  10.12 Leeds Permanent        13.63  50,000    3/6/91  100.00  130.25  10.46 Leeds &amp; Holbeck        13.38   1,000   31/3/92  100.23  123.50  10.83 Newcastle              12.63   1,000    8/9/92  100.45  115.00  10.98 Newcastle              10.75   1,000   15/6/93  100.32   99.13  10.85 North of England       12.63   1,000   23/6/92  100.14  117.50  10.75 Skipton                12.88   1,000   27/2/92  100.48  118.00  10.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett.  *Purchase price as at Thursday July 7; excludes accrued interest  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Smaller Companies Trust calls for Pounds 24m THE SMALLER Companies Investment Trust is proposing its second substantial fund raising exercise in five months. The trust, managed by Abtrust Fund Managers, is attempting to raise some Pounds 23.8m, net of expenses, through a conditional plac-ing of C shares at 135p apiece. The previous fund raising, in May, raised approximately Pounds 20.6m net. Directors said those proceeds had largely been invested. Shareholders will be able to participate in the latest proposed increase in the capital base through a right to subscribe for eight C shares for every 17 ordinary and/or warrants held. The C shares will be converted into ordinary shares at a ratio of their respective net asset values. Holders will also get new warrants on a 1-for-5 basis, exercisable at 135p in the years 1996-99. Conversion takes place when 90 per cent of the net proceeds have been invested or committed to investment, or if earlier, on December 31 1993.</p>

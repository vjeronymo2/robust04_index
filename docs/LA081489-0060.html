			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECISIONS, DECISIONS; MOORE, CHALENSKI DECIDE TO JOIN BRUINS  </P> <P> Among the newcomers expected to report to UCLA today for a week of conditioning  before the official start of fall football practice next Monday are Mike  Chalenski and Michael Moore.  </P> <P> Chalenski, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound defensive end, is a transfer from Pitt, where  he was a part-time starter last season as a freshman; Moore, a wide receiver,  is a freshman from Beverly Hills High who was a second-round pick of the  Toronto Blue Jays last June in the major league baseball draft.  </P> <P> According to published reports, Chalenski hoped to transfer to Miami until Pitt  officials told him they would not release him to a school on the Panthers'  schedule.  </P> <P> But Chalenski, expected to be a standout at Pitt, denied the reports. He said  the only reason he chose Pitt over UCLA out of high school was because Los  Angeles was so far from his home in Kenilworth, N.J.  </P> <P> What's the difference now?  </P> <P> "I'm older, more mature," said Chalenski, who will sit out this season.  </P> <P> Moore, a three-sport start at Beverly Hills, said that he and the Blue Jays  never came close to reaching an agreement on contract terms.  </P> <P> "I'd love to play (professional) baseball," he said, "but going to UCLA is by  no means secondary."  </P> <P> Moore, a center fielder, hopes to play baseball at UCLA.

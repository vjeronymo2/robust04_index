			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: When price cuts prove price sensitive - The reaction of the Stock Exchange to recent Telegraph share sales The speed with which the Stock Exchange moved to investigate recent trading in The Telegraph shares may reflect the determination of Mr Michael Lawrence, the new chief executive, to give more focus to its regulatory role. But its equally swift clearing of last month's Hollinger share sale came as little surprise to City lawyers. An insider dealing specialist from a leading City firm said: 'When a sale of that size is proposed there would be such close scrutiny to ensure there was no unpublished price-sensitive information involved that I find it inconceivable that there would be any evidence connecting the sale with the Telegraph price cut.' The freedom of directors of listed companies to deal in their shares is restricted by the listing rules of the Stock Exchange. These include a model code which forms the minimum rules a company must adopt to cover directors' dealings. It requires directors to receive clearance from the chairman or other designated director for any dealings in the company's shares. Such clearance must not be given for deals during 'close' periods ahead of announcement of financial figures. For a company that reports quarterly, like The Telegraph, the close period covers the month immediately preceding the announcement of figures. So Hollinger, which is controlled by Mr Conrad Black, The Telegraph's chairman, would have been barred from selling shares in the month up to May 13 when The Telegraph announced strong first quarter figures. The sale was made six days later. Dealings are also prohibited in 'any period when there exists any matter which constitutes unpublished price sensitive information in relation to the company's securities (whether or not the director has knowledge of such matter) and the proposed dealing would take place after the time when it has become reasonably probable that an announcement will be required in relation to that matter'. The Stock Exchange investigation has found no evidence that a cut in The Daily Telegraph's cover price - which has proved highly sensitive for The Telegraph share price - was contemplated at the time of the Hollinger stake sale. There have been very few successful insider dealing prosecutions against directors, largely because of the requirement for trades to be cleared by other board members. The biggest to date was the conviction in 1991 of Mr Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the Leeds-based timber and clothing company. He received an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to selling Pounds 1.2m of shares in the company just before it announced worse-than-expected figures. The Stock Exchange is thought to be pursuing investigations into sales of Telegraph shares by employees ahead of the price cut announcement. But insider dealing experts believe it is very unlikely that prosecutions will result. The new insider dealing rules which came into force in March prohibit someone from dealing in securities when in possession of information relating to the securities, which is 'specific or precise' and which if made public would have a significant effect on the securities' price. Given the number of Telegraph employees who own shares in the company, there is always a steady flow of share trades. So it is likely that some employees sold shares in the run up to the price cut when there was increasing internal speculation about such a move. A leading lawyer said that in these circumstances it would be easy to mount a legal defence even if such sales had been prompted by the speculation. 'The prosecution would have to show that the information was 'specific and precise' and that the defendant knew it came from an inside source, and was not just a rumour.'</p>

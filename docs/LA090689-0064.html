			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIXON BIRTHDAY MAY BE HOLIDAY IN YORBA LINDA  </P> <P> Yorba Linda, which once fought to be designated as the official birthplace of  former President Richard M. Nixon, now wants to declare his birthday a city  holiday.  </P> <P> "President Nixon is definitely in fashion again," declared Yorba Linda Mayor  Henry W. Wedaa, who proposed the Jan. 9 holiday for city employees.  </P> <P> The City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to request a resolution designating  the holiday. In two weeks, the council will decide whether to create a new  holiday or substitute Nixon's birthday for an existing city holiday.  </P> <P> "I think this is a fine idea," said Councilman Mark Schwing.  </P> <P> In his travels, Wedaa said, he finds that people rarely bring up the Watergate  scandal that forced Nixon's resignation in 1974. Rather, he said, people often  recognize Yorba Linda as Nixon's birthplace and the home of the Richard M.  Nixon Presidential Library, which is scheduled to be completed next year.  </P> <P> "This often leads to many positive comments about what a great President  history is showing him to be," Wedaa said, adding that he hopes the Nixon  Library will schedule special events to coincide with the new Nixon holiday.  </P></p>

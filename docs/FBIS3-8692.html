			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] We have Mr. Mate Granic, the Croatian  foreign minister and vice prime minister, on the line. Good  evening, Mr. Granic. You landed in Zagreb a few minutes ago, if  I am not wrong.    [Granic] That's right. I'm still in the car.    [Announcer] We have managed to get hold of you as soon as  you  arrived in Zagreb. Would you please comment on these 10 days,  especially today, when we impatiently waited for a long time for  the agreement to be reached.    [Granic] As you can see, after persistent and serious  negotiations which lasted for 10 days, the draft constitution of  the federation has finally been completed. We also agreed on  all basic principles of the confederation, but the final form  and content will be agreed only after the negotiations with the  Serb side, and when the final set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  determined.    In addition, we discussed interim measures and the interim  functioning of authorities. We also discussed the maps,  borders, certain basic principles, but no final agreement has  been reached on this issue. But that was not our aim. A much  more important goal was finally to draw up a constitution of the  federation. As you know, that had to be done by 15 March, and  we completed it today.    [Announcer] We have learned from various sources that the  problem in the Muslim delegation this afternoon and this evening  was the authority of the president of the federation and the  prime minister of the federal government. Can you tell us, if  that is not a diplomatic secret, how that problem has been  solved?    [Granic] It has been solved well. There have been  consultations; we also had consultations with Zagreb, with  President Tudjman. However, the consultations between Vienna  and Sarajevo were somewhat longer, and finally at around 1900 or  2000 that problem was also solved. As far as the Croatian side  is concerned, the problem was solved in a very satisfactory way.    [Announcer] Does that mean that the president has greater  authority?    [Granic] It is more or less so. But, the president and vice  president rotate every year and are elected for a four-year  period, and one year it is a Bosniak and the next a Croat.    [Announcer] You have probably also decided whether the  first president will be a Muslim or a Croat, and who will be the  first prime minister.    [Granic] The constitution does not specify that. It is a  matter of political agreement.    [Announcer] Such an agreement was or was not reached over  the  past ten days?    [Granic] No, we did not even discuss that.    [Announcer] You said that the most interesting point now is  that both Croat and Muslim representatives, as well as Redman,  are stressing that a joint platform for talks with the Serbs has  been agreed on. Can we hear at least the basic principles of  that platform?    [Granic] It was agreed that after the agreement is signed,  which is to happen at the end of next week in Washington  [changes thought], it means that President Tudjman will go to  Washington at the end of the week and sign the agreement in the  White House. The negotiations with the third side will then  begin. We agreed on proposals for the constitutional set-up and  on certain basic principles of territorial division--not all of  it, but we still have enough time to agree on it completely.    [Announcer] I must insist, was it agreed how much  territory--what percentage--will be demanded from the Bosnian  Serbs, seeing that they have said that they cannot give more  than 15 percent.    [Granic] That was also discussed and certain proposals for  the maps have been put forward, but that is an issue of the  strategy of negotiations. The information about 15 percent is  not true. They are now ready to give about 20 percent.    [Announcer] There is something that you have probably not  heard yet. I will try to tell you what it is about because we  have already shown this report to our viewers. Today Momcilo  Krajisnik made a statement following his meeting with Vitaliy  Churkin, saying that the Bosnian Serbs had been offered  something which is, to say the least, very interesting. The  offer is for them to enter into a confederal relationship with  the Muslim-Croat federation, and to enter into a confederal  relationship with the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  Will that be possible, and how do you comment on that  possibility?    [Granic] That is absolutely impossible. Mr. Churkin had such  ideas, but that was energetically refuted when we had talks in  Moscow. Also, under no circumstances will Croatia enter any  kind of relationship linking it directly or indirectly with  Yugoslavia. That was very firmly stated to Mr. Churkin, Kozyrev,  and also to the Bosniak side.    [Announcer] What is the position of the Bosniak side on such  a relationship?    [Granic] As far as the main negotiator, Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic, is concerned, he agrees with our stands.    [Announcer] When you say the main negotiator, are you  hinting in a way at certain disagreements among the Muslim  leadership?    [Granic] I cannot say that. As far as that stand is  concerned, I cannot say that there are any disagreements in the  Muslim side. We talked a lot about it today. Croatia is not  ready to enter any direct or indirect relationship with  Yugoslavia or Serbia, and everyone knows this.    [Announcer] I would like to ask you something in the end. It  seems that the presence--at America's invitation--of the  delegation of the Bosnian Posavina area at the negotiations in  Vienna passed unnoticed. What was their role, and does it  indicate that the demands the Muslim-Croat federation will make  to the Bosnian Serbs will be strongest in that area, in Bosnian  Posavina?    [Granic] Everyone knows who the negotiators are: Mr Kresimir  Zubak on behalf of the Bosnian Croats, and Messrs Martinovic and  Akmadzic were also present. The Croatian delegation is also  known. As far as the presence of Messrs Pandzic, Kovacevic and  Markesic is concerned, they were in the embassy and mainly  expressed firm support for everything that went on, that is, the  Washington agreement and everything else. I believe that this  was their role.    [Announcer] And the final question is about Krajina. Momcilo  Krajisnik said in the same statement that the Bosnian Serbs  would insist on linking the so-called Serb Republic with the  so-called Krajina. Can you comment on that? Was there any talk  over the past ten days about the guarantees the U.S. gave to  Croatia for the peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas?    [Granic] The guarantees are being discussed all the  time--both with the United States, the Security Council, the UN  secretary-general, and the European Union. No link at all can  be considered. That is the sovereign territory of the Republic  of Croatia, and Croatia is ready to negotiate in the framework  of Security Council resolutions, the Constitution and the  constitutional law.    [Announcer] Thank you very much, Mr Granic. Good night.</p>

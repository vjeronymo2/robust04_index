			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Property (The Deep South): Jacuzzis at their best - Gerald Cadogan finds grand houses for grand men in Atlanta BUY A HOUSE in Atlanta, USA, and you can let it in 1996 when the Olympic Games come to town. Splendid houses are for sale in the city, those in the northern suburbs grand enough to excuse any chairman for moving his home and his corporate headquarters to the thriving capital and air hub of the south-eastern US. Georgia began in 1733 when General Oglethorpe landed at Savannah, a place where debtors were sent. The youngest and largest of the 13 states of the original union, it was reluctant to secede from the Crown and in the civil war looked for an alliance with Britain - an outlook mirrored in the dominance of British styles in its grand houses. In 1837 a town called Terminus was founded, becoming Marthasville in 1843 and Atlanta in 1845. Its position in the foothills at the south end of the Appalachians made it the rail hub of the south east. General Sherman destroyed this city in 1866 on his horrendous march 'from Atlanta to the sea'. When he stopped shelling, less than a tenth of the houses were intact. The march to Savannah left a swathe of destruction 50 to 60 miles wide. His attempt to annihilate the economy affected life in Georgia for years, and southern memories for ever. But a pharmacist's cordial that became Coca-Cola set Atlanta on the road to recovery. By the 1920s, the money it brought the city was being spent on stately homes, mostly English-style, in the area north of the city centre where the battle of Peachtree Creek took place in the civil war. Today what is good for Coke is still good for Atlanta. Three clever architects led the mansion building between the wars, so successfully that there are bus tours round these suburban palaces. Philip Shutze (rhyming with gutsy), Neel Reid and Lewis Crook produced intelligent, sharply detailed Tudor, Queen Anne or Georgian - and some French or Italian-style - buildings with allusions to grand houses in Europe. They had a good eye for siting. North Atlanta houses are in small wooded valleys with creeks at the bottom, set well back from the road for privacy and security. The large gardens are ablaze with azaleas and dogwood in the spring and in autumn the 'man-made' woodland merges into the old natural forest so well that you do not notice where one ends and the other begins. It is suburbia, but at its best. Large, free-standing houses so close to each other surprise Europeans who would expect each to be in its own park, but their elegance and the beauty of the woods soon captivate. The property market in Atlanta has been through a similar cycle to that in the UK. Prices are well down from their 1987-88 peaks, realtor (estate agent) Harry Norman said, as he has had to explain to vendors who would like their houses priced at levels of five years ago. Unsurprisingly, some asking prices have been cut. Where Atlanta differs from the UK is that, with the greater mobility of the US workforce, there are plenty of good houses on the market. Many have super-expensive kitchens with free-standing 'island' counters and, attached to the master bedroom, jacuzzis - I have never seen so many before  -mirrored dressing rooms and large clothes cupboards that are complete rooms. Nowadays, an agent remarked, the money that in the past went on the reception rooms is spent on these private rooms. The chairman moving his corporate headquarters might like to buy an early 1920s Neel Reid house, 2 Vernon Road on offer from Harry Norman at Dollars 2.495m. It has splendid public rooms, a porch modelled on Gunston Hall, in Virginia, a stepped garden leading to a creek, and swimming pool next to the house. To spend more, he could look at 65 Valley Road, a Tudor house in immaculate condition on a very large lot (9.5 acres), with its swimming pool so deep in the woods that you would never know you were in the middle of a great city. Built for the third president of Coca-Cola, it is now the home of Edward and Suzanne Elson, who must sell as President Bill Clinton has nominated him ambassador to Denmark. With a great hall, wood panelling, and painted vaulted ceilings, and surrounded by azaleas, boxwood, dogwood and rhododendrons, the asking price is Dollars 6.75m from Jenny Pruitt. Property tax in 1992 was Dollars 21,042. It is hard to see how the ambassador's residence in Copenhagen can match it. Cheaper, and with the comforting feel of not having been revamped - house and fittings are 1930s - is 231 Peachtree Battle, for Dollars 1.25m from Jenny Pruitt. Its pool is also next to the house. The garden is a treat, planned as a series of rooms like Hidcote, in Gloucestershire, England, (which of course an American, Lawrence Johnston, made) and with interesting plants and a superb water garden around the creek at the bottom. In 3645 Nancy Creek Road the white wood floored kitchen with reinforced steel joists supporting the roof is like an exhibition pavilion. The pool below is the other highlight. Also this house is a good example of extruded mortar between the bricks, giving a rusticated texture that was news to me, but is customary in Georgia. The price is Dollars 1.9m, and the agent Jenny Pruitt. At the most expensive house 3640 Tuxedo Road (Dollars 9.5m from Harry Norman) the old water garden, now overgrown, awaits resurrection. This was once the house of Robert Woodruff, chairman of Coca Cola, sumptuous then and made more sumptuous by the present owners. Five grand houses for five chairmen or chief executive officers. If they buy next weekend, over the Thanksgiving holiday, they will be in time to enjoy the Superbowl in Atlanta in January.

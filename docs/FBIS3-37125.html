Good day to  you.    Previously Georgia was associated with the sea, fruit and  loving brunettes. Now life is tough in this country. Average  wages amount to approximately 3-4,000 rubles a month. Prices  are almost the same as those in Moscow. People do not venture  into the streets after 1900. Lord knows how they manage to live  here. Nobody has given us a clear answer to this. Georgia is  actually standing on the edge of the precipice, and that is why  the people were expecting a miracle to happen after President  Yeltsin's visit. A person writing to a local newspaper said that  he was waiting for Yeltsin's visit more than for one from his  own mother.    [Video cuts to show Svanidze interviewing Eduard  Shevardnadze  in a room]    [Svanidze] Georgia is in a very difficult situation.  President Yeltsin paid a visit to Georgia. A whole package of  documents was signed. What will change now if something is  expected to change?    [Shevardnadze] A lot will change for the better if we really  get down to implementing all that was discussed and signed, and  if this process is not dragged out.    [Svanadze] The living standards are far higher in Russia  compared with those in Georgia. So, was the aim to tie up with  Russia?    [Shevardnadze] The matter was about restoring the economic  ties between enterprises, towns and regions that had been set up  during many decades and the two past centuries. I think that  the breaching of those ties was an anomaly. There was that  naive approach toward this matter.    [Svanadze] Did you always think like this?    [Shevarnadze] I always thought like this.    [Svanadze] What is your attitude toward the expansion of the  ruble zone into Georgia?    [Shevardnadze] This issue has not yet been examined. We are  having extensive debate on this issue. First, I am not sure  that Russia will simply open the door and that tomorrow we will  find ourselves in the ruble zone.    [Svanadze] Would you like this to happen?    [Shevardnadze] One will have to think about that. If we  strive to achieve, and achieve the revival of economic life --  this should be virtually achieved in matter of several months --  then there will be a better picture on whether the national  currency has any prospects. Naturally, the present financial  situation is deplorable; this was inevitable.    [Svanidze] What made Boris Yeltsin sign the treaty with  Georgia at this particular moment?    [Shevardnadze] In connection with the Georgian-Ossetian and  the Georgian-Abkhazian conflicts, some of the Russian leaders  thought it was necessary to retain this lever for exerting  pressure on the Georgian leadership. They meant that this is in  Georgia's interest, while Russia could live without a treaty.  We have lost a great deal by not signing it earlier. I am  convinced that if a year ago we had signed a large-scale treaty,  a major agreement, and all the documents on military cooperation  we have signed now, perhaps it would have been possible to avert  the Abkhazian tragedy.    [Svanidze] I know that when Sukhumi was virtually on the  brink of capitulation, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  proposed that you introduce a considerable contingent of Russian  troops -- up to two divisions, as far as I know -- in order to  help you to take the situation in control. You refused then.  Now, under the present treaty, you are in fact agreeing to more  than just that. Do you think you then made a mistake?    [Shevardnadze] Yes, that's true, the question then was  whether we would manage to defend Sukhumi, because considerable  forces were advancing, including not only Abkhazians, but  mercenaries as well. At the time I did not act with sufficient  firmness of principle and courage. There were my young  colleagues at my side and I was told that if this happened -- I  mean if the two divisions were brought in -- they would resign.  If this demonstrative resignation had taken place, it would  have had a very negative effect on the then situation in  Georgia. Therefore, I started looking for some compromise  solutions, but Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev found them  unacceptable. Several days later the situation became  aggravated. I think this was a miscalculation on my part. I  should have done it, although the Georgian people were not ready  for this, so to speak.    [Svanidze] Are they ready for it now?    [Shevardnadze] I think that if one takes the whole complex  of  agreements, which had already been signed, the majority of  people approve of them. Approximately 70 percent of the  population now support my line, as it were, as far as this  matter is concerned.    [Svanidze] During his meeting with you, President Yeltsin  spoke not just about establishing friendly relations between  Russia and Georgia but also about becoming allies. What does it  imply for Russia and Georgia? It means the construction of a  network of military bases on the territory of Georgia.  Officially, they are talking about three bases, but as far as I  know they are talking, in fact, about the creation of seven  military bases. This would mean that -- bearing in mind the  difference in population and might of the two countries --  Georgia becomes Russia's outpost in the Caucasus, and if one  were to call things by their own names these relations will  acquire a vassal nature. Are you happy with this scenario?  Don't you think that this treaty is a diplomatic defeat for  Georgia?    [Shevardnadze] As for the military bases -- and you are  saying there might be up to seven -- we have them in  approximately three locations. They already exist. We really  ought to be talking about the duration of the stay of the  Russian Army in Georgia. There is a division stationed in  Batumi. There is another division stationed in Akhalkalaki.  There are also military units near Tbilisi and in some of the  Tbilisi districts. There is a Russian battalion in Sukhumi and  there is another one in Gudauta. So if one looks at the present  state of things they will not really change much. Our relations  are being put on a civilized footing.    [Svanidze] Incidentally, you have just counted five  locations.    [Shevardnadze] Uh?    [Svanidze] You have just counted five locations.    [Shevardnadze] No, I do not think that you can count Sukhumi  and Gudauta as bases. There are units which are stationed there  temporarily. They can be moved to Batumi, or if we do not agree  to it...[pauses] But we are more likely than not to agree  because their future presence here is simply necessary. Let us  see if there are other options. Where Georgia's interests lie,  so to speak? Just now we have looked into Russia's interests.  Yes, naturally, Russia is interested in having its armed forces  here in Georgia, in the Transcaucasian region. It is interested  in this -- again, for the sake of stability in the southern part  of the country, a large part of it -- and the question, as you  know, is not that simple. And Georgia? I have already spoken  about stability in general. How Georgia will build its own army  if there is no proper support from Russia.    [Svanidze] Speaking about this treaty: In the view of the  conditions put forward initially, who gets the best deal as a  result -- Russia or Georgia?    [Shevardnadze] I think that so far Russia has got more out  of  it. But in the long term I think Georgia will get what is due  to it.    [Svanidze] Is it true that you have on several occasions  suggested to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin that you will be prepared  to resign from the post of head of the Georgian state in the  interests of improving relations between Russia and Georgia?    [Shevardnadze] I have always said and will say it again -- I  am ready to do so. If Russia is not unequivocally happy with  Shevardnadze as a political figure, and if, as is in some  circles, he is even viewed with hostility -- I am prepared to  leave. I have tried to do this before. Unfortunately, I did  not succeed.    [Svanidze] Am I to understand then that the question of  whether you remain head of the Georgian state is mainly  determined by Yeltsin?    [Shevardnadze] No, that is not so. It is not Yeltsin who  decides this, but I am prepared, all the same. If Russia  believes that Shevardnadze can be an impediment to the  development of normal, good and neighborly relations between the  two states, I am prepared to leave. Even now, right after this  conversation is over.</p>

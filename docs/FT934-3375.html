			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Cards may be 'smart', but are they attractive? National Westminster Bank has been demonstrating in a mocked-up sitting room the 'smart card' which it hopes to establish as a global substitute for cash. The phone on which cash can be transferred to the card sits by a bookshelf containing Enid Blyton's Mysteries and a book called Great Disasters. For the moment, the prospects of smart cards remain a mystery. Whether the Mondex card will become a disaster or a triumph for NatWest depends on the reaction of about 30,000 consumers and 1,000 retailers in Swindon. Their reaction in a pilot run with British Telecommunications in 1995 will determine its future. The Mondex vision is compelling, both for consumers and for banks which spend increasing amounts on handling cash. NatWest hopes that consumers will adjust to a world in which they load cards with cash from phones and electronic terminals in up to 30 currencies, and use the cards as cash tokens. The heart of the system is a computer chip which sits on a plastic card and can store electronic value in up to five currencies. The holder can load the card from a bank cash machine, a retailer's terminal, or from a telephone with a card reader which may cost about Dollars 200 (Pounds 134). Once the cash is transferred from the holder's account to the card it can be spent at any retail outlet which has the right card reader. There is no personal identification number (PIN), so someone who drops the card in the street can easily lose the whole amount, just like losing cash. Security is provided by the ability to 'lock' the card so that it cannot be used. This 'locking' can also be done on a plastic 'wallet' with its own internal chip which two Japanese electronics companies have built for NatWest. This can also be used to transfer money from one card to another. Users will be able to check the balance on the card by using a reader built into a keyring (pictured right). Yet Mondex is fraught with risks. Older people may not like carrying around a card which a thief can use like cash unless it has been electronically 'locked'. Equally, NatWest and its partner Midland may not make a return on a large capital investment if other banks simply set up competing smart-card systems. The heart of the appeal for banks is twofold. First, they may remove cash from the enormously expensive clearing systems which operate in all developed countries. The cost of cash transmission in the UK clearing system alone has been estimated at Pounds 2bn a year. Second, they may establish a form of payment which is suited to a wider range of consumers and retail outlets than credit and debit cards. Such cards are limited to creditworthy consumers who can be trusted not to overspend, but the Mondex system simply provides a limited amount of cash. Mr Tim Jones, the NatWest executive who thought of the idea, said: 'There is a much broader opportunity than with credit and debit because anyone can hold cash.' He said the technology suited cash-based outlets such as taxis, fast-food stores and small retailers well. The bank emphasises the use for families which could hand out set sums to children using the electronic wallet. But it argues strongly against the notion that it is simply an electronic card for feckless folk without access to credit. The hardest task will be to persuade consumers of the benefit. The ability to load cash from home may appeal. The easy access to foreign currency is also convenient. But a lot may depend on the bank's eventual pricing strategy. Having to buy equipment to participate in a card-based system when cash accounts are free might not hold much appeal. But NatWest will have to make it attractive enough to establish the brand clearly.</p>

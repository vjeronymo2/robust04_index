			<p>BFN     [Text] A government delegation comprising representatives  from the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food Industry; the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social  Welfare; and the Government Office paid a working visit to Quang  Tri Province on 23-24 May to inspect the crop failure there and  to discuss the hunger recently faced by the province.    The province is facing an acute hunger situation due to the  failure of two consecutive crops. About 16 percent of its  population is experiencing serious hunger. Among them, 34,000  are ethnic minorities and 44,000 are people dependent on social  welfare assistance in the coastal area. More than 70 percent of  families in 11 of 44 villages inhabited by ethnic people face  severe hunger.    To resolve this situation, Quang Tri Province has allotted 1  billion dong from its reserve budget to buy seeds for  distribution to the peasants to help them quickly engage in  planting the summer-fall rice crop. The province also is  striving to improve the irrigation system and encouraging the  people to plant more subsidiary food crops to relieve the hunger  situation.    Quang Tri Province requested that the government delegation  consider an exemption of its agricultural tax and the  postponement of its debt payment to the state bank during the  winter-spring and summer-fall rice crops. It has also asked the  government to provide help to relieve the hunger situation while  distributing more seeds to the peasants to help them quickly  engage in the planting of summer-fall and winter-spring rice  crops.</p>

The meeting was attended by Acting Prime Minister Necmettin  Cevheri, the chief of the General Staff, the ministers who are  members of the Council, the force commanders, the gendarmerie  commander, and the NSC secretary general. The meeting was also  attended by the deputy prime minister and state minister, and  because issues concerning their ministries were discussed, by  State Ministers Ibrahim Tez and Abdulbaki Atac, and Public Works  and Housing Minister Onur Kumbaracibasi.    1. At the meeting, the NSC reviewed and assessed the  security and public order situation in the country in general  and the domestic and foreign developments that affect it. It  determined that the successful results being obtained in the  struggle against separatist terrorism, and that the support our  people give our security forces in this struggle, increases  daily. The NSC also determined that, faced with the heavy  losses incurred by the separatist organization recently,  surrender would be beneficial for our youths who have been used  as tools in this adventure against the unity of our country.    The NSC decided to recommend to the government to continue  with economic and social measures in parallel with antiterrorist  efforts in the area.    2. Considering the need for existing measures and for the  exercise of authority, the NSC unanimously decided to extend the  state of emergency currently in effect in Batman, Bingol,  Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli, and  Van by another four months as of 1700 on 13 July 1994. The NSC  decided to inform the government of this decision.</p>

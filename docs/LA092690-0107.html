			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Jet Engine Cracks Probed: Cracks inside the shafts of 12 Pratt &amp; Whitney  PW4000 jet engines have prompted a Federal Aviation Administration  investigation, with findings expected to be released next week. The defective  shafts cleared inspections at Pratt in Hartford, Conn., and at Le Fiell Co.,  the San Francisco-based subcontractor that forged the shafts for Pratt, the  Hartford Courant reported. One engine had been in service before it was  grounded, three had been shipped for installation on jumbo passenger jets and  the others were in various stages of assembly.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wu Xiaojun and Liu Shun: "Non-Aligned </F> Movement Seeks To Play More Effective Role"]    [Text] Cairo, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers or  representatives from 109 Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) member  states gathered in Cairo from May 31 to June 3, discussing  future role of the NAM under the new world situation.    The world has seen great changes since the ending of the  Cold  War with the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. How to  face the new challenges and make NAM become more effective  through adjustment becomes a focal point of discussion during  the four-day 11th NAM foreign ministerial conference.    U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's envoy to the  conference spoke on behalf of Butrus-Ghali that the Non-Aligned  Movement, as other world organizations, came to a cross-road and  needs to reaffirm its duty in today's world.    The envoy asserted that as an inter-continent movement, NAM  can play a special role in the international political sphere.    Delegations to the conference confirmed that as an important  forum and channel for maintaining the interest for developing  countries, NAM also has its own function. Its principle of  independence, self-determination, non-alignment, non-blocking  and maintaining world peace, disarmament and establishing new  international economic order still has vitality.    The ministers pointed out that the NAM countries should  strengthen its coordination and take unified stands on major  international issues, in a bid to produce more voice in the  United Nations and strengthen negotiating power in dialogue with  the developed countries.    It is widely agreed that peace and development are still two  major task for the NAM. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak said  at the conference opening ceremony that facing the challenges  posed by the changes in the world, the Non-Aligned Movement is  required to stand up as representative of the whole developing  world and strengthen its coordination with Group [of] 77.    As for security issues, many delegates to the conference  expressed concern over the fightings and conflicts in some  developing countries. They called for peaceful and political  means for solving the conflicts and fightings in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Rwanda and Yemen.    Ministers said the developing countries witnessed sluggish  economic growth due to historical reasons, unfare trade [as  received] and debt problems. Thus they should make persistent  efforts to build a new international economic order.    They called on the movement to promote South-South  cooperation and South-North dialogue and has closer contacts  with Group 77.    Govind Narain Srivastava, Indian delegate to the conference,  said the end of Cold War does not mean that the Non-Aligned  Movement has outlived its utility.    He said, "It is widely agreed that although political items  will continue to attract attention of the movement, the major  focus will, certainly, be on the economic issues."    As the gap between the developed and developing world  widens,  the movement shall have to assign maximum priority to the  economic contents and take concerted action for economic  prosperity, he added.    Though the ministers said the movement should strengthen  coordination among its member states in economic field, most of  them believed that the NAM would play a greater role in the  political sphere.    The conference concluded with the issuing of the "Cairo  Declaration," which will be the guidelines for the approach of  the 109-member movement toward political and economic issues of  interest to NAM countries.    The Non-Aligned Movement was established in 1961. South  African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo participated in the  conference and his country was accepted as NAM's 109th member  state.</p>

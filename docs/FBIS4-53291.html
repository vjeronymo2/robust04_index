			<p>BFN     [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] is open to the  possibility of holding the second round of formal talks between  the government and the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] in  the Philippines, if Indonesia could no longer host the peace  negotiations. However, Presidential Adviser on the Peace  Process Manuel Yan said the Philippine Government will wait for  Jakarta's advice on the date when it could be held.    The talks were scheduled to be held yesterday, however the  Indonesian Government asked the Philippine Government panel to  wait for further advice as to when the formal talks could be  resumed in Jakarta. The Indonesian Government called off the  second round of talks without giving any official excuse.  Observers say however, Jakarta is angry because a Philippine  nongovernment organization is hosting a conference on reported  human rights violations in East Timor, a former Portuguese  colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976.</p>

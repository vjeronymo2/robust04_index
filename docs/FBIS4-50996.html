			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- Taiwan's balance of  payments has changed structurally, with the current account  surplus declining while capital inflow is beginning to outpace  capital outflow, finance officials said Tuesday [24 May].    Taiwan saw a net capital inflow of more than U.S.$1 billion  in the first quarter of this year, the first favorable balance  in its capital account since 1988, according to preliminary  statistics compiled by the Central Bank of China (CBC).    Taiwan's current account surplus, however, dropped to a  13-year low of about U.S.$200 million during the January-March  period mainly because of a sharp decline in the merchandise  trade surplus, the CBC said.    It will release the exact figures of the country's balance  of  payments for the first quarter of 1994 later this week.    CBC officials said the capital account surplus indicates  that  foreign capital movement has begun to influence Taiwan's balance  of payments as a result of its financial liberalization and  internationalization policy.    Meanwhile, the officials said, the drop in the current  account surplus reflects structural changes in the local  economy. Taiwan has gradually lost export competitiveness,  particularly in labor-intensive industries, and thus no longer  enjoys a huge trade surplus. Taiwan's foreign trade surplus  totaled only U.S.$240 million during the three-month period.    The balance of payments measure records all of a country's  economic transactions with the rest of the world during a  specified period of time. It is usually divided into the  capital account, which records short and long-term capital  flows, and the current account, which records merchandise and  service trade as well as unrequited transfers.    The balance of payments is an effective measure to monitor a  country's external trade and financial relations.    Taiwan consistently registered net capital outflows between  1987 and 1993 as local companies were making massive investments  abroad because of the worsening investment climate here. The  capital account deficit reached a record U.S.$5.6 billion in the  fourth quarter of 1992.    The trend reversed itself in the first quarter of this year.  An influx of "hot money" for investment in the local stock  market in January and February as well as a slowdown in direct  overseas investments resulted in a net capital inflow of more  than US$10 billion during the period.    Thanks to its huge current account surplus, Taiwan saw its  balance of payments end up in the black between 1981 and 1991.  It registered a rare U.S.$639 million deficit in its  international balance sheet in 1992, but again chalked up a  U.S.$1.45 billion surplus last year.    The balance of payments surplus is also expected to exceed  U.S.$1 billion in the first quarter of 1994 due to a combination  of factors, including net capital inflow, slower increases in  overseas travel bills and increases in interest income from the  country's huge foreign exchange reserves, the officials noted.</p>

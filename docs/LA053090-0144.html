			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 'CHEERS' STAR FACES DRUG TRIAL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer today testified that "Cheers" star Kelsey Grammer  confessed to dropping a small packet of cocaine in his patrol car after the  actor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in 1988.  </P> <P> "That cocaine was in my pocket.  </P> <P> I felt stupid. I should have just told you I had it," Officer Michael Akana  quoted Grammer as saying. "You deserve better than that. I would like to  apologize to you," the star allegedly added.  </P> <P> Akana was the sole witness during a preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal  Court on the cocaine possession charge stemming from Grammer's 1988 arrest in  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Judge Aviva K. Bobb said the evidence was sufficient to hold Grammer for trial  and scheduled a Van Nuys Superior Court arraignment for June 13.  </P> <P> Wearing a blue jail uniform and sporting a stubbly beard, Grammer looked  cheerful as he came into court. He is serving a 30-day sentence for a probation  violation stemming from an unrelated drunk driving conviction.  </P></p>

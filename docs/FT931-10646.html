			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Investcorp profits rise 20% to Dollars 62.7m INVESTCORP, the Bahraini-financed international investment bank which controls well-known businesses in the US and Europe, pushed up its after-tax profit by 20.2 per cent to Dollars 62.7m (Pounds 41.5m) in 1992. Investcorp, which was set up 10 years ago, specialises in channelling funds held by wealthy Arabs into well established businesses, such as Gucci and Saks Fifth Avenue. It is attempting to buy and reorganise Circle K, the bankrupt US convenience store chain. Mr Michael Merritt, Investcorp's chief administrative officer, said there were two main reasons for the profit growth. Investcorp realised two of its US investments, Catherine's Stores, a US retail chain specialising in extra large clothing for women, and Sports &amp; Recreation, a sporting goods retailer. The second source of profit growth was the two corporate acquisitions it organised during the year, on which it earned fees. On behalf of its pool of investors and also using its own funds, a 50 per cent stake in the German Mondi Group, a clothing manufacturer, was bought. In early 1992, it bought Nouvelle Lemania, a manufacturer of watch movements, and then merged this business with Breguet, the Swiss watch company owned by Investcorp and its clients. Mr Merritt said Investcorp was looking at possible investments in the UK. He and Mr Elias Hallack, Investcorp's chief financial officer, are being appointed co-chief operating officers. A Dollars 15m cash dividend is being paid - identical to the payment for the past few years - representing a 15 per cent return on the capital invested by the founder shareholders in the business.</p>

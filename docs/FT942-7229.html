			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds falls to Pounds 121.6m - Recovery seen in Chinese markets helps sustain share price Courtaulds, the chemicals and fibres group, yesterday said it was seeing recovery in some of the markets hit by last year's credit squeeze in China. Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said that acrylic fibre prices had started to harden, helped by the problems of the Chinese cotton crop, and that demand for acetate tow, used in cigarette filters, was picking up. The comments helped Courtaulds' shares remain unchanged at 527p in a falling market despite a sharp drop in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 186.2m to Pounds 121.6m on turnover of Pounds 2bn (Pounds 2.09bn), including Pounds 43.7m (Pounds 141.2m) from discontinued activities. The figures were affected by a number of exceptional items and a higher interest bill. At the operating level profits slipped 11 per cent to Pounds 174.5m. About half the fall was due to a sharp drop in acetate tow prices after China suspended purchases in its anti-inflation drive. Profits from acetate tumbled by Pounds 12m to Pounds 28m. Although Chinese purchases have resumed Mr Huismans does not expect to see much improvement in the short-term. 'The price position will take some years to recover.' But the prospects for fibre prices have improved following a disappointing cotton crop in China. 'It is now such a big economy that marginal changes start to have a significant impact on world markets,' said Mr Huismans. Following the figures several analysts upgraded their forecasts with Mr Martin Evans at Hoare Govett increasing his pre-tax prediction from Pounds 170m to Pounds 185m before exceptionals, up from Pounds 146.2m last year. Total profits from fibres and chemicals fell to Pounds 93m (Pounds 108m) on sales of Pounds 727m (Pounds 775m) with Tencel, Courtaulds new fibre, making a net profit. Mr Huismans said Tencel's contribution this year would be held back by the costs of building European and Asian operations. Courtaulds is constructing a second US Tencel plant costing Dollars 134m (Pounds 90m) and is still examining four possible sites for its European factory. Capital investment, which rose to Pounds 130m, or 1.7 times depreciation, will increase further this year but gearing was down to 30 per cent (39 per cent) helped by disposals profits of Pounds 25.1m. There were Pounds 49.7m of restructuring charges, relating largely to the previously announced rationalisation in coatings and sealants, and the interest bill rose Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 31.6m, including a Pounds 9.1m charge to close interest rate swaps no longer required. Profits from coatings and sealants slipped to Pounds 62m (Pounds 64m) on sales of Pounds 875m (Pounds 848m) with the marine paint business buoyant but US industrial markets still in recession. Polymer products were steady at Pounds 32m on turnover of Pounds 352m (Pounds 330m). Dividends are up 5.7 per cent to 14.8p, via a 10.8p final, although earnings fell to 20.3p (35.1p) or 25.8p before exceptionals. See Lex</p>

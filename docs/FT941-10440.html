			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Toyota plummets 48.7% to Y83bn in six months Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, suffered a 48.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the six months to end-December in one of the worst business periods in the company's history. Pre-tax profits plunged to Y83.24bn (Dollars 764m) from Y162.34bn in the corresponding interim period a year ago largely as a result of the weak domestic market and the adverse impact of a sharply stronger yen. Operating profits fell by 84 per cent to Y9.34bn - the steepest decline suffered by the company. The ratio of operating profits to sales at 0.25 per cent was the worst the company has experienced. Sales fell by 13 per cent to Y3,987bn from Y4,564bn, the first decline in turnover for seven years. Toyota's deteriorating financial performance underlines the severity of Japan's economic downturn, as well as the impact of the yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar and the impact of weak demand in European markets. Several of Japan's leading carmakers, including Nissan and Mazda, have suffered heavy losses following three successive years of falling new vehicle demand in the domestic market. Toyota, which has a calendar financial year unlike most Japanese companies which report to March, had been able to avoid falling into loss mainly as a result of its cost-cutting efforts, Mr Masami Iwasaki, executive vice-chairman said. The cost cutting efforts, which had saved Y70bn, had been more than wiped out by foreign exchange fluctuations, which had reduced operating profits by Y100bn. Every Y1 rise in the value of the Japanese currency against the dollar translates into a loss for Toyota of Y10bn, it said. While Toyota expects a moderate recovery in Japan in the second half to June, it believes weak European demand and the adverse impact of the high yen will continue to weigh heavily on second-half profits. The company is forecasting pre-tax profits of Y200bn for the full year, down from Y286.45bn previously on sales of Y8,100bn against Y10,210bn. The sales forecast is lower than its previous forecast of Y8,700bn made in August although the pre-tax forecast in unchanged.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Clinton attacks Bush over 'isolationism': The main Democratic presidential contender addresses foreign policy MR BILL Clinton, front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the US, yesterday accused President George Bush of 'invoking a new world order without enunciating a new American purpose' in external relations. In a foreign policy address in New York, the governor of Arkansas charged that the Bush administration had brought about 'a new birth of isolationism on the left and on the right' of US politics. He was specifically critical of what he called 'an overly cautious approach' to assisting the former Soviet Union. But his main purpose was to take on the president in Mr Bush's perceived area of strength - management of foreign policy - and to contrast it with his own internationalist prescriptions. The speech, his first on foreign policy since last December, was also intended to deflect attention from his own bitter contest with Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, in the New York, Wisconsin and Kansas Democratic primaries next week. It was delivered the day after Mr Brown had thrashed him in the Vermont party caucuses. Mr Clinton, implicitly critical of both Mr Bush and Mr Brown, said the American people were being offered 'a false choice' between domestic and foreign priorities. The two, he argued, were indivisible, and restoring the nation's domestic strength and competitivity constituted a necessary precursor to 'leading the world we have done so much to make.' He conceded that the president had shown 'deft' crisis management in the Gulf War. But, he went on, the lack of a positive vision had led to miscalculations and missed opportunities.' He cited the 'browbeating' of Israel, earlier attempts to woo Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, 'coddling China's ageing rulers,' and failing to keep pace with the democratic revolutions in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, including the absence of US recognition of Slovenia and Croatia. Mr Clinton saw a world shaped by three realities: continuing danger even after the end of the Cold War, with threats from such diverse quarters as ethnic rivalries, terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons; the force of democracy: and the imperative of strong US leadership. As president, he said, 'I will not shrink from using military force responsibly and I will maintain the forces we need to win, and win decisively, should that necessity arise.' In Europe, 'we must maintain our ties to Nato, even as the Europeans play a stronger role both within Nato and in the evolution of future secureity arrangements for the continent.' He committed himself strongly to the UN and to international financial institutions, while reserving the US right to act alone when vital national interests were at stake. The US should pay its arrears to the UN, and Japan and Germany should be made permanent members of its Security Council. It would, he said, be 'deeply irresonsible' to pull the plug on foreign aid, and he charged Mr Bush with failing, yesterday's announcement in Washington notwithstanding, to show leadership in pressing for bigger quotas at the International Monetary Fund. The overall message was to emphasise the historic changes taking place in the world asnd the continued need for US leadership. 'After World War two,' he concluded, 'in similar circumstances, our nation proclaimed its character with an historic pledge to defend, to build, and to lead. I am confident the American people stand ready to affirm that pledge again today.'</p>

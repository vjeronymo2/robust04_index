			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["-ann" report: "Neuber: Further Prime Rate Reductions"] </F>   [Text] Duesseldorf, 18 May -- Because of many special  influences, the money supply has lost -- at least temporarily --  its significance as a central indicator of monetary policy.  Thus, the Bundesbank is well advised to orient itself toward  other values, such as costs and capacity utilization, which can  help to predict the future development of prices. Since these  indicators signal a further easing of tensions at the price  front for the foreseeable future, one can probably assume that  the Bundesbank will be willing to make further cautious  reductions of the prime rate in the coming months -- even if the  money supply does not move toward the target corridor. This was  stated by Friedel Neuber, chairman of the board of directors of  West Landesbank, at the news conference presenting his bank's  balance sheet.    In Neuber's view, the overall economic constellation in the  FRG is fundamentally different from that in the United States:  There they have a strong upswing with expectations of rising  inflation and an increasing demand in net capital imports, which  goes hand in hand with increasing deficits in the balance of  goods and services; here we have a generally moderate recovery  of the economic development with expectations of declining  inflation and a declining dependence on capital imports, which  goes hand in hand with shrinking deficits of the balance of  goods and services. In addition, short-term interest rates in  Germany are now clearly below long-term interest rates, so that  sooner or later shifts to longer-term forms of deposits can be  expected. All this indicates that the German capital market  will decouple itself from the U.S. capital market to a certain  extent so that the German capital-market interest rate will  probably go down again over the next few weeks. However, Neuber  does not foresee a decline to the record low of the beginning of  the year.    In the view of Neuber, who quoted a new 1994-95 forecast for  Germany of the West Landesbank economists, the international  economy has gotten out of the longest period of weakness of the  postwar period so that, for the first time since 1989, the  German economy will once again get tangible stimuli from abroad.  In the wake of product and process innovations at the companies  and a moderate wage round, Neuber sees a clear reduction of unit  labor costs in industry in 1994, while productivity and profits  will increase considerably.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Isabel Becerril] </F>   [Text] The chemical industry will oppose the accelerated  elimination of tariffs under NAFTA, according to Arturo Garcia,  president of the National Chemical Industry Association. He said  it is wrong to follow this course at this time because NAFTA is  still quite new and the three countries involved are just  starting to obtain benefits from the trade pact.    He also told EL FINANCIERO that this sector had decided not  to enter into any trade commitments until it received guarantees  that the treaty would benefit the industry. He also noted that  current negotiations with Venezuela and Colombia are "stalled"  because the Venezuelans have asked that the policy on the origin  of goods be made flexible. This situation has cast doubts that  the treaty will only benefit those countries that signed it.    Interviewed at his office, Arturo Garcia admitted that  NAFTA,  which was signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada,  includes a provision that the signatories can request the  accelerated elimination of tariffs on a number of products as  part of the regular treaty regime. The chemical industry,  however, is not willing to give up the advantages it achieved in  the NAFTA negotiations.    Garcia recalled that with the treaty, the industry obtained  a  10-year moratorium on tariff elimination on almost all its  products because the sector proved it required a transition  period to reduce its tariffs to zero, and "this was accepted by  all three parties." What the industry will do, he said, is offer  the United States and Canada a list of products whose tariffs  can be eliminated immediately because these were not included in  NAFTA and are not produced in the country.    It has to be very clear, however, that the chemical industry  will not ask any tariff be eliminated on products in response to  the document. "We will only offer, for their acceptance, a few  highly specialized products that we do not have in Mexico." The  industry's position is firm: Let the text of the treaty remain  as it was negotiated.    Referring to the negotiations with Costa Rica and Chile, as  well as those with the United States and Canada, Garcia said the  chemical industry is very pleased with these talks because the  policy on origin of goods was accepted in those talks.  Unfortunately, he added, negotiations with Venezuela and  Colombia have encountered problems because of the chapter that  covers rules on origin. Those two countries want this chapter  to be weak or very flexible, and this does not guarantee that  goods from those industries in which Mexico is competitive will  flow to those two countries.</p>

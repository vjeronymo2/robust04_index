			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Astra pays more as profits soar ASTRA, Sweden's leading pharmaceuticals group, saw 1992 pre-tax profits rise 50 per cent to SKr5.12bn (Dollars 678m) from SKr3.41bn, driven by strong sales growth and one-off currency gains. The strong performance led the group to raise its dividend by 54 per cent to SKr5 a share from SKr3.25, on a 60 per cent increase in earnings per share to SKr28.80. Sales rose 25 per cent to SKr15.6bn, which the group stressed was entirely due to higher volumes rather than increased prices. Growth is expected to continue in 1993, with earnings rising in line with sales. However, the group did not give a specific forecast because of turbulent currency conditions. Operating earnings after depreciation rose 29 per cent last year to SKr3.96bn from SKr3.06bn. But the group also benefited from a 62 per cent rise in net interest income to SKr580m and a SKr470m one-off currency translation gain as a result of the weakening of the krona. Operating income and licensing income were only marginally affected by exchange rate changes as the krona only fell sharply at the end of the year. Astra's sales rose sharply in a number of important markets, including the UK, Germany and Sweden. Sales of Losec, its top-selling anti-peptic ulcer drug, climbed 43 per cent to SKr4.35bn from SKr3.03bn. If the drug's sales through licensees is included, sales rose to SKr7.2bn from SKr4.85bn. Pulmicort, the anti-asthma agent, saw a 55 per cent growth in sales to SKr1.91bn to make it the group's second most important drug. Plendil, the anti-hypertensive agent, increased sales by 69 per cent to SKr569m. 'This is a good underlying performance and shows that Astra has probably the best portfolio of new drugs of any of the world's major pharmaceutical companies,' said Mr Andrew Tivanen, pharmaceutical analyst at James Capel in London. The group is also one of the least exposed to threatened US healthcare reforms. The latest performance extends an impressive run which has seen Astra's profits growth outstrip sales growth for the past 15 years. In both 1990 and 1991, the group pushed its pre-tax profits up by 36 per cent a year. The group's A shares fell SKr22 to SKr685, largely because the figures disappointed some of the expectations which built up last week. Astra is also proposing a five-for-one share split.

The revised Circular was developed by an interagency task force for governmentwide use in a common rule format to facilitate regulatory adoption by executive departments and agencies. In the published revised Circular, OMB specified as ``required action'' that, Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering grants and other agreements to recipients described therein, shall adopt the language in the Circular unless other provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. This interim final rule adopts the provisions of the revised Circular word-for-word. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is effective August 3, 1994.

OMB Circular A&hyph;110 was originally issued by OMB in 1976 with minor revisions made in 1987. The standards it contained were structured into 15 attachments lettered A&hyph;O. An interagency task force also reviewed the circular in 1987 and recommended it be combined with OMB Circular A&hyph;102, Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements with State and Local Governments, as a consolidated ``common rule''. In November 1988, a proposed consolidated ``common rule'' was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (53 FR 44716) but, due to adverse concerns by some university groups and Federal agencies it was not finalized and issued by OMB. In November 1990, another interagency task force was convened to review Circular A&hyph;110 and a revision in a ``common rule'' format was proposed and developed. This revision was published for comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 39018) in August 1992 and over 200 comments were received from all sources. All comments were considered in a final revision of Circular A&hyph;110 which was issued for governmentwide application in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 29, 1993. Consequently, this rule is published as an interim final rule because of the previous request-for-comment process used in the development of the Circular, the large number of comments already received and considered by OMB and the Federal agencies, and the limited flexibility to revise the rule provided by OMB. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

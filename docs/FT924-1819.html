			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Arts: A remarkable 'Cyrano de Bergerac' - Theatre To begin with an apology: I had never seen Cyrano de Bergerac before in any of its manifold versions, whether on stage screen or whatever, so can make no comparisons with previous performances. Innocence or ignorance, however, can be an advantage: I can say with absolute freshness what a remarkable piece it is. Nothing else is quite like it. The version at the Haymarket is a new translation by John Wells. That itself gives pause for thought. Anything that Wells has a hand in - whether it is 'Dear Bill' in Private Eye or his current role in Graham Greene's Travels With My Aunt at Wyndham's - tends to bear his own unmistakeable, whimsical stamp. One could almost believe that he invented Cyrano. But he did not; it just fits his style. The original play is by Edmond Rostand (1868-1918) and has been a success around the world ever since it was first performed in Paris in 1897. Cyrano (1616-1665) was a real figure: poet, soldier, philosopher, scientist and lover of both sexes, he was someone whom Rostand picked up at a time when the European theatre was entering a period of great earnestness. There is nothing earnest about Cyrano, whether the man or the play. Rostand called it an heroic comedy. It could be equally well described as a mock tragedy. However, it seems to me that it is simply sui generis. The principal attribute of Cyrano is that he has a very large nose, which he assumes disfigures him and blights his life. In fact, he is quite wrong about this. In the play, he is an affable character, much sought-after and well-liked. It is his misfortune to believe that he gets by largely on his verbal felicity, while the men with good looks get the girl. But there is much more to Cyrano than Cyrano. Rostand was plainly steeped in Shakespeare. Echoes of the battle scenes in Henry IV recur throughout; possibly Cyrano is meant to be a rather cleverer Falstaff with a French education. There is, in this production by Elijah Moshinksi, some remarkably good ensemble playing of a kind that one does not always associate with the West End. One of the characters, de Guiche, is played by Julian Glover, fresh from his performance as King Henry for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The RSC influence is catching. There is also a development of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. Cyrano cannot court the woman he wants for fear of being thought too ugly, so he gives his words to his handsome friend. For a time they woo together as if on stilts. This is comedy of a very high order. So, too, is the fencing scene where the duellists not only have to compete with blades but also in inventing verse as they fight. Shakespeare comes in again with a series of puns: 'But soft, what nose through yonder window breaks?' and the inevitable 'a nose by any other name'. Yet the influences are by no means all English. In this very curious mix of a play, it is quite hard not to think of Proust and Stendahl. Rostand brings everything together. Cyrano is played by Robert Lindsay who carries his nose to perfection. Note when he is asked to taste some wine from a rather narrow glass. The girl, Roxane, is Stella Gonet; she becomes remarkably dignified, almost queen-like in spectacles, in her old age. Both the designs by Michael Yeargan and the lighting by David Hersey are exceptional. A huge amount of effort has gone into the details, and it pays off. Cyrano should be added to the list of plays to be seen during the holidays - or whenever. Theatre Royal, Haymarket (071) 930 8800</p>

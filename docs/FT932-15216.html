			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: US stores blame poor weather for flat sales THE severe winter storm that swept across the eastern US last month was blamed for the generally disappointing March retail sales figures reported by the largest US store groups last week. K mart, which takes in a leading chain of discount stores and specialty retail operations, reported a 1.3 per cent fall in same-store sales last month, for example. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, managed only a 3 per cent gain, far below the double-digit increases that investors have come to expect from the Arkansas-based company. Sears, Roebuck, another big retail group based in Chicago, also posted a fall - in this case of 1.4 per cent. Some of the traditional department stores fared slightly better, however. May Department Stores managed a 5 per cent increase in same-store sales; Neiman Marcus posted a 3.8 per cent gain; and Federated Department Stores, which owns Bloomingdale's and Abraham &amp; Straus, reported a 2.5 per cent advance. But among the specialty retailers, there were some pronounced declines: The Gap, the San Francisco-based fashion chain whose 'star' reputation has become somewhat tarnished lately, reported a 6 per cent fall in same-store sales, for example. Retailers admitted that the weather might not have been the only influence, with waning consumer confidence also a factor. 'Uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and the prospect of higher taxes is translating into lower levels of consumer confidence and a modest reduction in consumer activity,' said Mr Allen Questrom, chairman of Federated. 'If these trends continue, they can be expected to have some impact on retail performance for the remainder of the year,' he added.</p>

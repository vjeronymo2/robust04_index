			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Niassa Provincial Elections  Commission said it will not contact the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] to open its areas to the voter registration  process, because it is not its duty to contact parties but the  government's duty. He was commenting about Renamo advisers'  remarks to the Niassa provincial governor that the process will  not begin in Renamo-controlled areas if the provincial elections  commission does not contact it.    In Niassa Province, the voter registration process has only  begun in the city of Lichinga and district capitals. A source  from the provincial elections commission said the process has  not yet begun in other areas because of a lack of  transportation. The process has also not yet begun in  Renamo-controlled areas.</p>

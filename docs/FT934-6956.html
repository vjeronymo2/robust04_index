			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / EU offers Serbia deal on sanctions The European Union yesterday backed a Franco-German plan to offer Serbia a gradual suspension of United Nations sanctions in exchange for more land for Bosnia's embattled Moslems. It was the union's first joint action under the Maastricht treaty. Foreign ministers of the 12, meeting in Luxembourg alongside the Western European Union, the EU's embryonic defence arm, also threatened force to get aid through Bosnia. Last night, though, UN soldiers were reported to be preparing to start delivering food to civilians after the Bosnian Croat militia commander, Mr Ante Russo, agreed to allow safe passage of aid convoys. Aid deliveries were suspended four weeks ago after attacks on convoys, and Bosnia's huge refugee population faces catastrophe as winter takes hold. The 12 foreign ministers, with Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, and commanders of the UN peace force, have invited military and political leaders of the warring parties to Geneva on Monday to discuss humanitarian aid and steps towards a peace settlement. The US and Russia are being invited to Geneva. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'We are very anxious not to get into any tangles, as we did earlier in the year with the Americans', when the US and Europe clashed over Washington's plan to lift the UN arms embargo on Bosnia and to bomb Serb positions. Ministers made clear that they were offering only a progressive phasing out of sanctions on Serbia and its ally Montenegro. That will be conditional on Serb, and possibly Croat, surrender of some of the land seized from Bosnian Moslems; a ceasefire; and undisturbed passage for aid convoys and airlifts into Tuzla, Mostar and Sarajevo. The total suspension of sanctions, in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 871, would be contingent on a deal being reached over the Serb enclave of Krajina in south Croatia, and over Belgrade's domination of the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo.</p>

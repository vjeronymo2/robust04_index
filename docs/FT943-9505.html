			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Kok cabinet to be named soon The Dutch caretaker finance minister, Mr Wim Kok, was yesterday putting the finishing touches to a three-party government coalition agreement that will make him the next prime minister, more than 100 days after the May general election. The three parties that are aiming to govern - Mr Kok's Labour party, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 - will be asked to approve the plan over the next few days, and ministers are expected to be appointed next week. The proposed left-right coalition, a new departure in Dutch politics, will relegate the Christian Democrats of prime minister Ruud Lubbers to the opposition benches for the first time in modern Dutch politics. Mr Kok's plan calls for Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.59bn) in spending cuts over four years, around a third of them falling controversially on social security. University education is also set for a shake-up. Students would continue to receive funding up to their bachelor's degree, but would have to take out loans to finance master's and doctoral degrees.</p>

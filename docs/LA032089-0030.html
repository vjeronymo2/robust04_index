			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'HARD TIMES' A GOOD TIME AT SCR  </P> <P> In his "Hard Times," Charles Dickens assailed those teachers who wanted to cram  children's heads with facts at the expense of the imagination. So it's entirely  fitting that the staging of this 1854 novel, now at South Coast Repertory's  Second Stage in Costa Mesa, is a triumph of the imagination.  </P> <P> Adapter Stephen Jeffreys spurned the scenic detail and enormous casts of the  Dickens movies. Instead, he relied on our ability to imagine -- that five  actors were really 19 wonderfully varied characters, that an almost bare stage  was really a grimy armpit of the Industrial Revolution, that these oppressed  and depressed people might break into song at crucial moments.  </P> <P> In the story, the schoolmaster Gradgrind instructs his pupils to reject art  that isn't absolutely realistic. Defying Gradgrind's advice, Jeffreys and his  precursors, the people who put together the Royal Shakespeare Company's  "Nicholas Nickleby," not only celebrated the imagination, but they also  celebrated the stage as one of the best places to exercise that imagination.  </P> <P> At South Coast, actors and audience alike get an invigorating workout.  </P> <P> True, the audience must sit for 3 1/2 hours, stirring only during two  intermissions. (The show begins an hour earlier than most Second Stage  productions.) But that's not as long as the installments of "Nicholas," and the  story moves swiftly. There's a slight sag during the second act, but -- as in  "Nicholas" -- the material is so rich that any momentary restlessness soon  dissipates.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the audience's role is not just to absorb everything but also to  make the connections between "Hard Times" and our times. Jeffreys' script is  more insistent about this than was "Nicholas"; in a closing chorale, he  directly challenges us to make those connections.  </P> <P> Yet director Robert W. Goldsby hasn't inserted contemporary references: to  trickle-down economics, for example, or to those parents who parade fact-filled  flash cards in front of their babies. He lets the audience draw its own  conclusions.  </P> <P> The actors' workout here calls for immense physical and technical skills, in  addition to the imaginative powers required of the audience, and these actors  demonstrate Olympian prowess.  </P> <P> The two women in the main cast of five (two extras fill out peripheral parts)  play five roles each. Anni Long makes the most spectacular leaps between  characters. She plays Sissy Jupe, an independent-minded girl; whining Mrs.  Gradgrind (who wishes she never had a family -- then they would know what it's  like to do without her); a couple of weavers at the Coketown mill, and snippy  Mrs. Sparsit, who wants us to understand how low she has stooped in order to  become an industrialist's housekeeper.  </P> <P> Long's creation of Mrs. Sparsit is abetted by a pretentious headdress and a  mask with a fiercely pointed nose -- the handiwork of set and costume designer  Ariel. This and other masks help camouflage the actors as they switch roles and  also sum up characters in visual shorthand. And the use of a mask on Gradgrind  leads to an illuminating moment, late in the second act, when the mask comes  off to reveal the man under the cartoon.  </P> <P> Jarion Monroe plays Gradgrind as well as the seducer of Gradgrind's daughter --  perhaps the evening's most startling transformation. He fills out the role of  the seducer, which Jeffreys may have been trimmed a bit too much, so that we  understand this fellow fully. In the pivotal role of Gradgrind's daughter,  Devon Raymond creates some of the play's most tragic images -- yet also finds  the resources to play four smaller roles with finesse.  </P> <P> Robert Sicular astonishes with his brief bits as Bitzer, the hilarious young  model student with an exotic blond haircut, as much as with his more  substantial roles as bigwig Josiah Bounderby and as Gradgrind's foolish son  Tom. And Art Koustik, though stuck with two almost equally sympathetic  characters, carefully delineates the differences.  </P> <P> Ariel designed a floor and created a rear platform and backdrop, artfully lit  by Peter Maradudin, that suggest the economic and the pedagogical imperatives  of the era. Robert MacDougall's score and sound track constantly supports the  action and occasionally ascends to the surface of the show. Singing isn't the  cast's strong suit, but it's a problem only in the closing chorale; earlier,  the raw and sometimes faltering voices make their own point about these  people's lives.  </P> <P>  At 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m.,  Sundays at 7 p.m., weekends at 2 p.m., through April 16. Tickets: $20-$25;  (714) 957-4033.  </P> <P> </P></p>

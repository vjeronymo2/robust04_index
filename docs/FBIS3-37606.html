			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The main generating set of the Bilibino AES [nuclear  electric power station] in Magadan Oblast was stopped today, the  POSTFAKTUM agency reports. It was stopped at the initiative of  the strike committee and the management of the Bilibino AES  because it is owed a considerable amount of money for the  electricity supplied to consumers. The station itself owes  approximately 6 billion rubles to its employees and partners,  while consumers' debt to the AES amounts to 8 billion rubles.  If the strike continues, most of the biggest enterprises in  Yakutia and Magadan Oblast could come to a halt in the next  three days.</p>

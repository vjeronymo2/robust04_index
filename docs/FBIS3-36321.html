Reports  are being carried in the international mass media that there are  efforts to sign a similar accord with all the republics of the  former Soviet Union that have nuclear weapons, including  Kazakhstan. What is your opinion on these efforts?    [Zholdasbekov] We are responsible for safeguarding our  nuclear weapons. Until all countries in the world guarantee  that they will not use nuclear arms and the world is rid of such  weapons, we will not destroy them or transfer them elsewhere.  We are aware of the accord signed on the nuclear disarmament of  Ukraine. However, we believe that disarmament should be  accompanied by a world guarantee that such weapons will not be  used.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You have not announced this stance  openly and officially.    [Zholdasbekov] Our stance on this matter will be conveyed to  the U.S. President on 17 February when Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev goes to the United States.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Why do you wish to report this to the  U.S. President?    [Zholdasbekov] Our president is visiting the United States  at the official invitation of the U.S. President. Naturally,  the objective of his visit is not to provide any clarification  on nuclear weapons. However, it is natural that Mr. Clinton  will speak to Mr. Nazarbayev about Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons.  I mean that during these talks Mr. Nazarbayev will convey our  country's official stance to the U.S. President.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, it is clear that Russia  is constantly seeking to extend its domination over all the CIS  countries. Do you believe this?    [Zholdasbekov] It is not to our advantage to magnify such  points. In view of the extensive economic and industrial  relations that we have with the Russians, we do not consider it  appropriate to overshadow these relations with political issues.  We should keep in mind that we have the longest common border  with Russia and that we should be seeking logical and principled  ways to broaden these relations.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you have any political or economic  news about Kazakhstan for us?    [Zholdasbekov] Yes. In the economic field, I wish to tell  you that in the last few days of 1993 (that is one month ago) we  replaced the ruble with our own monetary unit, the tenge. In  the political field, I may add that soon parliamentary elections  will be held in Kazakhstan.    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How soon?    [Zholdasbekov] On 7 March.</p>

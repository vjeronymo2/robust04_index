			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STEINBERG IS ENDING THE JETS' ISOLATION  </P> <P> If you're planning to attend the Jets' home opener Sunday against the Browns,  it would be a good idea to buy a program. Otherwise, you might have trouble  determining the players. This isn't the same team that trudged off the field  last Dec. 23 after being blown out by the Bills, 37-0, in the season finale.  The 1990 Jets have 21 new players -- a 45 percent turnover from last season's  4-12 team.  </P> <P> As the large turnover attests, the Jets have been aggressive in acquiring  players by means other than the draft. This represents a new philosophy for the  Jets. As a result, their image around the NFL apparently has changed. After  years of being perceived as a team that operated in isolation, the Dick  Steinberg-led Jets have returned to the mainstream, according to executives  around the league.  </P> <P> "With Dick running the show, they're going to be an aggressive team," said  49ers vice president John McVay, echoing a common sentiment around the league.  "You know that because that's the way he operates." Said Chiefs General Manager  Carl Peterson: "Dick is plugged into the network, and you have to be to have an  idea where to find players."  </P> <P> Browns Coach Bud Carson, who spent four seasons as the Jets' defensive  coordinator, said: "As I look at their starting lineup, about half of them are  new faces. They've really got the franchise moving."  </P> <P> Which is a far cry from the old-regime Jets, who employed a four-man football  committee to call the shots, instead of a traditional general manager.  </P> <P> One NFL source, who didn't want to be identified, described the old  front-office situation, saying, "Obviously, they were out of it -- WAY out of  it. It was a weird situation. (Former president) Jim Kensil didn't do anything.  (Current president) Steve Gutman comes out of a business background, and he's  fine at what he does, but he's not a football man. So it comes down to (former  personnel director) Mike Hickey. The only problem with Mike is that he believed  he was smarter and better than everyone else, so he was tough to deal with."  </P> <P> When he was hired, Steinberg said the Jets projected a "mystique" in NFL  circles. That's a polite way of saying no one in the league had a clue about  what went on inside Weeb Ewbank Hall.  </P> <P> Apparently, that has changed. If anything, Steinberg is plugged into the  information network. During the off-season, he said he spent an average of five  hours a day on the telephone. Obviously, this has made it easier for other  clubs to deal with the Jets.  </P> <P> "From an efficiency standpoint, it's a lot easier to call one individual who  has control over all the areas you want to discuss, instead of calling three or  four different people," Peterson said.  </P> <P> Steinberg has been active, that's for sure. All the moves may not pay off, but  as Peterson said, "You can't make a football team better -- especially a  rebuilding team -- without making moves."  </P> <P> Of the 21 new players, seven are draft choices. That includes starting flanker  Rob Moore, who was selected in the July supplemental draft. The Jets forfeited  their 1991 first-round pick by selecting Moore, but so far it seems to be worth  it.  </P> <P> Besides the draft, the Jets acquired players from a number of sources,  including:  </P> <P>  -- Trades. In the Jets' first player-for-player trade since the Matt Robinson  trade in 1980 -- hard to believe, isn't it? -- the Jets sent rookie receiver  Reggie Rembert (unsigned at the time) to the Bengals in exchange for linebacker  Joe Kelly and tackle Scott Jones. Kelly immediately stepped into the starting  lineup, while Rembert and Jones are on injured reserve.  </P> <P> Steinberg also unloaded underachieving fullback Roger Vick, a former No. 1  pick, to the Eagles for an undisclosed pick. Two trades in a week. Amazing.  </P> <P>  -- Plan B. The Jets signed 12 ($720,000 in signing bonuses) and six made the  team, including two starters -- tackle Brett Miller and tight end Mark Boyer.  </P> <P>  -- Waivers. They added needed linebacker depth by claiming Dan Murray, John  Galvin and Troy Johnson. "We're a lot better at linebacker than we were at the  start of camp," Steinberg said. "If Alex Gordon wasn't hurt, we'd feel  comfortable at that position."  </P> <P> Despite the moves, there's still work to be done. "The first and second years  are frustrating," Peterson said. "You see the potential, and you want to get  there, but there's only so many steps you can take at once."  </P></p>

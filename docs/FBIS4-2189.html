			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 6 (XINHUA) -- South China's  Guangdong Province has taken measures to promote grain  production.    In recent years, the grain output in Guangdong has seen a  decline due to a decrease of crop-growing area. As a result,  the imbalance between grain supply and demand is worsening.    Guangdong Provincial People's Congress promulgated a set of  regulations on a minimum size for a protection zone of farmland,  which stipulated that the total area of the farmland protection  zone should be more than 2 million hectares.    The provincial government also set a target of increasing  the  area of the farmland protection zone to more than 2.5 million  hectares by the end of 1997.    It stressed that the crop growing area, including the double  cropping area, should be about 3.3 million hectares in the  province and the annual grain output should be maintained at  17.5 million tons.    Meanwhile, Guangdong Provincial Government and the  government  in some cities and counties will jointly invest in a grain  development program for constructing 50 commodity grain bases in  three years.    Jiangmen city has increased more than 20 percent of  investment in farming production and it has decided from this  year on to allocate 2 million yuan annually to aid farm  production.</p>

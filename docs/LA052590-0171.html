			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LUCE SAYS HE WILL RETIRE AS CHAIRMAN OF GREAT AMERICAN  </P> <P> Gordon Luce, chairman and chief executive of Great American Bank, said Thursday  he will retire this year, once the embattled S&amp;L finds a replacement.  </P> <P> In making the announcement at Great American's annual shareholders' meeting,  Luce acknowledged reports that have circulated for weeks that he plans to leave  the S&amp;L this year. Although the S&amp;L has no mandatory retirement age,  Luce will turn 65 in November. He has been Great American's chief executive  since 1969 and chairman since 1979.  </P> <P> An executive search committee is looking for a new chief executive, Luce told  shareholders. As reported earlier, Luce confirmed that Federal Home Loan Bank  of San Francisco President James Cirona has been offered the job. But Cirona  removed himself from consideration after he and the S&amp;L's board of  directors failed to agree to terms.  </P> <P> "The search is not yet concluded, but, when it has, there will be a prompt  announcement of my successor," Luce told shareholders. "It is time for change,  and perhaps a new perspective will assist the bank in moving forward in these  changing times."  </P> <P> In his 21 years at Great American, Luce built the thrift from an obscure  four-branch institution then known as San Diego Federal to the eighth largest  S&amp;L in the nation, currently with $15.4 billion in assets and 211 branches.  He introduced an array of marketing and customer service innovations and  established a branch network that became the envy of many California financial  institutions.  </P> <P> Luce also enjoyed high standing within the S&amp;L industry, partly by virtue  of his strong political ties to Ronald Reagan, who, as California governor,  named Luce state secretary of business and transportation. When Reagan was  President, he appointed Luce to a United Nations post.  </P> <P> But Luce's accomplishments at Great American have been overshadowed in recent  months by the financial problems that have brought the institution close to  insolvency. Most of the problems stem from Great American's 1986 acquisition of  Home Federal Savings of Tucson, from which Great American has reaped a harvest  of problem loans.  </P> <P> Those bad loans were a major cause of Great American's 1989 losses totaling  $263.4 million. As a result, Great American has been weakened to the point of  facing regulatory seizure unless it can find a merger partner or buyer, or  raise $350 million in outside capital by the end of the year. Great American  stock has dropped to Thursday's close of $2.25 from a high over the past 12  months of $14.875.  </P> <P> Citing the five shareholder lawsuits that have been filed against the S&amp;L  and its executives, Luce and other Great American executives declined to answer  many shareholder questions on the S&amp;L's finances. Much of Luce's prepared  speech was taken from previous regulatory filings.  </P> <P> Two dozen shareholders questioned Luce and other executives closely about the  plunge in Great American's stock price and looming threat of a government  takeover, but few were openly hostile.  </P> <P> "What's remarkable about the meeting is what didn't happen, that shareholders  didn't tear the arms and legs off management, given that the stock has been the  worst performer in San Diego over the past year," said Blaine Roberts,  president of La Jolla-based Morgan, Roberts &amp; Co., an investment firm with  a stake in Great American.  </P> <P> "It just goes to show the remarkable amount of good will on the part of the  community toward the company," Roberts said.  </P></p>

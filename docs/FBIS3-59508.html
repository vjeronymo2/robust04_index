			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "C.H.": "Second Chance in Microelectronics"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt -- The electronics industry is showing the  greatest growth of all branches of industry and by the end of  the decade will become the largest branch of industry in Europe  too. Europe has the largest trade deficit in this field. This  deficit will double by the end of the decade. But Europe also  has a "second chance" in microelectronics if European  manufacturers focus on independently supplying custom-designed  circuits (ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits]). Dr.  Max Syrbe, a professor and president of the Fraunhofer Society,  has now called attention to this in a 10-thesis paper.    Japan dominates the memory market and America the  processors.  Custom- designed circuits offer Europe opportunities for  independent developments, he says. The strategy of catching up  in technology in the field of memory devices has failed, Syrbe  believes. The basic mistake was copying the Japanese way,  because it was believed that the technology of very-large-scale  integration for memory chips would be the engine for constant  technological progress. However, it would be a mistake to  believe that the future can be ensured with international  cooperation in every area of demand.    Syrbe argues further that the danger of dependence is less  threatening from mass-produced devices than from  application-specific chips, in which a major part of the  functionality of new products lies. Because of this Europe's  strategy for the future must be the development of  microelectronic manufacturing geared to the needs of the small  and medium-sized user industry.    The factory designs are also different here. While memory  factories have to be designed for the best possible mastery of  standard mass products, short process times and great  flexibility prevail in ASIC factories. By means of flexible  manufacturing technology with a high degree of automation the  Europeans could offset the lead that Japan has in mass devices.  The level of integration and the packing density of chips are  not primarily decisive for the success of European products, but  the cost and properties of the overall system are.    Syrbe is asking that now a structure also be found that has  a  form of sharing the work and risk with science that is  advantageous for small and medium-sized companies, "as a  specifically European way for microelectronics." New CAD tools  for circuit design must constitute one footing, and new  manufacturing technologies by means of which small numbers of  items can also be manufactured economically, the other.  Minifactories could set themselves up as adequate partners for a  small and medium-sized user and manufacturer industry. The  "single-wafer factory" project of Texas Instruments in the USA  also demonstrates this.    He who brings his products more quickly onto the market has  the competitive advantage. The microchip alone is not decisive  here, but the product advance achieved by its means. Therefore  the tight knitting together of semiconductor manufacturers and  users is the prime necessity here.</p>

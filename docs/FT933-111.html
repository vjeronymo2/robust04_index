			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Penna shares fall 30p on warning SHARES IN Penna, the USM-quoted holding company for the Sanders &amp; Sidney outplacement consultancy, fell by 35p to 130p yesterday after the company warned of a modest pre-tax deficit for the six months to September 30 1993. Mr John Beard, chief executive, said revenues in the second quarter had continued at the reduced levels of the first three months. 'Cost reduction programmes are in hand to reduce fixed overheads to levels more appropriate to present levels. The board remains committed to its strategy of developing its outplacement services, and marketing programmes are being sustained. 'The balance sheet of the group remains strong and the business is cash positive.' Shares in Penna have moved erratically. It was the best-performing USM stock in 1990, but the shares collapsed from 325p to 83p in 1991, following a profits warning and then the departure of Mr Stephen Rowlinson, the highly paid chairman and chief executive. The shares recovered from that low point to reach 279p in March, but substantially declined after the company warned at its annual meeting that first-quarter trading was slow.</p>

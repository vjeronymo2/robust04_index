			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Israel to lift ban on PLO contacts THE ISRAELI government plans to move next week to revoke controversial legislation banning contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, although it will continue to oppose any direct PLO role in Middle East peace negotiations, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. The decision was announced yesterday by the Justice Ministry just before the arrival in Jerusalem of President Francois Mitterrand of France who has urged Israel to accept the involvement of the PLO in the peace process. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who held talks with Mr Mitterrand last night, has turned a blind eye to close contacts between the PLO leadership, based in Tunis, and the Palestinian delegates to the Washington peace negotiations who are all residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But he has refused to allow any deeper PLO involvement. The move may be aimed at improving the atmosphere at the next round of peace talks starting on December 7. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, told Reuters this week that the Palestinians were close to pulling out of the talks which he said had reached 'a dead end'.</p>

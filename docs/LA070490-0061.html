			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO CHARGE RESIDENTS FOR EXTRA TRASH  ADVANCES  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council panel, in a bid to encourage recycling, approved a  plan Tuesday to charge homeowners who generate large amounts of trash higher  fees for extra trash containers.  </P> <P> Under the proposal that was endorsed unanimously by the Budget and Finance  Committee, residents who participate in a new mandatory curbside recycling  program would be given two 60-gallon containers and a recycling bin free.  </P> <P> However, residents would be charged $5.35 per month for a 90-gallon container.  Those requiring a third container would be charged $8.60 a month for an extra  60-gallon container, or $12.60 for another 90-gallon can.  </P> <P> "The focus of this proposal is not to raise revenue, but to change our habits  by charging those of us who don't, after recycling, reduce our volume of  waste," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.  </P></p>

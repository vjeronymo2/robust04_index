			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Railtrack asset base must be written off Sir, How right Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, is to try to establish sensible financial objectives before he takes over ('Railtrack delays pricing after row with Treasury', November 30). Previous chairmen of BR have accepted, without proper consideration, an impossible financial remit and found themselves taking the blame for inevitable failure. It is absolute nonsense for the Treasury to argue for replacement cost as a basis for the valuation of railway track and other infrastructure assets. Britain's railways mainly carry subsidised passenger trains which do not even cover their direct operational costs. No asset value is ascribed to the road network with which the railways compete, neither is a rate of return set for roads. Many main lines are so dilapidated that they represent not an asset in Railtrack's books but a liability. Add to this the vast collection of Victorian architecture where, for example, the property income at a station like Paddington is entirely absorbed in the cost of repairing Brunel's roof. If government is really serious about attracting more freight and passengers to the railways, eventually privatising Railtrack and stimulating private sector interest in bidding to operate franchises or finance new rolling stock, there is a strong case for writing off the whole asset base of Railtrack. A Pounds 5bn asset base is far too high. A rate of return of 5 per cent might be sought on new commercial investment, where franchisees could afford to pay, but such a return will be unachievable for most at the expenditure on the social railway, and for the maintenance of listed buildings and environmental work. If government is squeamish about writing off debt, it needs only remind itself of other privatisations where this has been necessary. Japanese railways, far busier than ours, needed massive debt write-offs in the run-up to what appears to be a successful privatisation. It is a prerequisite of the market investing in franchises, or the building of new rolling stock for lease, that Railtrack is not dependent upon a vast annual subsidy, either direct or indirect. This is because such investors will always believe that the subsidy to Railtrack will be cut, leaving other railway associated business unviable. Bob Horton has the right target in his sights. If he doesn't win this battle with the Treasury, he would be better off going now. Bill Bradshaw, Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, Wolfson College, Linton Road, Oxford OX2 6UD</p>

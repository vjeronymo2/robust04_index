			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PERRIER RECALL CAUSES PROFIT TO PLUMMET 75% FOR 1989  </P> <P> Source Perrier SA said Friday that the costs associated with the recent recall  of its popular bottled sparkling water were assessed to last year's account,  resulting in a 75% plunge in earnings for 1989.  </P> <P> The company said net profit totaled $47 million for the year, compared to $185  million in 1988.  </P> <P> Perrier recalled its bottled water worldwide in February after tests showed  traces of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, in its product in several  countries. The contamination came from improper infiltration of carbon dioxide  gas added to the water, according to the company.  </P> <P> Perrier put the cost of the recall at $78 million.  </P> <P> The company said it put aside part of its 1989 profit to cover the recall  expense, which is permitted under French law.  </P> <P> Perrier said it had expected to cover most of the recall costs with  nonrecurring gains from the sale of assets, but these totaled only $45 million  for 1989.  </P> <P> In addition, Perrier's 1988 results were boosted by much more substantial  nonrecurring gains of $154 million, reflecting the sale of assets that included  television, confectionary and milk interests.  </P> <P> Perrier recently began resupplying its distributors with bottles marked  "Nouvelle (New) Production."  </P></p>

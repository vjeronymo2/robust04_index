			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / China 'losing patience' over WTO: FT correspondents report from the Apec meeting in Jakarta Mr Long Yong Tu, China's chief international trade negotiator, is running out of patience. He says he is reaching the limit of his ability to negotiate on his country's application for membership of the new World Trade Organisation. If the year-end deadline for completion of the talks was to be met, he says, leaders in Beijing and Washington would have to settle the political differences which he blamed for holding up progress. 'Our negotiations are coming to a critical stage,' he says. 'Now it is very important to get a political decision because, just like two guys who are having a quarrel, we need someone higher up to say, okay, you should work out this thing.' Mr Long complains bitterly about the US position, which he says is the biggest obstacle to Beijing's eight-year effort to rejoin the multilateral trading system. He says Washington has failed to spell out exactly what it wants from Beijing and repeatedly asks for more. 'They tell us what they want, and we say 'Okay, we accept'. Then they say that's not enough, we have to do something more. It is as if this WTO belongs to the US and they can veto any country, even as large as China.' Mr Long said: 'They are a little short-sighted. They are looking at the immediate commercial benefits. China's WTO membership should be a strategic long-term thing.' He says Ms Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, offered a package of 'important concessions' to Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, at a meeting yesterday in Jakarta where the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit opens today. Though Beijing hoped the offer would create a breakthrough in the negotiations, the US had failed to respond. According to Mr Long, the concessions included: Publishing details of all China's import quotas, covering what Beijing calls sensitive products such as chemical fertiliser. This meets a long-standing US demand and, Mr Long says, was the crux of Beijing's differences with the US. The extension of foreign banking rights to Beijing and 10 provincial cities, in addition to 13 coastal cities already proposed. Permission for foreign banks to transact business in local currency on an experimental basis after WTO entry. Mr Long concedes the offers do not fully meet US demands and hints at possible further concessions, though he says this would be difficult because it requires complex co-ordination by Chinese ministries. However, Beijing was not prepared to offer them after the end of this year - even if the US agreed to extend the negotiations, as it has recently says it may be ready to do. The two sides agreed yesterday to resume bilateral talks next month, after a US Congress vote on the Uruguay Round. But Mr Long says that if the talks drag on beyond January, Chinese political support for WTO membership will wane, and Beijing fears Washington will seek ever more concessions. 'The reason we want to set a time limit is that we don't want to be squeezed by them indefinitely. If they want to use Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) membership as a kind of leverage to hold us hostage, they are wrong. We are really at the end of our patience. We know China can do very well without Gatt.' Mr Long says it would be 'childish' of China to make success for its WTO application a condition of its support for proposal to set a firm date for trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. 'But in actual practice, I really do think there is a linkage,' he says. If Apec eventually opened its markets to the rest of the world on a reciprocal basis, China could lose the full benefits while it remained outside Gatt.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Gucci chairman admits to pledging shares MR Maurizio Gucci, chairman of the fashion house which carries his name, has admitted to pledging 10 per cent of his shares in the Gucci business to secure personal debts. The latest twist in the battle for control of the company, made in a court filing in New York, came days after Mr Gucci publicly denied having pledged shares. Investcorp, the Bahrain-based bank which holds 50 per cent of Gucci, is seeking to force Mr Gucci's dismissal and win control of his 50 per cent through the New York courts. The bank alleges Mr Gucci has violated a shareholder agreement by pledging his shares. Mr Gucci denies this interpretation of the agreement. In a New York court yesterday, a judge ruled that Mr Gucci's shares, which have been subject to a restraining order since July 22, should be frozen for a further week. The court is expected to decide on Friday whether the stake should restrained pending the outcome of arbitration launched by Investcorp last month. Mr Gucci has consistently denied pledging any of his shares to third parties. A Gucci spokesman suggested the apparent contradiction might be due to a technicality. He suggested that Mr Gucci had denied pledging 'Gucci' shares, rather than commenting on shares in Seaton Hills, the offshore holding company which owns Mr Gucci's stake. Last night, Gucci officials were also trying to ascertain from lawyers whether pledging 10 per cent would be enough to infringe the pact with Investcorp. Yesterday's admission follows an earlier setback for Mr Gucci. On Saturday, a Milan judge rejected his attempt to sequester Investcorp assets in Italy. The decision was based on the fact that the court could not consider an action by Mr Gucci regarding Guccio Gucci, the group's Italian parent company, as he is not a direct shareholder.</p>

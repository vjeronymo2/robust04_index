			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE RESIGNS;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV SAYS HE'S 'STUNNED'  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned without warning today, telling  Parliament that a reactionary resurgence threatened the Soviet Union with  dictatorship. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was stunned by the  resignation of his longtime ally.  </P> <P> "Dictatorship is coming," Shevardnadze told the Parliament, his voice choked  with emotion. "No one knows what kind of dictatorship it will be, what kind of  dictator will come, and what order things will take.  </P> <P> "If you make a dictatorship, no one can say who will become the dictator."  </P> <P> Hard-liners have been pushing Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency in  troubled areas of the country, and he is asking the Congress of People's  Deputies legislature to amend the constitution to further strengthen his power.  </P> <P> Gorbachev took the podium hours later and said that before the resignation he  had planned to make Shevardnadze his vice president, under a government  reorganization that would put more power under presidential control. He did not  say whether he is still considering Shevardnadze for the job.  </P> <P> Speaking slowly and calmly, Gorbachev said: "I don't want either to simplify  the situation or over-dramatize it. The main thing is not to fall into panic  or, even worse, hysteria."  </P> <P> "I personally condemn" Shevardnadze for abandoning the perestroika reform  program during a difficult time, the Soviet president said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said he knew nothing about any attempt to establish a dictatorship  but told deputies that such a condition could arise if the country continues to  sink into disorder.  </P> <P> Immediately after Gorbachev spoke, parliamentarians voted 1,540 to 52, with 11  abstentions, to ask Shevardnadze to stay in the job. But Foreign Ministry  spokesman Vitaly Churkin said the resignation was "irreversible."  </P> <P> There was immediate speculation that Deputy Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,  an Arab specialist who has been Gorbachev's personal envoy to the Persian Gulf,  is a possible successor.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, waving his finger at lawmakers, blamed what he called reactionary  forces for pushing the president to take dictatorial steps but he also implied  that Gorbachev is acceding to their demands.  </P> <P> The white-haired Georgian and second most visible figure in Soviet politics  decried the influence of hard-line lawmakers "with colonels' shoulder-stripes"  in the Congress, the country's highest legislative body.  </P> <P> "I express my great gratitude to Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev," he said. "I am  his friend. I think as he does, I have always supported and will until my last  day support the ideas of perestroika, the idea of renewal, the ideas of  democratization."  </P> <P> "But I think that resignation is my duty as a person, a citizen, a Communist,"  he said, declaring that "the future belongs to democracy and freedom."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, 62, was named foreign minister four months after Gorbachev became  Communist Party chief in March, 1985. He helped steer Soviet foreign policy  away from confrontation and conquest in favor of appeasement and coexistence.  </P></p>

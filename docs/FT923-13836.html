			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chip price war dents AMD income growth ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semi-conductor manufacturer, yesterday reported second-quarter net income more than doubled from a year ago. But the figure was 50 per cent lower than in the first quarter due to a computer chip price war with arch-rival Intel. The company warned at the start of this month that sales revenue was likely to drop 15 per cent compared with that of the first quarter because of severe price pressures on 386 microprocessors. Yesterday it reported net income of Dollars 41.45m, or 43 cents a share after preferred dividends, compared with Dollars 17.27m, or 17 cents a share, in the same period of last year, and Dollars 84.90m, or 90 cents a share, in the first three months of this year. Revenues totalled Dollars 350m, up 18 per cent from the Dollars 296m of last year, but down 14 per cent from the first quarter's Dollars 407.4m. Mr WJ Sanders, chairman, said 'the quarter to quarter decrease in revenues was attributable to severe price pressures in 386 microprocessors and a decline in unit volumes. 'There was an abundance of supply, coupled with fierce price-cutting by our major competitor.' He added that personal computer manufacturers were confident that supplies of 386 products would remain plentiful and had dramatically reduced their inventories. AMD's other product lines had shown 'strong growth' in the quarter. For the six months the company reported net income of Dollars 126.35m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, compared with Dollars 21m, or 19 cents a share, in 1991. Sales rose by 33 per cent to Dollars 757.6m.</p>

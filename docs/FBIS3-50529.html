There was also a unique meeting between U.S.  President Bill Clinton and five of Caricom's 13 heads of  goverment that irritated some Community leaders who subsequently  failed to meet separately with Vice President Al Gore.    In Jamaica, which accounts for more than a third of the  13-member Community's ethnically and culturally diverse  population, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson led his incumbent  People's National Party (PNP) back to power with a massive  electoral victory. The March 30 election that coincided with  Patterson's first anniversary as successor to the retired  Michael Manley as leader of the PNP and government, gave the PNP  52 of the 60 parliamentary seats. But the win was dampened by an  electoral turnout of approximately 58 percent, one of the lowest  in Jamaica's electoral history, and sustained charges of  electoral malpractices, including stuffing of ballot boxes on  voting day. The election results forced the opposition Jamaica  Labour Party's leader, ex-prime minister Edward Seaga, to  publicly indicate that the "rebuilding process" of the party  could include determining his own future with the JLP.    Three months later, on June 30, the veteran politician of  Belize, George Price, took a gamble with a snap poll that saw  his People's United Party (Pup) losing power. The PUP lost by  three seats to Manuel Esquivel's United Democratic Party (UDP).  The UDP's 16-13 victory, which surprised some political  analysts, was its second in three contested elections.    Four months after the poll, Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds  of St. Kitts and Nevis also chose to call an early election on  November 29, only to be faced with a crisis that by year-end was  posing a threat to the longevity of his one-seat majority  coalition government. Simmonds' People's Action Movement (PAM)  gained four of the eight seats in St. Kitts -- the same number  as the opposition St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party -- with the three  seats in sister territory, Nevis, being shared by the Concerned  Citizens Movement (CCM) of Premier Vance Amory (two) and the  Nevis Reformation Party, PAM's traditional coalition partner  (one). The swearing in of a minority coalition government of PAM  and NRP with Simmonds back as prime minister, sparked violent  demonstrations, forcing declaration of a state of emergency, a  dusk-to-dawn curfew and an appeal by Simmonds for assistance  from the Regional Security System (RSS). Both the curfew and  state of emergency were lifted within two weeks, but the  bitterness between labour and the coalition remained.    The St. Kitts Christian Council and the Evangelical  Association failed in bids to broker a peace that would have  resulted in fresh elections within six months, which labour  party leader Denzil Douglas said was "the logical and decent  thing to do." Douglas, pointing out that his party commanded 54  percent of the votes cast to PAM's 42 percent, warned that a  "new election is now inevitable since we have no intentions of  being governed by two parties in a coalition overwhelmingly  rejected by the electorate." In a no-confidence motion in the  new parliament, the CCM's two votes would be crucial to bringing  down the PAM-NRP coalition.    The year 1993 also saw changes in the leadership of the  governing Dominica Freedom Party (Brian Alleyne for the retiring  prime minister Eugenia Charles) and the ruling Antigua Labour  Party (Lester Bird for his octogenarian father, Prime Minister  Vere Bird, Sr).    There were also numerous technical and ministerial meetings  to advance the deepening and widening of the region's  20-year-old economic integration movement, Caricom. At the 14th  Caricom summit in The Bahamas in July, heads of government  decided to have in place "appropriate measures" so that the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), subsequently  approved, would not adversely affect the Community's trade and  agricultural policies. The region's dissatisfaction over  benefits from the current Lome IV convention with the European  Community and its concerns over access to the North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) without "undue disadvantages" from  concessions already granted to founding members like Mexico,  were also on the agenda of that summit. After the meeting, on  August 30, the president of Guyana and the prime ministers of  Jamaica, Barbados, The Bahamas, and Trinidad and Tobago were  invited to a unique working luncheon meeting at the White House  with President Clinton.    While U.S./Cuba relations remained a cause for concern, for  the five Caricom leaders, the Community's access to NAFTA on  favourable terms was the major agenda item. They left Washington  with a promise from the President that his administration would  study the likely negative impact of NAFTA on the region's  economies to determine how best it could respond to Caricom's  areas of concern. The leaders of the Organisation of Eastern  Caribbean States (OECS) were not happy over the choice by the  Clinton Administration for the August 30 working lunch and, with  the exception of Prime Minister Charles of Dominica, failed to  show up for a planned October meeting with Gore.    Prime Minister James Mitchell of St. Vincent and the  Grenadines reflected his own disagreement when he said that  while the President of the USA was free to invite whoever he  wished, "I do not recognise two sets of Caricom heads of  government." During October, Caricom heads of governments were  meeting again for a special session in Trinidad and Tobago, this  time with the leaders of the so-called "Group of Three" in Latin  America -- the presidents of Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia --  as well as the vice president of Suriname. Delegates said the  meeting was "a positive development in the process of increasing  political consensus which is developing in Latin America and the  Caribbean...." They pledged to find mutually acceptable  solutions to common problems.    Their interest in encouraging deeper involvement of the  private sector in new development thrusts in the post-Cold War  phase of rising mega-economic blocs, was later reaffirmed when  the sixth Europe-Caribbean conference, organised by the  Caribbean Council for Europe took place in Santo Domingo, the  Dominican Republic November 10-12. One of the significant  developments flowing from that conference was the inauguration  on November 28 in Santo Domingo of a federation of European  chambers of commerce.    Except for the Port-of-Spain meeting of Caricom and Central  American leaders, Cuba was involved in all of the major meetings  and events organised by the Community's governments during the  year. Having rejected "misrepresentations" and "unnecessary  fears" emanating from a group of United States congressmen over  a proposed Caricom-Cuba joint commission, the Community's  governments went ahead and formally launched the commission on  December 13 in Guyana, where the inaugural meeting reviewed the  wide range of areas for technical, economic, and cultural  cooperation. Earlier, Caricom countries had, for the first time,  given overwhelming support to an approved resolution at the  United Nations General Assembly in October for an end to the  31-year-old U.S. trade, economic, and financial embargo against  Cuba. The Cuban foreign minister, Roberto Robaina Gonzalez, who  subsequently made a seven-nation tour of Caricom member states,  estimated that the U.S. embargo had already cost his country 40  billion U.S. dollars. Robaina said he would visit the remaining  six other Caricom countries early in 1994 to "strengthen our  relations with the Caribbean which we regard as a natural ally."    The Caribbean Conference of Churches and the Caribbean  Policy  Development Centre (CPDC) of non-government organisations were  active in their advocacy for the lifting of the U.S. embargo  against Cuba. They were also very vocal, along with Caribbean  Rights, in urging Caricom governments to keep alive demands for  the international community to help restore constitutional  government in Haiti under exiled president Jean-Bertrand  Aristide. Toward year-end, however, such a development seemed  even more remote than prior to the United Nations brokered peace  pact in July at Governor's Island in the USA that called for  Army strongman, Raoul Cedras, to step down from power and for  Aristide to return by October 30 as head of government.    It was also a year that saw government and tourism officials  worrying about crime. (Tourism for the estimated 30 member  countries of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation in all four  major language areas of the region, accounted accounted for 9.8  billion U.S. dollars in revenue for 1993, or approximtely 100  million U.S. dollars more than in 1992.) Crimes of violence,  rape and murder, particularly in evidence in countries like  Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, and St. Lucia,  included among its victims in 1993 the prison superintendent of  Trinidad and Tobago, Michael Hercules. Gunned down while on a  charity mission, Hercules, hailed as one of the region's strong  advocates of penal reform, was given a state funeral and praised  by all sections of the society. The year saw a widening between  the country's police service and the government, in particular  its minister of national security, Russell Huggins, whose  disagreements with both the Police Service Commission and the  police commissioner, Jules Bernard, were no secret.    The minister's own initiatives on structural changes and  "cleansing" of the police service were related to the findings  of a Scotland Yard investigative team that had found "endemic  corruption" in the country's police service. But he failed to  get the early retirement of Commissioner Bernard.    In Jamaica where the incidence of violent crimes and charges  of police corruption were also making the news, Prime Minister  Patterson, was supported by opposition leader Seaga in the  unprecedented appointment as police chief of the retired Army  colonel, Trevor Macmillan.    The year also saw an historic ruling by Britain's judicial  committee of the privy council in November, commuting to life  imprisonment the death sentences of Jamaican prisoners Earl  Pratt and Ivan Morgan. The ruling led to intense, and at time  angry debates between opponents and proponents of the death  penalty. One prompt and dramatic development resulting from the  privy council's ruling against the execution of those on death  row beyond five years, was the decision by some Caricom  governments to commute to life imprisonment the sentence of more  than fifty prisoners awaiting execution for murder.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`hjh' report: "De Maiziere Criticizes Union"] </F>   [Excerpt] Potsdam -- Lothar de Maiziere (CDU)  [Christian-Democratic Union], the final GDR prime minister, is  once again interfering in politics. With Peter-Michael  Diestel, the final GDR interior minister, he attended the  foundation of a CDU branch in Frankfurt/Oder, where he  criticized the policies of the Brandenburg CDU and CSU  [Christian Socialist Union]. "We must perform opposition work  again," said De Maziere, who resigned from the post of  Brandenburg CDU chairman because of his controversial Stasi  contacts. The CDU cannot involve itself in "Stolpe's personnel  problems" forever, said the former prime minister, who called  for tolerance in evaluating the past.    The Brandenburg CDU/CSU leadership did not wish to  exaggerate  the significance of the appearance by the two CDU politicians.  At the sidelines of the CDU Brandenburg party congress in  Strausberg, it was said that there were no objections to the  political involvement of De Maiziere and Diestel. Diestel and  the CDU Brandenburg leadership had a disagreement in 1992 in  connection with the accusations of Stasi involvement leveled  against Minister President Manfred Stolpe [Social Democratic  Party of Germany].

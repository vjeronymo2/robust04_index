			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Electronic road pricing system for Singapore Singapore, which heavily taxes cars and restricts their entry into the business district during peak hours, is launching the world's first electronic road pricing system in a new attempt to reduce road congestion, public works department officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Singapore. 'The system will permit a more flexible pricing structure and a more effective way to control traffic,' said executive engineer Mr Lew Yii Der. Under the system, now being tested in some areas in Singapore, selected entry points will send a signal to an electronic card fixed to a vehicle when it passes a marker to enter a restricted area. The card will 'store' a certain amount of money and each time a vehicle passes an entry point a fare will be automatically deducted. If the stored-value card is absent or does not contain enough money, the system will trigger cameras to photograph the rear number plate of the vehicle as it passes. Motorists driving to Singapore's busy shopping and business districts in peak hours must now buy a permit or face a ticket from the island's efficient traffic police. Authorities fear tiny Singapore, just 42 km (26 miles) long and 23 km (14 miles) wide, will soon be clogged by a growing number of vehicles. Rising affluence is prompting more Singaporeans to buy cars, despite eye-popping price tags inflated by a stiff premium for new cars, decided during government auctions - a new 1.6-litre Honda Civic, for example, costs around SDollars 122,000 (Dollars 78,710). Three groups of international telecom and electronic companies have been shortlisted from 10 who originally bid for the project, officials said. Teledata (Singapore) and Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone International submitted the lowest bid of SDollars 193.4m (Dollars 125m). The second consortium, with a SDollars 231m (Dollars 149m), bid for comprises Singapore Electronic &amp; Engineering, General Electric Company (S), Britain's GEC Traffic Automation and Italy's Marconi. The third group with a bid of Dollars 268.9m (Dollars 173.48m) comprises Philips Singapore and Miyoshi Electric of Japan.</p>

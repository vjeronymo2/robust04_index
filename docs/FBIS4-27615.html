			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from King Norodom Sihanouk to his subjects; date </F> not given -- recorded]    [Text] My respects to both supreme patriarchs, to Samdech  Preah Pouthiveang, Samdech Preah Khousananda, and Samdech Preah  Mongkol Teppeacha [superior monks], and to the rest of the  Buddhist clergy; my respects to all my beloved compatriots, old  and young alike. I would like to inform you that the  inter-Cambodian conference known as the roundtable in Pyongyang,  the DPRK -- Cambodia's great friend -- has ended and has  produced the following results:    1. His Excellency [H.E.] Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun  Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, and myself -- the five of us  responsible for solving problems for Cambodia -- agreed to  always be true and always be loyal to the principle that we will  do our best to create conditions for securing peace and security  for our Cambodian people, nation, and motherland. Our people  have suffered for more than 20 years now. They are in urgent  need of a cease- fire, of peace. Therefore, we must do our best  to restore peace and fully realize national reconciliation.  Furthermore, we will always be loyal to the sacred principle  that the country must be free from partition or secession; it  must not be divided into three, four, or more parts. We must  preserve the territorial unity and territorial integrity of  Cambodia forever. We must preserve the land and maritime  borders of an independent, neutral, and nonaligned Cambodia  which existed from 1963 to 1969 and which were solemnly  recognized by the international community.    Therefore, we must defend these borders, this 1963-69  territorial integrity and must do all we can so that all  countries in the world respect these land and maritime borders.  In order to do that we must achieve national unity, we must  regard one another as members of the same family and avoid  polarization. For this reason, the Pyongyang roundtable  unanimously agreed that although Cambodia's overall problems,  such as the problem of war, are not yet settled to a  satisfactory extent, we must carry on the talks between the  Royal Government of Cambodia and the party of Democratic  Kampuchea. Consequently, the Pyongyang roundtable decided that  in June 1994 another roundtable will be held at Damnak Chan in  the Phnom Penh Royal Palace. This roundtable will be a meeting  of representatives of H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun  Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, and Norodom Sihanouk. The five representatives will  come to the Royal Palace on 15 June, continue the work left over  from Pyongyang, and see to it that there will be progress in the  search for a solution to all problems, such as the problem of  war.    I would like to inform all of you, venerable monks and  beloved compatriots, that I Norodom Sihanouk am affected with  cancer of the bone marrow, an illness for which I did not  receive any treatment during the two months that I was having  the honor to serve my people, my country between our traditional  new year and the day I left home in May. During this time that  I was serving the people, the nation, and the motherland, I was  very tired every day and I did not receive any thorough medical  examination from my Chinese doctor to see whether the cancer had  recurred. The Chinese doctor was worried that my overwork and  lack of proper medical treatment -- as the one I received in  Beijing -- would cause a relapse. The Cambodian and French  doctors in Phnom Penh took three samples of my blood for  examination. The results of my blood test were not good. It  showed that I still had this cancer and a few other afflictions  in my system. Therefore, I needed to return promptly to the  Chinese hospital in Beijing.    However, because we also needed to hold the roundtable to  bring peace for our people and end their sufferings, I made the  ultimate sacrifice. As a result, my future was not bright and I  might become very sick and might even die. Although I was  experiencing a health problem, I agreed to make the sacrifice  and I did not recoil from personal discomfort when I had to work  relentlessly in the past few days. Why did I agree to all of  that? It was so that our nation can live in peace, ridding  itself of sufferings and fear caused by war.    It is most regrettable to me that the delegation of  Democratic Kampuchea or Khmer Rouge headed by H.E. Khieu  Samphan to the roundtable did not agree with the Royal  Government and the National Assembly.    Our Royal Government represented by HRH Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Samdech Hun Sen and our National  Assembly represented by H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, as the chairman,  fully accepted the king's proposal, that is, an immediate  cease-fire or, failing that, a permanent cease-fire as of 15  June when the war, the fighting must end without any conditions.  They also agreed to study with the Khmer Rouge ways to include  them into our Royal Government. They agreed to see whether our  Royal Government can accept the Khmer Rouge leaders as  ministers, deputy ministers, or secretaries of state. A number  of Khmer Rouge leaders are thus to be included into the Royal  Government and the Khmer Rouge army known as the National Army  of Democratic Kampuchea is to be integrated into the Khmer Royal  Armed Forces.    In this undertaking, I hoped that Pyongyang with its  excellent atmosphere and calm would be a perfect venue for us to  hold the discussion. I hoped that we would have sufficient time  to solve the problems to stop the war, end the Khmer Rouge  secession, and include some Khmer Rouge leaders, such as H.E.  Khieu Samphan and H.E. Chan Youran, into the Royal Government.    However, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea leaders did not  agree with the proposal of the King of Cambodia Norodom  Sihanouk. They proposed a method of supervision that is  different from what Norodom Sihanouk had suggested. They wanted  to invite five foreign countries. They asked the royal  government to pick five countries from the 10 they had selected  to come and oversee the cease-fire. However, the cease-fire  cannot be implemented if the problem of a new government,  meaning the formation of a new Cambodian Government whose power  is jointly shared by them, has not been resolved. If the  problem is not completely solved according to their desire, they  will not stop fighting. Therefore, the talks will run aground  because of the Khmer Rouge's demand for foreigners to monitor  the cease-fire.    Somehow, when foreigners came during the time of UNTAC [UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia], the Khmer Rouge did not  allow them do any overseeing. They also endangered UNTAC and  even caused the death of some UNTAC members. Now, they have  changed their words, saying 10 UN members -- they did not talk  about the United Nations, but 10 countries which are all full  members of the United Nations -- should be invited and that five  of them should come. However, it would take a long time for them  to answer yes or no if we were to ask them. It might take  months or even a year to solve the problem of cease-fire  supervision. Our people will continue to suffer endlessly.  Even if these countries say they will come, I still do not  believe they would. I am sure they will not come. They said  they had bitter experiences while they were under UNTAC in  Cambodia. UNTAC told them the experiences with Khmer Rouge were  most bitter. At that time, the Khmer Rouge did not respect  UNTAC, but now they said they need foreigners to come and  oversee Cambodians. The Khmer Rouge can never be trusted. That  is what these countries said.    I wish to clarify that when the five countries are allowed  to  come and oversee us, it does not mean that the Khmer Rouge will  agree to stop the war. They will continue to fight; they will  agree to stop only if the existing government dissolves itself,  contrary to the Constitution. They will do whatever they can to  bring to existence a new government through which they can exert  control in the areas of state affairs, the state, the country,  and the nation with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and H.E. Chea Sim and H.E.  Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party. At least, power should  be given to them equally, though they did not take part in the  elections. H.E. Samdech Hun Sen has disagreed with that. He  said that is against the Constitution and that the sacrifices of  the voters will be futile and meaningless. Therefore, he  remained in disagreement at the roundtable meeting in Pyongyang.  That how the talks turned out.    I am no longer able to solve this problem. So, I have asked  H.E. Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong, who is now over 86 years  old and trusted by various parties, to go to Phnom Penh. He is  staying with me now in Pyongyang and will travel to Phnom Penh  to represent the king as the chairman of the roundtable meeting  to be held in the Royal Palace on 15 June 1994. This is what I  would like to tell the clergy.    Anyway, we hope that there would be some good results on  15-16 June. But, is our optimism reasonable? From what I know  about the Khmer Rouge, I have little hope. Nonetheless, the  Triple Jewel will not forsake us, the supreme patriarchs and  clergy will not abandon us. Their teaching about compassion,  nonviolence, and national reconciliation will one day help  Cambodia, allowing it to regain peace, security, full  independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity within its  borders recognized during the Sangkum Reas Niyum era prior to  the coup d'etat staged by Lon Nol and Sirimatak. Therefore, I  wish to call on the clergy to further support the talks so as to  allow our people, who have suffered in the extreme, to again  live in peace. We will join hands to rebuild our nation and  motherland toward glory.    As revered Marshall Kim Il-song, president of the DPRK, said  yesterday: After you leave here, Cambodian brothers, please  compromise before it is too late to reestablish peace for the  people, nation, and motherland. Peace should be taken as  national reconciliation and reunification, the basis for  rebuilding the Cambodian nation and motherland toward prosperity  and glory. This will allow Cambodia to catch up with other  countries that are developing, while it is regressing due to  division and war. Therefore, division and war should be put to  an end. You should achieve peace and national reconciliation  and reunite around your king to rebuild the nation, and permit  it to catch up with other developed countries in this modern  world. This is most valuable advice. Therefore, the PDK  leaders -- including H.E. Khieu Samphan and his delegation --  who heard this statement with their own ears at Marshal Kim  Il-song's palace yesterday, please heed this advice in a timely  fashion. Please help our nation so that it can survive like  other countries, and prevent it from vanishing in the future.    This is the end of my impromptu message. When the royal  government delegation bade farewell to me before returning to  Phnom Penh, I hurriedly recorded this message for the  information of all of you. Thank you very much.    I pray that the Triple Jewel, previous Cambodian kings, and  goddesses will protect all of you. May you enjoy longevity,  social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. And  may our Cambodia and respected and beloved people recover peace  in the near future. Thank you very much.</p>

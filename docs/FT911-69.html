			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Post Office staff vote for strike COUNTER and clerical staff employed by the Post Office have voted to strike over a 6.8 per cent pay offer. The Union of Communication Workers, the main Post Office union, last night called for the urgent resumption of talks in an attempt to have the offer increased. The ballot result was announced yesterday at the UCW's conference in Blackpool. Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary, agreed last night that the result was some way from the overwhelming majority that union negotiators had sought. In a 67 per cent turnout for the ballot, 4,613 UCW members voted for industrial action, while 3,732 voted against. A total of 14,500 counter and clerical staff are employed by the Post Office Counters business, which is separate from mail sorting and delivery service. Mr Tuffin said that he would have liked more members to have taken part in the ballot. However, the result, which had come from what was traditionally a non-militant section of the union, indicated the strength of feeling among the membership. A number of options for action remained open, said Mr Tuffin. Workers in cities such as London, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester were likely to have voted most heavily for a strike, and it was possible there could be selective action. He added that Post Office Counters management had been asked to travel to Blackpool, where the union's conference continues for the rest of the week, so that talks could re-open without delay. Post Office Counters said last night that it was clear the union's executive did not have an overwhelming mandate for strike action and it hoped that the pay offer would now be quickly agreed.</p>

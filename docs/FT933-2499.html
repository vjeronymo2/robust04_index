			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Short shrift for another chequered British loser: Why it looks like the chess hype may have to stop AS British challenger Nigel Short enters the sixth round of the World Chess Championship today, he will not be alone in hoping for a win. With Short so far having failed to win a single game in the series against the defending champion Garry Kasparov, fears are growing about the fortunes of Short and the much-hyped tournament. One sure sign of concern is that William Hill, official match bookmakers, has withdrawn bets on an overall Kasparov win - while still offering 3-1 on Short failing to win a match, and 12-1 on a Short victory. 'We are desperate for Nigel Short to win a game, otherwise this is going to be a dead duck,' said William Hill. 'If Nigel loses a couple more games, the papers are just going to start to forget about it. The hype will just die.' Teleworld, the telecommunications company and joint sponsor of the match, this week withdrew its 'predict-a-move' telephone chess line, which allowed viewers in Europe to second guess the moves and phone in at a premium rate of between 36 pence and 48 pence a minute. Teleworld says that it needed 2,000 players placing several calls a match to make it worthwhile. The maximum at any match was 500 calls. Mr Wytze de Back, vice chairman of Teleworld corporate communications, said: 'We are very disappointed. But there just wasn't enough interest, and so this was the only wise decision.' The Times newspaper, which provided the bulk of the Pounds 1.7m prize money and tried to whip up chess fever with heavy pre-match advertising, is still faithful - devoting almost a page a day to the match. Most UK newspapers have quietly relegated it to a brief mention. Channel Four, which bought exclusive television rights, reportedly for Pounds 250,000, and plans 60 hours of coverage, insists that viewing figures are better than expected. And though the match hall at the Savoy Theatre has appeared half-empty during matches, the organisers insist that at least two-thirds of the 1,000 tickets for each game have been sold for the matches so far. Ms Mary Fultan, speaking for the promotors, said: 'The reason you see empty seats is because people come and go. Lots of people have gone off to the bar, because there is coverage there as well.' But with 18 games to go, and tickets already selling for about half their initial prices of between Pounds 45 and Pounds 150, the sponsors will be hard-pressed to recoup much of their investment. The company hopes that the computer network it established can be used for other projects, and suggests that the main reason for predict-a-move's failure was the conservative nature of the chess world. 'We advertised in all the chess magazines, but perhaps the product is a bit new,' said Mr de Back. He also acknowledges the sheer complexity of chess - and the problem of maintaining a British interest when once again, a Briton looks like being a loser. A short wait, Weekend FT, Page IX</p>

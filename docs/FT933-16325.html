			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Nadir took up to Pounds 565m from PPI: Little of the money seems likely to be recovered MR Asil Nadir misappropriated what could be as much as Pounds 565m from banks, bondholders and shareholders in the last few years of his chairmanship of Polly Peck International to fund a wide range of his personal and business interests. As the battle over the conduct of the case against Mr Nadir continues to rage, a Financial Times investigation has identified how the fugitive businessman removed Pounds 371m from the group in the three years leading up to the Serious Fraud Office raids in 1990. At least another Pounds 194m or more remains unaccounted for and could possibly also have been misappropriated. Mr Nadir jumped bail and fled to northern Cyprus in May. The analysis, based on writs, creditors' reports, company documents and interviews with employees and investigators, shows for the first time the complex movements of funds out of the Nadir business empire into his private activities. Most of the money which was misdirected for Mr Nadir's own purposes came from more than Pounds 1bn raised for PPI in loans, rights issues and bond issues in the UK, Switzerland and other financial centres before his company went into administration in October 1990. Mr Nadir - with the alleged help of a small group of associates in London and northern Cyprus - then switched the money in and out of a number of the group's bank accounts in several countries before using it to: Buy about Pounds 100m of PPI shares through a series of Swiss and Jersey trusts, most of which were not disclosed. Prop up loss-making businesses, principally in Turkey and Cyprus Buy hotels in Cyprus, help purchase two stately homes in England and furnish his properties with valuable antiques. Create a printing and publishing empire in Turkey and Cyprus. All but Pounds 30m of the Pounds 371m has been traced but most appears to have been frittered away. Realisations so far total just over Pounds 1m. Little more is likely to be recovered. The money-go-round began in a series of Polly Peck bank accounts in London, loans to the company and letters of credit. The funds were recorded as transactions in 'inter-company accounts' or loans from the parent PPI group. Between September 1987 and October 1990, Pounds 245m was channelled into northern Cyprus subsidiaries, mostly to Unipac, a packaging company. Another Pounds 126m was booked to Turkish subsidiaries including Meyna, the fruit business. The money passed through several different bank accounts in the names of these subsidiaries, including NatWest in Jersey, a correspondent account with Midland bank in London on behalf of the Industrial Bank of Cyprus, and Impexbank in Turkey. A process of what experts call 'cloaking' then took place, with money switched between accounts, apparently to confuse the trail. Most funds were transferred into the Industrial Bank of Cyprus and Impexbank, both of which were controlled by Mr Nadir during that period. Only at this point was the money - which was still shown in the accounts as borrowings to PPI subsidiaries - misappropriated into activities outside the group such as purchasing PPI shares, propping up loss-making businesses, and purchasing property and antiques. These were never declared in the accounts. It was also during 1987-90 that Mr Nadir made donations to the Conservative party of at least half the Pounds 440,000 the Tories admit getting from the businessman. Substantial contributions also went to charity. A Citibank account in Switzerland in the name of his mother, Mrs Safiye Nadir, emerges as a key conduit for the money. Some was passed on to Corvo, the Jersey trust which funded South Audley Management, the London company which managed some of Mr Nadir's personal interests. Some PPI money to buy shares in the company was channelled through Restro, the Jersey trust. Other money for share purchases went through secret trusts including Riverbridge in Switzerland. About Pounds 85m went to fund Mr Nadir's printing empire in Turkey, including a number of loss-making newspapers he purchased in Turkey such as Gunaydin. He also supported Noble Air, the company, now in liquidation, controlled by his sister. Some Pounds 46m was transferred to the Central Bank of Northern Cyprus. But the bank has refused to co-operate and won on appeal a legal battle that the English courts were not the appropriate jurisdiction in which it could be pursued. Further money was transferred to about 20 offshore bank accounts in the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and elsewhere. So far only a few millions have been traced. Some realisations will come from sales of the remaining operating businesses, and the administrators also plan to sue Stoy Hayward, PPI's auditor, in the next few months. But creditors are likely to receive only 1p-2p in the pound.

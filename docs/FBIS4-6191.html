			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea  reiterated Monday that two alleged nuclear facilities at  Yongbyon are military sites and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) has no right to inspect them.    "About the two military sites, there was no inspection  allowed. It's not within the authority of the IAEA to inspect  military sites," said Maj. Gen. Kim Yong-chol of the North  Korean People's Army in an interview with America's Cable News  Network (CNN).    In a dispatch from Pyongyang, CNN identified Gen. Kim simply  as a senior military official. The taped interview was aired in  the United States Monday night.    CNN also broadcast an interview with a former Costa Rican  president who was visiting Pyongyang, presumably for North  Korean President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday last Friday.    Gen. Kim reiterated the North Korean position when CNN's  Beijing correspondent, Mike Chinoy, asked why the Stalinist  state refuses to let the IAEA inspect its facilities at the  Yongbyon nuclear complex if it has no intention, capability or  desire to develop nuclear weapons.    "Inspecting military sites is an issue that has to be dealt  with between North and South Korea in the process of disarmament  between the two sides," Kim said. "The authority the IAEA was  given is to inspect peaceful nuclear facilities."    Asked if North Korea cooperates militarily with countries  like Iran, Syria or Libya, Kim said, "that is a question which  is directly related to the distortions and the bad rumors about  our country which are all fabricated, made up, by the West."    North Korea, as an independent state, has a right to  maintain  multilateral relations including military cooperation with other  countries.    "There is no limited scope in the cooperation," Kim said.  "If  it suits our interests, we do it. If it doesn't, we don't do  it."</p>

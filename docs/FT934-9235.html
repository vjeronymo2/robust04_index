			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Unigate beats City hopes with Pounds 50.3m UNIGATE raised pre-tax profits by 19.8 per cent in the half year to September 30, to Pounds 50.3m, on sales up 2.5 per cent to Pounds 1bn. This beat market expectations and the shares rose 6p to 371p. Operating profits were ahead 27.7 per cent to Pounds 49.8m, including Pounds 3.8m from acquisitions and Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.2m) from businesses sold. The dairies division raised profits by 50 per cent to Pounds 18.6m, with margins rising from 6.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent, though most of the rise came from integration benefits from acquisitions. Fresh foods profits rose 19.2 per cent to Pounds 8.7m, despite retailers' price cuts. Margins were 3.3 per cent (3.2 per cent). Profits from farm foods, such as bacon and turkeys, rose from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 1.2m helped by lower pig prices and the sale of half the pig herd. Higher feed costs had cut margins there. Margins were still low at 0.9 per cent. Distribution profits rose 47.3 per cent to Pounds 10.9m, largely because of the Glass Glover acquisition, although margins fell from 8.5 to 7.5 per cent. The US restaurants suffered a fall in profits from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 7.7m, despite a rise in sales, with the fall in dollar terms near 20 per cent. Other activities made Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 1.2m) including a loss from the US exhibitions business. Associates, the Dutch Nutricia baby food business, contributed Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 7.7m) with the rise due to translating profits at a lower sterling rate. Exceptional costs totalled Pounds 700,000. However, this included a Pounds 5.9m gain from the release of a provision made in 1991 which was surplus to needs. The fall in sterling added Pounds 1.5m to profits. Earnings per share, excluding exceptionals, rose 23 per cent to 15.5p. The interim dividend is raised from 5.7p to 6p. See Lex</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Territories sealed in response to Hamas killings Israel sealed off the occupied territories for an indefinite period yesterday, banning all Palestinians from entering Israel and East Jerusalem after a second Palestinian attack in 24 hours came as the country remembered 6m Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust. The move cuts tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs and followed a warning by extremist Islamic groups, responsible for slaying eight Israelis in two separate attacks, that they would step up their violent activities and 'continue in the path of blood and martyrdom'. President Bill Clinton condemned the Palestinian attacks as 'acts of terrorism' aimed at stopping the Middle East peace process. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, in its first official comment said it regretted Wednesday's car bombing which left seven Israelis dead and urged Israel to implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord as soon as possible. Despite intense domestic pressure the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said it would continue peace talks with the PLO in Cairo on Sunday after observing the annual Holocaust memorial day and the Jewish sabbath. Israel's closure of the occupied territories was intended to calm public fears of more bloody attacks by Islamic groups seeking revenge for the February massacre of 29 Arabs by a Jewish settler in Hebron. In the southern Israeli town of Ashdod, a Palestinian guerrilla of the Islamic Jihad group, who lived in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, yesterday sprayed a bus stop at a busy intersection with gunfire, killing an Israeli and wounding four. Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza yesterday to stock up on food and supplies and prepare for 'an atmosphere of real war which will engulf the Zionist soldiers and enemy commanders in the coming days.' Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Israeli-PLO peace agreement and wants to build an Islamic state in all the historical land of Palestine, said at least four more attacks were being prepared. In Israel, right-wing opposition leaders have called for a suspension of the peace talks and the resignation of Mr Rabin.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS OUTRAGED OVER CELEBRITY CAMPAIGN TO HAVE SENTENCING JUDGE GO EASY ON  MILKEN  </P> <P> I was bemused by the outpouring of love and affection shown towards Mike Milken  in your Sept. 11 article.  </P> <P> The relevant issue here is not whether Milken is a good math teacher, or that  he danced with "skinny" and "plump" girls in his 5th grade ballroom dance  class, or that he donated money to charity. The issue is that Milken was a  willing, knowing criminal. He should now be punished severely for his chosen  role as a felon.  </P> <P> BRUCE A. REEVES  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

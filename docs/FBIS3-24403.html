			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liana Minasyan under the heading: "American </F> Diplomacy Steps Up Its Activity on Russia's Southern Borders:  The Consequences of This Could Be Ambiguous, Including for the  United States Itself"]    [Text]    In a short space of time a third CIS leader has gone to the  United States: Clinton has received Kravchuk, he has received  Nazarbayev, and now, Shevardnadze. All three countries have  experienced quite strong pressure on the part of Moscow and  could ultimately have been seeking an outside distraction, in  any event, checking the extent to which the world is prepared to  accept CIS countries outside of a Russian context.    Of the three countries, Georgia is the most susceptible to  Russian influence--acknowledging Moscow's direct impact on the  course of the Abkhaz conflict and the possibility of freezing  it, its official representatives have thus far been expressing  regret at the fact that international organizations have been in  no hurry to respond to the joint requests of Moscow and Tbilisi  concerning formalization of Russian peacekeeping in the zone of  the conflict. The fact that Shevardnadze discussed in Washington  the possibility of the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping contingent  to Abkhazia and obtained support has for himself one attractive  circumstance--Georgia's prospects are still linked with him  personally, and, supporting him, Western leaders are supporting  the present regime and have an interest in its stabilization.  All other prospects are more doubtful.    Doubt number one--how long will it be necessary to  wait for the prospects of a "firm political settlement," that  is, for the parties to have reached a compromise which makes it  possible to begin a peacekeeping operation without subjecting  the soldiers to the unpredictable vicissitudes of the war. The  appearance of "blue helmets" in a region stuffed with Russian  arms in direct proximity to the troubled Russian borders is in  itself a political problem. Russia is jealous not so much of the  fact of the presence of UN soldiers as of the "outside"  political influence on Georgia. The Abkhaz leadership could  attempt to derive practical benefits for itself from the latent  rivalry. Although it has no one from whom it can expect  political recognition, enshrining the present status quo with  the aid of its Moscow allies is possible.    But Georgia, split not only along the line of the front but  also divided into spheres of influence, would be even further  from stability than now. Russia, even having signed the  notorious cooperation treaty with it, played on its weakness.  But Georgia will remain a weak country--with a financial system  in a state of collapse and blocked lines of communication and  cut off from energy supplies--until the internal problems are  resolved and it becomes a self-sufficient state. Russia, despite  all its ambitions, lacks the resources to "pay" for the  corresponding political orientation--its "residual" influence  has been sufficient thus far only for maintaining Georgia in a  disorganized state. And Western investments would be spent on  the war, as if on a glutton. Inasmuch as the main candidates for  the role of peacemakers in the region--Russia and international  organizations--have as of late been pushing disagreements more  than seeking mutual understanding, the problems in their  relations will be resolved at the expense of Georgia and  Abkhazia. They can only be alleviated by a Georgian-Abkhaz  compromise, but it, judging by the failure of the recent Geneva  negotiations, is unattainable as yet.</p>

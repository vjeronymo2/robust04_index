			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Talk Show Host Gets Death Threat: A radio talk show host in Greenville, S.C.,  said he has received a death threat invoking the name of a Denver radio  personality whose murder was linked to white supremacists. Mike Gallagher,  whose talk show on WFBC-AM airs from 9 a.m. until noon, said he had just  finished a program on racism on Thursday when he received a telephone call from  a man who identified himself only as "George from Anderson," a South Carolina  town.  </P> <P> Gallagher said the caller told him to "remember Alan Berg," the Denver talk  show host who was gunned down in 1984. When Gallagher left the station around 2  p.m., he found a note on his car windshield that included a racial remark,  another reference to Berg and the words, "You're a dead man." The threat, which  is being investigated by police, came after Gallagher and his callers discussed  the controversy over a South Carolina sheriff accused of using a racial slur.

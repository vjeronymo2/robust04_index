			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: SKF long-term debt downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, yesterday had its long-term debt downgraded to BBB from BBB plus by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. S&amp;P said the decision was based on the Swedish company's weak 1992 financial performance, its rising debt and increasingly difficult industry conditions. SKF's loss after financial items rose to SKr1.8bn (Dollars 233m) in 1992 from SKr221m a year earlier, while net debt rose to SKr6.7bn from SKr5.6bn. Low industry demand and price pressures mean the debt will only be reduced slowly, according to S&amp;P. Demand in Europe, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of group sales, is expected to be particularly weak this year. 'With few signs of a recovery in the fortunes of SKF's main customers, the automotive and engineering industries, SKF could face its fourth consecutive year of declining demand,' S&amp;P warned. It noted the group's strong industry position and its rationalisation programmes, but stated that 'prolonged industry difficulties could weaken demand beyond expectations and lead to reduced credit quality.' S&amp;P also lowered its rating on the US dollar-denominated Euro-commercial paper programme of Neste Oy, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals group. The cut to A-2 from A-1 reflected 'a material deterioration of the group's financial position due to the difficult trading positions in all its key businesses and the continuing high level of capital investment in the last couple of years,' said S&amp;P. The agency noted the Finnish government's capacity to help state-owned companies had been constrained by sharply higher public sector borrowing. Neste has been identified as a privatisation candidate by the government. The group's business position in the Nordic region is strong, according to S&amp;P, particularly in Finland where it is the only oil refiner.</p>

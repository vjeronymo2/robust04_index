			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: More to cut in CAP cost Sir, It really is good news that the European Commission is willing to stimulate debate on further change to the Common Agricultural Policy just two years after the MacSharry reforms were adopted (your articles 'CAP report sends tremors through Brussels', September 30 and 'Trouble down on the farm', October 3). For 'reform-minded' politicians the publication of this latest study signals a shift towards a more flexible approach from the Commission on agricultural policy. It also shows that the Mac-Sharry reforms were an important step but that less costly ways of compensating farmers for price reductions must be found. In 1995, the EU will still be paying Ecu37bn for the farm budget - nearly half the entire budget amount. It may well be that one-off compensatory payments are not in the forefront of 'Brussels thinking'. But in budget and trade terms, and as the EU expands eastwards, we have to find some way of eliminating export refunds altogether and completely decoupling production from price support. If not we will bankrupt ourselves. If the alternative to lump sum payments is the renationalisation of the CAP - which way would the Commission go?

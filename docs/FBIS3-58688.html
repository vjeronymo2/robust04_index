			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Werner Girke, former administrator of the </F> foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, by  Dieter Krause in Berlin; date not given: "Search for Millions"]    [Text] [Krause] You were in Moscow last week when the  premises of your company, TVO [Fiduciary Management and  Organization Company], in Berlin and your apartment were  searched. Did you meet Zhirinovskiy there?    [Girke] No. I do not even know where Zhirinovskiy is based  in Moscow. I was there purely for business reasons.    [Krause] The search of your office and apartment was  intended mainly to produce documents concerning the whereabouts  of 4 million German marks [DM], which you are said to have used  for private purposes.    [Girke] Nothing has been taken away illegally. Even the  Trust Agency knows that. Due to my knowledge of former assets  of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, I have recovered some  DM63 million for the Trust Agency since spring 1991.    [Krause] How much has been transferred to Trust Agency  accounts?    [Girke] A total of DM53 million so far. Another DM6 million  are on their way, so this leaves those DM4 million.    [Krause] What about them?    [Girke] These are the commissions to which I am entitled.  The Trust Agency received the corresponding claims and bills  one year ago.    [Krause] Where are the DM4 million now? In Russia?    [Girke] No. The money I took to Russia this time was  invested in a food service project.    [Krause] Behind which stands Zhirinovskiy?    [Girke] My Russian business partner is in no way connected  with that gentleman.    [Krause] Did you give any money to Zhirinovskiy?    [Girke] Not a single mark.    [Krause] Why did you invite him to Berlin?    [Girke] He asked me. Shortly before Christmas, my partner  Werner Neumann and I happened to meet Zhirinovskiy in Austria.    [Krause] Was it also a coincidence that one of  Zhirinovskiy's staffers worked in your company for six weeks  last summer?    [Girke] I was not aware of that connection at the time.    [Krause] So, you are only interested in business relations  with Zhirinovskiy?    [Girke] Yes, that is what I would be interested in.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALLPLAYERS TAKE A SWING AT BEING BUSINESSMEN;  </P> <P> ENTERPRISE: ERIC DAVIS, DARRYL STRAWBERRY AND REGINALD MONTGOMERY SHARE  BASEBALL AND A BUSINESS IN THE TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY GREW UP.  </P> <P> On a run-down section of South Broadway in South-Central Los Angeles, a  sparkling white Porsche convertible pulls up in front of a modest storefront.  Out of the car steps Eric Davis, who will earn $3 million for each of the next  three years patrolling center field for the Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> Nearby, a dirty-faced homeless man pushes a shopping cart past the storefront  and an adjoining Baptist church and aluminum-can reclamation yard. So what is  Davis, natty in a dark business suit and patent leather black loafers, doing  here?  </P> <P> Inside the storefront is All Star Custom Interiors, a business started three  months ago by Davis, fellow baseball star Darryl Strawberry, who plays right  field for the New York Mets, and their high-school chum and ex-minor league  ballplayer, Reginald Montgomery, all of whom are 27. The firm sells custom  bathroom fixtures, carpeting and other interior goods to contractors and  individuals.  </P> <P> For Davis, who has a house in Woodland Hills, and Strawberry, who has an Encino  residence, All Star gives them an opportunity to learn a new skill that they  hope to use after the major leagues. "Baseball isn't always going to be there,"  Davis said. "This was a challenge to me to learn the products, learn the  business world, learn how to deal with people outside of baseball."  </P> <P> And to hear Davis and Montgomery tell it -- Strawberry couldn't because he  failed to show up for an interview -- the business also is their way of helping  improve South-Central Los Angeles, where the three men grew up. Davis and  Montgomery went to Fremont High School in nearby Compton, and Strawberry  attended rival Crenshaw High.  </P> <P> Each man owns one-third of All Star, which they initially capitalized with  about $50,000. But they have since spent thousands more building their showroom  and ordering supplies for resale to their customers.  </P> <P> Davis and Strawberry also are on the promotion trail; their appearances on TV  sports talk shows typically include a plug for the new venture.  </P> <P> All Star also isn't shy about dropping the names of celebrities who have bought  its goods. When a visitor recently stopped at its showroom, Montgomery pointed  to a stack of boxes in a corner and said they were destined for the home of  Byron Scott of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team. Laker Michael Cooper  also is a customer, he said.  </P> <P> The ballplayers' investment in All Star is still a pittance given the salaries  of Davis and Strawberry, who earned $1.8 million last year. Indeed, they could  have opened All Star in a swank area, but they chose South Broadway "to try to  upgrade our community," Davis said.  </P> <P> "People around here like nice things," he said. "They might not be able to  afford all of the high-end stuff, but they can afford the medium-range stuff,  like a Jacuzzi tub. We could probably do 100% more residential business if we  were in Beverly Hills or Woodland Hills, but that would be taking away from our  culture.  </P> <P> "Just by putting our building here, other businesses on this street are trying  to upgrade their businesses," he added. "It's a positive image in the  community."  </P> <P> All Star's single-story showroom, which is not much bigger than a master  bedroom, features such high-end items as a $1,600 royal blue toilet and a  $4,000 black bathtub with gold-plated fixtures and Jacuzzi. Davis and  Montgomery said such items are meant mainly for upper-crust individuals who  come by to see what is available, and that All Star sells much more mundane and  lower-priced goods as well.  </P> <P> Among the products All Star sells are bathroom fixtures made by Kohler Co. of  Kohler, Wis., Bob Gold, the company's zone manager for Los Angeles, said "we  admire their philosophy on developing a business and returning something to the  neighborhood where they grew up."  </P> <P> All Star is not a passing fancy that the ballplayers grubstaked in order to  help their old friend Montgomery, they said. "It was something we had talked  about for numerous years, going into some type of business," said Davis, who  spends several hours a week at the store during the off-season. And his  interest in decorating precedes All Star.  </P> <P> Davis' mother has been an amateur interior designer for many years, he said,  and "It rubbed off on me." Davis said he has thrice rearranged the furnishings  in his Woodland Hills home, where he lives with his girlfriend, Sherry Brewer,  and their 4-year-old daughter, Erica.  </P> <P> Understandably, Davis is still learning the fine points of managing a business  -- and mastering its jargon. Although he is all grace on the diamond, in an  interview he gets tongue-tied trying to describe All Star's profit potential  and confuses its gross sales, net sales and low overhead. But his point is  clear: He thinks All Star will break even after its first year.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Montgomery will be the day-to-day boss, running the firm while  Davis and Strawberry try to hit 90 m.p.h. fastballs eight months out of the  year. That suits Davis fine, because he and Montgomery are close friends.  </P> <P> Although Montgomery also unsuccessfully tried to become a major league  ballplayer, he was familiar with the home-furnishings business; his father, Ed  Montgomery, has been a building contractor for 40 years.  </P> <P> After Reginald's five-year effort to make the big leagues ended in 1988 -- a  USC star, he was only a step away from the majors, having played at the  Triple-A level in the minors for the California Angels and Baltimore Orioles --  he joined his father as a trouble-shooter, helping other builders and  developers locate interior supplies.  </P> <P> The need for Montgomery's services persuaded him, Davis and Strawberry in 1989  that they should start a business that helps interior designers, contractors  and developers order faucets, carpeting, sinks and the like.  </P> <P> Those professionals -- who are often buying in bulk -- will account for up to  80% of All Star's business, while individuals shopping for themselves will  account for the rest, Davis said. Montgomery said the company has no sales goal  for its first year because, "We didn't want to set any goals. We wanted the  market to dictate what we could do."  </P> <P> Davis and Strawberry also will have fax machines and personal computers in  their respective Cincinnati and New York homes, so that they can receive  frequent updates on All Star's business. Still, Montgomery doesn't pretend that  in the heat of a pennant race, Davis and Strawberry will be too concerned with  peddling bathroom wares.  </P> <P> As Montgomery noted, "You can't worry about toilets and bidets and try to hit a  slider from Bert Blyleven."  </P></p>

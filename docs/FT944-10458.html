			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rationalisation benefits Fenner Rationalisation, organic growth and new products helped Fenner, the power transmission, fluid power and industrial belting group, lift full year pre-tax profits from just Pounds 315,000 to Pounds 8.15m. Operating profits before exceptional items for the year to August 31 rose 27 per cent to Pounds 12.2m, the highest for four years, while turnover slipped from Pounds 201.6m to Pounds 200.8m. After adjusting for disposals and exchange rate movements, turnover rose 5 per cent. Exceptional items fell from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 2.6m as redundancy and rationalisation costs fell. Interest charges dropped from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 1.9m, reflecting last September's rights issue and placing. Earnings per share, after exceptional items, were 4.46p (6.97p losses). Mr Mark Abrahams, chief executive, said the biggest achievement was the turnround on the power transmission side - Fenner's largest business and one that was formerly for sale. In spite of continuing difficult trading conditions, the division reported its first operating profit for three years. The 'star performer,' said Mr Abrahams, was the polymer business, which was helped by a 20 per cent rise in US sales and strong growth in hose and ducting sales. The fluid power division was helped by a strong performance in the US, and from initial sales in continental Europe and the US of Fenner's new vapour recovery system for use at petrol filling stat-ions. Mr Abrahams said the system, which returns allegedly carcinogenic vapour back to the filling station tank, could become a 'very material' part of the division. A final dividend of 1p (nil) will be paid as a foreign income dividend, a measure introduced at the interim stage to save on ACT. The total for the year is 1.5p (nil). COMMENT After recession, things are coming right at last for Fenner, due as much to its own efforts as to improved market conditions. The main problem, power transmission, has been sorted out and offers a solid, if unexciting, future. The rights issue and placing has cut gearing from 54 to 10 per cent and gives a better springboard from which to exploit new products - especially the vapour recovery system. Organic growth and a further reduction in exceptionals should give pre-tax profits of about Pounds 13m this year. Assuming a lower tax charge, the prospective p/e is reasonable at 12 to 13.</p>

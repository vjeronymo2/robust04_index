			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Machiavelli's view of John Major HERE AMONG the congested news offices at Westminster, the Tory and Labour skirmishing is looking too seraphic and scrappy. Attempts to seize the 'political initiative' blur in my mind. Who is more dedicated to public transport? Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, or his brash shadow, John Prescott? Which party is more enthusiastic about the National Health Service? It is time for someone to inject a little order, devilish malice and ruthlessness. Niccolo Machiavelli, the earliest and so far unsurpassed political commentator, must have felt similarly frustrated as he penned a note to The Magnificent Lorenzo De Medici, Duke of Urbino in the 16th century, on his new book, The Prince. Like him, my humble status as a political observer instills a sense of awe. The likely ferocity of the 1992 UK election campaign would impress a Borgia, in vindictiveness if not debauchery. Election press conferences will start at 7.15am to hit breakfast TV. Insults will flow like water. But awe should not stop pundits preaching to the potentates. As Machiavelli wrote: 'Just as men who are sketching the landscape put themselves down in the plain to study the nature of the mountains and the highlands . . . so, to comprehend fully the nature of the people, one must be a prince, and to comprehend fully the nature of princes one must be an ordinary citizen.' Machiavelli's writing plays heavily on the baser human motives, to which only the reckless of political leaders would admit. There are handy election tips. But burn this article after reading. The Prince is most applicable to Tories, partly because it is about holding or consolidating power. Machiavelli himself was an unreconstructed Conservative. Socialism and liberal democracy were not big swingers in turbulent late medieval Italy. Parts could have been written by the Treasury. A Prince spending generously 'will soon squander all his resources only to be forced in the end, if he wants to maintain his reputation, to lay excessive burdens on the people, to impose extortionate taxes,' Machiavelli warns. 'This will start to make his subjects hate him.' John Major is tilting in the wrong direction, positively boasting about the amounts being spent on the NHS. Such largesse will eventually backfire. There needs to be less of this 'honest guy' image. It may have brought credit in Major's first year as prime minister, but callousness will bring still greater dividends. 'A prudent ruler cannot, and must not, honour his word when it places him at a disadvantage and when the reasons for which he made his promise no longer exist.' Major needs to stamp authority on his cabinet. Men must either be pampered or crushed if a Prince is to survive. Rifkind described the row among ministers over rail privatisation as cabinet government 'working properly'. Machiavelli is spinning in his grave. What lessons are there for the usurpers, Kinnock and Ashdown? Machiavelli does not say how power is seized. But the best tactics must be to play to the incumbent's weaknesses. Outbid his prowess and promises. Lie liberally. It may not win an election, but it would inject of bit of demonic fun into my job.</p>

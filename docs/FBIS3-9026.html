Stepan, who is currently chairman of the People's Union of  National and Social Salvation (LUNSZ), told journalists he  considered it absurd for a "person from a friendly Slav country  to come here with the handicap of being followed." He said that  as LUNSZ chairman and as a Czech citizen he would watch  Zhirinovskiy's views with interest and would "read between the  lines."    Jan Vik, spokesman of the Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) which invited  Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic, said today that no  matter whether the visit took place in several days or later it  would be very welcomed. Zhirinovskiy is a Russian  ultra-nationalist and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) which emerged victorious in the Russian parliamentary  elections recently.    Stepan said that Zhirinovskiy had become a victim of an  international information conspiracy. He said that a period of  strengthening of pan-Slavic solidarity is approaching, so that  "300 million Slavs not to find themselves in the position of  nations subservient to overlord nations," the latter being the  "advanced" states.</p>

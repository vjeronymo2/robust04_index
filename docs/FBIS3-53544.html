			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following joint communique has been issued  following the visit of Sardar Faruq Ahmad Leghari, president of  the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia:    King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, the custodian of the  two holy mosques, king of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and His  Excellency Sardar Faruq Ahmad Khan Leghari, president of the  Islamic Republic of Pakistan, have followed with profound  anxiety and extreme regret the devleopment of the painful  situation in Afghanistan resulting from the Afghan sides  resorting to, irrespective of their orientations and  affiliation, the factor of violence and brute force in settling  the differences and problems between them, which has led to the  spilling of innocent blood, killing, and destruction of  properties. It is utterly sorrowful, regrettable, and  disappointing to see all this taking place following the famous  agreement which the Afghan leaders signed in the vicinity of the  holy mosque [Mecca] and their undertaking at that time to adhere  to what had been agreed upon at the holiest place on earth  during the month of blessed Ramadan of last year.    King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the two holy  mosques, and His Excellency Sardar Faruq Ahmad Khan, while  expressing their indignation at what matters in Afghanistan have  led to -- and in a way that does not please God -- appeal to and  demand from the Afghan leaders to fear God and arm themselves  with wisdom and seek arbitration in the contents of the Holy  Qur'an and the pure Sunnah of His Prophet -- may God's prayers  and peace be upon him -- and would like at the same time to  stress the necessity of an unconditional ceasefire and the  halting of all attacks in all areas of Afghanistan according to  the Agreement of Holy Mecca, which stipulates assigning an  important role to the Islamic Conference Organization and its  secretary general to supervise and follow-up; and to give the  secretary general the opportunity to carry out this role and use  his good offices to establish peace and security in Afghanistan  and to ascertain that all sides genuinely abide by the Islamabad  agreement signed by the Afghan leaders in the midst of Holy  Mecca on 18th of Ramadan 1413, corresponding to 11 March 1993,  and to abide by the stipulations of the recent Jalalabad  agreement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Another report from our correspondent from Paris  this time. Today the 91st conference of the Inter-Parliamentary  Union has opened there at the UNESCO headquarters. Yevgeniy  Lukyanov, our Paris correspondent, gives the details.    [Begin recording] [Lukyanov] The activities of the  Inter-Parliamentary Union are widespread. They are mainly  directed towards developing cooperation between peoples for  peace on the planet. They also help to establish contacts  between parliaments and parliamentarians of various countries,  exchange work experience, and defend human rights, the basic  factor of parliamentary democracy.    The agenda of the present conference, which will work until  6  March, includes lots of questions. The two main issues that  will be discussed concern problems connected with the prevention  of conflicts, the maintenance of peace, as well as the problem  of protecting the environment from various wastes of human  activity, a problem that has now become a burning issue.    A delegation of the Commonwealth of Independent States,  which  includes the chairman of the Russian Federation council and the  chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, has  arrived in Paris to participate in the present conference of the  Inter-Parliamentary Union.    I asked Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the upper chamber of  the Russian parliament and chairman of the inter-parliamentary  assembly of the participating CIS states, to tell us about the  aims of the CIS delegation, which has the status of observer at  the conference.    [Shumeyko] [Words indistinct] about 120 representatives of  parliaments of various states have got together. There is  considerable interest in our inter-parliamentary assembly,  because the CIS, about which we talked so much with you, has not  been in existence for long. At the last plenary sitting we  agreed to use abbreviations less and that it is better to use  the word Commonwealth. Many parliaments express an interest now  in what the inter-parliamentary assembly of the former Soviet  Union, and today of free sovereign states, itself intends to do,  what aims it has, what approaches. Is Russia turning once again  to a totalitarian path, an imperial path, the unification of  peoples? I think this will never happen, and we, with our  assembly, will show this. I will evidently read a paper here,  at least the French side [word indistinct] this. I will try to  tell of our goals and tasks and explain to the world that we  come with peace. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders bearish on outlook for cotton COTTON FUTURES prices, after two days of hovering near life-of-contract lows, saw a tiny rally after yesterday morning's open at the New York Cotton Exchange. But with the market virtually awash with cotton and world demand diminishing, the outlook was for continued downward pressure on prices. The March spot month contract at NYCE rose yesterday morning to 53.65 cents a lb, up from Tuesday's close of 53.38 cents a lb. The May contract crept up to 55.55 cents from its previous close of 55.37 cents. The rises were considered to be technical with a little bit of profit taking. Some market observers were waiting to see how much cotton American farmers would place in the US Department of Agriculture's loan programme. The USDA takes farmers' cotton, paying them a set amount as a interest-free loan and storing the cotton for ten months without charge. Farmers can redeem the cotton if prices rise or forfeit it if they do not. If a lot of US cotton had been put into the loan programme, it would have created an artificial tightness in the market, prompting prices to rise a little. But only 4.3m bales are currently in the programme out of a 17.5m bale crop, and this has had virtually no effect on market sentiment. International market factors are perhaps weighing on prices even more heavily, say cotton analysts. China, which has its second largest crop ever in 1991-92, has switched from being a net importer to being a net exporter. According to the secretariat of the International Cotton Advisory committee, China, which had been a net importer of 280,000 tonnes last year, is expected to become a net exporter of 60,000 tons this year. Cotton is also pouring on to the market from the republics of the former Soviet Union, which need hard currency. They have also been supplying cotton in barter deals with trading companies, the committee reported. The Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union and Paraguay have also aggressively and repeatedly cut cotton prices since last summer, according to Ms Sharon Johnson, a cotton analyst with Cargill Investor Services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By commentator Wang Furu (3769 4395 1172): "Reviewing Mao </F> Zedong's Teachings on Resisting `Sugar-Coated Bullets'"]    [Text] The anticorruption drive, which began in the autumn  of 1993 and has become the focus of attention at home and  abroad, has already scored certain results of a phased nature,  and some corrupt elements who failed to sustain the tests from  government, reform, and opening up, have been uncovered one  after another, and have been punished according to the country's  law and the party's discipline. This move wins the hearts of the  people, and the struggle is develping steadily and in an orderly  manner.    One prominent feature of the corrupt phenomenon at this time  is that unlawful elements in the society vigorously engage in  trading money for power with the mutated elements within party  and government departments, and they vehemently embezzle state  assets to an alarming extent. The emergence of this feature  cannot but make us recall Comrade Mao Zedong's warning on  resisting "sugar-coated bullets," a warning he gave on the eve  of the nation's founding. Those teachings are still very  practical and applicable today. At this time when the 100th  birthday of Mao Zedong is approaching, with this article I want  to cherish my profound memory of our revered old man.    Comrade Mao Zedong spent all his life on the undertakings of  the party and the people; he hoped our people's government and  socialist undertaking would not be forfeited because of our own  corruption. As early as the period of rectification campaign in  Yenan, Comrade Mao Zedong reminded the whole party not to once  again make the mistake of being arrogant in time of victory in  his report entitled "Study and the Times." He praised Comrade  Guo Moruo's article entitled "Memorial Ceremony for 300 Years of  Jia Shen," which described the lesson one can learn from Li  Zicheng who walked from victory to failure; he asked the senior  cadres in the whole party to learn from the article. At the  Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee,  which was convened on the eve of the overall victory across the  country, Comrade Mao Zedong gave some earnest advice: "The  might of the enemies cannot conquer us, and this point has  already been proved. But flattery from the bourgeoisie could  conquer the weak-minded persons within our contingent. There  could be some party members who have never been conquered by the  enemies who held guns, and they lived up to the title of hero in  front of those enemies, but they cannot sustain the attack by  the bullets which are coated with sugar, and they will lose the  battle when such bullets are used. We must take precautionary  measures against such a situation." Comrade Mao Zedong's  prophecy unfortunately came true, during the "1951-1952 movement  against the three evils," the corrupt, degraded, and mutated  elements such as Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, who were the  typical examples, were discovered. In order to more effectively  prevent the cadre contingent from decaying, and to better save  the majority of the cadres who had made mistakes, the CPC  Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, after very careful  consideration, resolutely sentenced these two seriously  degenerated elements to death.    Today, under the conditions of reform, opening up, and  development of market economy, the situation is very different  from the one shortly after the nation's founding. But Comrade  Mao Zedong's teachings on resisting the "sugar-coated bullets"  still have great practical significance. Because, even under  the conditions of development of a market economy and the  practice of separation of the government and enterprises, the  government still has the duty of exercising macro-regulation,  control, and management over the economy, and judicial  departments, administrative and law enforcement organs, and  economic management departments still have relatively great  powers. Unlawful elements in society and those who are obsessed  with the desire for gain, will use various means to shoot  sugar-coated bullets, leap over and erode the supervisory powers  of party and government officials and even senior cadres, and  pull the weak-minded into the water, to serve as the protective  umbrellas from unlawful and criminal elements. Compared with  the period shortly after the nation's founding, the main body  shooting sugar-coated bullets is different now; at that time  they were the old bourgeois elements, and now they are probably  new figures who hold various titles such as "managers." Shortly  after the nation's founding, when party and government officials  received sugar-coated bullets, most of the time it happened  passively, but now some of them are actively attracting  sugar-coated bullets and seeking to be hit. No matter how the  contents and measures vary, the essence is the same, that is,  the trading of power for money, abusing public interests for  private ones, and jeopardizing the state's interests. What is  more serious is that this phenomenon has already begun to erode  the tools of people's democratic dictatorship--political and  judicial organs, and even some of our army units have also been  affected. This cannot but arouse a high degree of alertness  among us.    Our party's second-generation leadership collective  inherited  and developed Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas on resisting corruption  and advocating clean government, in particular, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping has shown a great deal of concern in this area. In the  course of reform and opening up, he has always stressed the need  to do two kinds of work simultaneously, and equally firmly. He  said: "We must fight corruption in the whole process of reform  and opening up. To cadres and party members, clean government  building must be grasped as a big thing." He also demanded that  senior party cadres play an exemplary role in being uncorrupt  and exercising self- discipline, including properly disciplining  their children. He stressed that clean government building must  rely on the legal system, and that it is still a legal system  which is more reliable. Based on these expositions by Comrade  Xiaoping, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee decided to explicitly list strengthening of clean  government building and the anticorruption drive as the  necessary conditions and important guarantees for building  socialist market economy system, holding that this is a big  matter which has a bearing on the success or failure of the  reform undertaking, and on the fate of the party and the  country; the decision reiterated: "The principle of commodity  exchange is never allowed to be introduced into the party's  political life or the administrative affairs of state organs for  the purpose of trading power for money."    At present, the whole party and the people in the whole  country are profoundly implementing the spirit of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  expediting development and reform. At the same time, we must  never become slack in spiritual civilization construction and  efforts to fight corruption and advocate clean government. We  should seriously learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on  anticorruption and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's relevant expositions,  and resolutely uphold the principle of doing two kinds of work  simultaneously and equally firmly, to ensure that our  undertakings continuously advance along a healthy track!</p>

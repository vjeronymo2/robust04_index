			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Madrid tries to stem flow of foreign funds THE MADRID bourse is considering ways of introducing marketmaking into the Spanish equity market in an effort to stop a slow draining of foreign investment towards more liquid European markets. Mr Antonio Zoido, president of the Madrid Stock Exchange, has said the possibility of creating marketmakers in Spain has already been put, informally, to the national stock market commission (CNMV). The introduction of marketmaking into Madrid would require a potentially lengthy change of stock market law or it could be achieved more rapidly through a royal decree. Spain's stock markets have already been through a gruelling reform process in the past four years, but this has concentrated mostly on offering greater transparency and security to investors. The Madrid market, the fourth largest in Europe in terms of capitalisation, still suffers from liquidity problems, however. Large foreign institutional investors tend to buy in a narrow range of Spanish stocks, mainly banks and utilities, which guarantee them a quick exit should it be necessary. Spain's brokers, who fight low key wars to undercut each other on commissions, are also victims of investor concentration on a limited number of liquid stocks. Brokers have in the past tried to create business for themselves by occasionally buying large stakes in companies with a view to turning them round and selling them on the markets. But these schemes, as well as a rash of flotations in recent years, have delivered disappointing results, with many new entrants to the market now trading well below their launch prices. Foreign investors, either brokers or final clients, have quickly seen the ease with which Spanish brokers can be squeezed. 'Whether marketmaking is good or bad is not the point,' said Mr Frederick Artesani, chief of equity research and sales with Benito y Monjardin in Madrid. 'The point is that marketmaking is inevitable.' With the Madrid market well down on the year, some larger Madrid brokers have already begun to provide unofficial marketmaking services to big foreign clients in an effort to hold on to business.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is now  communicating and exchanging information with Green Peace, the  international environment protection organization known for its  anti-nuclear and anti-whaling campaigns. Greenpeace is the  organization which has by actions shown its dislike for the  Japanese Government over issues of plutonium shipment and  whaling. MOFA in the past has even avoided coming into contact  with the organization. But having been beaten completely by  Greenpeace in the collection of information on Russia's dumping  of radioactive wastes into the sea, MOFA, while admitting its  exchanges with the group will have limitations, wants to hold  active exchanges with it as a source of information on such  matters as Russia's disposal of nuclear wastes.    Russia dumped nuclear wastes into the Sea of Japan last  October. The first report of this shocking news came from  Greenpeace, and pictures of Greenpeace's ship pursuing waste  dumping ships came on television screens across Japan. For the  MOFA which had had no information on the dumping at all, it was  a loss of face and a chance to be reminded of the group's  "capabilities."    Yoshitaka Kawamura, counselor (in charge of arms control and  science) of the MOFA Foreign Policy Bureau, and Naoki Ohara,  chief secretary of Greenpeace Japan, came to know each other in  an international conference on marine pollution prevention in  November. Ohara phoned the former in February. Counselor  Kawamura recalled, "I was not quite happy because of the  experiences of the past, but I thought we had the common purpose  of wanting to prevent the dumping." Thus the two came to  exchange views on the validity of information in reports that  "dumping would be resumed." Since then, MOFA and Greenpeace  have continued to exchange information, MOFA asking for  information that Greenpeace alone possessed and Greenpeace  asking for information MOFA possessed on Russia.    Shocked by the experience in October, the MOFA has increased  the number of officials handling the nuclear waste dumping issue  from two to four. The officials have made many trips to Moscow  and Vladivostok, thus expanding connections with the officials  of the central government as well as officials concerned in the  Far East area. The MOFA late last year established a consulate  general in Vladivostok, and has put in efforts on information  collection. A ministry official was full of confidence saying,  "Now, European countries and the United States come to us to ask  about the situation in the Russian Far East."    Yoshiji Nogami, a councilor of MOFA's Foreign Policy Bureau,  insisted, "It is not a bad idea to actively exchange views and  information with organizations which hold views different from  us." Greenpeace Japan's Chief Secretary Ohara on his part said  about the information of exchange, "We will cooperate as long as  it helps environmental protection."    Within MOFA, however, the Economic Affairs Bureau, which is  in charge of the whaling issue, is of a different mind. The  bureau continues to confront the group squarely from front.</p>

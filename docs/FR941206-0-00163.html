			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA notes that some measure of control of air emissions from remediation tanks, containers, and impoundments will be assured during the deferral period. Remediation authorities of RCRA and CERCLA and similar State authorities allow overseeing officials to impose, on a site-specific basis, appropriate air emission controls on these types of units, as well as on other waste management units and handling operations. In addition, hazardous wastes containing organics that are managed off-site (i.e., outside a RCRA facility's boundary, or outside a CERCLA site) would be subject to the subpart CC management standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the EPA emphasizes that the deferral is indeed temporary. The issue of appropriate air emission controls for remediation units is likely to be addressed in the context of the Hazardous Waste Identification Rules which are currently being developed by the EPA. The issue is also potentially part of the third phase of the RCRA section 3004(n) implementation. In addition, waste remediation sites are on the initial list of source categories under CAA section 112, and the EPA currently is scheduled to issue technology-based standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from this source (see 57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992). Consequently, the EPA will be addressing this issue in the reasonably near future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Radioactive mixed wastes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As explained in section IV.F of this preamble, the management of radioactive mixed waste at TSDF is subject to regulation under subtitle C of RCRA. The EPA reviewed the special nature of radioactive mixed wastes with respect to the air emission control requirements under the final subpart CC standards. In certain cases, the air emission controls used as the basis for the subpart CC standards are not compatible with the NRC requirements for safe handling of radioactive mixed wastes. For example, drums used to store radioactive mixed waste cannot be sealed with vapor leak-tight covers because of unacceptable pressure buildup of hydrogen gas to levels that can potentially cause rupture of the drum or create a potentially serious explosion hazard. This generation of hydrogen gas results from the radiolytic decomposition of organic materials (e.g., plastics) or aqueous solutions stored in the drums. Consequently, a drum used for storage of radioactive mixed wastes must be continuously vented through special filters in accordance with technical guidance issued by the NRC to prevent the hydrogen concentration in the drum from reaching dangerous levels. The EPA is planning to further investigate methods for effective control of organic emissions from waste management units handling radioactive mixed waste that are consistent with the NRC waste management practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. General Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final subpart CC standards require that TSDF owners and operators install and operate air emission controls on each tank, surface impoundment, and container subject to the rules except when all of the hazardous waste placed in the unit is determined to meet certain conditions. These conditions are based on properties of the hazardous waste determined at either one of two locations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The point where a hazardous waste is generated or the point where the waste is received by an off-site facility; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The point following treatment of a hazardous waste to remove or destroy the organics in the waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Point of waste origination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the final subpart CC standards, a TSDF owner or operator is exempted from managing a hazardous waste in a tank, surface impoundment, or container in accordance with the air emission control requirements of the rule when the owner or operator determines that all hazardous waste placed in the unit has an average volatile organic concentration at the point of waste origination less than 100 ppmw. The point of waste origination is defined in the rule with respect to the point where the TSDF owner or operator first has possession of a hazardous waste. When the TSDF owner or operator is the generator of the hazardous waste, the point of waste origination means the point where a solid waste produced by a system, process, or waste management unit is determined to be a hazardous waste as defined in 40 CFR part 261. As previously stated, the term ``point of waste origination'' applied to this situation is being used in a similar manner to the use of the term ``point of generation'' in waste operations air standards established under authority of the Clean Air Act in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, and 63 of this chapter. When neither the TSDF owner nor operator is the generator of the hazardous waste, point of waste origination means the point where the owner or operator accepts delivery or takes possession of the hazardous waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Treated Hazardous Waste. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a hazardous waste has an average volatile organic concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw based on the hazardous waste composition at the point of waste origination, then this waste is required under the subpart CC standards to be managed in accordance with the air emission control requirements of the rule. Under these requirements, specific air emission controls must be installed and operated on every tank, surface impoundment, and container subject to the rule used in the waste management sequence from the point of waste origination through the point where the organics in the waste are removed or destroyed by a process that meets or exceeds a minimum level of performance specified in the rule. In other words, once a hazardous waste is treated to remove or destroy the organics in the waste in accordance with the rule requirements, the subsequent downstream tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage this particular hazardous waste are not required to meet the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final subpart CC standards provide TSDF owners and operators with several alternative provisions for determining when a treated hazardous waste is no longer required to be managed in tanks, surface impoundments, and containers meeting the air emission control requirements of the rule. Treated hazardous waste provisions are specified in the subpart CC standards for the following processes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

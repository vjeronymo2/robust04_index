			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at  1030 GMT on 10 April reports that "Waqf official Muhammad  Abu-Salah testified this morning before the Hebron massacre  commission of inquiry that Barukh Goldstein struck him to the  floor when he tried to stop him from entering the Muslim prayer  hall. Three Waqf officials are testifying today after being  ordered to do so after they initially refused."    Later in the report, Qol Yisra'el notes that "Muhammad  Abu-Salah said Goldstein had caused some problems in the past,  but not as much as other settlers. He had refused to leave the  Muslim section when asked to by Waqf officials but no specific  complaint had been made against him." Abu-Salah said that "he  had tried to stop Goldstein entering the Muslim hall on the  morning of the massacre. Goldstein said: `I am an officer,'  pointing to his officer's insignia. Abu-Salah said he was still  not allowed in and Goldstein hit him with his rifle. Abu-Salah  fell to the ground and Goldstein walked past him and opened fire  on the worshipers."    The first Waqf official to testify, 'Isma'il al-Shilmun,  said  he had seen Goldstein a few times in the past, although he was  not one of the regular Jewish worshipers. He said Goldstein was  the only person to fire shots at the Muslim worshipers.  Al-Shilmun admitted that there were only six Waqf guards on  duty at the time of the massacre instead of eight. He described  a history of tension and acts of provocation by Jewish  worshipers and claimed that on numerous occasions he had  informed the military governor and Civil Administration  officials but nothing was done to change the situation.  According to al-Shilmun, in the past Jews poured acid or placed  sharp objects on the Muslim prayer mats, offered the Muslims  alcohol, and repeatedly shouted insults and opened the door  dividing the Jewish and Muslim sections before the allotted  time. On the night before the massacre, the settlers  celebrating Purim told the Muslims to drink wine, threw a toy  grenade, and shouted out such things as `this is our land and  you are our dogs.' Muslims responded with shouts of al-Qassam,  al-Qassam -- after the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 'Izz  al-Din al-Qassam terrorists -- and God is Great. The Waqf  officials denied that there were chants of Kill the Jews.  Al-Shilmun said that some of the Jewish worshipers came to pray  without provocation and respected the sanctity of the place. He  also said that some of the officers in charge of the site were  strict with the settlers and clamped down on any provocations,  but others were less strict and failed to act against the  settlers.    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 10 April, in  a similar report on the commission hearings, adds: "the three  Waqf officials testified that they did not see another man with  Barukh Goldstein. One of the guards leveled sharp complaints  against Dov Stelman, the Army commander at the Cave of the  Patriarchs, and said that tensions between Muslims and Jews had  risen sharply after Stelman's assignment to the post.  Contradictions were found between one guard's testimony today  and his original statement to the police. The guard, Muhammad  Sulayman Abu-Salah, told the police that he had seen four  soldiers and an officer outside the prayer hall, but told the  Shamgar Commission that he had not seen any soldiers."</p>

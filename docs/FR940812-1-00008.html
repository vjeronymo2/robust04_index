With the enactment of this legislation, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) issued a series of regulations, at 45 CFR part 400, to establish comprehensive requirements for a State-administered Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP), beginning with the publication on September 9, 1980 (45 FR 59318) of a regulation governing State plan and reporting requirements. Subsequent regulations covered cash and medical assistance and Federal funding, published March 12, 1982 (47 FR 10841); grants to States, child welfare services (including services to unaccompanied minors), and Federal funding for State expenditures, published January 30, 1986 (51 FR 3904); and cash and medical assistance, requirements for employability services, job search, and employment, and refugee social services published February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5463). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description of the Regulation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed regulation clarifies some current policies, amends others, and sets forth regulatory requirements for the targeted assistance program (TAP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years, annual refugee admissions have been high, resulting in an expanding pool of refugees in need of services. As of September 30, 1993, 1.6 million refugees have been resettled in the U.S. since 1975. All of these refugees, with the exception of those who have become U.S. citizens, are eligible to receive refugee program services. At the same time, the level of funds appropriated for services has remained essentially unchanged, making it difficult to serve all refugees in need of services with available resources. It is not uncommon, for example, for English language training classes, funded by the refugee program, to have waiting lists so that refugees who arrive in the country are not able to access English language training without a delay. Nine major States have indicated that there are currently waiting lists for refugee services, especially for English language training, in their States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe the increased demand for services makes it necessary to sharpen the program's priorities. Resources in the refugee program are no longer sufficient to provide the level of services needed to assist refugees for an open-ended period of time to become self-sufficient. We have learned from experience in the refugee program that the greatest impact that services can have on a refugee's social adjustment and economic well-being occurs during a refugee's initial years in the United States. These initial services often define a refugee's future experience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Findings from several studies indicate that comprehensive services, provided soon after a refugee's arrival in the U.S., increase the likelihood of early employment. Under commission from ORR in 1992, Dr. Robert L. Bach, in an examination of data from the Oregon Refugee Early Employment Project (REEP), found that refugees who received job services or pre-employment training in the first 90 days reduced the time to their initial job by almost two months. Dr. Bach's analysis indicated that each job service provided in the first 90 days increased the probability of employment by three percent. A study of the Oregon REEP, conducted by the Refugee Policy Group (RPG) and published in 1989, found that REEP set up client/caseworker ratios that permitted a staff-intensive approach early in the resettlement experience, an element which in large part, according to RPG, was crucial to REEP's achievement of earlier employment. Similarly, performance reported for the first year of the United States Catholic Conference (USCC) Wilson/Fish project in San Diego indicated that the project was able to reduce the average length of time on cash assistance by over two months through the provision of early comprehensive services aimed at employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

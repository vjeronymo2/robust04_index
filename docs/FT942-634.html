			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Norwegians to buy Bond Helicopters Helikopter Service, the Norwegian helicopter group, yesterday announced plans to acquire Aberdeen-based Bond Helicopters in a cash-plus-shares deal which values Bond at NKr800m (Dollars 115m). The deal will create the world's largest helicopter group with a fleet of 169 aircraft and annual turnover of NKr2.5bn. Following four years of co-operation between the two groups, HS yesterday acquired 49 per cent of Bond and will take over the remaining 51 per cent during the next three years. The owners of Bond will acquire up to 12.2 per cent of the shares of HS during the amalgamation period, making them the biggest single shareholder; 3i, the UK venture capital company, is disposing of its 30 per cent stake in Bond. Mr Christian Brinch, managing director of HS, said the companies would retain their identities during the next three years and that there would be no formal changes to management. Mr Brinch will become the managing director of the new entity. The merged group with 1,800 employees, 156 helicopters and 13 aircraft will command 42 per cent of the North Sea market.</p>

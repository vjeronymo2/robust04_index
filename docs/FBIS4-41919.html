			<p>BFN     [Text] Chernobyl [no date as received] -- A meeting of the  Supreme Council Commission for issues of nuclear policy and  nuclear safety was held at the Chernobyl AES yesterday. It  discussed the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power stations.    Leaders from Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, the  State Atomic Inspectorate, Ukraine's State Atomic Committee,  directors of nuclear power stations, and enterprises of the  nuclear industry took part in the commission's work.    Having noted the positive tendencies in raising the safety  of  Ukrainian nuclear power stations, above all, the Chernobyl AES,  the meeting's participants concentrated on the present problems  of which there are many because of the imperfections of state  tariffs. Nuclear power stations are working at a loss: The  Ukrainian Ministry of Energy's national dispatching station pays  the AES only 200 karbovantsi for 1 kWh, the cost price of which  is 750 karbovantsi. But even at this price, the nuclear  industry's debts reached two trillion karbovantsi. Because of  the shortage of funds, repair and preventative inspection work  is being disrupted and therefore the safe working of the AES is  not guaranteed. There is a real threat that up to five  generating sets each with a capacity of one million kW could be  shut down.    In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Mykola  Pavlovskyy, chairman of the [Nuclear Policy and Safety]  Commission, said that its priority task would be to prepare and  adopt a law on the use of nuclear energy as soon as possible,  and in the future to create an effective legislative base on the  basis of which nuclear power engineering will develop.</p>

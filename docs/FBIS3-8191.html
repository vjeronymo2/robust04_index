			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Rauscher: "Austrian Aggression"] </F>   [Text] Where did Vaclav Klaus learn the news first?--in  KURIER. In an interview in Prague on Thursday afternoon [3  March], he was taken aback by the postponement of the decision  on a loan of the U.S. ExIm Bank valued at billions [currency not  specified] for the completion of Temelin [nuclear power plant].  "I have not yet heard that. This is questionable information,"  said the Czech prime minister (who speaks fluent German and, of  course, English).    Now the crisis between Prague and Vienna has become even  further aggravated. Klaus, an unreserved advocate of the market  economy, does not understand why the Austrians and his  counterpart, Vranitzky, want to torpedo a project that he  regards as necessary for the--very good--economic development of  the Czech Republic. Apparently, the Austrian intervention in  Washington has now been temporarily successful after all. This  provoked a harsh reaction from Klaus: "Whether these are three  or eight deputies out of 480--this is not enough for me. This  is also not enough for me after such aggressiveness from the  Austrian side."    "This Austrian reaction is really impossible for me. The  completion of Temelin is absolutely necessary for us, and all  reasonable Austrians within and outside the government know  that. Nevertheless, they are playing this card for the election  campaign."    But is the government not making allowances for a real  concern of the population? "As it happened, I was skiing in St.  Anton, and I saw an opinion poll on ORF, according to which the  three most important topics for the Austrians are pensions, full  employment, and crime, but not Temelin. I do not believe that  Temelin is something that the Austrians have deep in their  heart. It is rather a political matter and is connected with  the elections."    But what about relations between the Czech Republic and  Austria? "Normal daily relations between Austria and the Czech  Republic, between hundreds, thousands, and millions of people,  will continue completely normally, without any deterioration,  which may only take place on a large-scale political level,  where the political card is played."    It is often heard from the Czechs that the Austrians want to  keep them in tutelage. "This is not a question of pride; it is  a question of wrong arguments on the Austrian side. What  alternative have you proposed to us? You proposed investments  for your firms, which are often owned by the state and  subsidized (transformation into gas power plants--the editors).  This was not a gift; it was only state-organized lobbying for  Austrian investments in our country. Austria's proposals are  not so innocent, and the Austrian politicians should not pretend  to be so innocent."    Should Austria have been more tactful? "The question is put  in an absolutely wrong way. The construction work in Temelin  has already progressed very far. The decision was not new, and  this should be taken into account. The other question is: The  ecological catastrophe for us is northern Bohemia, with the coal  power plants, not southern Bohemia, with nuclear power."    It is said in Austria that it is intended to export  electricity from Temelin in order to improve the Czech balance  of payments?    "We do not need to improve the balance of payments. It is  active. We told Austrian politicians a hundred times--no, we are  not building Temelin for electricity exports--but no one wants  to hear or understand that."    Apparently Vaclav Klaus really feels misunderstood. What is  his wish for relations with Austria? The answer is  characteristic of this strict liberal:    "We are moving very quickly to a free society, a free market  economy, and an open society. Therefore, we expect the same of  others who had the advantage that they did not have to live  under communism for 40 years. I mean opening up not only in the  field of economy but also in a wider sense."</p>

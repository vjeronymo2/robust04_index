			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Sheriff to Pounds 161,000 Sheriff Holdings, which serves the contracting and construction industries, slightly improved both turnover and profit in the six months ended March 31 1992. Sales were up Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4.7m and pre-tax profit rose Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 161,000. In the core plant business, hire turnover experienced a marginal downturn, whereas sales of minor equipment and cabins suffered more radically. Turnover was helped by a 3 1/2 month contribution from Abelson Plant, purchased last December for Pounds 2.55m. Since the purchase gearing had been reduced from 85 per cent to below 70 per cent. Earnings improved to 1.7p (1.5p). The interim dividend is lifted to 1p (0.75p).</p>

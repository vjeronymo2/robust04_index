According to Board  Chairman E. Nederkoorn, the company must cut its costs by 30  percent over the next three years, so as to become profitable  again in 1995. In addition to Fokker's own staff, which might  have to cope with as many as 1,000 layoffs, the suppliers will  feel the measures most.    Due to persistent problems in the aviation industry, Fokker  is forced to cut production and reduce the price of its  airplanes. Twelve important foreign suppliers will have to  assume part of the risk. Fokker's present risk-bearing  partners, the German DASA (bodies) and the North-Irish Shorts  (wings), will have to work for less, too. [passage omitted]    After this year's reconversion which resulted in 1,480  forced  layoffs, Fokker now has 10,000 employees. Two years ago, the  number of employees was still 13,000. In the company magazine  "Trimvlak," Nederkoorn says that "new and deep cuts will be  inevitable, both among workers and at the top." As to how many  jobs will be lost, the issue will only be decided in February,  when the commissioners will approve a plan. [passage omitted]    Nederkoorn argues that the slump in the aviation industry,  which started in 1990, is lasting longer than expected. "It is  unrealistic and dangerous to wait for miracles to happen on the  market," Nederkoorn says. "The market determines the price, and  the market can hardly pay our present sales prices."    Since last April Fokker has been part of Deutsche Aerospace  (DASA), which owns 51 percent of the shares. Fokker is having  most trouble selling its Fokker-50. Only seven orders have been  placed this year for this turboprop airplane, including the five  airplanes which will be ordered by the Scandinavian SAS this  week. Fokker does expect, however, that the Dutch Royal Air  Force will order four extended turboprops, the Fokker-60  transportation version, before the end of the current year.    Sales of the jet planes Fokker-100 and Fokker-70 -- the  short  version launched in June -- are going better. At the end of  this year, there will be no more unsold Fokker-100's at  Woensdrecht airport, while earlier this year, some 40 to 50  airplanes "were eating grass," as Fokker spokesman B. van Veen  put it. However, at the end of this year, 12 unsold Fokker-50's  will be waiting there.    After its slight 1992 profit, Fokker announced a 150-million  guilder loss for 1993. Over 90 million guilders are  attributable to the social scheme for the 1,480 layoffs.  Nederkoorn believes that 1994 will be "hard." However, the new  reorganization which has now been announced, should enable the  company to make "structural" profit from 1995 onwards.    Fokker is going to reduce its production from 100 airplanes  a  year to 55 or 60. This number is regarded as the strategic  minimum. The company will still remain the leading manufacturer  of jet planes with approximately 100 seats. Its market share is  now 32 percent, but should rise to 45 or 50 percent. In the  aircraft sector for 70-seaters, Fokker is the only manufacturer.  [passage omitted]</p>

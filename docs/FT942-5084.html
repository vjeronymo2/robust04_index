			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / 51% sale of El Al planned The Israeli government yesterday announced plans to sell off 51 per cent of shares in El Al, the national airline, by the end of the year, with the remaining 49 per cent to be disposed of at a later date. The shares will be sold in public offerings on the Tel Aviv stock exchange and markets abroad, presumably including New York, after the company is taken out of a 13-year receivership in October. Two teams of foreign and local experts are carrying out valuations of the airline, which has had a troubled financial history, but which officials say made net profits of about Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) last year on revenues in excess of Dollars 1bn. Official 1993 results have yet to be published. The El Al sale is the latest stage of a government privatisation drive, which includes the sale of government holdings in the country's main banks, intended to raise Dollars 1bn during this year. Mr Yisrael Kessar, Israeli transport minister, said yesterday the government intended to issue what he called a 'golden share' in El Al to the state, to protect vital interests. Thus, he said, the government would retain the right to order El Al to maintain flights to and from Israel even at times other airlines were not flying there. During the 1991 Gulf war, when Israel came under Iraqi Scud missile attack, El Al was the only airline to maintain its services to and from Israel. As a constant target of potential terrorist attack, El Al incurs Dollars 55m in annual security costs, 80 per cent of which are covered by the government. It is also limited by a ban on Sabbath flights, imposed under pressure from minor Orthodox Jewish political parties. Furthermore, the company is embroiled in a dispute with the US Department of Transportation, which has ordered it to cut back flights to and from New York because Israel has refused to authorise flights to Tel Aviv by World Airways.</p>

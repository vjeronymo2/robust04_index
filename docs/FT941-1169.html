			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Pounds 40m grant for London housing The government yesterday announced the allocation of Pounds 40m from its Estate Action programme to refurbish four council housing estates in London. Mr Tony Baldry, junior housing minister, told the Commons during a debate on inner cities that the funds would refurbish 3,500 houses and build 500 new ones. Mr Baldry also told MPs the vitality of urban life would be restored by revised planning guidelines sent to councils this week by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, which come close to banning retail developments on greenfield sites. Labour said the government had no strategy to deal with urban decay, which had spread across the country since 1979.</p>

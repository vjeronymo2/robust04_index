			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Mixed news at Forte - The Week Ahead Forte, the UK's leading hotels group, announces its full year results on Thursday. Profits generated on disposals will distort its headline figures, but underlying profits are expected to rise from Pounds 71m to between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m. Total trading profits are likely to slip from Pounds 200m to Pounds 190m because of the buy-out of the contract catering business, partly offset by a lower interest bill. Further asset write-downs are expected - following the previous year's Pounds 344m hit - but Forte's balance sheet is now much healthier thanks to disposals, including the Pounds 177m injection from the flotation of the Alpha Airports catering and duty free retailing business in February. Following the dividend cut last year, maintained payments of 7.5p are expected but are still unlikely to be covered by underlying earnings per share. Meanwhile the Savoy Hotel group, which includes the Connaught and Claridge's as well as the Savoy, is expected to report little better than break even when it announces its annual figures on Wednesday. That compares with a loss of Pounds 1.43m in 1992. The dividend on the A shares is expected to be held at 7p. Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 186m for 1993 on Monday, up from Pounds 179.6m a year ago. Trading has been tough in Germany, which accounts for about 20 per cent of group business, but recession in Europe should have been counterbalanced by more favourable conditions elsewhere. Following an enhanced scrip dividend at the interim stage, analysts think the final dividend could be lifted by more than 10 per cent. On Tuesday Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket group, is expected to announce a big fall in reported pre-tax profits for the year to February from Pounds 581m to between Pounds 435m and Pounds 445m. That reflects the impact of the group's decision - announced in January - to start depreciating stores, which will take Pounds 36m off reported profits, and land premiums, which will remove another Pounds 32m. There will also be a one-off write-down of Pounds 85m on land values. On the same accounting basis as last year, analysts believe profits would have increased to between Pounds 590m and Pounds 600m. Smiths Industries, the medical systems and aerospace components group, is expected to report increased interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 46.5m (Pounds 40.3m) on Wednesday. The improvement is thought to have been underpinned by strong sales by the medical division and contributions from recent acquisitions. Meanwhile the construction industry results season continues with annual figures from two of Britain's biggest building material groups. Blue Circle, the UK's largest cement group, is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 155m for 1993 when it reports on Thursday, compared with Pounds 93.8m in 1992. Progress at RMC, the world's largest concrete company, is thought to have been slower with profits of approaching Pounds 170m in 1993 not much higher than the Pounds 166.6m earned the previous year. RMC reports on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rural vote no longer true blue  -Tories face the erosion of support previously taken for granted / Farmers' Viewpoint BRITISH FARMERS do best under the Labour Party but can always be relied upon to vote Conservative. That, at least, has been the received wisdom of UK political parties as they have fought every general election since the second world war. It has meant that the Conservatives have not felt much need to court the farm vote because they perceived it was theirs anyway and that Labour has regarded time spent on farmers as a bit of a waste, since they were unlikely to persuade them to depart from established custom. Liberals, the Alliance, or the Liberal Democrats as they now call themselves, have sometimes been a threat to the other two parties in places like the wilder areas of Wales and Scotland and the East Anglian Fens but by-elections apart, have been of little consequence elsewhere. A survey commissioned by the magazine Big Farm Weekly recently, however, appears to indicate these rural traditions may be modified somewhat on April 9. Of the 500 or so farmers surveyed, 83 per cent said they had voted Conservative at the last election but only 63 per cent said they intended doing the same this time. In 1987 only 1 per cent had voted Labour; this time 6 per cent said they would do so. But the main beneficiaries of farmers' disillusionment with the Conservatives would seem to be the Liberal Democrats. Five years ago they received 13 per cent of the votes of the farmers surveyed; this time 26 per cent of them said they would vote for the centre party. The reasons for this apparent swing in farmer allegiance are not difficult to find. Over the course of the three Conservative administrations UK farm incomes have declined, in real terms, by more than 50 per cent and the net worth of the industry has fallen by a similar amount. Farmers, many of whom freely admit to usually making more profit under Labour, have always justified their electoral support for the Conservative party by pointing to its consistently lower levels of taxation on both income and capital. Falling incomes and a slump in the value of land over the last few years have meant that neither of these forms of taxation have recently been a significant factor in their lives. Moreover, the priority in many farmers' minds is to bring their incomes back to levels that will save their businesses from going bust. Farming's new floating voters presumably feel that any change of government would be to their advantage. But there is little in the manifestos of Labour or Liberal Democrats to justify that faith. Like the Conservatives, both other main parties are committed to the fundamental reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy. There are slight differences of emphasis but essentially all seek to cut the cost of agricultural support, to provide payments to enhance the environment, to reduce the intensity of farming methods and to force farmers to rely more on market forces than on guaranteed prices. In other words, on basic attitudes it looks like the mixture as before, whichever party or alliance of parties rules over us at the end of next week. Many of the agriculture-related plans disclosed in the manifestos are predictably geared more to the perceived demands of consumers of food than to those who produce it. The Liberal Democrats, for instance, say they would transfer responsibility for food standards from the Ministry of Agriculture to a new Food and Drugs Commission and that there would be much tighter labelling requirements for all foods. Labour would create a Food Standards Agency and replace the entire Ministry of Agriculture with a new Department of Food and Farming, the emphasis clearly being on food. Meanwhile, the Conservatives would press for the high standards of animal welfare already in force in the UK to be adopted across the rest of the European Community and, subject to EC agreement, offer financial encouragement for organic farming. In a clear attempt to attract the more traditional farming vote, the Labour Party has promised (although not in its manifesto) to reject the much criticised MacSharry plan for the reform of the CAP, to retain the UK marketing boards for milk and potatoes and to make no changes in farm tenancy laws. It may forfeit some of the support it might have derived from that quarter, however, by advocating public access to open mountain, moor and heath land and the opening of all footpaths across farmland. Labour has also promised to debate, yet again, the vexed question of hunting with dogs and to allow a free vote in the House of Commons. But they plan no new limitations on the much more popular country sports of fishing and shooting. The other two main parties are silent on such emotive matters but both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats say they would liberalise the laws on farm tenancies and introduce limited term agreements. Alongside the main problem of falling farm incomes, however, all these details are peripheral. As Mr David Curry, the former Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, conceded at the National Farmers' Union's annual meeting a few weeks ago, 90 per cent of all the decisions affecting UK farmers' incomes are taken in Brussels these days. Furthermore the outcome, if any, of current negotiations in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt will have far more real influence on British farm prices and profits than any policy likely to be adopted by any of the UK political parties. Add to this the fact that farmers and farmworkers now account for a mere 2 per cent of the British electorate and that they are spread over an enormous number of rural constituencies, and it is clear why large sectors of the industry feel impotent in the face of mounting difficulties. Indeed, as Big Farm Weekly suggested, there are only seven constituencies in which the farming vote might have a decisive effect on the selection of a member of parliament. They are Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, Lancashire West, Cambridgeshire North-east, Hereford, Pembroke, Devon North and Cornwall North. All are currently held by Conservatives; all have between 10 per cent and 25 per cent of their voting populations working in agriculture; and all are officially classified as marginal seats. A significant swing either towards Liberal Democrat or nationalist candidates would oust the sitting members. Who can tell in a situation in which a hung parliament has to be a distinct possibility what such a result might do to the balance of power? Perhaps the farmers in these constituencies at least have a bit more political clout than they realise.</p>

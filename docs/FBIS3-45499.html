			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji will resign from his post  as governor of the People's Bank of China at the next meeting of  the National People's Congress in March, according to sources in  the banking industry. Mr Zhu, who took over as head of the  central bank on July 2 last year, is expected to be succeeded by  People's Bank Deputy Governor Zhu Xiaohua. Bank sources said  the Vice-Premier was only appointed bank governor as an  emergency measure after the failure of the incumbent Li Guixian  to deal with the financial crisis which hit China in the first  half of 1993.    It was "perfectly normal" that Mr Zhu should give up the  post  and appoint a specialist full time head for the central bank  once the crisis had passed, they said. "Zhu Rongji as  Vice-Premier has a very broad range of responsibilities  concerning overall economic policy but being the governor of the  People's Bank is a very demanding job requiring a lot of  energy," a source said. "It is impossible for one man to do  both jobs for a long period of time, the demands are too great,"  he added. "The governor should be a specialist who can take on  the responsibility of managing the financial sector while Zhu  Rongji concentrates on the important task of directing overall  economic reform and development," he said.    Another reason given for the Vice Premier's imminent  retirement from the People's Bank is that the Government is  determined to give the country's central bank at least the  appearance of independence. A key element in the financial  reforms to be implemented this year is making the People's Bank  more autonomous from the central Government and as one source  pointed out, "You cannot have an independent central bank which  is governed by the Vice-Premier."    The man expected to take over as governor of the bank, Zhu  Xiaohua, is a former deputy head of the Shanghai People's Bank  who worked closely with Mr Zhu while he was mayor of Shanghai in  the late 1980s. He is widely admired both within the People's  Bank and the foreign banking community in China, as a highly  skilled and competent financial official who could carry out the  difficult and complex reforms which will have to be undertaken  if the institution is to become a genuine central bank as  recognised in the West. Zhu Xiaohua was appointed Deputy  Governor of the People's Bank after Zhu Rongji was made Vice  Premier in 1991 and became the economic czar's most trusted  adviser after he took over as head of the central bank last year.    With Zhu Xiaohua as governor of the People's Bank, sources  said, the Vice-Premier would feel comfortable the central bank  was being managed in accordance with his own economic policies.  But while Zhu Xiaohua is the Vice-Premier's choice as  successor, it is by no means certain the rest of the state  council will agree to his appointment. It is understood Zhu  Rongji still has a lot of lobbying to do before his man is  confirmed as the new governor of the People's Bank.</p>

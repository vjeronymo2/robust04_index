Dannemeyer, Dornan and  Rohrabacher -- were the subject Wednesday of the nationally syndicated  Washington column written by Jack Anderson and Dale Van Atta. . . . The three  "are beginning to make nuisances of themselves," the writers said. . . . "Their  specialty is moral outrage" and "their pushy style robs them of the credibility  it takes to wield power." And while they're popular at home, "the trio often  flops in Washington." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (1): Growth region ready for take-off - Commercial aircraft manufacturers expect the area to outperform other markets over the next 20 years, while defence contractors see it as their top growth area The aerospace industry is gathering en masse in Singapore next week for what promises to be the biggest Asian Aerospace show ever staged. Although the industry is still in a state of turmoil because of the financial losses of airlines and the deep defence cutbacks following the end of the cold war, interest in what has become the world's third largest international air show after Farnborough and Paris has continued to grow for two fundamental reasons. Commercial aircraft manufacturers expect the Asia-Pacific region to outperform every single other air transport market during the next 20 years. Boeing, the biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, forecasts that after the turn of the century the region will overtake the US as the world's largest commercial jet market with annual deliveries of new aircraft averaging Dollars 16bn from 2001 to 2010. Japan and China are set to become the two largest markets outside the US. And about 40 per cent of the future requirement for the new generation of large widebody aircraft now under development will come from the region. Defence contractors are also stepping up their export drive in Asia, especially at a time when defence sales to the Middle East appear to be peaking. Asia-Pacific has now become the only area in the world where the defence market is showing strong growth. That reflects the size, diversity and political volatility of the entire region, with its specific pockets of contention such as the Spratly Islands in the South China seas and its broader areas of tension and concern including North Korea, the overwhelming size of the Chinese armed forces, the military power of India and the potential military resurgence of Japan. Already by next year, British Aerospace, the UK defence contractor, which has traditionally relied very heavily on the Middle East for its exports, expects about 15 per cent of its defence sales to come from the region compared with 6 per cent last year. Asia-Pacific has also become the UK company's biggest export customer for Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft, with Indonesia alone placing last year a Pounds 500m order for Hawks. Competition for defence business has further intensified with increasing efforts by Russia to penetrate Asian markets. Malaysia last year became the first south-east Asian country to order Mig 29s from Russia. The strong demand for civil and defence aerospace equipment has opened a third related market in the region, providing the necessary aviation and military infrastructure to support the growth of air travel and defence sales. Without heavy investment in new airport capacity and modern air traffic control systems, the anticipated annual growth in air travel, which according to the European Airbus aircraft manufacturing consortium is likely to average around 8.6 per cent over each of the next 10 years, risks being clipped. 'The big problem for the future of civil aviation in the region is congestion at airports like Narita and Osaka in Japan, Hong Kong, and Bangkok, to name but four. If congestion grows, it will hold back growth. It is not a country issue nor a regional issue, but an international issue,' warns Mr Kim Cheung, a Boeing project director for market research. Infrastructure is an equally important component of defence sales. In some cases, the provision of military infrastructure and services can account for as much as and sometimes more than the value of the original export contract for military aircraft or other defence equipment. Overall, the potential market in Asia for civil and military infrastructure is likely to become as big as the market for aircraft themselves. The combination of this strong demand for civil and military aerospace equipment as well as the necessary infrastructure to support this growth has also encouraged the Asia-Pacific countries to invest in the development of indigenous aerospace industries. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan have all sought to expand their presence in the aerospace industry through increased collaboration with western airframe, aero-engine and components and systems manufacturers as well as through their own programmes. Established western aerospace groups have also been keen to seek new collaborations and joint ventures with Asian partners to strengthen their presence in the growing regional market for commercial and defence equipment. Interest has been particularly focused on China, the region's fastest growing market, where domestic air travel has been showing astonishing 30 per cent annual growth rates during the past few years. China's aviation industry has been growing at breakneck pace ever since the government eased regulatory controls in the 1980s. China was Boeing's largest single customer last year taking delivery of 47 aircraft. It has also been a big market for Airbus and the US McDonnell Douglas group. Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are all proposing close industrial co-operation projects with China, which is at the same time considering joining in a regional project to set up what has become known as the 'Asian Airbus'. This would involve collaboration modelled on the European Airbus partnership system between China, South Korea and India, and possibly other Asian partners to develop 50 or 100 seater regional aircraft. Indonesia is also exploring possibilities with British Aerospace to develop turbopropeller regional and commuter aircraft. However, BAe's efforts to form a regional jet joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace now appear to have collapsed. Although China is now outstripping all the other Asian countries in terms of growth, Japan is still expected to be the largest single customer outside the US for commercial aircraft despite the country's current economic difficulties. Since the beginning of jet travel, Japan has ordered more than 637 airliners worth about Dollars 44bn. Boeing expects the Japanese market will absorb another Dollars 60bn worth of airliners between now and 2010. Japanese aerospace companies have been working with Boeing for the past three decades and have become important suppliers to the US company. The big three Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, supply about 15 per cent of the value of the Boeing 767 airframe and about 20 per cent of the airframe for the 777, the new twin engine widebody that Boeing will roll out for the first time in April. However, Japanese aerospace ambitions suffered a setback this year when Boeing decided to put on ice plans to develop a new 150 seater aircraft, the 7J7, in which the Japanese companies intended to take a 25 per cent equity stake. Instead, Boeing has decided to develop a new version of its 737 family of narrowbody twin engine airliners. Negotiations are at present taking place between Boeing and the Japanese companies over their possible involvement in the new 737 programme. The Japanese companies have also been approached by the European Airbus consortium over possible collaboration on the development of a next generation superjumbo airliner capable of seating 600 to 800 passengers. The Airbus partners and Boeing are now studying the possibility of jointly developing a superjumbo aircraft which is expected eventually to involve collaboration with Asian manufacturers, especially the big three Japanese companies. Airbus considers the Asia-Pacific region as 'the major world collective force in determining requirements for the future development of even larger aircraft to match growth demand'. The European group says that Asia-Pacific airlines accounted for seven out of 10 carriers surveyed by the consortium on the possible development of an advanced technology superjumbo. The region is also regarded as one of the main markets for a future second generation supersonic airliner to replace Concorde in the next century. Leading aircraft manufacturers have teamed up to study a new future supersonic aircraft which would have double the range of Concorde and carry three times as many passengers. Although these projects are still very much at an early design stage, the development and production of a superjumbo and a new generation supersonic airliner represent the next big challenges for aerospace technology. Asia-Pacific will not only be the main market for these advanced airliners, but it is also likely to be very closely involved in the development of these ambitious and costly programmes.</p>

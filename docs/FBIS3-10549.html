			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the 3-80 Northern Front in Caulatu, </F> Quiulali, Nueva Segovia Department on 6 March; from the "Five  O'Clock Sharp" newscast]    [Text] After the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] General Command  and the 3-80 Northern Front staff met in Caulatu, Quilali  Municipality, Nueva Segovia Department, to assess the situation  of the RN demobilization and to accomplish complete RN unity,  the following was considered:    1. The 3-80 Northern Front is on its way to demobilization  and being reincorporated into the country's social and civic  life.    2. All RN leaders should be concerned about the desperate  plight of the RN demobilized.    3. At this very moment, our people are conducting a civic  protest through a hunger strike at the following radio stations:  Radio Corporacion, El Pensamiento, and Radio Catolica. The  government, however, has given no indications of desiring to  resolve this situation.    Therefore, we have decided the following:    1. We unconditionally support the fair demands of our  brothers on a hunger strike.    2. We strongly condemn the government's failure to give  any serious indications of willingness to talk with the  strikers' negotiating commission, a failure that could worsen  the situation or lead to the death of one of the strikers for  lack of food.    3. The 3-80 Northern Front has been incorporated into the  RN Higher Council, thus proclaiming tight RN unity.    [Issued] Caulatu, Quiulali, Nueva Segovia Department, at  1730  on 6 March 1994.    [Signed] Jose Angel Talavera, alias Commander Chacal, chief  of the 3-80 Northern Front staff; Alejandro Alcantara Sosa,  alias Commander Musul, Staff G-2; Jose Carvajal Espinales, alias  Commander Martin, chief of operations; Fremio Altamirano, alias  Commander Jimmy Leo, RN national president; Enrique Quinones,  alias Commander Josue, RN national vice president; Tomas David  Hernandez, alias Commander David, RN national secretary; Julio  Cesar Blandon, alias Commander Caliban, secretary for agrarian  affairs; Reynaldo Espinales Aguilera, alias Commander Holman,  member of the Higher Council; Pablo Abrena Escobeda, alias  Commander Colorado, member of the Higher Council.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: RUSSIA'S RULERS UNDER THE OLD REGIME BY DOMINIC LIEVEN  (YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $35; 407 PP.)  </P> <P> This meticulously researched book describes the Russian ruling elite in the  reign of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II. It seeks to answer the question: What  kind of men governed Russia in the Empire's last years? Dominic Lieven focuses  on the 215 men appointed to Nicholas' State Council, analyzing statistical  data, their education and careers and their ideas about politics.  </P> <P> Lieven discovers that one-third of the State Council members were "pure"  Russian aristocracy, with noble ancestors reaching into the 16th Century. At  the time of Peter the Great in the 17th Century, there was an influx of  foreigners into the government. Lieven traces the German ancestry of certain  members of the ruling elite by searching church records and discovering whose  family was Protestant and whose Russian Orthodox.  </P> <P> Having "attempted with due statistical solemnity to pin-point the social status  of all members of the State Council," Lieven recognizes the individual  differences within his group, and etches these with great clarity. He gives  personal anecdotes of State Council members: Semyonov once crawled on the  ground in full-dress senatorial uniform "in order to look at a painting by a  Dutch master from the best possible angle"; Andrei Saburov led a crusade to  rescue prostitutes; "Gramophone" Kokostov was so named because he loved the  sound of his own "loud, well-rounded phrases."  </P> <P> Education rather than class in the strict sense defined the ruling elite,  Lieven argues. The Romanovs founded both the Lycee and the School of Law  (reputedly where idle youths were sent), and retained close ties with these  schools, which produced many members of the ruling body. Young men were  expected to become fluent in French and while in the Lycee, all wore an  old-fashioned uniform with a tricorn hat and a sword symbolizing the  aristocracy.  </P> <P> Although he does not directly address the question of the elite's role in the  revolutionary period, Lieven offers a basis for understanding the men who were  unseated in the fall of the old regime. "In a way that was genuinely tragic,"  Lieven writes, "the higher the ideals, the humanity and the level of culture of  the members of the ruling elite, the further removed they were in many ways  from the demagogic techniques which might have made the mobilization of mass  support more feasible."  </P></p>

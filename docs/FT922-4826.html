			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: The bell tolls for a party traditionalist - Ivo Dawnay on Gerald Kaufman'sunhitching from Labour's wagon MR Gerald Kaufman is a politician whose greatest achievements have been in keeping fragile projects on the road - not least the survival of his party. Early in his 22-year parliamentary career he cajoled the New York authorities into allowing Concorde landing rights at Kennedy airport. Last year he sweet-talked the Labour party through the political minefield of the Gulf war while completing, as if by sleight of hand, the most difficult policy U-turn of all by bringing it back to a multilateralist nuclear policy. But yesterday the caustic, oddball shadow foreign secretary himself opted for the political lay-by of the backbenches - becoming, after Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr Roy Hattersley, the third of the party's heavyweights to unhitch his wagon from the party leadership. Only Mr John Smith now remains. His decision, along with a parallel one not to stay on the party's national executive to which he finally won election only last year, is another toll of the bell for the few Labour MPs who remember the evermore distant years of power. In part, it represents a job completed. After Mr Kinnock himself, Mr Kaufman's persistence made him one of the foremost players in the struggle to drag Labour back from the cul-de-sac it reached in the election defeat of 1983. Yesterday he claimed that his mood was one of 'celebration' not of depression. But he also conceded that the party's defeat on April 9 had been the greatest disappointment of his career. On the Saturday after polling, he related bitterly yesterday how he had toured his impoverished inner-city constituency of Manchester Gorton, confessing to voters that nothing would be done for them for the next four years. He believes that despite the 40-seat gains and other psephological crumbs of comfort the defeat had been 'ignominious.' At heart a traditionalist and firm believer in the 'one last heave' revival strategy, rather than any wide-ranging cultural change, he concedes that Labour must overcome a deep residual mistrust of the party - a by-product largely of what he saw as the Bennites' attempt in the early 1980s to mount a coup d'etat. For the seventh child of an immigrant Polish tailor, Mr Kaufman's career has been as successful as his party's has been a failure. Brought-up in respectable working-class Leeds, he graduated via the city's grammar school to Queen's College, Oxford. From the chairmanship of the Labour Club, he took up a career in political journalism, shifting over to Harold (now Lord) Wilson's staff in 1965. His ambition became apparent on his election in 1970, when he turned down the party leader's offer to act as his parliamentary private secretary on the grounds that it was time to be his own man. Four years later he emerged from the Labour victory as environment under-secretary to the late Tony Crosland, moving on to industry minister and then, after 1979, to shadow environment, the home office and, latterly, foreign affairs. With characteristic immodesty, Mr Kaufman made much yesterday of his personal triumphs - 12 times elected to the shadow cabinet, he is also the only Labour MP who has increased his majority at every election since 1970. But much of the respect he has commanded on Labour's backbenches has been won by the artful application of his acidic scorn to the Tories. Rare among Labour's liberal quasi-intellectuals, he also commanded loyalty and affection among the party rank and file. Yesterday, before contemplating with pleasure the prospect of having time to resume his love affair with the movies, Mr Kaufman claimed he had not sought power but 'the ability to do things'. At 61, and with no prospect of office for four years, he has now done, in a Tory phrase, the only decent thing remaining to him.</p>

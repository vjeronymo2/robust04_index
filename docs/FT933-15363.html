			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Spring prompts ministerial clash on Ulster BRITISH and Irish ministers clashed publicly over the future of Northern Ireland last night after the Irish government incensed unionist leaders with ideas floated for the province's future. In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments made in a newspaper interview by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed across the two communities in the province. But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative ideas then we may as well all give up.' He added that if 'round-table' talks on the province's future failed, then 'ultimately responsibility lies with governments and I think that the governments have to make that quite clear'. The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main political leaders that collapsed last November. Unionists say that they will not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on the north. Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't visualise this process failing and I'm certainly not planning for it failing or a course of action if it does.' However, Mr Spring has raised the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians and agreeing a new political framework for the province, possibility being put to referenda in north and south Ireland. Options could include joint authority or sovereignty of the province. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Patrick have firmly rejected such proposals and yesterday Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said Mr Spring's comments amounted to an 'incitement to take the paramilitary road'. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring also clashed over the exclusion order served on Mr John Matthews, who was cleared in court of an attempted bomb attack on Downing Street. In spite of attempts by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to defend the order, Mr Spring said he believed Britain should review the powers it has under the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S TOP S&amp;L ADVISER BLASTS THRIFTS ON CAPITAL ISSUE  </P> <P> The President's top adviser on savings and loan issues Tuesday blasted S&amp;Ls  that are lobbying to weaken financial standards for the industry, saying: "A  small group of thrifts wants to make billions of dollars in loans without a  dime backing them."  </P> <P> With the House beginning debate today on the S&amp;L rescue package, Richard  Breeden said rules regarding capital are "the key issue" and insisted that the  White House is not retreating from the strict standards in the version of the  bill approved by the House Banking Committee.  </P> <P> "First and foremost, it's a question of safety," Breeden, an assistant to the  President, said in an interview.  </P> <P> The House Banking Committee measure would require the owners of S&amp;Ls to  furnish $3 in cash to their institution for every $100 in loans it makes, a  safety margin designed to deter thrifts from making the kinds of risky  investments that produced the industry's current crisis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Restriction Now  </P> <P> Some thrifts have comparatively little cash invested by their owners. Instead,  they count as capital the value of goodwill -- the intangible worth of an  institution in addition to its cash and physical assets. Much of this goodwill  was obtained in recent years when healthy thrifts took over sick S&amp;Ls,  receiving certificates of supervisory goodwill from federal regulators.  </P> <P> Current rules provide a 3% capital standard without any restrictions on the  amount of goodwill that can be included. The S&amp;L industry as a whole has  about $15 billion to $18 billion in supervisory goodwill, which is now counted  along with cash as capital. The proposed capital standards would eventually  forbid the counting of goodwill, requiring the already hard-pressed industry to  raise billions of dollars in cash.  </P> <P> Thrifts dependent on goodwill have been lobbying Congress vigorously to be  permitted to keep counting the value of goodwill. These institutions "have  saved the taxpayers billions of dollars" by agreeing to acquire troubled  S&amp;Ls during the early 1980s, said Jared Cameron, spokesman for a lobbying  group, the Financial Assistance Inequity Relief Coalition.  </P> <P> "If they had not supplied a helping hand, the troubled institutions would have  been liquidated with taxpayers' money," Cameron said.  </P> <P> The federal S&amp;L insurance fund, which guarantees deposits up to $100,000,  did not have enough funds to close S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors, so federal  regulators fashioned complex deals, including promissory notes and goodwill  certificates, to attract healthy thrifts to buy ailing ones.  </P> <P> Thrifts that were active in these deals now say it would be unfair for the  government to force them to give up the use of goodwill.  </P> <P> Among the major S&amp;Ls dependent on goodwill -- and active in the campaign to  modify the House Banking Committee bill -- are Talman Home Federal Savings  &amp; Loan Assn. of Illinois, Chicago; Empire Federal Savings, Buffalo, N.Y.;  Anchor Savings Bank, New York; Merabank, Phoenix, and Seamen's Bank for  Savings, New York.  </P> <P> But Breeden, a key architect of the Administration's S&amp;L package, said  counting goodwill as capital is financially worthless, the "equivalent of cold  air."  </P> <P> Supporters of the House Banking Committee bill have been fearful the White  House is not providing sufficiently strong backing for the capital rules. But  Breeden insisted that the Administration is fighting hard. "The President has  spoken to members of the leadership and members of Congress, and he will  continue to be active," Breeden said. The overwhelming majority of the nation's  2,000 thrifts will be able to meet the new capital standards, he noted.  </P> <P> Tough standards are vital to prevent a recurrence of the current S&amp;L  crisis, a "national tragedy," Breeden said. The Administration's S&amp;Ls  package will cost an estimated $157 billion over the next 10 years, with the  funds used to close or sell hundreds of crippled thrift institutions and pay  off depositors.  </P> <P> In other thrift news Tuesday, a survey indicated that consumers are nervous  about the S&amp;L crisis.  </P> <P> "The people of California are experiencing the S&amp;L crisis first hand," said  Alex Sheshunoff, president of a financial information and consulting firm.  "Many have seen thrifts fail and, even with insurance, Californians are  concerned about their deposits," he said.  </P> <P> Although deposits are insured up to $100,000, about 37% of Californians  surveyed said they worry about losing money. By contrast, a national survey  disclosed a lesser fear factor, with 28% of Americans worried about the safety  of their deposits, according to the poll earlier this month by Sheshunoff  Information Services of Austin, Tex.  </P></p>

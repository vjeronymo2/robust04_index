			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (8): Bond with America's Big Three tightens - The parts business in the US is undergoing a transformation With the uncompromising courtesy that one might expect from a Japanese business executive, the head of international purchasing at Toyota came very close to reading the riot act to the company's US suppliers a few weeks ago. The official, Koichiro Noguchi, warned representatives of 124 component makers that Toyota had no plans to extend a commitment to increase purchases of US-made parts beyond 1996, when the voluntary agreement expires. The main problem, he said, was the sub-standard quality of their products. Despite intense political pressures, 'further growth in our US purchasing will depend on further gains by American suppliers in raising quality', Mr Noguchi warned. To a casual observer, such criticism would suggest that little has changed in the US component industry over the past five years. During a period when many sectors have made great strides in improving their international competitiveness, it would appear that the parts business stood still or even regressed. Poppycock, say analysts. In fact, the industry is in the throes of a radical transformation which has already paid off in handsome productivity gains, drastic price reductions and more reliable products across the board. The misleading impression given by Toyota only underlines the arm's length relationship it maintains with the US suppliers, analysts argue. 'If the Japanese car maker let the parts supplier be a full partner,' says Scott Merlis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, 'the quality would be fully built into the design. Any subsequent manufacturing problem could be quickly debugged with the help of the car maker.' Mr Merlis's observation cuts to the heart of the forces shaping the component industry. Analysts say a much tighter bond has developed between the Big Three US car makers and those suppliers that have survived a painful consolidation. In fact, the closer relationship between the two sides is the defining feature of the industry's evolution in the 1990s. As the decade began, Ford and Chrysler were determined to streamline their supply systems and slash the cost of components. The drive was part of a strategy to recapture market share from the Japanese. General Motors got off to a late start in 1992, when Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, then head of worldwide parts purchasing, moved to shake up GM's supply network with controversial - some might say heavy-handed - tactics. The most apparent result of these efforts is a drastic shrinkage of the supplier base. Over the past five years, the number of parts makers under contract has dropped by about a third to 2,000. By 2000, 20 per cent fewer suppliers are expected to be under contract with the Big Three. The main beneficiaries have been big, publicly-traded companies such as Eaton, Magna International and Hayes Wheels. In a highly fragmented business still dominated by small, privately held manufacturers, those well-capitalised suppliers with full research and development capabilities are expected to command 75 per cent of sales by 2,000, up from 50 per cent now. 'In most component areas, the industry is going to wind up with two or three big players, rather than 15,' says James Alexandre, the Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst. The reason is simple. The Big Three have decided to use fewer suppliers, often contracting with just one or two companies for any one part or system, such as suspensions or wheels. With more orders going to a handful of manufacturers, the lucky few have been able to achieve greater efficiencies and meet Detroit's demands for price reductions. Productivity gains have ranged from 2 to 6 per cent a year, while prices paid by the Big Three are falling 3 to 5 per cent. Detroit has rewarded suppliers which are able to deliver the goods cheaply with longer-term contracts. Five-year deals are now common in an industry which once worked on a year-to-year basis. The extended time frame has encouraged suppliers to take more risks in investing in new technology, which in turn has triggered a second shift  - towards more 'outsourcing'. The Big Three are using fewer parts made in-house because they lack capital to keep up with the latest innovations. To cut costs and improve quality, 'the car makers are going to the people who are the experts', says Mr Alexandre. Lear Seating, a Michigan-based company with Dollars 2bn in annual sales, highlights the trend. Its business has snowballed, as it became the sole source of Ford's seats, winning big supply deals with Chrysler, GM, BMW and other European producers along the way. In the case of Ford, the car maker in effect spurred consolidation while outsourcing its needs by agreeing last November to sell its own seat-manufacturing operation to Lear for Dollars 170m. The confluence of these forces should result in robust growth for the so-called Tier 1 suppliers in the coming years, even if car sales tamper off from their recent acceleration. Kemper Securities expects US vehicle sales to jump 9 per cent this year and a solid 6 per cent in 1995. However, revenues and earnings for the principal component makers are expected to outstrip those levels. Mr Merlis forecasts Lear's top-line growth at 40 per cent. For Eaton, a big, diversified group specialising in vehicle power-trains, a 25 per cent jump in 1994 revenues to Dollars 5.5bn is projected by the Value Line investment survey, following a 12 per cent advance the previous year. Meanwhile, Kemper Securities picks Automotive Industries, Dana, Simpson and Superior Industries as this year's high-flyers. Those companies are expected to realise strong gains in market share by acquiring rivals and winning more contracts. By turning more frequently to such companies, the Big Three have in effect allowed themselves to grow more dependent on their suppliers. The component makers are increasingly called on to deliver whole systems ready to be snapped into the car during assembly, which helps lower costs. The requirement, however, has forced the supplier to assume a role in the design process, rather than just bidding on a blueprint. Later, it must take a more active role in the assembly process, rather than simply delivering consignments to the factory gate. 'Improved quality is a by-product of this alliance, as parts can be more accurately designed on a product-specific basis with manufacturing requirements in mind,' writes Kemper in a recent investment advisory. That is not to say that US suppliers have achieved parity with their Japanese counterparts, though there are exceptions. Magna International, Canada's biggest parts company, is singled out by analysts as a producer of first-rate parts.</p>

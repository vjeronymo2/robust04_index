			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A great stir was created by President's Clinton's  alleged proposal yesterday that the armies of Hungary and the  other east-central European countries should carry out their  international military cooperation within the framework of the  so-called Partnership for Peace movement, and for the time being  they should not consider NATO as their future partner.  "Newsreel" first asked the opinion of [Defense Minister] Lajos  Fur.    [Begin Fur recording] A very important statement has been  attributed to President Clinton: NATO does not need Hungary and  the other east-central European countries. However, it is my  conviction that this is only a temporary political view. Sooner  or later Western Europe and the Atlantic countries must realize  that without creating and guaranteeing the security of  east-central Europe it is impossible to create general European  security. [end recording]    Does the Foreign Ministry consider the announcement  official?    [Begin recording] [Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman]  No, it is clear from news agency reports that this is a  newspaper's opinion. The United States has never said recently  that admission of this region's countries to NATO is expected in  the near future. It is obvious that this is a process and that  within this process, the NATO summit on 10 January in Brussels  is going to be a very important event.    We expect that the NATO summit will make it unequivocal: The  North Atlantic Alliance is an open organization, so the  countries that meet the requirements, in perspective, may become  members of the organization. A new initiative, the Partnership  for Peace program, has come about. We expect that the NATO  summit will open up and make this program accessible. Hungary  accepts the Partnership for Peace initiative and strives to fill  it with real content.    [Unidentified correspondent] However, the Partnership for  Peace means a lot less than the possible membership.    [Herman] Yes, it means less. We can clearly see that it does  not quite meet the expectations prevailing in the region and  also in Hungary. However, it is a step in the right direction,  and an important step at that, and we have no reason for not  hoping that other steps will follow in the future. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (5): Paris Pointers - A look ahead to autumn Shows are held the world over but Paris always seems to produce the best, the worst and the most extreme. Prettiest collection: Valentino - youthful, charming but womanly. One of the few older-generation designers with the right, light touch for now. Ugliest collection: Lagerfeld - swathes of harshly colour-mixed stretch nylon body-dresses do nothing to enhance wearable, well-cut jackets and coats. Most overworked collection: anything being filmed for Robert Altman's forthcoming frock-horror film, notably Lacroix, Rykiel and Dior. Over-elaborate clothes essential to prise attention away from the antics of the cast who look less like fashion people than film stars. Wittiest collection: a toss-up between Westwood, with her fur bikini and derriere-concealing tartan 'curtain', and Issey Miyake's serious pleats worn with hats made out of pasta, lampshades, dustbins etc. Most influential collection: John Galliano's 18 outfits mixed Japanese style with 1950s couture that could be the new direction designers are waiting for. Must-have accessory: the mineral-water holder made from Chanel gilt-chain and leather straps, a fine example of old-style Lagerfeld wit. Silliest accessory: a Chanel handbag in foot-long pastel fake fur, an example of new-style Lagerfeld desperation.</p>

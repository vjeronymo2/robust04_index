			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE MARKS ANNIVERSARY WITH MEXICAN FESTIVAL  </P> <P> It was hot and sticky Saturday at the Cinco de Mayo celebration sponsored by  the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, perfect weather for a nice cold  drink.  </P> <P> But Jered Standing was having trouble with the soda his mother had just bought  him.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I can drink with this thing," complained the 10-year-old boy,  referring to the still-wet plaster-of-Paris Mexican mask that a folk artist had  just created for him.  </P> <P> "Aaaah!" Standing said when artist Lonnie Miramontes gently pulled it off his  face.  </P> <P> All day long, children lined up to have their faces wrapped in gooey gauze.  </P> <P> And when the masks dried, they sat under a shade tree to paint them with  brilliant colors.  </P> <P> Miramontes said he hoped to share a little of Mexican culture with the  children.  </P> <P> In fact, that was one of the principal aims of the organizers of the Cinco de  Mayo festival, which was held to celebrate the college's 20th anniversary.  </P> <P> "We're really making an effort to bring these two cultures together," said Sue  Bozman, the college's spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Another purpose was to encourage Latinos to become familiar with the college.  </P> <P> "What we're really trying to do is outreach for the Mexican community," Bozman  said. "To let them know this is a place where they are welcome, where they can  have fun and learn."  </P> <P> Organizers estimated that 1,000 people would attend the daylong celebration  that included plenty of music, salsa, folk dancing and dramatic skits.  </P> <P> Among the guests were 200 migrant farm worker families.  </P> <P> It was clearly a day for children, who scampered from one event to another.  </P> <P> They made miniature pinatas out of paper bags and crepe paper, and shaped bowls  and vases from big mounds of clay.  </P> <P> And once the full-size pinatas appeared, the children all seemed to gravitate  toward the grassy clearing where the real action was.  </P> <P> When a boy bashed the head off a blue Cookie Monster pinata, bedlam broke out  as children scoured the grass for candy.  </P> <P> A new "musical sculpture," made by the college's welding students, was a big  hit with the kids.  </P> <P> When a child hit the large metal sculpture with a rod, it sounded like the  tinkling chimes in a bell tower.  </P> <P> Some adults preferred to escape the heat by slipping into an air-conditioned  building to look at an exhibit of 40 paintings by Mexican artists, sponsored by  the Mexican government.  </P> <P> Still others crowded around the messy soda booth where frantic volunteers were  unable to keep up with the demand.  </P> <P> But Angee Harrold, 21, another college student, said, "It's so hot out here I  can't stand it."  </P> <P> * OTHER CELEBRATIONS: B22  </P></p>

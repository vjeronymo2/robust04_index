			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> DEFT TOUR OF EXOTIC, UNEXPLORED WORLD;  </P> <P> DESIRE BY AMY WALLACE; HOUGHTON MIFFLIN $19.95, 223 PAGES  </P> <P> Frail, neurasthenic Lily Van Velsen is a gemologist who specializes in the  cutting of pearls, an exceedingly delicate art at which her great-uncle  Mordecai was the grand master. Now that even the most costly pearls are  cultured by introducing a bead into oysters' shells, pearl cutters are  virtually extinct; their services required only when a rare antique gem must be  matched.  </P> <P> By peeling away the multiple skins of a natural pearl layer by layer, these  highly trained experts can uncover a series of tints -- rose, green, blue,  cream -- each exquisite, but only a phase in the revelation of the hidden  pure-white globe.  </P> <P> One slip of the miniature tools, one minuscule step too far in the search for  perfection, and a magnificent pearl could dissolve into gray dust.  </P> <P> Pearl cutters learn to contemplate before they cut, visualizing what lies  beneath each successive color. Such recondite and fascinating lore has clearly  captured the imagination of author Amy Wallace, who uses it as the matrix of  "Desire," a novel as multilayered and mystical as the process itself.  </P> <P> Mordecai Van Velsen, the aristocratic semi-invalid old man who lives with his  equally ancient manservant, Chen Li, in a musty mansion in San Francisco's  Pacific Heights has retired from Van Velsen Jewelers. Now he devotes himself to  literature and philosophy, leaving the still-flourishing concern in the capable  hands of Alan Purdue, Lily Van Velsen's devoted but stolid fiance.  </P> <P> Orphaned in early childhood, Lily was brought up under the attentive  supervision of her great-uncle, growing even closer to him as she matured;  becoming his spiritual as well as his professional heir. She visits often,  never leaving without an armful of books selected -- actually assigned -- by  her great-uncle.  </P> <P> When the novel opens, her reading material includes transcripts of letters  written in 16th-Century France; fragments of Van Velsen family history. At that  time and in that place, a young woman who became pregnant by an unsuitable  young man was dispatched to a convent where she eventually went mad and died of  thwarted love and grief.  </P> <P> Thoroughly modern Lily is overcome by a psychic affinity for this tragic  creature, and on an otherwise routine errand for Van Velsen Jewelers, she  herself falls victim to a sexual obsession.  </P> <P> The object of her passion is an arrogant sculptor with the power to awaken  erotic desires never aroused by her gentle and affectionate fiance. Completely  unstrung by her enslavement to the sculptor, Lily is afflicted by symptoms  eerily similar to those of the 16th-Century French girl. In the throes of her  anguish, unable to eat, sleep or work, Lily trails her great-uncle's manservant  on his mysterious rounds of the city, finally to an opium den.  </P> <P> This discovery leads her to a bout of opium addiction, and eventually, by an  extremely circuitous route, to aspects of her great-uncle's history never  suspected. Along the way, we're regaled with Mordecai Van Velsen's adventures  as a young man, compelling in themselves and enlarging greatly our already  expanded knowledge of pearls, but doing little to give this ambitious novel the  cohesion it desperately needs.  </P> <P> Just at the point when the entire invention might shatter like an overly worked  pearl, a fragile connection is established.  </P> <P> Though the realistic scenes in contemporary San Francisco are only functional,  Amy Wallace is wonderfully adept at the far more demanding job of evoking the  atmosphere of medieval France, re-creating the remote world of pearl divers in  Ceylon, and imagining the atelier of the pearl maestro where Van Velsen learned  his skills.  </P> <P> There, in exotic and unexplored territory hundreds of years and thousands of  miles from Van Velsen's shop at Maiden Lane and Grant Avenue, the author is  truly at home.  </P> <P> Next: Carolyn See reviews "Splinters" by Erica Heller (William Morrow).  </P></p>

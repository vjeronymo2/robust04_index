			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Amado Gutierre, Colombian Council of State </F> president, by reporter Rodrigo Barrera; place not given; from  the "CMI Newscast"--live]    [Text] Attention: For the first time in Colombia's  history, the Council of State is advocating a political trial  against the president of the Republic on charges of contempt of  the Constitution. The Principal Court of Administrative  Disputes was not satisfied with President Gaviria's explanations  on the presence of U.S. military soldiers in Colombia. Rodrigo  Barrera is with the Council of State president now. Good  evening, Rodrigo.    [Barrera] Good evening. Council of State President Amado  Gutierre, what steps will the council take now that it presented  this charge against the president of the Republic?    [Gutierrez] We have nothing further to do. Our actions are  limited to sending our declaration to the Congressional  Investigation and Charges Commission [comision de investigacion  y acusacion de la honorable camara] and to the Attorney General.  It is for them to decide on this institution and on the  official [not further identified]. We cannot take any further  steps, because we do not know if the congressional commission  will decide to initiate a political process or if the attorney  general will open a disciplinary investigation. This refers to  the charges against the institution and the official.    [Barrera] According to the Council of State, there are  enough  merits to initiate a political trial, however. On what basis  was this decision made?    [Gutierrez] We simply stated the presence of foreign  military  troops, as well as foreign war aircraft and ships, in our  national territory does not conform to the Constitution and  violates our national sovereignty.    [Barrera] Thus, Congress has to take it from there?    [Gutierrez] The congressional commission has to decide now  whether it will open a political trial.    [Barrera] In his letter, the president has told the Council  of State the Defense Ministry had the autonomy to approve those  actions. Why was his argument unacceptable?    [Gutierrez] Because the end of that document states the  agreement was signed with the authorization of the respective  governments. It is understood that a government is the  president of the Republic and his ministers.    [Barrera] Stated differently, either the president has lied  to the Council of State or the minister has lied to the  president.    [Gutierrez] I cannot determine this; the commission will do  so once it studies our declaration, as well as the attorney  general if he decides to do so.</p>

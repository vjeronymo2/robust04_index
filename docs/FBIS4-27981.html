			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa will leave for South Korea next Saturday [11 June] for  bilateral talks expected to focus on the North Korean nuclear  issue, government sources said Monday.    The move follows Saturday's talks in Washington between  high-level officials of Japan, South Korea and the United  States, where it was decided to urge the U.N. Security Council  to consider possible sanctions against North Korea.    The sources said Kakizawa and South Korean Foreign Minister  Han Sung-chu would meet next weekend to discuss the prospect of  Security Council sanctions and of unilateral sanctions by the  three countries if the council fails to act.    Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference  earlier in the day that Japan wants to hold the foreign  ministerial meeting as early as possible, considering the  heightened tension relating to the issue of North Korea's  alleged nuclear weapons development program.    But he said Kakizawa and Han would be discussing a wide  range  of issues, in what will constitute a regular foreign ministerial  meeting.    The previous such meeting was held in September, when Han  visited Japan.    Meanwhile, Kakizawa, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai were scheduled to meet Monday  night to listen to a report from Shunji Yanai, director general  of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who represented  Japan at last weekend's trilateral talks.</p>

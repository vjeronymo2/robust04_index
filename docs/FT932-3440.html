			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Test for dollar FOREIGN exchange dealers will focus this week on data which will test whether the US is experiencing inflation at the current stage of the recovery, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks there has been a growing belief that inflation is set to rise in the US, a phenomenon which would force the Federal Reserve to raise short term interest rates. Last Friday, the May producer prices figure US showed that the rate of inflation was far smaller than had been anticipated, with the ex-food and energy figure up 0.2 per cent on the month. But the market will wait for the consumer price inflation figure for May, due out tomorrow, before giving its final verdict on US interest rate moves. The Michigan consumer confidence survey for June, which is due on Friday, will also show whether the PPI figure was a blip. After the onslaught that it has received in recent days, the near term outlook for the dollar against the yen will be affected by two sets of data this week. Thursday brings the April trade balance for the US which is set to show another deficit. DKB International predicts that this will be in the order of Dollars 8.5bn, following a deficit of Dollars 10.2bn for March. Even more important will be the Japanese trade balance for May. The yen rose strongly on the back of the April figure of Dollars 10.2bn, because the US is so keen to see Tokyo's trade surplus reduced. A strong surplus this time might have a similar effect, pushing the yen towards the Y100 level against the dollar. In Germany, the week's key data will be the M3 money supply figure for May, which is expected to show a slight dip. But, the Bundesbank is unlikely to ease monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday.</p>

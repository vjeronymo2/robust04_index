			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Equity indices On an optimistic reading of the economic cycle, this is an auspicious moment to launch an index of medium-sized companies. Having been roundly out-performed by the bigger FT-SE 100 stocks over the past three years, companies in the new Mid 250 index should recover the lost ground during an upswing. For one thing, the new index is weighted in favour of sectors such as engineering and construction which are geared to domestic recovery. Midcap stocks are also, on average, more heavily borrowed and stand to benefit particularly from lower short-term interest rates. Indeed, on most conventional valuations Mid 250 stocks look cheap: the index is trading on a multiple of around 13 times last years earnings, against 15 times for the market as a whole. The US experience, though, suggests medium-sized stocks are vulnerable to disenchantment even in the early stages of recovery. The Standard &amp; Poor's Midcap index outpaced the S&amp;P 500 during 1991 in anticipation of the turn, but has fallen behind this year. With this in mind, UK institutions may be wary of buying an index which contains a fair few troubled former FT-SE 100 stocks until there are clear signs of a domestic upturn. There is also a penalty in terms of higher trading costs. The average dealing spread for Mid 250 stocks is some 75 per cent higher than for FT-SE 100 shares. That said, there must be a fair chance that higher trading volume in mid-sized stocks will encourage tighter spreads.</p>

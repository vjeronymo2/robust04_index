			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the </F> House of Representatives and leader of the Yemeni Reform  Grouping, by Sulayman al-Nimr in Riyadh on 11 May]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Nimr] Do you believe that  the regime in Sanaa will continue the war, or will it accept  mediation and dialogue with 'Ali Salim al-Bid?    [Al-Ahmar] It is illogical to hold a dialogue with the gang  and the rebel leader. However, it is possible to hold a  dialogue with the Socialist Party as a party and with the  elements that are not bloodthirsty or rebellious, and with the  elements that did not drag the country into this situation. In  the end the Socialist Party is a political party, and we are  committed to democracy and pluralism. [passage omitted]    [Al-Nimr] It has been reported that Yemeni Reform Grouping  elements are fighting alongside northern forces against the  Socialist Party's forces.    [Al-Ahmar] The war is still a military war. No civilians  are taking part in it. The war is between the state and the  rebels.    [Al-Nimr] Do you believe that tribes could intervene in  favor of one party?    [Al-Ahmar] The tribes have not intervened so far, and we do  not want them to intervene at all. [passage omitted]    [Al-Nimr] Do you agree to a cease-fire now?    [Al-Ahmar] We did not start the war.    [Al-Nimr] If mediation is offered to secure a cease-fire,  will you accept it?    [Al-Ahmar] We will not turn down the mediation of any  fraternal or friendly state, provided it is based on the fact  that legitimacy cannot be harmed, democracy and unity cannot be  harmed, and that the Army is the state's army, so it is  impermissible for a section or a battalion of it to remain  rebellious or loyal to any power other than the state.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "dos": "Right-Wing Groupings and Personalities </F> Can Run on the Christian Democratic Movement Slate of  Candidates"]    [Text] Bratislava--At its meeting on 30 April the  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] Council authorized the KDH  Presidium to enter into negotiations with representatives of  right-wing groupings and personalities holding similar political  views about their possible participation in the fall  parliamentary elections on the KDH slate of candidates. In a  resolution, the KDH Council called this decision "a realistic  possibility of saving society from the threat of the onset of  political extremism." KDH Deputy Chairman Ivan Simko specified  that the KDH regards as right-wing groupings, to which the KDH  Council's decision might apply, the Democratic Party, the  National Democratic Party, the Party of Entrepreneurs and  Tradesmen, and representatives of the Standing Conference of the  Civic Institute. The KDH Council meeting also dealt with the  basic theses of the KDH election manifesto and the mechanism of  compiling slates of candidates.    [On the same day, on page 4, Bratislava SME in Slovak  carries  a 400-word Marian Bednar commentary entitled "Challenge." The  commentator views the decision of the KDH Council of 30 April as  an "unprecedented shift in the KDH's own way of thinking" and a  "major breakthrough" because "vague statements about the  integration of the right have assumed a far more specific  shape." He believes that the KDH's "specific offer" will be  accepted by "the followers of Cernak and Langos," by the former  in view of their poor performance in preelection polls and by  the latter because of "the nonexistence, following the demise of  the Civic Democratic Union, of a political entity with which  they would be ready to identify."]</p>

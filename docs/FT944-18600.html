			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Observer: Waste recycling Browning-Ferris Industries, the US waste services company, makes much of its aversion to waste. Waste of money and resources, that is. Chairman Bill Ruckleshaus boasts that pictures and pages have been eliminated from his company's annual report to save costs. His words have been taken so seriously that BFI has eliminated pages 17-33 of the report and instead reprinted Ruckleshaus's comments from pages 1-16 in full. Well, if it's worth saying once. . .</p>

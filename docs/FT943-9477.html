			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Carsberg urges crackdown on 'oppressive' sellers The law on consumer protection should be toughened to crack down on those who use oppressive tactics to sell goods or services to vulnerable people, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. He insisted also that the government's emphasis on deregulation should not be seen as a campaign to weaken ways of protecting the customer. 'Economic policy, including policy on competition and consumer protection, should be decided with the aim of achieving the greatest possible consumer well-being,' he said. The OFT's review of consumer credit was an example of how deregulation and consumer interests could coincide. Publishing the Office of Fair Trading's annual report, Sir Bryan expressed concern about the use of high-pressure techniques, such as those used to sell security systems to older people living alone. Powers for the director-general to take action against 'rogue traders' can be exercised only if the sales agents persist in unsuitable but lawful selling techniques. Sir Bryan said he had submitted proposals for reforming this area of the law to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, late last year. By highlighting the commitment in the Tory manifesto in 1992 to tighten the law on 'rogue traders' Sir Bryan increased pressure on the government to revise the legislation. Attempts to toughen this aspect of the law would face fierce competition from other legislation in the limited parliamentary time available for bills put forward by ministers. However it is the sort of relatively limited and uncontroversial proposal the government might suggest to a Tory MP who came high in the annual ballot for parliamentary time to discuss bills put forward by backbenchers. In terms of competition policy, Sir Bryan said he did not agree with every decision made by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, but would not specify where disagreements lay. Earlier this year the commission concluded that neither the supply of ice cream for immediate consumption nor the supply of recorded music operated against the public interest. Sir Bryan said it was the function of how the system worked - with the OFT carrying out a preliminary inquiry and then referring some issues to the commission for a fuller investigation - that there should be some cases where the commission found against the industry and some where the industry was cleared of acting against the public interest. Of the six reports published last year, two - relating to exhaust-gas analysing equipment and fine fragrances - were clearances. The 1993 annual report of the director-general of fair trading. HMSO.

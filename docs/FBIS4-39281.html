			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Postanogov report: "Tension on the Peninsula White </F> Hot"]    [Text] While ROK President Kim Yong-sam was receiving the  diploma and medal of honorary doctor of Moscow State University  in Moscow, ministry leaders in Seoul were preparing for action  in the emergency situation connected with the expected  declaration of international sanctions against the DPRK.    The conflict flared up over Pyongyang's reluctance to  renounce its nuclear ambitions and to satisfy the requirements  of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] concerning  inspection of a reactor producing plutonium suitable for the  production of nuclear weapons. The U.S. Administration is  holding intensive consultations with other states on this  problem. "We are taking a firm line," Bill Clinton stated  yesterday. "We are going to the UN Security Council with a  draft resolution on sanctions."    In response to these statements the DPRK leadership has  warned that any sanctions will be viewed as a "declaration of  war." This is what has forced its southern neighbor to take  "all measures necessary to give an immediate and decisive rebuff  in the event of any agression from the North." Incidentally,  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has stated that, if  necessary, the United States would be prepared to strengthen the  contingent of 38,000 troops already in South Korea.    The situation on the Korean peninsula has reached fever  pitch. The United States, it would appear, is attempting to put  together a coalition against the DPRK similar to the one that  George Bush organized during the Gulf War. However, it is  extremely doubtful that Clinton will manage to form a similar  "alliance," and he would risk triggering a second Korean war,  whose consequences would be catastrophic.    Moscow's stance in the current situation was spelled out in  the proposal put forward by Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin's suggestion that an international conference be called  to search for mutually acceptable solutions to this conflict.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Federalism argument must be confronted Sir, The timely letter from the chief economist of the Bank of Ireland (May 31) points out that the agenda for economic and monetary union in Europe is driven by political (especially federalist) aspirations which have little to do with economics. As those who promote federalism know perfectly well, economic union inevitably leads to political union. Just as a family loses its independence if its household budget is controlled by outsiders, so a nation loses its freedom of action if decisions about taxation, public expenditure and monetary policy are transferred to supranational institutions - in this case, European ones. The Maastricht Treaty ('Treaty on European Union') commits the EU to the creation of a single currency by 1999. That alone practically guarantees the development of a federal state and therefore a common European government. Can Britain remain 'at the heart of Europe' - to use the prime minister, John Major's phrase - without being pushed by these pressures down the road to political union? If Mr Major remains unwilling to put such an important constitutional issue to the people in a referendum, it is vital that he sets aside considerations of tactics and timing and starts to articulate a conceptually clear understanding of the arguments for national self-governance versus federalism. This debate should be open, honest and immediate. It should not be obscured by the party political battle for seats in the European Parliament which, in this context, is irrelevant.

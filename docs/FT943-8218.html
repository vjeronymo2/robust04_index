			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Utd Industries' director resigns United Industries, the precision tools and springs manufacturer, yesterday said Mr Alan Matthews, its finance director, was resigning as part of a management overhaul. His departure follows the retirement of Mr Ernest Hopwell, the group's longest-serving director, the appointment of Mr Brian Newman to head the springs division and the decision by Mr Malcolm Pye, company secretary, to stand down as a director. Mr Matthews has been replaced by Mr James Coleman, former finance director at B Elliott, the engineering group where he worked in the past with Mr Tom Brown, United's chief executive. Mr Matthews was on a one-year service contract and is expected to receive a 'relatively modest' pay-off. 'We have completed the board reorganisation and now have a strong management team,' said Mr Brown. 'We've been through a major transformation. Alan Matthews did a sterling job but I needed to build my own team.' That transformation was dominated by the Pounds 25m purchase this year of three engineering businesses from BBA.</p>

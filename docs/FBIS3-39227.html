These safety programs,  which are in the interests of both the local populations and of  West Europe, have led the Commission to commit ECU275 million  for a variety of projects including the sending of EU nuclear  experts on permanent on-site missions at six Russian and two  Ukrainian plants.    Since the beginning of this and other international  assistance programs, the question of liability in the case of  accidents has been an issue. Internationally the Paris and  Vienna Conventions deal with the question of liability by making  the country where the plants are located responsible in the case  of accidents. Neither Russia nor the Ukraine are members of  these conventions. In order to allow their safety programs to  move forward, the main international donors such as the EU and  the United States have negotiated arrangements to cover  liability with the Russian authorities.    For example, U.S. Vice President Gore reached an agreement  with the Russian authorities during his December 1993 visit to  Moscow. In the summer of 1993 the European Commission arranged  with the Russian authorities that Russia would accept liability  for all TACIS projects currently underway.    Therefore, contrary to press reports today, there is no  delay  in the projects which were launched in 1993. These are  proceeding according to plan. However, the current EU-Russia  arrangements do not cover the next stage in the program which  will include the supply and installation of hardware. Therefore  the Commission has been negotiating with the relevant  authorities in order to extend the areas for which they will be  responsible. The position of the Commission is that the Russian  authorities should accept liability for work carried out in  their plants since this is international practice and will  become the rule as soon as Russia and Ukraine join the Paris and  Vienna conventions. The Russian authorities are currently  considering a proposal tabled by the Commission in Moscow at the  beginning of February. This proposal was discussed yesterday  with the European industry.    The Commission is keeping in close contact with other  international donors such as the United States and the  multilateral nuclear safety fund set up on the initiative of the  G-7 in order to find an acceptable solution to this problem of  liability.</p>

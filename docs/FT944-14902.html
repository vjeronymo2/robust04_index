			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow in sharp climb on earnings reports Wall Street US stocks climbed sharply yesterday afternoon as more strong earnings news overshadowed fresh weakness in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. After showing a modest decline during the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 18.50 ahead at 3,936.04. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.62 at 470.28. On the NYSE, advances held a slim lead over declines. Volume was a fairly heavy 319.3m shares as program-guided trading helped to lift the level of activity. The Nasdaq composite strengthened 5.81 to 770.62 and the American SE composite was up 1.54 at 458.26. Early on, the market's attention was focused on August trade data released by the Commerce Department and its effect on the bond and currency markets. The report produced no big surprises. The US deficit in goods and services came in at Dollars 9.7bn, just about as economists had forecast. The figure represented a narrowing of the previous month's gap, revised up to Dollars 11.19bn. But a jump in Japanese imports was a disappointment. With the US trade deficit with Japan at Dollars 5.8bn, against Dollars 5.26bn a year earlier, the dollar lost a little more ground against the yen. The decline in turn reinforced a sour mood in the Treasury market, where a weaker greenback often diminishes the appeal of bonds. Against this backdrop, most stocks failed to make much progress during the morning. Just before 1pm, however, a broad range of issues began to rally, stirred by the fresh batch of encouraging quarterly results on offer. Technology stocks were especially strong. One of the big winners was Digital Equipment, up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 5/8 . It narrowed its fiscal first-quarter loss to 98 cents a share, from Dollars 1.14 a year earlier. The figure was better than a Dollars 1.32 deficit forecast by analysts. Compaq Computer was Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars 36 5/8 on heavy volume of 7.7m shares. The stock improved even though the company's third-quarter earnings were spot on expectations and its gross margins receded. IBM rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 75 3/8 in anticipation of its earnings, due out later in the week. In pharmaceuticals, Johnson &amp; Johnson climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 on news that it had beaten the consensus estimate by posting third-quarter profits of 82 cents a share. McDonnell-Douglas, the aerospace concern, moved ahead Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 127 1/4 after posting earnings per share of Dollars 4.07, about 17 per cent better than predicted. Its main US rival, Boeing, appreciated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44. A host of telecommunications companies released their results, but none of their stocks moved very much as a result. Bell Atlantic was up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 52 1/8, Pacific Telesis added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 31 and MCI was marked down Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 3/8 in Nasdaq trading. In financial services, North American Mortgage plummeted Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 19 1/2 . Mabon Securities lowered its rating on the stock after the company revealed a loss of 27 cents a share, against net income of 83 cents a year ago. Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, Amgen led technology stocks in a solid advance. The biotechnology concern jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 58 on its forecast of double-digit growth in sales and income next year.</p>

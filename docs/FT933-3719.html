			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Bitten by the Golden Lions - Nigel Andrews survives the film festival FOR THOSE in a state of advanced mental befuddlement this year, pink elephants have been replaced by golden lions. With prize night still two days off, we have been bombarded with the beasts. Steven Spielberg, breasting a sea of Jurassic Park mania, came to accept a career achievement Lion. On the same night Spielberg himself tried to present a special Lion to veteran director and Venice festival chief Gillo Pontecorvo. 'No, no, you keep it]' said Signor P, clearly suffering from lion confusion himself. And to top things off, the TV screens in the festival theatre lobby have been re-pumping endless footage of past Venice winners winning past Golden Lions. Lionitis is a notifiable cultural disease, so we critics have been comparing notes as to the likeliest victim on prize night. Robert Altman may draw the short paw for Short Cuts, his majestic three-hour fresco of Los Angeles life (reported on last week). Then again Maria Luisa Bemberg's Don't Talk About It, Rolf De Heer's Bad Boy Bubby and Krzystof Kieslowski's Blue have all been lionised by different segments of the festival audience. The Argentinian film comes from the lady who gave us Miss Mary and I, The Worst Of All: Bunuel-suave tales of sex, gnomic violence and religious dissidence. Drawn from a Magic Realist novel by Iulio Llinas, Don't Talk About It tells of dwarf girl Carlotta, her normal-height widowed mother who hopes to marry her off, and Marcello Mastroianni as a lovestruck charmer who keeps travelling round the world and back again before finally popping the question to the girl. This short/tall, May/December, wanderer/homebody romance is just one of the film's dotty charms. Bemberg draws a portrait of the little town as rich as a Marques story. Gossip is the main local industry, closely followed by social hypocrisy. When the Mayor dies in the middle of a wedding - that wedding - everyone pretends not to notice; and he is shoved into a bathful of ice-cubes afterwards so as not to spoil the party. Like an impossible wine the film goes its sweet, dry, intoxicating way towards an ending no less startling and funny for being utterly inevitable. Bad Boy Bubby from Australia takes Magic Realism and turns it into - let us register a new genre - Agit-Surrealism. Dutch-born writer-director Rolf De Heer has a nasty mind and wants to share it with us. His hero (Nicholas Hope) is an overgrown baby held hostage into his 20s by a large and lustful Mum. She keeps him at home (grey walls, cockroaches) right up to the day that Dad (dog collar, dirty beard) returns, encouraging the boy to kill them both with Clingwrap. Then it is out into the world with Hope, mixing his perceptual innocence and untutored morals with every dodgy group from a Salvation Army platoon via a grunge rock band to a cerebral palsy ward. Good taste? De Heer has never heard of it. Sex, murder, foul language and blasphemy are on tap, plus enough political incorrectness to set back the cause of group dogma by a century. For its first half-hour Bad Boy Bubby seems like one of those essays in onanistic outrage we expect from young directors. But it gathers its awful logic around it like a mudstained robe and by the close is dispensing a marvellous cauterising wit and wisdom. Blue is the latest film in the colour-fashion of the year. Britain's Derek Jarman has lent the title to Poland's Krszystof Kieslowski who goes to Paris to tell the tale of a young woman (Juliette Binoche) battling bereavement pains. Husband and daughter lost in car crash; ghosts from past and ghouls from future humming towards her; and a film that becomes an unforgettable series of still lives stirred to sinister movement, as 'everyday' objects and events turn into a danse macabre of the soul. The film opens soon in Britain. So do several of the myriad American movies that maestro Pontecorvo waved into Venice, using a baton that seems to have magical power over all of Hollywood. The VIPs glittered as they came: Harrison Ford, Tina Turner, Robert De Niro, Madonna, Woody Allen, Daniel Day-Lewis, Martin Scorsese, Spielberg . . . This is a struggling, underfunded film festival on the Adriatic? Gaze on your thrice-larger budget, Cannes, and despair. Many of the directors attended Venice's much-puffed Artist's Rights conference. This 48-hour thinkathon began with public speeches under Tiepolo ceilings, went private for a day and a half's commission work, then unveiled its resolutions in the Lido's Hotel De Bains (setting for Visconti's Death In Venice). One hundred and twenty world film-makers gathered, putting the event on a par with an Oscars ceremony. Result: the founding of a High Court For The Freedom Of Expression In Cinema And The Audio-Visual Arts (where but in Italy can one spirit up a high court at will?), several proposed GATT reformations and a mile-long paperchase of decrees and sub-decrees. Being sceptical about auteurs and auteurs' rights in a collaborative high-cost art like cinema, I look forward to dissecting this symposium later. Not here, nor now. Venice is in the madness of wind-up phase. We must mention the films that boasted, if not quality, large quantities of vitality or eccentricity. Jean-Luc Godard's Helas Pour Moi: hurling poetry, philosophy and jagged mise-en-scene at star Gerard Depardieu as we and he wander round scenic Lake Geneva. Clara Law's You Seng from Hong Kong: its 6th century battle scenes like painted scrolls come to life. Robert De Niro's directing debut A Bronx Tale: pouring doo-wop music over a catchy story of Italian-American boyhood. Dominic Sena's Kalifornia: a road-movie with murders, in which bad couple Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis get their kicks on Route 66. And Abel Ferrara's Snake Eyes: Harvey Keitel and Madonna rising (mostly) above a steamy-specious script about movie-making. There were also booby prize contenders. A Plastic Lion ex aequo should go to Joseph Kay and John Yorick's The Hollow Men, in which a terminal Euro-beach plays host to murky photography and ear-bashing alterations of Verdi music with existential dialogue, and to the portentous agonies of Joao Botelho's Here On Earth, 90 minutes of pained attitudinising in which Munch's 'The Scream' seems to have visited Portugal and bitten the whole country. Disappointing also were two films from well-loved veterans, Ermanno Olmi's The Secret Of The Old Wood and Eric Rohmer's The Tree, The Mayor And The Cultural Centre. Olmi's film is a green fable about an endangered forest, full of talking animals and Disneyish whimsy. Rohmer's film is a Green fable about local politics and Euro-environmentalism: as thrilling as a Party Political Broadcast by Jonathan Porritt in French. The Lion looks on all these candidates and sharpens its claws. But Venice is not just about 'Who wins?' Every year it conjures variety and inquiry, sideshows and seminars, from a budget that was never large and is getting smaller. This year we had retrospectives (a look back at 1943 in world cinema); discussion events ('Music and Cinema' with Ennio Morricone, 'Opera and Cinema' with Riccardo Muti); documentaries and video programmes (including Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's brilliant TV series on DW Griffith); and the Artists' Rights think-in. Sometimes at Venice the critic feels as if he has gone back to school again. But in a festival as multi-faceted as this, and as unapologetic about shaking hands with Hollywood, there are as many school treats as school trials.</p>

As of March 20, the Korean Silk Association had carried out  its first quarterly plan at 101.2 percent. Setting itself the  goal of fulfilling its plan for the first half of the year ahead  of time, it is producing more silk yarn and textile than  envisaged in the daily plan.    The Taegak mine, the Unsan forestry station and the Kumchon  disabled soldiers daily necessaries factory hit their first  quarterly targets more than one month ahead of schedule. They  had overfulfilled their daily quotas through an extensive  movement for increased production from the beginning of the year.    Notably, the October 13 youth smeltery has brought an  unprecedented upswing in production by actively introducing new  technology and advanced work methods into production, topping  its first quarterly assignment 35.7 percent on February 15.    First quarterly assignments have been fulfilled far ahead of  schedule by many other units including the May 24 export fishery  station, the Chiktong geological survey team and Unjon, Yonan,  Paechon and Haeju youth railway stations.</p>

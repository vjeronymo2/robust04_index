			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Suman Chattopadhya] </F>   [Text] The Rao-Clinton joint news conference just  concluded. When all of us were coming down the stairs of the  White House after the conference, a young journalist from  Gujarat, who was a member of the prime minister's entourage,  loudly told a senior journalist from THE WASHINGTON POST, "Had  this been our country then at least for the sake of courtesy, we  would have asked your president some questions, but you have  insulted our prime minister by not asking him any questions."  The American journalist was not at all offended by this remark.  He smiled and softly told the youth to come with his prime  minister when he visits the White House after five years. He  then added that at that time, you will not find us as  indifferent.    This spontaneous anger of the unexperienced Indian  journalist  was 100 percent genuine. It is really difficult for  professional Indian journalists to tolerate the disregard shown  toward their prime minister by American journalists. This  proves that American journalists do not give any importance to  the country where about one sixth of the total world population  lives.    Rajiv Gandhi was able to create a lot of enthusiasm in the  U.S. media during his first visit to the United States in 1985,  but Narasimha Rao failed to generate even a fraction of that  enthusiasm. The major U.S. newspapers gave wide coverage to the  press conference which was addressed by Rajiv Gandhi at the  National Press Club in Washington. This time, the newspapers  thought it a waste to spare space to cover Rao. During Rajiv  Gandhi's visit, THE NEW YORK TIMES criticized the Reagan  administration for trying to impress Gandhi by showing robots to  him. The newspaper said "India must be reckoned with in deeper  terms than by displaying robots or space capsules to as  sophisticated a man as Rajiv Gandhi." This time, due to the  request made by the Indian Embassy, only THE WASHINGTON POST  agreed to write a short report on Rao's visit. It wrote: "A  small bald figure in a Congress Party grey suit, a man with a  shy manner and a low voice, a man who is a total stranger to the  (?sound bite) [as published], the Indian prime minister is not  easily recognizable as a politician." It is unfortunate for the  senior, learned, and experienced prime minister of India that  popular television networks like NBC or ABC did not feel it  necessary to give even one minute's coverage to him.    Did Rao really deserve the neglect which was shown him by  the  U.S. media? Rajiv Gandhi was able to attract American  journalists due to his amiable disposition, westernized outlook,  and alluring personality. Rao had something valuable in his  pocket which the Americans should have been attracted to, that  is, a market economy. The media did not give much importance to  Narasimha Rao this time as they are not very aware of the  developments which are taking place in the Indian subcontinent.  Despite this, there is no denying the fact that India will soon  become very important to the U.S. media just as China has  become. The Clinton administration was reluctant to give most  favored nation treatment to Beijing as its human rights record  was not satisfactory. This enraged the U.S. media. The U.S.  media is of the opinion that nothing should be done which would  hamper bilateral trade ties with China.    Americans continuously shed tears for the cause of  democracy,  but why is the U.S. media so keen to keep the communist  dictators of Beijing happy. This is so because their only  objective is trade. If Beijing does not get most favored nation  status due to the rashness of Clinton, then U.S. industrialists  will be affected and the interests of the country will be  hampered. Their main objective is to protect the economic  interests of the United States. It should be achieved at any  cost even if it is necessary to renounce the country's policies.  It has been observed that Beijing did not make any special  efforts to secure most favored nation status. The industrial  corporations and the U.S. media are working together to protect  the interests of the Chinese leaders, Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng.    India will also be able to acquire this importance after  the United States becomes involved in its market. The first and  foremost requirement is to attract U.S. capital. During his  visit to the United States, to some extent Narasimha Rao has  been able to attract U.S. businessmen to India. This is the  most significant aspect of his visit to that country. These  people were able to realize the amount of profit they can make  by investing in India. It is true they have been impressed by  the reform measures initiated by Rao and Manmohan. U.S.  businessmen have started realizing that this country of hermits  and snake charmers have a middle class population of about 200  million people, who have great purchasing power. There was no  one in the United States to speak in favor of India in the past.  At present, a lobby of industrialists has been formed in favor  of India. Some key persons of giant U.S. corporations have also  joined this group. A new horizon of prospects has been created  in front of their eyes -- the largest free market of the 21st  century.    Their eagerness towards this country is new and it must be  admitted that India will gain from it. The first benefit is  economic. This is because India is desperately in need of  foreign capital, particularly in the sphere of infrastructure.  The second gain is political. Due to growing U.S. interests in  India, other sensitive political issues like Kashmir and the  nonproliferation issue will gradually lose significance.  President Clinton and his colleagues did not make any attempt  to embarrass Rao on these issues during his recent visit. The  main reason behind this is pressure from industrialists. If the  United States remains passive on these issues, then Islamabad  will have to suffer. In fact, it is the intention of India to  blunt the sharp mouth of Islamabad.    To sum up, it may be said that in this post Cold War era, it  is essential to improve ties with the United States. It is  necessary to play the economic card well to establish this  relationship. Narasimha Rao's visit has created prospects for  the establishment of friendly relations between the two  countries. This relationship will be further strengthened if  the pledges given by Rao and Manmohan regarding economic reforms  are speedily implemented. Once capital is invested in this  country, then it is bound to influence the White House and the  U.S. media. After this, if the Indian prime minister goes to  address a joint news conference with the U.S. president, then  all cameras will be focussed on the Indian prime minister. This  will fulfill the predictions made by the American journalist to  the Gujarati youth.</p>

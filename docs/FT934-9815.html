			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: CrossRail support vital Sir, I was most concerned to read in your article 'Clarke wins battle over spending' (November 2) that 'among the projects facing delay or cancellation were the London CrossRail link and the Channel tunnel rail link'. The government's innovative approach towards attracting private sector finance into public sector projects loses credibility with every swing of the pendulum. Potential investors cannot be expected to express an interest in such major projects as CrossRail while this stop-go cycle continues. We support the principle of private sector investment; within the current financial constraints the government's imaginative search for workable solutions to develop major infrastructure projects is applauded by business. Since the Central London Rail Study of 1989 the London Chamber has consistently campaigned for CrossRail as an essential tenet of London's transport network serving business commuters, the tourist industry, and the indigenous community. Recent independent reports suggest the project would lead to the creation of about 60,000 jobs in central London, a boost which Britain's capital urgently needs as the recovery is not yet assured, and the illogical political compromise over the sighting of the European Monetary Institute requires a renewed government commitment to London's future. We would urge the government to confirm its complete commitment to CrossRail; the result in terms of investor confidence and the government's credibility in the eyes of London's business community of further delays would be seriously damaging. Simon G Sperryn, London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 33 Queen Street, London EC4R 1AP</p>

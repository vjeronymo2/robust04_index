			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / London to lure back investment A drive to attract more manufacturing investment to greater London was launched yesterday by Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, in a move that marks the first concerted attempt to reverse the decline of the capital as a manufacturing centre. The greater London manufacturing workforce has dropped from more than 800,000 in the early 1970s to 300,000. This is just 11 per cent of the area's total workforce, compared with a nationwide figure of 20 per cent. Mr Eggar's initiative also aims to ensure existing manufacturers get the best deal from central and local government. It comes a day after Samsung, the Korean industrial group, announced plans to build a Pounds 450m manufacturing plant in the north-east of England, eventually creating 3,000 jobs. He said this showed how development agencies, local authorities and Training and Enterprise Councils elsewhere in the UK were working effectively with government to attract new manufacturers. 'Other regions of the UK are old hands at this,' he told the parliamentary manufacturing industry group. Mr Eggar, MP for Enfield North, said London could not escape blame for undervaluing its manufacturing sector. 'The false stereotype of the London businessman with his pinstriped suit and bowler hat has been equally misleadingly replaced by the image of a young man with red braces wheeler-dealing in front of an exchange room computer screen,' he said. An anti-manufacturing culture had been perpetuated. Companies faced with the opportunity to expand had found it easier to move elsewhere rather than work through the issues with their local workforce, local authorities and government. Mr Eggar said the government could not prescribe a recipe for success. Instead, central government, local authorities, agencies such as the London First forum and companies needed to work together to ensure that London thrived as a base for manufacturing. As a first step, he plans to bring together some of the capital's most important manufacturers to agree priorities for action. But he identified three key issues which he said London needed to address urgently: TECs must ensure that the skills of London's workforce match industry's needs. Boroughs need a proactive programme to nurture manufacturing industry. Local business organisations need to foster supply chains and ensure that the new London Business Links organisation gives clients a better advisory service than is now available.</p>

Dr. Stigum's report includes an analysis of, and conclusions regarding, each of the CNA Transactions, and she represents that her findings on each transaction demonstrate that each of the CNA Transactions was consummated at fair market value, which she defines as ``a price (rate) at which a willing seller would have sold to a willing buyer, neither being under any compulsion to sell or buy.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In her report, Dr. Stigum explains that her determinations of the fair market values of the commercial paper involved in the CNA Transactions were based on comparisons with LIBOR rates <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , because time-series data on short-term commercial paper rates are not available, and short-term commercial paper was traded during the relevant period at a relatively constant spread to LIBOR rates, on which accurate time-series data are readily available. She states that over the time period of the CNA Transactions, commercial paper for different maturities consistently traded at a spread below LIBOR rates for Eurodollar deposits having those same maturities. Accordingly, for each CNA Transaction, Dr. Stigum presented and compared actual CNA Transactions data with two LIBOR yield curves: (1) For the week of the initial purchase of the commercial paper; and (2) for the week of the subsequent sale or purchase of such paper. She states that her determinations were also influenced by her awareness that the rates at which secondary trades of commercial paper may be effected through a dealer depend on the name and rating of the issuer, the rates that the issuer is posting, and the precise time of day at which the secondary trade is made. On the basis of these factors, Dr. Stigum represents that she has judged the prices (rates) involved in the CNA Transactions to be fair market prices if they fell within a range of five basis points above or below the rate that the data indicated to be a fair market rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate for Eurodollar deposits. Dr. Stigum represents that banks post, each day, a number of different LIBOR rates, one for each maturity in which they are bidding for funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The Applicants represent that since discovery of the CNA Transactions in May and June 1993, they have undertaken efforts to prevent any recurrence of direct or indirect transactions between the Trust and the CNA Companies. The Applicants state that three full-time attorneys were appointed to review all proposed CNA intercompany trades of commercial paper, to detect any proposed transactions involving the Trust. Additionally, a memorandum describing the prohibitions of the Act was distributed to all personnel involved in commercial paper transactions on behalf of the Trust, the receipt of which was acknowledged in writing. The Applicants state that this memorandum will be recirculated annually to all such investment personnel. The Applicants represent that personnel involved in the Trust's commercial paper transactions have been directed to develop a ``real-time'' trading audit computer program which would interdict proposed party-in-interest transactions before the trade can be accomplished. Furthermore, Assurance has entered into an investment management agreement with Harris Investment Management, Inc. (Harris), under which Harris manages all the Trust's commercial paper investments and approves all the Trust's commercial paper transactions, in order to prevent any transactions involving parties related to the Trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In summary, the Applicants represent that the CNA Transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) The prices at which the Trust sold commercial paper were not less than the paper's fair market value, and the prices at which the Trust purchased commercial paper were not in excess of the paper's fair market value; (b) The transactions resulted from actions customarily taken by the Traders in effecting commercial paper transactions; (c) The transactions involved a very small percentage of the Trust's total commercial paper transactions for 1992; and (d) The Applicants have undertaken efforts to prevent any recurrence of direct or indirect transactions involving the Trust and the CNA Companies, including the appointment of Harris as an independent investment manager of all the Trust's commercial paper investments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ronald Willett of the Department (202) 219&hyph;8881.

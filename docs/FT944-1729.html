			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Rapid growth for voicemail Love it or loath it, voicemail, the business equivalent of the domestic telephone answering machine, is here to stay. According to Dataquest, the marketing consultancy, the UK market alone for voicemail and voicemail products was worth Dollars 163.1m in 1993, a growth rate of approximately 55 per cent in one year. A recent survey carried out for Octel Communications, a designer and manufacturer of voicemail products, suggests that some 38 per cent of the UK's larger companies now have voice processing systems installed, with manufacturing industry the most enthusiastic. Financial services companies, however, seem the most satisfied, with almost three-quarters of those surveyed reporting improved customer service. Management, however, tended to be unenthusiastic about voicemail until after installation. 'Initial resistance,' the survey said, 'seems to be linked with a sense that the company may be losing its human face.' Indeed, a major disadvantage detected was that some staff hide behind voicemail either to avoid answering calls or to camouflage absence. The principal errors that management makes in installing new technology  - failure to train staff adequately, or to measure response - were very evident in voicemail. Michael Persky, Octel's marketing director, said: 'Only 59 per cent of companies installing voicemail make training for users compulsory. This should be 100 per cent if organisations are to maximise their investment.' Can it be only a matter of time before European companies follow the lead of their US contemporaries and appoint 'voicemail police' to check that colleagues are changing their greetings regularly and listening to their mail? *Getting the Message: trends in Voice Processing, Pounds 25 from Firefly Communications, 071-381 4505.</p>

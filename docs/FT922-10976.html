			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Deflating German hopes It is tempting to conclude after yesterday that the German government's grip on the economy is faltering. Two senior ministers resigned; the Kohl administration came under heavy attack from other industrial countries for its lax fiscal policy and excessive interest rates; the country was hit by a wave of strikes from public sector workers. That would normally be enough to inject a note of nervousness into financial markets, but - after an initial wobble - the DAX finished only marginally lower and the 10-year government bond future actually rose. Granted, the resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher after 18 years as foreign minister has little relevance for the markets. Nor should the strikes have any relevance, as long as they are over quickly: indeed, they reveal a government so far determined to avoid fanning the inflationary fire through high wage settlements. Yet the markets may be drawing too much solace from optimistic comments on inflation made by both Chancellor Kohl and Dr Otmar Issing of the Bundesbank. It will take more than that to open the door to lower interest rates. The Bundesbank council would be reluctant to ease while money supply is growing at nearly 10 per cent, especially since the economy still has some life left. Whatever the daily news distractions, the basic danger is still the same - that the present policy mix will lead to prolonged stagflation. That would be positive neither for German financial markets nor for those of its European partners. A little more action and fewer promises on the budget deficit would be more convincing.</p>

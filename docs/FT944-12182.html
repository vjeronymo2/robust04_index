			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Demand for UB Food manufacturer United Biscuits advanced 9 to 315p as SG Warburg sent a note to clients arguing that the shares had fallen too far. The house sector specialists said the stock was at a five-year relative yield high and price low and commented: 'We continue to regard United Biscuits as one of the best recovery stocks in the sector.' Other analysts cited a return of bid speculation which has been touching the company for some time. UB is seen as being one of the only UK food manufacturers with enough overseas interests to attract one of the big international players.</p>

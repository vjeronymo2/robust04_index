			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Obituary of Jocelyn Hambro: Innovative merchant banker and dauntless risk taker Jocelyn Hambro MC, of Hambros Bank and JO Hambro, died on Sunday aged 75. His death ends the era of merchant bankers based in a family bank and prepared to take risks in all areas of investment. He once said: 'Merchant bankers aren't supposed to be conventional bankers; merchant bankers are supposed to be risk takers, as opposed to joint stock (clearing) bankers who rarely take a risk and still manage to lose money.' Jocelyn Olaf Hambro was born on March 7 1919 in Upper Brook Street, London. His father Olaf was a director of Hambros Bank and chairman from 1932 to 1960. His mother Winifred (nee Martin-Smith) - who drowned in a boating accident on Loch Ness in August 1932 - was also from a banking family. Jocelyn was sent to Summerfields and then to Eton. At Eton he was a capable student and developed his taste for horse racing, at one time becoming the school bookmaker. In 1936 he went to Heidelberg to study languages before going to Trinity College, Cambridge. In August 1944, having landed with the Coldstream Guards in Normandy, he was wounded by a British shell. Both legs were severely damaged: the right was saved but the left was amputated. In 1945 he joined Hambros Bank in Bishopsgate. He was sent to America to promote UK exports. After a spell with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, he travelled extensively selling franchises for MG cars and setting up the Hambro Automotive Corporation in 1947, with sales of Pounds 61,000 growing to Pounds 90m by 1960. Throughout the 1950s, as a director of Hambros, he gathered expertise in loans, flotations and public offerings. But in 1959 the bank faced a crisis of identity as Hambros lost the fight with Warburgs for British Aluminium in the 'Aluminium War' which set the 'gentlemen' merchant bankers against the new 'players'. Jocelyn Hambro learned from this, and as director and chairman of the bank (1965-1972) aggressively developed the bank's investment and corporate finance capacity. He initiated the Eurobond and Eurodollar market with a Eurodollar bond for Norges Kommunalbank in January 1963. The market grew with Hambros, SG Warburg and NM Rothschild as leaders. In 1968 Hambros formed the first consortium bank in London. In 1970 he founded Hambro Life - the unit-based life assurance company  - with Mark Weinberg and his team from Abbey Life. By 1975 Hambro Life assets were Pounds 335m, and in 1976 the bank sold its share to cover losses on Norwegian tanker loans after the oil crisis of the early 1970s. Jocelyn Hambro was a diverse merchant banker: he developed the bank's direct investment and venture capital divisions; maintained an interest in diamond and bullion broking through I. Hennig &amp; Co and Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid; in mining though his directorship of Charter Consolidated; and in insurance through his directorship of Phoenix Assurance (1952-77) and his chairmanship from 1978. In 1986 after 14 years as chairman and president of Hambros plc, Jocelyn Hambro, with his three sons, Rupert, Richard and James, decided to leave the family bank to set up the investment house JO Hambro. They sold their shares in Hambro Trust, which controlled Hambros plc. In business, Jocelyn Hambro was a calm, discreet man with a dry wit. He welcomed new ideas and fitted them to old traditions. He had capacity and vision to take risks and explore new forms of investment. He was a supporter of several charities, including Henry Smith's charity, for which he was chairman from 1978 to 1990. He also supported the Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund and the Britta Dolan Memorial Cancer Fund. His first wife, Silvia Muir, and his second wife, the Duchess of Roxburghe (who was chairman of The Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund for 25 years) both died of cancer. He established the National Cancer Day Society in 1967 and the Hambro Businessman of the Year Lunch in 1969. He leaves a wife, Margaret, and three sons from his first marriage. Andrew St George is the author of JOH, the privately printed biography of Jocelyn Hambro.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10TH TRY THE CHARM AS TITAN 3 BLASTS OFF;  </P> <P> SPACE: LAUNCH FOLLOWS 9 POSTPONEMENTS. IT'S THE DEBUT OF A SECOND PRIVATE U.S.  FIRM HAULING PAYLOADS INTO SPACE FOR A FEE.  </P> <P> A Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese communications satellites roared  into space Sunday night after nine postponements as Martin Marietta Corp.  entered the commercial launch business.  </P> <P> The 155-foot-tall booster blasted away from its launch pad at the Cape  Canaveral Air Force Station at 7:07 p.m. and gave thousands of spectators a  dazzling New Year's Eve show, brilliantly lighting the night sky as it climbed  toward orbit.  </P> <P> "Everything looks good," mission commentator Bob Gordon reported as the rocket  sped into space. Twenty minutes after liftoff mission director Vic Whitehead  reported the Titan 3 upper stage carrying the satellites had achieved a  successful orbit ranging from 117 to 437 miles high.  </P> <P> The Titan got away on its 10th attempt. Originally set for Dec. 7, the launch  was delayed once by a technical problem and eight times by strong, high  altitude winds. The wind was no problem Sunday night and the countdown  proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff.  </P> <P> Packed in the nose cone of the most powerful U.S. commercial rocket were the  14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites.  </P> <P> Skynet 4A was ejected from the Titan's nose cone into its planned preliminary  orbit a little more than an hour after launch and JCSAT 2 followed about an  hour and a half later. On-board rocket motors were to boost the relay stations  to their operational altitude of 22,300 miles.  </P> <P> JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic network, providing  telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data services. It is owned by  the Japanese Communications Satellite Co.  </P> <P> Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for communicating with  land, sea and air forces.  </P> <P> The Japanese company and British government share the $125-million cost of the  rocket and launch services provided by Martin Marietta.  </P> <P> Roaring with power, the Titan's boosters burned out about two minutes after  liftoff as planned and fell away into the Atlantic Ocean. The liquid-fueled  Titan "core" vehicle then continued the ascent, looking like a brilliant star  as the vehicle disappeared to the east.  </P> <P> The flight plan called for Skynet 4 to be deployed from the Titan's  second-stage nose cone one hour and 12 minutes after liftoff. JCSAT-2 was to  follow suit about an hour and a half after that.  </P> <P> The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the second big U.S.  rocket to enter the commercial market, launching payloads for a fee. McDonnell  Douglas was the first, with its Delta rocket hoisting a communications  satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in August.  </P> <P> General Dynamics plans to enter the competition next year with its Atlas  rocket.  </P> <P> The three U.S. companies are competing with the European Space Agency's Ariane  rocket.  </P></p>

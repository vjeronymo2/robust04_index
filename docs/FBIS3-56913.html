			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 20 January carries the program  "Approaching Elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The  program features platforms by the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity  and Social Justice [Ukrayinska Partiya Solidarnosti I  Sotsiyalnoyi Spravedlyvosti] and the Party of Free Peasants of  Ukraine [Partiya Vilnykh Selyan Ukrayiny]. The announcer says  each party has been given a 10-minute slot on this evening's  program during which each party can present its views.    The first slot is taken up by a video recording made by the  Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social Justice, featuring  party leader Eduard (Lashutin) and Oleksandr (Bulavin). They  speak in Russian. They see Ukraine as a community of peoples  who live in harmony with each other, mutually enriching each  other's cultures. Their party stands for Ukraine going along the  path of civilized countries, where all have equal rights and  where there is no antagonism between social classes. They  propose a society where civic responsibility comes before class  or ethnic interests -- a society of social partnership without  crises or risk. They assure viewers that the situation with  inflation and fuel shortages can be stabilized within one year  at the most. They cite the experience of other countries  without natural fuel resources.    Next, they link the activity of the state sector with  private  initiative. They propose that the form of managing the state  sector and conditions under which it operates be changed, but at  the same time not destroying it and creating a climate for the  development of initiative in the private sector. Only  initiative can fill the market with goods. The state cannot do  this alone. The speakers go on to say that the state sector  should be partially denationalized and the role of the state  decreased, but such reforms should not be conducted in ways that  decrease the rates of production and productivity. All reforms  should be expedient ones. If the role of the state sector is  changed, then a sector serving the interests of the people will  be created.    The speakers add that everyone should be provided for,  including children, pensioners, students, workers, servicemen,  and that the country has erroneously rejected the welfare state  of the Soviet Union, which was admired the world over. They  want to make life easier for women. New young forces and more  professionals should enter the new parliament. They finish by  saying that a society with social protection can be created in a  short period of time.    The second slot features (Vasyl Hordiyenko), head of the  Party of Free Peasants of Ukraine. He starts speaking in  Ukrainian and goes on to apologize because he is going to speak  in Russian as his Russian is better than his Ukrainian and this  will save time. His party was set up on the basis of the  association of private farmers of Ukraine and has both private  farmers and entrepreneurs among its members. The main aim of  the party is to revive free peasants and entrepreneurs as a  middle class in Ukraine. All who wish to work on the land  should have land, freedom, and state support. If each takes the  amount of land he wants and is able to cultivate, the only limit  needed is a land tax. Then the allocation of land is not  decided by corrupt bureaucrats. He says that the party's  program is published in the party newspaper and offers to send a  copy of the party's charter and program to whoever asks for  them, and gives the party's address and phone numbers for this.  He gives the main reason for the current crisis as the Supreme  Council's "group of 239" and the president as the leader of that  group, who have blocked reforms and privatization. (Hordiyenko)  was present at an extended Cabinet session on 13 January 1992  and asked the president to cancel the decree on liberalizing  prices. He says that the West was for price liberalization in  Russia, but only saw it as as a market for its own goods, and it  is price liberalization that has brought about the current  situation. There is a way out of the crisis. Political reforms  should precede economic reforms.    (Hordiyenko) advocates creating a parliamentary republic and  renouncing presidential government and the nomenclature  presidential structures of government. The election of a new  parliament on a multi-party basis is needed, which would form a  government of reformers. As far as economic reforms are  concerned, the basis of them should be the right to own land.  He mentions the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of  the Rukh secretariat, and accuses the "party of power." He  appeals to President Kravchuk to ensure the safety of all party  leaders, and to Levko Lukyanenko to gather representatives from  all parties the following day to discuss the issue. He finishes  by saying that one should conduct an honest political campaign.</p>

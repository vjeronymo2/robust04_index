			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Turkey to privatise 11 cement companies TURKEY'S privatisation programme is being relaunched with the sale of 11 state cement companies representing around 18 per cent of Turkish cement production. Bids, which have to be in by July 24, are expected to raise between Dollars 350m and Dollars 400m. Both Turkish and foreign groups are understood to be lining up offers. Societe Ciments Francais, which is now part-owned by Italcementi of Italy, and Lafarge Coppee are understood to be among foreign groups keen to bid. Holderbank of Switzerland, Blue Circle of the UK and Loma Negra, the Argentine privately-owned company, are also expected to make an offer, together with Sabanci, Turkey's leading industrial group, and Oyak, the armed forces pension fund. The two Turkish groups together already control 30 per cent of the Turkish cement market. Turkish cement sales on the domestic market are around 24m tonnes a year, or about the same size as France and Spain. Exports are less than 1m tonnes. The market is growing by 3 to 5 per cent annually, in spite of a slowdown in the economy. The Turkish plants up for sale are at Adiyaman, Askale, Bartin, Corum, Denizli, Gaziantep, Iskenderum, Ladik Sivas, Sanliurfa and Trabzon.</p>

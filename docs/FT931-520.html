			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Efforts to liberalise air routes to US face test EFFORTS by the UK and US governments to liberalise air transport between the two countries will be put to the test by United Airlines's agreement to acquire USAir's London-Philadelphia route. . United, one of the three largest US carriers, said yesterday that it planned to transfer the route to serve the London Heathrow to Chicago market. The carrier added that it would not go ahead with the Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.7m) route acquisition if it did not secure authority from the UK government to transfer the service to Chicago, its principal hub. Under the UK-US bilateral aviation agreement, United cannot operate services from Chicago to London. But the carrier hopes for approval for the switch following the US government go-ahead for the move by British Airways to buy a 19.9 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 300m. As part of the deal, USAir agreed to dispose of three routes to London. Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, said the proposal to switch the Philadelphia route to Chicago gave the UK government an early opportunity to show its commitment to expanding air services between Britain and the US. United, together with American and Delta, had fiercely opposed the BA-USAir deal unless the Washington authorities secured greater access for US carriers into the UK market and especially Heathrow airport. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is due to hold air liberalisation talks in Washington next month with Mr Federico Pena, his US counterpart. Services from Heathrow to Chicago, the largest hub in the US, are currently operated by BA and American Airlines.</p>

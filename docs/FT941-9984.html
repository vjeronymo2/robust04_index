			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / City to scrutinise corporate results for earnings prospects One of the most telling UK corporate reporting seasons in years is getting under way with the investment and business communities paying even closer attention than usual to the progress of companies. Mr Robin Aspinall, chief economist and strategist at Panmure Gordon, said: 'This results season will probably tell us more about the health of companies than any other in a long while.' Shares have rarely traded at such high valuations. The price/earnings ratio of the 855 stocks in the FT-SE-A All-Share index is 25.21, implying high hopes for rapid growth in corporate earnings. Mr Robert Buckland, a market strategist with NatWest Securities said: 'It will be more of an earnings-driven market this year than last, which was interest rate-driven.' Profits are beginning to benefit from economic recovery but the stock market has set a stiff challenge to companies: rapid earnings growth will be difficult in a low inflation and low growth economic environment. Thus, the City will pore over chairmen's outlook statements with the arrival of companies' results. Share prices will be marked down sharply on disappointing results or prospects. A string of weak results could cause a sharp sell-off, but Mr Aspinall argues that more powerful factors are at work. Money has poured into equities as interest rates have fallen. 'What really matters, is whether that cash keeps coming in.' UK results preview: Page 20</p>

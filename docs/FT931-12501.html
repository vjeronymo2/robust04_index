			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Political Notebook: Taxing times This week Conservative MPs have been trooping across Whitehall to sip tea with Mr Norman Lamont and his Treasury colleagues. It is an annual ritual, ostensibly to give the government's foot soldiers at Westminster a voice in the shaping of the March Budget. For much of the past 14 years it has been a sham. During his chancellorship Lord Lawson frequently disparaged the pleadings of Tory colleagues as vehemently as those of the Trades Union Congress. Typically his meetings were held close enough to Budget day to ensure that key decisions had already been taken. But this government cannot afford to treat its backbenchers with disdain. It tried last autumn. It is now about to pay the price in the form of a massive subsidy to an uneconomic coal industry. Nor can Mr Lamont. The recovery in his reputation after the Autumn Statement has proved as short-lived as the false dawns on the economy. This week's cut in interest rates raised a scarcely audible cheer on the Tory backbenches. Instead the mood was one of foreboding. The chancellor's colleagues no longer offer any pretence that they expect him to remain in the job beyond the summer. Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Howard are front-runners to succeed him. Mr John MacGregor and Mr Michael Portillo are also in the race. So Mr Lamont has sent out his invitations early. With one or two exceptions, the backbenchers are being listened to with studied respect. As is customary, Mr Lamont has said little himself. The absurdities of Budget purdah - rigorously enforced by the Sir Terence Burns - dictate that even the chancellor cannot be trusted not to blurt out a Budget secret. (No matter that Treasury ministers can chat freely with the same colleagues in the lobbies of the House of Commons). Mr Lamont nonetheless has offered clues to his thinking. The conclusion being drawn by astute Tory MPs is that he remains as uncertain as they about the best strategy for March 16. Predictably, his starting point has been to impress on them the awful medium-term outlook for the borrowing requirement. Mr John Major has said that the return of economic growth will take care of most of it. Mr Lamont is not at all convinced. Just as strikingly, he has been cautious about the pace of economic recovery: it will be a slow and occasionally faltering. He has intimated also that it would be dangerous if the economy began to grow strongly when the rest of Europe remained mired in recession. The Treasury worries more about the trade gap than it cares to admit. Mr Lamont has clarified the constraints imposed by the manifesto presented to the electorate less than a year ago. Mr Major's frequent promise to widen year-by-year the 20p income tax band is not regarded as a pledge. More importantly, nor are his parallel reassurances that the Conservatives had no plans to widen the VAT net. So the question the chancellor has left in the minds of his guests is not whether taxes will have to rise, but when and by how much. Only income tax rates are off-limits. Extension of VAT to newspapers, domestic fuel - a green tax - and perhaps childrens' clothes are seen as the favourites. The MPs are no more certain than their host about where the balance should be struck. A majority are terrified that significant tax increases in March would lay another frost over those still-elusive green shoots. They have yet to get used to the prospect of 3m unemployed. But a large minority believe that unless Mr Lamont makes a start now, the financial markets will take their revenge. That brings us to the bright idea being floated in the lobbies: Mr Lamont should announce a series of tax increases in March but stipulate they will take effect as part of the December Budget. The economic logic is that such a strategy would strengthen the recovery by encouraging consumers to advance spending. It would also reassure the markets that the government was ready to act over the medium term. The Treasury traditionally opposes pre-announcement of tax increases for the good reason that it gives interest groups the opportunity to mobilise against them. But for Mr Lamont there may be a political as well as an economic attraction to make an exception to that rule. If the odds are that he will no longer be chancellor at the end of the year, why not pre-empt in March the December Budget?</p>

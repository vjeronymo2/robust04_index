			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / All change, or fall down: The new TUC boss faces twin tasks Mr Norman Willis, who yesterday announced his early retirement as general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has been called many things during his nine years at the top of British trade unionism; 'a hard act to follow' is not one of them. But for Mr John Monks, Mr Willis's little-known deputy and likely successor, the benefit of favourable comparison with his often ineffectual predecessor will provide only temporary relief in the uphill struggles ahead. He has two main tasks: to redefine the role of the TUC in relation to government and to its affiliated unions, and to convince an increasingly sceptical world that unions are still of benefit to their members and to the economy as a whole. Since 1984, when Mr Willis took the helm, union membership in the UK has fallen by more than 25 per cent to 7.7m. The authority of the TUC has been diminished both by hostile Conservative governments and the rise of 'super-unions' formed, or to be formed, by mergers between the big craft, general and public-service unions. Mr Monks, an unassuming but able 47-year-old Mancunian, is aware that Mr Willis is not to blame for those unfavourable trends and that he is likely to remain a manager of a declining industrial force. But there are few officials, either in the TUC or in outside unions, who doubt that he will do a better job than Mr Willis. Although Mr Willis can be fluent and witty in private he seems plodding and sometimes confusing on television and radio. Critics charge that coming from the ranks of the Britain's biggest blue-collar union, the TGWU general union, he failed to modernise the movement's cloth-cap image. However, Mr Willis has been head of the TUC during one of its most difficult periods, and at times, during the 1984-85 miners strike, for example, he has shown considerable courage. But he has failed to rethink the role of the TUC and his internal management style has been widely criticised as inept. Mr Monks, on the other hand, is widely praised as an excellent manager both within the TUC and in the handling of disputes between unions. The former student of economic history at Nottingham University also better represents both the new 'classless' meritocracy within the unions, and the new, predominantly white-collar, trade union members, most of whom now have at least one A level. 'He has a good feel for how the average Lancashire textile worker thinks, but is also a moderniser who knows how the unions need to reposition themselves,' says one senior trade union official. He certainly understands the value that the trade union movement places on loyalty and has been properly applauded over the past few years for abstaining from the whispering campaign by some union leaders against Mr Willis, great though the temptation might have been. Mr Monks will have to prove that he can deliver the sharper focus for the TUC that has been much talked about since the Labour party's election defeat last year but little acted upon. The TUC must become a service centre for its affiliates, concentrating on key areas where it can best add value: Europe, health and safety, labour law, pensions and education. It must also become a more effective lobbyist of government, rather than the labour movement's civil service, producing documents on all public policy issues which are usually ignored. Mr Monks believes strongly in this new role. One colleague who has attended meetings between Mr Monks and Conservative MPs, as part of the TUC's new-style lobbying on the current employment bill, says: 'He is a good performer in meetings with Tory MPs. He's got credibility and a certain establishment feel about him, and he's got no hang-ups about doing it.' But while he might be able to deliver on internal reforms, especially as there is now a wide consensus in favour, it is less clear that he can succeed in the broader role of selling the unions. Mr Monks is an uncharismatic TUC bureaucrat who sometimes appears rather worn down by his six years as deputy. He can seem cautious about new ideas, such as enlisting the unions in the attempt to reach a better trade-off between pay and jobs, for example, or pushing harder in the direction of positive rights for all employees rather than just union members. He is also unlikely to become a great media performer, which is why some TUC insiders believe his deputy should be a more appealing and fluent outsider such as Mr Jack Dromey, of the TGWU, or Ms Brenda Dean, the former print union leader, instead of Mr Brendan Barber, the in-house candidate. With or without such an aide the best hope for the TUC is that Mr Monks can grow in the job. He is certainly a thoughtful and open man with none of the strutting rhetoric sometimes associated with union bosses. He believes strongly in Europe - he has a Dutch wife, Francine - and is politically pragmatic, urging his colleagues to show more flexibility and substance when arguing the union case. In the age of the super-union it may, in any case, be more appropriate to have a thoughtful manager at the head of the TUC rather than an authoritarian leader trying to stamp his authority on everyone. As Mr Monks himself points out, the conglomerate unions are here to stay, mirroring the development of British industry. The unions have had little to celebrate in recent years, and even failed to turn popular discontent over pit closures to their advantage. The employment bill before parliament will hit them hard, especially the proposal to make it more difficult for unions to have dues automatically deducted by employers. In his typically pragmatic vein, Mr Monks likes to point out that ending automatic 'check-off' will hit employers too, because they usually hold the money for unions on deposit for a few weeks before handing it over. Despite the battering the unions have taken Mr Monks also likes to point to the fact that more than 50 per cent of the workforce is still covered by collective bargaining and that almost all of Britain's top exporters, such as ICI and British Aerospace, are highly unionised companies. Unions, he believes, should signify efficiency, productivity and profitability as well as decent treatment of employees. He will make that point to government and employers more eloquently than his predecessor. Whether he can halt the long-term slide in TUC influence must remain in doubt.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Torchmark Drops Takeover Bid: Torchmark Corp. has dropped its $6.4-billion  hostile bid for much bigger rival American General Corp. but said it still  plans to go through with its proxy battle for the nation's fourth-largest  insurance company. Torchmark said it has withdrawn its offer because American  General did not formally respond to the bid by March 28. Torchmark said it  would still nominate a slate of five candidates for election to the American  General board at the May 2 annual meeting.  </P></p>

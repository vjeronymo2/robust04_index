			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: British Alcan deficit deepens to Pounds 4.7m BRITISH ALCAN Aluminium has reduced savagely its capital expenditure as it continues to suffer record losses because of a world-wide slump in aluminium prices and the deep UK recession. The company reported that its pre-tax loss in the first six months had increased from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 4.7m. Last year's figure was after exceptional costs of Pounds 7.3m for redundancies and plant closures, but there were none this year. Mr Douglas Ritchie, chairman, said: 'No significant improvement in performance is anticipated in the second half, given current aluminium prices and the weak state of the UK economy.' Keeping a tight control over working capital in order to generate cash remained a priority for British Alcan, a subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium of Canada which also reported substantial first-half losses. The British company's capital expenditure was restricted to Pounds 9m, against Pounds 20m in the same months of 1991. Since December debt had been cut by another Pounds 17m, from Pounds 336m, resulting in a two point improvement in the debt-equity ratio to 34:66 at June 30. Mr Ritchie said the benefit of continuing cost reduction schemes also helped to contain losses. Volume sales rose by 21,500 tonnes to 172,600 tonnes reflecting increased volumes of fabricated products and strong export business. Higher recycled aluminium volumes from the Pounds 28m Warrington used beverage can facility, which opened last year, helped to compensate for reduced primary aluminium sales caused by the mothballing of half the Lynemouth smelter's capacity in 1991. However, due to lower prices, sales revenues fell by Pounds 2m to Pounds 384.8m. . The attributable loss was Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 3.8m.)</p>

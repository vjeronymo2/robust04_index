			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Walbrook Insurance faces liquidation threat WALBROOK INSURANCE Company, a subsidiary of London United Investment which is in administration, faces the possibility of liquidation after a new analysis of its reserves has shown that it has negative shareholder funds. The 200 principal policyholders of the company have been invited to meetings in Chicago today and London next Monday to consider four separate options as to its future. In a letter to policyholders earlier this month, Sir Ian Morrow, chairman, invited them to hear the directors describe 'the deterioration in Walbrook's current financial position, and propose a plan which they believe should achieve long-term solvency'. The board is believed to favour proposing an informal scheme of arrangement by which they would remain in charge, with creditors receiving 100 cents in the dollar, but then returning 60 cents immediately in exchange for preferred stock. The three other options are a formal scheme of arrangement, provisional liquidation or liquidation. Provisional accounts circulated by Walbrook for the year to December 31, 1991, are believed to show negative net worth of more than Dollars 160m (Pounds 83m). It has gross reserves of more than Dollars 1.5bn. Walbrook announced on May 29 this year that it would no longer be paying out on claims. That followed a report from its actuaries that it had had to increase its reserves, which had the effect of making it insolvent. Separately, Transit Casualty Company, a Missouri-based insurance company which went into receivership in 1985 and which is one of Walbrook's larger creditors, filed a petition for provisional liquidation in the High Court in London. Walbrook has been known to be in difficulties since an announcement by the Department of Trade and Industry in March 1990 that it would cease writing new business. That application was postponed by Mr Justice Harman until July 15 to allow Walbrook time to discuss its position with creditors. Some of the policyholders, including Transit, are also creditors with other subsidiaries in the LUI group, and have been disgruntled at the large legal expenses and slow progress of insolvency proceedings on these other companies.</p>

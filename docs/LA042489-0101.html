			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BBC ON STRIKE -- 'YABBA-DABBA-DO' IN PLACE OF NEWS  </P> <P> The "Flintstones" cartoon characters filled in for one morning television news  program today and silence greeted many radio listeners as thousands of British  Broadcasting Corp. workers went on strike for higher pay.  </P> <P> The 24-hour walkout by 18,000 of the BBC's 25,000 employees forced nearly all  live programs on the corporation's four national radio networks and two  television channels to be canceled or shortened. This affected half the  nation's non-cable television and all national radio stations.  </P> <P> The BBC radio canceled its World Service, which broadcasts all over the globe,  with morning news commentary programs, financial reports and the daily review  of the British press.  </P> <P> The strike began at midnight to demand a 16% pay raise that would bring  salaries in line with those in commercial broadcasting.  </P></p>

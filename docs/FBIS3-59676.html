			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] It was announced on 20 September 1993 that  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) will join with the  diversified Candian firm Bombadier (located in Montreal) to  develop the "Global Express," a long-distance business jet (see  diagram showing the jet from three sides [diagram not included])  that will be able to fly from Tokyo to New York without landing  en route. MHI will underwrite an estimated 10 percent of total  development expenses, which will apparently be &yen;20 to 40  billion, and will undertake the production of the main wing and  the mid-section of the plane's fuselage. The Global Express will  make its first flight in the latter half of 1996. MHI had worked  on the twin-engine business plane "MU300" but was not  successful, and transferred production and sales rights to Beech  Aircraft of the United States in 1988; thus, the Global Express  marks MHI's reentry into business planes after an absense of  five years.    This is the first time that a Japanese manufacturer has  teamed up with a foreign manufacturer to undertake joint  international development in the business-plane field. This  time, however, "participation in the Bombadier venture" seems  close to becoming a reality.    The Global Express will have a wingspan of 28 meters and  will  measure about 30 meters in length. In the cabin are eight seats  made to executive specifications. The plane will mount two BR710  jet engines being jointly developed by Rolls Royce of the UK and  BMW of Germany. Takeoff weight will be around 40 tons and the  plane can transport about 20 people if all seats are installed,  so it would seem that the aircraft can be used for such purposes  as regular flights to remote areas. The plane is expected to be  priced at &yen;2-3 billion.    The Global Express greatly exceeds the common perception of  a  business jet: its most outstanding characteristic is its range  of 6,500 nautical miles (about 12,000 kilometers) with a crusing  speed in the vicinity of Mach 0.85. It can fly without stopping  between Chicago and Taipei, Los Angeles and Sydney, and New York  and Tokyo -- trans-Pacific routes on which demand for passenger  planes have been increasing. The Global Express is expected to  be utilized by executives of transnational corporations and  VIP's of various foreign governments.    U.S. and European manufacturers are prominent in the  long-range, high-class business jet field, but only the United  States' Gulfstream Corporation currently has specific  development plans for such an aircraft. The word is that  Bombadier envisions Global Express sales in the three figures  and has expressed self-confidence regarding demand prospects for  the plane.    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Nagoya Aerospace Systems Plant  will be in charge of the design, manufacture, and support of the  Global Express's main wings and central fuselage section. How  much will be invested had not been made public.    Bombadier has experienced rapid growth beginning with  products such as railroad cars, small engines, and snowmobiles;  it has a yearly turnover of about &yen;400 billion. Beginning in  the latter half of the 1980's, Bombadier bought up the U.S.  business jet manufacturer Learjet as well as Canada de Haviland,  a small passenger jet manufacturer under the aegis of the United  States' Boeing. Currently about two-thirds are accounted for by  the civil aviation and defense sectors, such as by Canadair.    This year Canadair's announcement of the 7,000 kilometer  range "604" in addition to the large business jet "Challenger"  became topics of discussion at the 1993 Paris Air Show.</p>

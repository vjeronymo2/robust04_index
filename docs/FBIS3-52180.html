The Shiite Moslem Hizballah denounced the Holy See's  recognition of Israel as a "historic sin against Christ and all  humanity. How can a state created in the name of Christ  recognize the legality of an entity established by usurpation  and injustice?" it asked.    Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, former Hizballah secretary general  and leader of the group's radical wing, said in comments  published by the press that a link exists between the pope's  visit to Lebanon and recognition of Israel.    "This visit becomes a basis for evil and action that does  not  serve the interests of the Lebanese," he said. Al-Tufayli  expressed surprise that "the Vatican speaks of peace when it  signs a document recognizing the Zionist entity."    The spiritual leader of Hizballah, Shaykh Muhammad Husayn  Fadlallah, on Friday also denounced the Israeli-Vatican accord  as ignoring the "teachings of Jesus Christ."    Shaykh Mahir Hammud, the political director of the Sunni  Assembly of Moslem Ulema (religious scholars) which is close to  Iran, called on "the free forces" in Lebanon to boycott the  pope's visit.    He said the accord signed Thursday in Jerusalem between the  Vatican and Israel, which calls for diplomatic ties this year,  is based on "the principles of the Zionist movement, not those  of the Vatican."    Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said: "We would have  preferred it if Israel's recognition by the Vatican had taken  place after the Jewish state complied with the principles of  peace decided at the Madrid conference."    The Madrid conference in October 1991 launched the  Arab-Israeli peace talks.    The Vatican-Israel pact should "at least be part of pressure  on Israel to execute international resolutions," Buwayz added.    Lebanon has repeatedly called for Israel to comply with U.N.  Security Council Resolution 425 to withdraw from south Lebanon.</p>

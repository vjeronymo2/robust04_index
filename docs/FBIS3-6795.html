Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Ambassador to Seoul  James Laney led the talks held over breakfast. Gen. Gary Luck,  chief commander of the UN Forces, and Kim Sam-hun, chief aide to  Han on nuclear affairs, also attended, officials said.    The meeting was arranged just after the International Atomic  energy agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution referring the North  Korean issue to the UN Security Council.    Inside sources said Seoul and Washington reaffirmed the  early  deployment of Patriot missiles, 36 of them sometime next month.  The two sides, however, held off on a Team Spirit decision  while agreeing that the drill will be staged when deemed  necessary, they said.    They also discussed what to expect at the UN Security  Council  once it takes up the North Korean issue, the possibility and  effectiveness of sanctions, and Seoul and Washington's readiness  to counter any North Korean threat, sources said.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEIJING OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NEW PUSH TO FIND AND ARREST PROTEST LEADERS  </P> <P> A Communist Party official warned Friday that more than a month after the  bloody military assault on pro-democracy demonstrators around Tian An Men  Square, "counterrevolutionary" resistance persists, official Chinese newspapers  reported.  </P> <P> At a meeting of senior Beijing officials, Li Qiyan, the capital's Communist  Party deputy secretary, called for fresh efforts to isolate and smash remnants  of the democracy movement.  </P> <P> He said protest organizers are still at large "distributing anti-revolutionary  rumor," despite a wave of arrests, and that "their capture is of vital  importance to the survival of the party, the stability of the society and the  fundamental interest of the people," according to a report in the official  People's Daily.  </P> <P> China has announced the capture of only six of 21 most-wanted student leaders,  and several are believed to have escaped abroad.  </P> <P> Also on Friday, Chinese authorities, stepping up a campaign against Western  influences, seized foreign newspapers and magazines from bookshops at luxury  hotels in the capital.  </P> <P> Managers at 10 five-star hotels said agents of the Central Propaganda Bureau  raided the bookshops and told the hotels that they would no longer receive  foreign publications.  </P> <P> "They even took away the shelves," said an assistant manager at the Great Wall  Sheraton Hotel.  </P> <P> Last week, authorities ordered deluxe hotels to stop receiving satellite  transmissions of foreign broadcasts and raided bookstalls selling the works of  pro-democracy leaders.  </P> <P> In another development, Western companies were largely absent from an  international trade fair, touted as China's biggest ever, that opened Friday in  Beijing. In contrast to previous such events, the United States, Britain,  Canada, West Germany and France had only one booth each. Many Western countries  imposed sanctions against China in protest of the crackdown.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the official New China News Agency noted that 24 nations  exhibited, and it said the "festive and friendly atmosphere at the fair did not  seem to be affected by the martial law still going on in the city."  </P></p>

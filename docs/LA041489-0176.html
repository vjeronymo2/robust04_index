			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ENVOY NOMINATION RAISES DOUBTS  </P> <P> Several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have privately raised  doubts with the Bush Administration about the nomination of Donald Gregg to be  ambassador to South Korea because of his possible role in the Iran-Contra  affair, congressional sources said today.  </P> <P> However, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has reiterated his support for  Gregg's nomination to the high-profile diplomatic appointment by President  Bush, Gregg's former boss. When Bush was vice president, Gregg was his national  security adviser.  </P> <P> Gregg's nomination, which will be debated by the Senate committee next month,  is one of several that have run into opposition in the light of disclosures  about the Iran-Contra affair that have surfaced in the trial of former White  House aide Oliver L. North.  </P></p>

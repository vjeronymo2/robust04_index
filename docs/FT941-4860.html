			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Partco for market with Pounds 59m price tag Partco Group, the biggest independent distributor of automotive parts and equipment in the UK, is raising about Pounds 20.7m through a placing and intermediaries offer at 200p per share - valuing the whole company at Pounds 59.2m. The placing and offer comprises 14.58m ordinary shares - 11m of which are new ordinaries being issued by the company. The remaining 3.58m shares are being sold by existing shareholders. Partco, which was a management buy-out in 1986 from Quinton Hazell, trades from more than 200 branches in the UK and had sales of about Pounds 124m in 1993. Pre-tax profits last year were Pounds 4.28m, from which pro-forma earnings on an actual tax basis were 13.2p a share. This gives an historic multiple of 15.2 times at the 200p offer price. The notional net dividend for 1993 was 5.35p, giving a gross yield of 3.3 per cent. The group is being advised by Hambro Magan, with Cazenove acting as brokers to the issue. The closing date for the intermediaries offer is March 15 and dealings are expected to begin on March 18. COMMENT Improved distribution methods, long familiar in retailing and industry, are transforming the previously fragmented business of supplying automotive parts to garages. Last month Finelist, a smaller competitor to Partco, was floated successfully. Now investors are offered an opportunity to back the biggest group in the field, which has a national warehouse and sees scope for rapid expansion. With forecast earnings of about 11.9p per share in the current year, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 16.8, a discount to Finelist, and a prospective yield of 3.5 per cent - a premium to the smaller company. The pricing does not look aggressive and should leave the larger group plenty to go for.</p>

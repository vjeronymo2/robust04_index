			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] The massacres perpetrated by the Serbs in the  town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina were condemned in  demonstrations held in various cities, especially in Ankara and  Istanbul.    Thousands of people who gathered in Zafer Square in Kizilay,  Ankara, chanted slogans condemning the Serbian massacres and the  attitude of the United Nations. The citizens then started  marching along Ataturk Boulevard to the UN representation in  Ankara. They continued their protests there as well. Certain  provocateurs in the crowd hurled stones, shattering some of the  windows of the UN building. Despite these provocations, the  people proceeded to Kocatepe Mosque following the appeasing  remarks of Ankara Governor Erdogan Sahinoglu and Ankara Security  Director Orhan Tasanlar, who arrived at the scene of the  incident.    During the march, stones were thrown shattering the windows  of the TRT General Directorate building, the U.S. Embassy, and  the Russian Commercial Attache's Office. Some individuals  climbed over the iron fence of the U.S. Embassy and entered the  garden. They posted a flag at the main entrance of the U.S.  Embassy and then left the garden.    In a statement to TRT, Sahinoglu said that efforts are under  way to determine who is responsible for directing the course of  events. Asking the citizens not to heed such provocations,  Sahinoglu noted: I believe that with regard to international  relations, which are sensitive, it is appropriate for us to  display attitudes that are more careful, self-sacrificing, and  befitting our traditions. I particularly ask our people not to  heed provocations and such rumors.    The recent attack against Gorazde was also condemned in a  demonstration held in Istanbul's Taksim Square. Groups, which  gathered in Taksim Square at noon, shouted various slogans  against the Serbs. The police did not intervene in the  demonstration, which was held without a permit. Certain people  attempted to behave in an excessive manner, however, attacking  members of the press, who were filming the meeting, including  TRT teams. The groups, which remained in Taksim Square for  about three hours, later marched along Istiklal and Cumhuriyet  Streets. Intensive security measures were adopted during these  marches. A group proceeding towards Harbiye chanted slogans  against TRT in front of the TRT Istanbul Radio building. The  demonstrators shouted slogans against the UN, Israel, and the  United States.

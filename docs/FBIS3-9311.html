			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) has lost 45.117 billion dollars through the  disintegration of the former federation and draconic sanctions  subsequently clamped on the country by the United Nations, show  figures released on Tuesday by the Yugoslav Science and  Development Ministry's development and economic policy centre.    The U.N. Security Council imposed comrehensive and mandatory  sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992 for the country's alleged  involvement in civil war raging among the local Moslems, Serbs  and Croats in the neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Of the 45.117 billion dollars, the loss to the national  product accounted for 38.136 billion dollars, lost net earnings  from the abroad for 1.415 billion, lay-over compensation for 436  million, and humanitarian and economic assistance to the  refugees and the Serb states in the breakaway Yugoslav republics  of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, for a further 5.130 billion  dollars, the centre's officials said at a press conference.    The figure does not include losses incurred through a halted  scientific and technological development and a brain-drain,  explained the centre's director Misa Jandric, assistant minister  for science and development.    Furthermore, incalculable damage has been done to  Yugoslavia's reputation in the world and in international fora  and to the health, education and culture of the population,  which have been brought down to an alarmingly low level, said  Jandric.    Should the sanctions remain in place, Yugoslavia stands to  lose 147.33 billion dollars by the year 2011, the centre  estimates.    A study prepared by the centre indicates that Yugoslavia  cannot hope to regain the level of economic activity recorded in  1990 before the year 2012, which brings with itself the threat  of a slowed development of its neighbors and of Europe as a  whole.    In 1990, Yugoslavia's gross national product stood at 26.6  billion dollars, to dwindle down to barely 12.57 billion dollars  in 1993.</p>

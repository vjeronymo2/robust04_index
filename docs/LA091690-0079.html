			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROUTING A TOLLWAY THROUGH SAN CLEMENTE  </P> <P> There is more to San Clemente than Avenida Pico.  </P> <P> However, Mayor Candace Haggard says it's "devastating" if the proposed tollway  linking the Tustin and San Clemente areas has to be routed through San Clemente  instead of Camp Pendleton to connect with Interstate 5.  </P> <P> We wonder if she and her ilk paused a moment to think that the route through  Camp Pendleton is devastating to San Clemente residents and property owners who  live on Avenida Santa Margarita, especially the beginning of Avenida Santa  Margarita from El Camino Real, where the proposed tollway is located within 300  feet or less of our residences. (Yes, the southern end of town is considered a  part of San Clemente.)  </P> <P> Did the San Clemente city officials and our other elected state and federal  officials stop to think about the effect this massive roadway project will have  on the San Clemente community with regard to increased freeway noise (in  addition to Interstate 5), traffic, air and water (aquifer) pollution?  </P> <P> We wonder just how much the mayor, city officials and our state and federal  officials care about San Clemente, its environment and its families, residents,  and property owners.  </P> <P> We wonder how much they care about preserving the pristine natural habitat on  Camp Pendleton and state land.  </P> <P> We wonder how much they care about the Earth and its ever-increasing fragility  to the damaging effects of pollution.  </P> <P> At the next and subsequent elections, we will remember our elected officials as  they have remembered us.  </P> <P> MARGO BEAUCHAMP  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

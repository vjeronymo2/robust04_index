			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Productivity gains boost Meggitt Productivity gains and a commitment to new product development were behind a 10 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits at Meggitt, the Dorset-based engineer. Profits for 1993 rose from Pounds 21.2m to Pounds 23.3m on turnover similarly ahead to Pounds 360m (Pounds 328m). The result was achieved after higher net interest payments of Pounds 3.24m (Pounds 908,000). Mr Ken Coates, executive chairman, said the group had kept profits up through three years of recession. In addition, cash generation of Pounds 38.5m had helped to cut gearing from 48 per cent to 31 per cent. The group had increased capital expenditure from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 7.8m and research and development by Pounds 3m to Pounds 11m. Sales per employee were ahead 11 per cent to Pounds 55,000. 'When business comes back we'll be reaping our just rewards,' said Mr Coates. On prospects, he added that orders in the first quarter of this year had been 3 per cent ahead of the comparable period. However, he warned that the group's performance would be constrained by the lack of clear signs of improvement in the aerospace market and the European process industry. The aerospace and controls divisions make up most of Meggitt's business. Aerospace operating profits edged ahead from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 13.9m on turnover up from Pounds 121.7m to Pounds 132.6m, while controls profits fell from Pounds 6.25m to Pounds 5.22m on turnover of Pounds 117.5m, against Pounds 115.8m. While the aerospace market continued to decline, the group had won new customers throughout the division. In the controls sector, profits were held back by the need to reorganise some Sunvic and Mobrey operations. Germany was likely to prove a difficult market this year. The energy division doubled profits to Pounds 2.22m on turnover of Pounds 47.2m (Pounds 37m). The group had established its presence in east Asia, winning important orders in Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan and Korea. Electronics profits rose from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 6.95m on the back of greater volume with turnover improving to Pounds 61.6m (Pounds 49.1m). Earnings per share grew to 7.1p (6.6p). A final dividend of 2.63p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 3.93p (3.78p). COMMENT While Meggitt has shown its resilience to recession, it looks as though the current year will prove to be dull. The group has sharpened the management focus and is carrying out some sound restructuring. But it is all dressed up with nowhere to go. Its two main markets will be among the last to recover from recession. An improvement to Pounds 25m for earnings of 7.5p put it on an undemanding prospective multiple of 14, but the yield of almost 5 per cent could prove attractive.</p>

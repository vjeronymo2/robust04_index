			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (17): The battle to topple Intel - Chip Wars INTEL jumped from third to the top of the world league of semiconductor companies last year according to Dataquest, the market research company. Its 26 per cent (Dollars 1bn-plus) growth in revenues cut across the general recessionary trends of the industry. Interestingly, 1992 saw two other major US manufacturers, Motorola and Texas Instruments, achieve significant growth (22 per cent and 11 per cent respectively) compared to low single-figure growth, or even declines, by the Japanese suppliers. Across the board, the US suppliers' share of the world market grew by some 3 per cent, whereas the Japanese fell by nearly 4 per cent, giving the two groups roughly equal shares in the marketplace. The key drivers of this are linked: the growth in demand for high-powered processors such as Intel's 486 device, and the rapid and widespread acceptance of the portable PC as not only a low-powered, note-taking addition to an existing desktop system, but as a computer in its own right. All the leading portable PC manufacturers now offer high-powered, fully-specified systems, often in a notebook form factor. Their popularity, one of the few sales high spots in a lacklustre year for PC makers, has driven the demand for the high-performance processors offered almost exclusively by US suppliers. This trend, however, increases the pressure on the dominant processor supplier, Intel. Not only does it face stiff competition for its leading desktop PC devices both in the marketplace and the law courts, but there are also increasingly tough technological challenges as it seeks to service the needs of portable and notebook PC users. The competition comes from a growing number of sources. There is even speculation that IBM, which lost nearly as much as Intel grossed, might join the fray. It could be the dark horse of the semiconductor marketplace. IBM is often claimed to be, in practice, the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, and has significant rights to produce Intel-compatible processors. The most important area for competition now comes in two areas which can be loosely defined as the 'present' and the 'future'. In the former, it is the popularity of notebook PCs which is the driving force. Here the rate at which the electronics consumes the power of the batteries is of vital importance, and while much is being done in software to control the utilisation of the circuitry, displays and disk drives, making devices that consume less power in the first place is the high demand. Intel is most threatened in this area, for others are joining it in producing devices that operate at 3.3 volts, rather than the standard 5 volts. This one-third reduction in power consumption means a reciprocal increase in battery life - a strong sales point for notebook manufacturers. Even with 5-volt devices, any saving in consumption is vital. For example, Intel introduced a low-power version of its popular 386 processor, the 386SL, some two years ago, but this has been beset with problems and has not proved too popular with systems companies. One leading supplier, Toshiba, recently went on record that it would utilise Advanced Micro Devices 386SX processors because Intel could not match the power consumption specification. Intel has now switched its emphasis from the low-power 386 processor to the low-power 486 marketplace, where it has a 3.3 volt 486SX processor available and already being used in notebook systems from Toshiba and Texas Instruments. The company is gambling this device will become the effective 'entry-level' specification for such systems. Packing density is as crucial an element as consumption. Many other suppliers, such as Cyrix and Chips and Technologies, offer notebook PC manufacturers greater advantages by integrating more of the PC architecture 'glue' circuitry - the many components that surround the processor and memory devices - on to a single chip together with the processor itself. In the near term, Intel's success will hinge on its continued extension of the technology. It has, for example, the next generation of its processor family, the Pentium, (often referred to as the 586) due out shortly. Several PC makers have already demonstrated systems running this device and it is likely soon to appear in a high-end portable system as well. Further in time comes the 'future' competition, in particular the new generation of hand-held computer-telephone systems, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). The first company to declare a real interest in this market has been Apple Computer, with its Newton product, based on a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (Risc) chip from ARM, the UK company in which has a minority stake. A more recent contender is Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics and computer giant. As yet, however, it is fair to say that both are dabbling with the market to assess customer demand. The potential, however, is huge, particularly if AT&amp;T, the US telecommunication leader, is to be believed. The company's microelectronics division recently launched the Hobbit processor chipset specifically to address this market, predicted to account for 1bn units by the turn of the century. The objective is to create systems which combine personal pen computer, cellular telephone, fax and a wide range of communication services such as electronic mail into a single, hand-held personal unit. This is an entirely new marketplace which Intel, and others that make compatible chips, will not automatically dominate. Indeed, the power required to manage these facilities points, as AT&amp;T has found, to the use of Risc devices optimised for the job. It is an opportunity which has not escaped the notice of IBM which, together with its alliance partners Apple and Motorola, is already well advanced on the design of a chip specifically for PDAs. This will be a development of the new PowerPC processors from the partners, the first example of which is now entering production. It will have a significant potential advantage for corporate users, for it is planned to be code-compatible with all other versions of the PowerPC family. This will extend from desktop workstations to large enterprise network servers. It is unlikely that Intel will ignore this new market opportunity, especially as it could also offer similar levels of enterprise-wide compatibility. It is, however, a market offering different technologies and services, so it will be a new, level playing field on which it has to compete.</p>

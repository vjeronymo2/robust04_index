			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Adam Michnik] </F>   [Text] It seemed as if our countries had learned from the  bitter experience of Munich, Yalta, and the Brezhnev Doctrine,  which permitted the making of decisions about Poland's fate  without Poland's participation. It seemed that Visegrad would  change all this.    Visegrad was also a chance for stability in the center of  Europe. It could have become a real partner for the powerful  countries. It enjoyed excellent reviews.    But it did not last long. The disintegration of  Czechoslovakia was the first blow to Visegrad. Then  Slovak-Hungarian conflicts broke out. And then politicians, not  just in the Czech Republic, decided that they would reach Europe  sooner if they went alone.    It looks like the greatest political chance of the Poles,  Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians in the 20th century may be  wasted.</p>

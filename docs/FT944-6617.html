			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / New mortgages fall in October Fresh evidence of the sluggishness of the mortgage market came yesterday as it emerged that new home loans by banks fell more than 10 per cent in October compared with September. The number of new loans approved but not yet undertaken was also down slightly at 29,081, from 29,718 in September. While this was higher than in October last year, the average value of loans approved - Pounds 50,400 - was scarcely more than the equivalent in 1993. This contrasts with the summer, when average values of loans approved were 10 per cent higher than in the previous year. The figures, released by the British Bankers' Association, show new lending last month, both in gross and net terms, below the levels of October 1993. Mr Tim Sweeney, BBA director-general, said the figures mirrored the fall in new home loans from building societies last month. He suggested that the poorer figures for October might have reflected September's 'good month' in the mortgage market. However, new net lending by banks in September this year was less than in September last year.</p>

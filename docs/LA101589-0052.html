			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE SHOULD TAKE SECOND LOOK AT CREDIT CARD RATES  </P> <P> As a major opponent of legislation to remove California's 25-year-old ceiling  on retail credit card rates, I read with interest and concern your recent  article, "Rate Deregulation Has Cost Consumers $100 Million" (Sept. 15).  </P> <P> In 1959, the Unruh Act was enacted in response to a number of consumer abuses,  including excessive interest rates, which were routinely between 39% and 81% at  the time.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, at the urging of the retailers, the legislature last year passed  and the Governor signed a bill that repealed portions of the Unruh Act,  deregulated retail credit cards and removed the interest rate cap on these  cards.  </P> <P> I strongly opposed this bill because experiences in other states have shown  that deregulation results in increases in interest rates on retail credit  cards, without any resulting benefits to consumers in terms of greater credit  availability.  </P> <P> In fact, the issuance of new credit declined by two-thirds in New Jersey after  deregulation. In New York, interest rates went up between 15% and 20%.  </P> <P> The record is devoid of any evidence supporting higher retail credit card  interest rates. For the sake of California's consumers, perhaps we need to take  a second look.  </P> <P> RUSTY AREIAS  </P> <P> Los Banos  </P> <P> The writer is an assemblyman in Northern California.  </P> <P> </P></p>

Shemyakin at Russia's  Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 577.175.82+61282.015]    [Abstract] The phenomenon of joint localization of  classical and peptide neurotransmitters which enables the  receptor to interact with its own specific ligand and ligands  which are specific to other receptors--which may lead to a  modulating effect on the receptor activity--and the recently  discovered effect of substance P (SP) on the binding  characteristics and functional properties of the nicotine acetyl  choline receptor (AKhR) prompted an examination of the effect of  various acetyl choline receptor ligands on the binding of  iodized substance P to tachykinin receptors (TKhR) in the rat  brain. The study shows that such compounds as  d-tubocurarine and phencyclidine inhibit the SP  binding but only at sufficiently high concentrations  (10[.sup]-4[/] M). Thus, ion exchange HPLC is used to purify  _a_-neurotoxins, _k_-bungarotoxins, cytotoxins, and  A[.sub]2[/] phospholipases of snake venom. Phospholipases  A[.sub]2[/] have the highest ability to inhibit the substance  P binding by the rat brain membrane while the remaining toxins  are weak inhibitors. The high inhibitory potential of  _a_-bungarotoxin discovered earlier is attributed to  contamination of commercial preparations with phospholipase  A[.sub]2[/]. The high sensitivity of the SP interaction with  tachykinin receptors to phospholipases A[.sub]2[/] is  especially noteworthy due to the fact that various  phospholipases A[.sub]2[/], including brain enzymes, are  activated by a number of G-proteins connected to  G-protein-dependent receptors. It is speculated that cell  phospholipases are capable of specifically interacting with  Na[.sup]+[/]- and K[.sup]+[/]-ATPase or annular lipids and  serve as an endogenic regulator.

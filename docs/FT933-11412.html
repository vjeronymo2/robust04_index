			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Du Pont below expectations for second period DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, yesterday posted disappointing second-quarter figures, with declining underlying earnings from all of its main businesses except petroleum. In the three months to June 30, the group had net income of Dollars 516m, or 76 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 277m, or 41 cents, in the same period of 1992. Stripping out one-time items in both years, earnings rose 11 per cent in the quarter. On Wall Street, shares in Du Pont closed down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 52 3/8 . Analysts had expected earnings of abut 84 cents a share. Mr Edgar Wollard, chairman, said that without an increase in economic activity 'business conditions are likely to remain difficult, with excess capacity and resultant downward price pressures in our major markets.' Petroleum earnings, excluding non-recurring charges, soared 155 per cent to Dollars 199m in the quarter. The growth in income reflected higher natural gas prices, lower exploration and other costs and stronger upstream earnings on new oil and gas production outside the US. The chemical division's earnings fell 4 per cent to Dollars 91m, largely due to lower earnings for white pigments and specialty chemicals. Fibre earnings declined 27 per cent to Dollars 107m, while polymer division earnings were 14 per cent lower at Dollars 107m. The diversified businesses unit saw earnings drop 15 per cent to Dollars 151m, stripping out a non-recurring charge in 1992. For the first half, Du Pont earned Dollars 1bn, or Dollars 1.49. A year earlier, the company took accounting charges of Dollars 4.8bn which contributed to a net loss of Dollars 4.12bn, or Dollars 6.13. Excluding non-recurring items, earnings rose 15 per cent in the first six months of 1993.</p>

Garcia] </F>   [Text] Havana, 17 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban  emigre organizations in the United States today agreed that the  Cuban Government's call to the conference "The Nation and  Emigration," which will be held here in April, is an important  step.    PRENSA LATINA spoke by telephone with Raymundo Del Toro,  president of the Cuban-American Committee for Peace (CCAP), and  with Walfredo Moreno, leader of the Alliance of Workers of the  Community (ATC).    Del Toro said the initiative shows the goodwill of the  people  in accepting their brothers who live outside the fatherland.    The CCAP has 17,000 members and is headquartered in New  Jersey, the state with the second largest concentration of  Cubans in the United States after Florida.    About the meeting, the most recent precedent for which was  in  1978, Del Toro stated: "They call us once again to share and  listen to our worries and aspirations."    On 14 February, the Cuban authorities announced the  convocation of a meeting on 22, 23, and 24 April in which over  200 representatives of the Cuban community residing in other  nations are expected to participate.    Although the topics on the agenda and the list of  participants have not yet been defined, Havana made it clear  that those who want to destroy the country and support the U.S.  blockade have been excluded from the meeting.    Del Toro said the decision not to invite organizations such  as the Cuban-American Foundation and the terrorist groups Alpha  66 and "19 April" L (Liberty) Commando Units, among others that  have spoken out against the people and for the blockade, was  fair.    Those groups do not represent the Cuban community residing  in  the United States, but the interests of Washington and the CIA  (Central Intelligence Agency), he added.    He said that recent polls showed that 83 percent of emigres  residing in Miami favor the elimination of the economic  sanctions imposed on Cuba over 30 years ago.    For his part, the president of the ATC stated that the  convocation to the conference has scared "the worms"  (ultraright-wing sector of the emigres) and encouraged those who  favor the ties with Havana.    Moreno said the initiative has left the most reactionary  sector of the community without arguments. Those sectors wish  to perpetuate the blockade, the main cause of the economic  crisis in the country.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina recently said the  Government has the willingness to smooth edges and solve  differences with the community, whose relations with the Cuban  Government were manipulated or undermined by the enemies of the  revolution.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> VERMONT;  </P> <P> COURT RULES AGAINST MENORAH DISPLAY  </P> <P> A federal appeals court ruled that the display of a 16-foot menorah in a  Burlington, Vt., park is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of  church and state. In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in  New York reversed a lower court's decision allowing the city to issue a permit  to a Jewish group to erect the menorah in a park next to City Hall. The appeals  judges based their decision on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that a  creche inside a Pittsburgh courthouse was not permissible but a menorah in  front of a nearby government building was because it was paired with a  Christmas tree.  </P></p>

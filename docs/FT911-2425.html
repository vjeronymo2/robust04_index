			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UN backs plan for W Sahara THE UN Security Council yesterday approved unanimously plans for a ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario Liberation Front in Western Sahara, to be followed by a referendum. The decision, ending years of conflict, came after a UN search for the best way to implement a peace plan accepted by the parties in August 1988. Under the proposals, Morocco would cut its troop deployment by two thirds, to 65,000, within 11 weeks of the ceasefire.</p>

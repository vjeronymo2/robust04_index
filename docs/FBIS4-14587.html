			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Rotar report under the "Talks" rubric: "Main Problem </F> is Refugees. Another Stage of Georgian-Abkhazian Settlement"]    [Excerpts] Consultations between the delegations of  Abkhazia and Georgia on a settlement of their conflict were held  in Moscow yesterday with Russia's mediation. The new  Georgian-Abkhazian meeting was prompted by a recent appeal by  the Russian Government expressing concern over the resumption of  hostilities and calling on the warring sides to sit at the  negotiating table once again.    It was decided not to discuss Abkhazia's future status (the  sides should only agree on a cease-fire) during these  consultations, which were intended to focus on the return of  refugees.    Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, personal  representative of the Russian president, told NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA on the eve of the talks: "I cannot say that we have  achieved a significant breakthrough, but now the achievement of  a compromise has finally become a reality. We have conducted  intensive work with the Abkhazian delegation and now the final  result depends on the Georgian side."    In Pastukhov's view, the Russian side has managed to  convince  the Abkhazians to soften considerably their criteria for the  definition of "refugees to be banned from entry." Initially,  the Abkhazians insisted on including in this category "all those  who participate in the hostilities on the Georgian side." Now  they have agreed that the following categories will be denied  the right of return: those responsible for military crimes;  regular criminals; and those taking part in military operations  or currently undergoing training at special military camps in  western Georgia.    According to Boris Pastukhov, the Abkhazian side was very  reluctant to agree with the definition of the third category.  The personal representative of the Russian president said that,  according to UN military observers' estimates, there are three  military camps in western Georgia, each of them providing  training for around 1,000 refugees from Abkhazia. Pastukhov is  certain that the Georgian side has to accept the current  definition of the "refugees banned from returning:" "What is  more important, after all: The problem of 3,000 intransigent  young people, or the fate of around 300,000 refugees (the figure  given by the Georgians themselves). If the Georgians really  want peace, they are obliged to agree to the plan." [passage  omitted]    During yesterday's talks, however, the sides never came to a  definite solution. Despite that, the Russian president's  personal representative is not losing his optimism: "We have  achieved considerable success and are steadily moving ahead  toward our goal. Final conclusions should be drawn after the end  of the talks, the new round of which is scheduled for 4 April."</p>

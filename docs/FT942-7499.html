			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dawson seeks Pounds 45m after heavy losses Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile group, yesterday announced a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise more than Pounds 45m as it plunged into the red after provisions for the closure of its US fleece and jersey business. More than 39m shares will be issued at 120p. Yesterday they closed at 150p, up 6p on the day. Pre-tax losses for the year to March 26 were Pounds 95.4m, after a provision of Pounds 50m and goodwill written off of Pounds 56.4m. There was a profit of Pounds 32.1m in the comparable period. Turnover was Pounds 443.1m (Pounds 431.7m), including Pounds 58.3m (Pounds 76.2m) from the discontinued US activities. Operating profits of Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 37.2m) took account of losses of Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 2.71m) from the US operations. Sir Ronald Miller, executive chairman, said market conditions had been appalling. 'As a small player we did not stand a chance.' The closure of the division soaked up Pounds 38m of the provision. The remaining Pounds 12m was for Dawson Home Fashions, a maker of shower curtains and bath mats, which was hit by imports. The provision would cover its sale, which is under discussion, or its restructuring if the sale fell through, Dawson said. Dawson Home Fashions incurred its first loss last year, of Pounds 2.9m on sales Pounds 57.3m, compared with a previous profit of Pounds 4.6m on sales of Pounds 59.5m. Operating profits from continuing operations, excluding Dawson Home Fashions, were ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 35.2m). Sir Ronald said: 'We can see enormous potential coming through.' Losses per share were 64.6p, compared with earnings of 13.3p. A final dividend of 1.5p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 3p (9p). The proceeds from the rights issue will be used to develop and expand the core businesses, particularly the international branded clothing business and the Morgan thermal underwear business in the US. The group will also reduce borrowings and redeem up to Pounds 27.9m of 9.375 per cent convertible preference shares. Gearing at March 26 was 67.4 per cent if the convertible shares are treated as liabilities; 37.4 per cent if they are treated as equity. Pro forma net gearing would be 20.1 per cent. The rights issue would have the effect of restoring shareholders funds, which fell from Pounds 163.4m to Pounds 115.1m at March 26, to Pounds 160.5m. The issue has been underwritten by Samuel Montagu, Goldman Sachs and Noble Grossart. Broker to the issue is Cazenove. COMMENT The figures are horrendous, but were well flagged at the beginning of March. It could be argued that there is no need for the rights issue as the remaining operations are cash generative. On the other hand the underlying businesses look undervalued, with pencilled-in profits of a little less than Pounds 30m giving a prospective multiple of 13.5. In the final analysis shareholders will simply have to ask themselves if the management that got into such a mess deserves backing.</p>

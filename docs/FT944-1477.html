			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beckman's better times Sir, To those who have been reluctantly bearish recently, but always looking for a silver lining, hope springs from an unexpected quarter. In a mostly well-reasoned article (In the Pink: 'Batten down for a bear to beware', December 10), Bob Beckman writes '. . .it would not be unreasonable to expect the bear market that began in February 1994 to be one of the longest and deepest ever experienced'. I have been reading those of Bob Beckman's market forecasts published in the press as long as he has been making them and, so far as I can recall, they have invariably been wrong and usually in spades. I look forward to the future with (a tiny bit more) confidence. H L Benjamin. 22 Shrewsbury House, Cheyne Walk, London SW3</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Court approves TWA plan TRANS World Airlines, the US carrier, yesterday won approval from a Delaware bankruptcy court for its 'plan of reorganisation' after a day of hearings. This should allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within the next few weeks. TWA entered bankruptcy in early 1992, when the company was still owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the US financier. Mr Glenn Zander, one of two co-chief executives at TWA, told the court that the airline's performance was consistent with projections contained in its reorganisation plan, and claimed that the airline would be viable if it returned from bankruptcy. The carrier has yet to decide where it would base its ongoing operations; TWA has been operating from Mount Kisco, New York, where Mr Icahn's other business interests are based. Under the reorganisation, equity ownership would be split between employees, in return for wage concessions, and creditors, in exchange for debt forgiveness. USAir, in which British Airways holds a minority stake, is acquiring five gates at Orlando airport in Florida from United Airlines, the larger Chicago-based carrier. USAir added that it planned to enter an agreement with United, under which the two carriers would provide code-sharing flights from areas in the north-eastern US to Miami, and then on to Latin America.</p>

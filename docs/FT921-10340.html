			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cook alleges cash fears in trust hospitals - Health MR ROBIN COOK, shadow health secretary, yesterday accused the government of 'cynically manipulating' information on the hospitals' financial status. His attack came as Labour rounded on the government's health service policies, using a leaked document it said showed 'worrying' financial crises at a number of trust-status hospitals. He said the document, from the National Health Service's management executive, indicated that 86 NHS trusts and directly managed hospitals were running up deficits of more than Pounds 100,000. Some were reaching millions of pounds. 'Most of them are being forced to clear this deficit within two months by slamming the brakes on patient care,' Mr Cook said. Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, reacted angrily at the use of 'stolen' documents for party political advantage. He said it was 'nonsense' to use figures showing deficits equivalent to 0.01 per cent of the NHS budget as a horror story. The document did not include other trust hospitals which are in surplus, Mr Waldegrave said. The service was in balance over the whole of last year. Later on BBC radio, however, Mr Waldegrave acknowledged 'particular problems in particular hospitals'. Mr Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS management executive, said: 'The document is straightforward monthly management reporting.' However, Mr Cook said the document highlighted the continued underfunding of the health service which Labour would seek to restore if it won the general election. Mr Cook said, however, that NHS managers had divided hospitals with financial deficits into 'hot spots' and 'tepid spots', while the document euphemistically referred to bad publicity as 'noise'. The first priority of civil servants was to 'keep the truth out of the news,' Mr Cook said.</p>

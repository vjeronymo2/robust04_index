			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Gatt law supporters in Senate offensive Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader in the US Senate, said yesterday he would hold a rare post-election session of Congress 'if necessary' to achieve US ratification of the Uruguay Round trade legislation by the end of this year. Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the senate commerce committee, meanwhile showed no sign of backing down from his intention to delay the legislation for 45 working days by holding 'a nationwide debate' over US trade policy. This would keep the legislation off the senate floor until after the congressional elections on November 8. It has been expected that the House would vote next Wednesday to approve the Uruguay Round deal. But members who have come under strong pressure from Gatt opponents may prefer to delay a vote until after the election. A delay in the House vote until November might also be beneficial in the Senate, where Republicans such as Senator Robert Dole, minority leader, seem tempted to use the issue for partisan advantage. The Senate Finance Committee yesterday approved the legislation by a 19-0 vote. Senator Dole did not vote on the pact and has refused to say if he will support it. Senator Hollings, a longtime supporter of the textile industry, can delay Senate action under special 'fast-track' rules, which require a Yes or No vote on legislation implementing trade deals. Chairmen of committees that have jurisdiction over the legislation have 45 days to hold hearings. The American Textile Manufacturers' Institute yesterday said it was surprised by the senator's move to delay the Senate vote. 'This legislation includes some vitally important provisions for the US textile industry,' it said. Damage done to textile producers by phasing out quotas would be offset by inclusion of a rule of origin that prevents countries from circumventing quota limits, it said. Kept busy by healthcare, foreign policy and partisan attacks, President Bill Clinton has had little opportunity to sell the benefits of the trade pact. During the formal end-of-summit press conference with the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, he took the opportunity to urge approval of the Gatt agreement and advertise its merits. 'This is the biggest trade agreement in history,' he said. 'It will give us 300,000 to 500,000 new high-wage jobs in the next few years.' The foes of the Gatt deal have taken up Senator Hollings as a hero. 'We're impressed with Senator Hollings's courage on this issue,' said Mr Andrew Wheat, spokesman for the Gatt Project. Ms Caroline Kazdin, legislative director of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, said the senator was doing the country 'a big service by bringing the substance of this thing to the public eye'. Polls suggest most voters know nothing about the Gatt deal, but when it is explained to them, they oppose it, she said. Although even most of the opponents believe the legislation will ultimately pass, they are by no means giving up their campaign against US ratification of the trade treaty.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Dec. 8 (YONHAP) -- The Russian Government  said Tuesday that North Korea's acceptance of partial nuclear  inspection represents a step forward, but not sufficient enough  to lead to a fundamental solution of the problem.    North Korea's expression of its willingness to accept  international inspection on some nuclear facilities showed it  was turning to a positive position in light of the opinion of  the international community, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Gregory  Karasin told reporters.    The proposal does not, however, lead to a fundamental  solution of the problem, which calls for full implementation of  its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and a  guarantee of uninterrupted nuclear inspection, Karasin said.    The Russian Government hopes the problem of banning nuclear  proliferation on the Korean peninsula will be resolved through  constructive dialogue and mutual cooperation between North Korea  and the International Atomic Energy Agency at an early date, he  said.</p>

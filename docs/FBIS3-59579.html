The silicate glass  withstands temperatures up to 550 degrees Celsius as well as  attacks by aggressive chemicals. "Also, Foturan can be optimally  combined with other materials into hybrid structures," muses  Burkhard Speit, head of product development for the optical  business sector at Schott Glassworks in Mainz, in whose  laboratories the special glass was developed.    Originally, Foturan was to be used by Siemens AG for the  construction of flat screens. But the Munich electronics group  halted the development of flat tubes--and Schott had to look for  other users for his wonderglass. They were soon found: Sensors  for high-temperature application, for example, are being made  based on Foturan. The Schott strategists now hope also to  establish their silicate glass as a material for microsystem  technology.    Foturan can--partly irradiated with ultraviolet light and  then etched--be made into tiny mold parts. It is also suitable  for the manufacture of perforated boards. The people in Mainz  have already managed up to 800 holes per square centimeter. "We  see application possibilities for example in mountings for  optical waveguide fibers."    In the development of new materials for microscopically  small  components, the experience from the world of macrosystems can  only be conditionally applied. "Often the mechanical properties  of materials for components in the microfield are totally  different from construction with normal sizes," according to  Professor Erwin Sommer, head of the Fraunhofer Institute for  Material Mechanics (IWM) in Freiburg.    Right now, materials experts in industry and at research  institutes are primarily occupied with optimization of already  available materials, such as certain synthetics or ceramics, for  their use in the microsystem field. By means of filmy-thin  coatings, improvements in the process technology or--much  simpler--the correct combination of various materials,  "completely satisfactory solutions can be achieved" (Sommer) for  the microsystems planned at this time.    The development of totally new, to some extent tailor-made  materials, is still not pursued with any force, at least for the  moment. The reason for this is simple. Schott researcher Speit  says: "We want to push ahead with the use of microtechnology  systems; we do not want to wait five years for the development  of a totally new material."    At this time experts see the broadest application field in  medicine--and at the same time the adjustment of the working  material is the most difficult here. "We can only make use of a  palette of 20 materials, whose biocompatibility has been  attested to by the Federal Health Ministry," explains Bernd  Amecke, a microsystem expert at the pharmacological group of  Boehringer Ingelheim. When modifying them in order to optimize  them for certain microsystems he must apply for a new permit in  order to use them in human beings. And that takes time.    Obstacles of this kind can only briefly hold up the  materials  designers, however. That is because materials technology is  likely to play a dominant role as early as with the second or  third microtechnology generation, the concepts of which are  already being drafted in the industrial research departments.    Here the researchers will penetrate down to the molecular  structure of the materials. At the Max Planck Institute for  Polymer Research in Mainz people are combining molecules which  independently merge into new materials with the desired  properties. The head of the institute, professor Gerhard Wegener  says: "It is as if bricks were to combine to form a wall on  command."    At the Institute for New Materials (INM) in Saarbruecken one  has also specialized in molecular puzzles. Here, for example,  glasses and ceramics for use in microsystems are being  optimized, by deliberately contaminating them with tiny foreign  particles. The particles are so small that a quadrillion of them  can fit on a pinhead.    The result of this molecular material composition is  so-called smart materials, intelligent materials, which under  varying pressure conditions can change their stability. "The  trend in microsystem technology in the next few years is  unequivocally heading toward increasingly intelligent  materials," confirms INM employee Herbert Krug and confidently  promises: "Technically we have already mastered it."</p>

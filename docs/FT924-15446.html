			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Pressure builds on Craxi as son leaves politics MR Vittorio 'Bobo' Craxi, the son of Italy's Socialist party leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, is withdrawing from politics after a series of allegations and setbacks in the wake of the Milan political corruption scandal. The younger Mr Craxi, a leading member of the Socialist party organisation in Italy's second city, seemed set until recently to follow in his father's footsteps, possibly to the top of the party developed by his father into a linchpin of recent coalition governments. Pressure is also building up on Mr Craxi senior to step down as party leader. Last week he attacked Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister and his heir-apparent, for 'disloyalty' for his increasing calls for change in the party. The Socialists, and the Craxis in particular, have been tainted by the growing revelations of political corruption in big Italian cities. Milan has been a traditional Socialist stronghold and remains the powerbase for the Craxi family. Mr Bettino Craxi's sister is married to Mr Paolo Pillitteri, the previous Socialist mayor of Milan, who is one of a group of MPs now under investigation for alleged fraud and receiving kickbacks. Though no charges have been brought against Mr 'Bobo' Craxi, he has complained of being regularly insulted by strangers and of being taken for guilty when actually innocent. Revelations of political corruption have been mushrooming following the discovery last week of a fraud in the Abruzzo region in southern Italy leading to the arrest of seven of the 11 members of the regional administration. Meanwhile, the Christian Democrats, Italy's biggest political party, named Mr Mino Martinazzoli as their next leader to replace Mr Arnaldo Forlani. Mr Forlani was one of the triumvirate of powerbrokers along with Mr Craxi and Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister, in the previous coalition government. Mr Martinazzoli will be formally appointed at the party's next congress, due later this month. Senior party members welcomed his appointment as a symbol of the change needed for the party to regain electoral support. In local elections in the northern province of Mantua last week, the Christian Democrats' share of the vote dropped by over a third. The Christian Democrats lost ground in northern Italy in last April's general elections.</p>

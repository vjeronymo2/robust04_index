			<p>BFN     [Text] Cordoba, 28 Jun (NA) -- Manuel Mondino, the National  Commission for Atomic Energy [CNEA] chairman, has denied that  the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Cordoba is  being reconsidered and holds journalists responsible for  disseminating inaccurate reports on this issue.    The CNEA chairman categorically stressed that "no decision  has been made." He added that "a decision may be made by the  end of the year, if it is made at all."    Mondino was very angry with journalists. He stressed that  neither "the National Government, the CNEA, nor anyone else has  ever discussed the construction of a second nuclear power plant."    Mondino described as "nonsense" reports released during  President Carlos Menem's visit to Canada, where Menem addressed  the issue.</p>

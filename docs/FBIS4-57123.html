After attending a military parade, they discussed trade  and economic relations between the two countries.    Brazilian-Romanian trade last year stood at $38 million.  Brazil exports iron ore, instant coffee, and soybean bran to  Romania; and it imports transformers, roller bearings, and  railroad ties.    According to Itamaraty advisers, negotiations are under way  for Brazilian companies to participate in the modernization of  Romanian highway, railway, and telecommunications systems.    After their meeting, Franco and Vacaroiu had lunch at  Itamaraty. In his welcome speech, Franco said the political and  economic changes that had taken place in Romania will pave the  way for strengthening economic and political relations between  the two countries.</p>

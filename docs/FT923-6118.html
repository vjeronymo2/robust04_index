			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: TWA and pilots agree terms over restructuring TRANS World Airlines, the debt-laden carrier operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, yesterday took a significant step towards emerging from bankruptcy through an agreement in principle with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). ALPA, the last union to accept TWA's reorganisation plan, said pilots had agreed to reduce the costs of wages and benefits by 15 per cent, with offsets, for three years. The union said it had received 'contractual language to transfer pilots' jobs in the event of asset sales, to set requirements for addressing TWA's pension shortfall, and to ensure appropriate changes to operational structure'. Mr Bill Compton, chairman of TWA pilots union, said his executive hoped the restructuring would lead to a rebirth of TWA. 'With agreements involving the flight attendants and machinists recently accomplished, our agreement will, upon ratification, complete TWA's needed cost reductions and enable labour and the creditors to assist in implementing the required improvements to TWA's revenue-generating capacity.' The company's creditors committee, which has agreed to the stand-alone reorganisation, will forgive about Dollars 1bn of the carrier's roughly Dollars 1.5bn in debt in exchange for a 55 per cent equity stake in TWA.</p>

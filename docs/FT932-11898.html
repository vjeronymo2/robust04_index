			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore loss reduced MERIVALE Moore, the property company, cut pre-tax losses in the six months to December 31 from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds 747,000. The shares advanced 10p to 49p, a new high for the year. Mr Grenville Dean, chairman, said: 'These figures, whilst no cause for euphoria in themselves, suggest that the blood letting has been arrested and that the company has commenced its recovery.' For the rest of the year he said shareholders could look forward to much better news as a result of the Pounds 5m settlement of its claims for damages concerning the collapse of a building and improved trading conditions. Turnover for the six months was Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 12.2m). The pre-tax result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 4.08m). Losses per share were 3.66p (7.9p). The interim dividend is omitted - 1p was paid previously but the final was passed.</p>

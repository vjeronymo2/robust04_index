			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Kuwait defence pact lifts UK hopes of sales A UK-KUWAITI defence agreement signed yesterday should produce 'valuable orders for British industry,' according to Mr Tom King, British defence secretary. He indicated that he had discussed supplies of equipment including Vickers Challenger 2 tanks and GKN Warrior armoured fighting vehicles. Kuwait is also thought to be interested in naval vessels from the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard, which is supplying minehunters to Saudi Arabia. Vosper is part of a British consortium with the construction companies Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey which has been selected to rebuild and upgrade Kuwait's main naval base. This contract alone is expected to be worth up to Pounds 200m. Kuwait is awaiting delivery of 16 Tucano trainer aircraft from Short Brothers which it bought before the 1990 Gulf crisis and is thought to be interested in British Aerospace Hawk jet trainers. However, UK hopes of orders totalling some Pounds 1bn are tempered by the certainty of strong competition. Sheikh Ali Salah al-Salem al-Salah, the Kuwait defence minister, said yesterday a similar defence pact was planned with France and other countries. One has been concluded with the US. 'In due time you might hear about other agreements,' the minister said. Yesterday's memorandum of understanding, which Mr King said would be 'the father of other understandings' in specific areas, also covers training assistance and joint exercises, the first of which is due to take place in early May involving the UK navy and Royal Marines.</p>

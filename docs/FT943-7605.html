			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The Bundesbank disappointed the market again last week by failing to return to variable rate repos. Instead, by ordering two more rounds of fixed-rate tenders at an unchanged 4.85 per cent, it demonstrated that it remained on guard against inflation. Provisional cost-of-living figures, due this week, are expected to nudge back over 3 per cent. While economists have already written this off as a temporary blip in the steady down-trend, they acknowledge that the shift towards the Bundesbank's 2 per cent ideal is decelerating. Since the German bond market and the economy appear to be recovering without any central bank intervention - the last discount rate cut was made more than three months ago - there appears to be no urgency about the next step. Meanwhile, the bank has to contemplate the disruptive potential of two important domestic rituals looming in the next few months: federal elections and the annual wages round. While neither will have an immediate monetary effect, there is no accounting for the impact on sentiment as the campaigning gets under way. There are also disturbing signs that unions are pushing for a return to real income growth in defiance of the Bundesbank's insistence that years of anti-inflationary restraint are needed.</p>

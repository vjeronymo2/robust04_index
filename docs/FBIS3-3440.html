Shumeyko, also chairman of the conference, made the  statement  at the opening ceremony of the conference's fourth session held  in St. Petersburg.    He stressed that the CIS members should make joint efforts  to  tide over the economic crisis which the 12 countries have  suffered since the 1991 disintegration of the former Soviet  Union.    Only eight of the 16 CIS states, including Russia, Belarus,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia,  attended the conference.    The conference today also approved its own peacekeeping  role,  saying it should take an active part in resolving regional and  ethnic disputes on the CIS countries, including conflicts in  Abkhazia, Georgia, and in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan.</p>

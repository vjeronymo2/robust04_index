			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy activity in Racal The unwinding of a big stock overhang and some determined buying by at least two of the market's most influential securities houses helped Racal Electronics shares to improve on exceptionally heavy turnover. Racal ended the session 1 1/2 higher at 63p with turnover reaching 27m shares, the heaviest since the placing of Williams Holdings' near 10 per cent stake in the group on April 29. Electronics specialists said a large stock overhang, of around 7.5m shares, had finally been cleared and the market was now concentrating on Racal's preliminary figures, scheduled for June 10, and details of the demerger of Chubb, Racal's security locks and alarms business. It was said that after the demerger both companies will emerge as bid targets. County NatWest and SG Warburg Securities have both been strong supporters of Racal. County put a demerged valuation of 75p a share on Racal. Fisons advance Speculation of a bidder for part of Fisons plus talk that a big US investment bank was buying stock in the market helped shares in the pharmaceuticals group to rise sharply. Fisons was the biggest percentage gainer in the FT-SE 100 index with a jump of 13 to 363p on turnover of 1.3m shares. The share responded to a Sunday newspaper report suggesting retail chemist Boots might bid for Fisons' consumer healthcare business. Boots, which is expected to announce annual profits of around Pounds 365m on Thursday was weak earlier but closed 2 better at 484p. A number of analysts said they anticipated the sale of the consumer division some time this year. One said there were several possible buyers and Boots was one of them although it was 'not renowned for paying above the odds'. Firmness in the US and enthusiasm in the UK helped some pharmaceuticals stocks, particularly SmithKline Beecham, which gained 10 to 925. SmithKline lifted on talk that agency broker James Capel had published a buy recommendation on the stock and realisation that the company's anti-nausea drug, Kytril, was doing well in France. The shares, a third of which are held in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts, also benefited from a stronger dollar. Tightly-traded Reckitt &amp; Colman was helped by a technical squeeze with some pointing to an agency cross. The shares picked up 10 to 650p on turnover of 2.7m shares. Smith &amp; Nephew slipped 3 to 150p reflecting disappointment over an anticipated sale. The group said the proposed sale of its Solpak generic drugs division in the US for Dollars 19m (Pounds 10.5m) to Ivax had fallen through. USM-listed research group ML Laboratories jumped 60 to 958p. The group is awaiting a product licence for a kidney dialysis substitute, but analysts said the company was not hinting at any imminent news and the leap in the share price was probably prompted by technical reasons. Seventy five per cent of the shares are held by one trust and, consequently, they move sharply on very little volume. Wellcome was weak as the market reacted to news that US rival Bristol Myers Squibb was seeking expanded use for its anti-aids drugs Videx, a direct competitor to Wellcome's Retrovir. The shares fell 8 to 972p. Midland Bank, up 4 to 421, was among the front runners in a generally firm banks sector, and easily outpaced the wider market, after news that Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking (HSBC), via its broker James Capel, had moved into the market last Friday and purchased a block of 5m Midland shares at 415p. The purchase saw HSBC's stake in Midland increased to 15.225 per cent. NatWest Bank attracted keen support after a broker's profits upgrading, the shares closing 6 firmer at 358p. Lloyds Bank, given a push by the banks team at Smith New Court, edged up 3 to 439p. The Scottish banks moved in opposite directions, with one broker said to be recommending a switch between the two stocks. Royal Bank of Scotland, increasingly viewed as a takeover candidate, edged ahead to 199p after heavy turnover of 4.7m shares, but Bank of Scotland slipped 2 to 116p. Vodafone, shaken last week by the relatively low valuations inferred by the merger of Centel and Sprint, two US telecoms groups, continued to suffer from international selling, the shares dipping 10 to 374p on heavy turnover of 6m. Vodafone is scheduled to announce preliminary figures on June 9. Although restrained by the weakness of the UK and US stock markets, the oil sector continued to attract some good international support as crude oil prices moved up to their best levels for around six months. BP and Shell eased 1 1/2 and 2 to 272p and 512p respectively albeit in rather thin trading. And the Wytch Farm participants were not harmed by valuations put on the 17.5 per cent holding in the oil field to be auctioned off by Atlantic Richfield (Arco). There were suggestions in the market yesterday that some of the utilities, notably the power generators, could well be interested in acquiring Arco's stake. Asda remained firm at 33 1/2 p with one analyst saying investors were beginning to wake up to the beneficial effects of the flotation of the MFI furniture store chain which is expected to reduce the retailer's heavy debts by at least Pounds 75m. Discount retailer Amber Day rose 6 1/2 to 64p on a turnover of 950,000 shares following rumours of a possible takeover bid for the company. British Aerospace eased 3 to 350p, as turnover reached 1.3m shares. There was talk in the market that the company will announce 600 redundancies, from its satellite division, today. Takeover speculation was also heard in Thomas Cowie, whose shares rose 3 to 162p. Bid candidate Dowty shed 5 to 173p, to fall below the the 175p cash alternative offered by its predator TI, 3 lighter at 682. In hotels and leisures, Forte closed 4 lighter at 235p after a Smith New Court profits downgrading. The broker reduced its current-year forecast by Pounds 13m to Pounds 112m, the following year's by a hefty Pounds 28m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (108).

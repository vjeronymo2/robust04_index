			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 18 (XINHUA) -- President Islam  Karimov hosted a grand banquet here this evening to welcome  Chinese Premier Li Peng, who arrived earlier today for a  three-day official visit.    Proposing a toast, Karimov said that the friendship between  the peoples of China and Uzbekistan can be traced to centuries  ago, when the "silk-road linked them together."    "There is every reason to revitalize this road today, when  conditions are ripe for developing full-scale bilateral friendly  cooperation," he said.    Premier Li Peng's visit marks the beginning of a new era in  the relations between Uzbekistan and China, he said.    As many Chinese entrepreneurs are tavelling with Premier Li  Peng, this provides a good opportunity for expanding bilateral  trade and economic cooperation, he noted.    The direct links now existing between the businesses and  localities of the two countries will undoubtedly bear fruits of  cooperation, he said.    Karimov spoke highly of China's reform and opening, saying  Uzbekistan is following closely with what is happening in China  and expects China to push ahead along the path, so as to make  greater contributions to mankind.    Li Peng, in his reply, said the warm reception accorded  himself and his entourage reflects the profound friendly  feelings the people of Uzbekistan hold towards their Chinese  counterparts.    He noted that the traditional friendship between the two  peoples entered a new stage after Uzbekistan became independent  and has been consolidated and furthered since then.    As China is concentrating on its modernization drive, it  needs a good international environment and follows an  independent foreign policy of peace, Li said.    "We are ready to develop ties with all countries on the  basis  of the five principles of peaceful coexistence," he said. "In  particular, we attach importance to developing good-neighborly  relations of friendship and cooperation with the neighboring  nations."    Li said he expected to have indepth discussions with  President Karimov and other leaders of Uzbekistan on bilateral  ties, regional and international issues.    Also, he expressed the conviction that this visit would  serve  to enhance the mutual understanding and cooperation in all  fields between the two countries.    He agreed with Karimov that the silk-road should be  revitalized, saying China would work towards that.</p>

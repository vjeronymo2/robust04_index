			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Shukai (6392 2885 0481): "Let Peasants </F> Enter Labor Market Freely"]    [Text] The superiority of the market system lies in its  competitiveness. That is, a market system achieves the optimal  allocation of resources through competition among the various  major players on the market. When government regulates the  market, the foremost objective should be to protect competition,  that is, preserving a level playing field for all participants  in market competition. As far as the labor market is concerned,  a level playing field means that the worker has the freedom to  enter or leave the market and the freedom to participate in  market competition on his own worth. When government intervenes  in the market not to protect such freedom but to decide whether  a worker has the right to enter the market based on government  wishes and to use administrative power to determine market  choices, the resultant labor market will not offer a level  playing field and is therefore not a genuine market.    In the current rural migration, rural workers spontaneously  enter the labor market. At the same time, they also  spontaneously create a labor market. Peasants entering the labor  market and peasants creating a labor market are the two sides of  one single process: the marketization of the employment  mechanism. In this sense, rural migration may be described as an  important engine of the marketization of the Chinese economy.  Changes in the rural macroeconomic system have given peasants  the freedom to operate and contract land on their own and the  freedom to leave the soil and find work elsewhere. Through  regional migration, such freedom has translated into the freedom  to enter the labor market, which i a key source of the energy  that has revitalized the rural economy, even the enter  urban-rural economy. To consolidate and further the achievements  of reform, we should protect this particular freedom for  peasants. At a deeper level, this freedom is not yet whole,  given the fact that peasants are still being hamstrung by a  social personal management system truncated along urban-rural  lines. It follows that to deepen reform, we must change the ID  system that treats urban and rural areas differently.  <H8>  1 </H8>   A permit system for peasants who wish to work elsewhere has  emerged in some areas in recent years. Under the permit system,  a rural worker who wants to leave his village to find work in  other places is required to apply to the county or township  government for an "out-of-town work permit" (abbreviated  hereafter as "work permit"). According to information from the  agencies involved, if the examination and approval agency in the  labor-exporting jurisdiction thinks the applicant has no  well-defined job search objective, it may try to dissuade him  from leaving and refuses to issue him a permit. Hiring units in  importing jurisdictions hire workers on the basis of work  permits; a person without a work permit would not be given a  job. The system is most prevalent in several leading rural  labor-importing and exporting provinces and regions in east  China, south China, and southwestern China. Taking this practice  one step further, some agencies have suggested that peasants be  required to produce a work permit before they can buy a train  ticket. These days the work permit system is being publicized by  some in the mass media a major innovation in reform. Recently we  went to the Zhu Jiang delta area in Guangdong, which has a heavy  concentration of rural migrants from other provinces, to do a  preliminary study.    Estimates put the non-local work force in Guangdong at 6.5  million, 10 million if we include the floating population on the  move between counties and municipalities in the province.  Non-local workers are concentrated in the Zhu Jiang Delta area  and large and medium-sized cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and  Zhuhai. Owing to the lack of statistical data, and because of  the complex nature of the distribution of rural migrants, we do  not as yet have a complete picture of the magnitude of the  out-ogh[f-province work force in Guangdong consisting of workers  with a work permit. Nor do we know how many enterprises in the  province (including individual hiring units) require a worker to  produce a work permit before hiring him. Our study mainly took  the form of interview and focused on state enterprises, the  three kinds of enterprises that are either wholly or partially  foreign-funded, rural collective enterprises, individual private  enterprises, as well as grass roots governments in such places  as Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shenzhen. In Zhongshan,  according to people in charge of the municipal agricultural  commission, township and town enterprises are required to demand  that an outside worker produce a work permit as a condition for  employment. However, township and town enterprises are  themselves a complicated lot. It is hard to tell how many of  them actually comply with this regulation. Comrades in Foshan  told us the same story. We visited Foshan Electrical Lighting  Company, Ltd., a large enterprise that has a rule explicitly  requiring nonnative workers to produce a work permit. The  enterprise has 5,000 workers, most of them from other provinces.  In the workshop we interviewed several workers from Jiangxi,  Hubei, and Guangxi, all of whom found work here on the  recommendation of fellow villagers, classmates, or relatives and  all of whom had work permits. Workers from southern Jiangxi said  they were charged 200 yuan each to get a work permit back home.  The rate was 60 yuan in Guangxi and 40 yuan in Hubei. We also  visited two enterprises in Foshan, one of them an aluminum  plant. A Sino-Hong Kong joint venture, it hired almost 1,000  people, about one-third from outside Guangdong. The other was a  Taiwan-funded knit sock factory with 500 employees, including  more than 100 from outside Guangdong. According to a factory  leader, no work permit was required. At the aluminum plant, a  young fellow from Hengyang in Hunan Province told us it was  possible to get a job there without a work permit. It would have  cost him 60 yuan to get a work permit back home, so he simply  decided not to get one. In Lishui township in Nanhai Shi, the  township chief said there were 15,000 nonlocal workers in the  township. To find a job in the township, a person must produce  his ID card and a document certifying that he is unmarried (or a  birth control card), but not a work permit. We also visited  several individual private enterprises in the Zhu Jiang Delta.  They required no work permit, not even an unmarried certificate  (or birth control card). We checked out several large hotels,  shopping centers, restaurants, clothing stores, and small shops  in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. None of them required a work permit  for hiring. For instance, neither Guangdong Guest-house in  Guangzhou nor Jingdu Hotel in Shenzhen, three-star and four-star  establishments, respectively, had a work permit requirement.    Our preliminary impression is that among enterprises in the  public sector, a portion, but only a small portion, have indeed  adopted the work permit system, but it is impossible to estimate  how many enterprises actually do so. Among nonpublic  enterprises, particularly miscellaneous private enterprises,  such as small eateries, restaurants, clothing stores, and small  shops, a work permit is not a prerequisite. As to whether there  are individual enterprises which make employment conditional  upon a work permit, we don't know. In terms of geographical  distribution, places like Foshan and Zhongshan in the delta  region do require a work permit, while large- and medium-sized  cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou do not. Nor do enterprises in  the development zone in Guangzhou.    In determining whether or not a practice or system is  necessary or appropriate, we cannot just look at the initial  results. A sound practice or system may not produce satisfactory  results in the early days of implementation, but that does not  make it any less sound. In fact it may become more and more  vital over time. A bad practice or system may be very vibrant at  the beginning, but it could still remain a bad system or  practice. The people's commune, for instance, took the nation by  storm in just a few months, but this is no proof that it was a  historically correct choice. It owed its explosive expansion  primarily to its coercive adoption by administrative forces. In  evaluating the work permit system, therefore, we cannot use the  number of enterprises and localities that have adopted the  system as a yardstick. What is even more important is to analyze  the actual impact of its operation on social economic  development. Is it consistent with the direction of  marketization? Does it facilitate the creation of a market  economy, particularly the healthy maturation of a labor market?  <H8>  2 </H8>   The system of requiring peasants who wish to leave home to  find work to secure a work permit has been endorsed by some  sectors. At one point we too considered it a good way to reduce  haphazard migration and promote orderly migration. Armed with  the results of our study and after listening to the opinions of  enterprises and peasants, we reexamined the system from the  perspective of the inherent requirements of the market economy  and realized that the system should not be endorsed. We can go  even further and say it may be an artificial impediment to the  entry of rural workers into the market.    There was an objective background for the emergence of the  work permit system. Rural migration that involves a massive  number of peasants may cause extreme social stresses. To begin  with, it has strained the rail and transport sectors to the  breaking point. Migrants could not be successfully distributed  and resulted in explosive concentrations. Secondly, importing  areas were overwhelmed by the flood of migrants pouring in. Many  workers could not find jobs right away, constituting an army of  unemployed migrants and causing a string of problems. They are a  source of concern for all society, particularly government. Some  labor-exporting and importing areas got together to work out a  solution. Hence the "work permit" system. A labor-exporting  jurisdiction issues a permit at the end of an examination and  approval process and lets a person go. The labor-importing  jurisdiction hires people when they can produce a work permit.  That way a basic balance is achieved between labor supply and  demand, thus avoiding haphazard rural migration. Looking back  now, we see that a lot of thought had gone into the system. Had  a government plan been the principal mechanism for creating jobs  for peasants, then such a system will invariably prove  effective. However, the enterprise system has now changed. Just  look at the hiring system alone. In the wake of the  diversification of the organizational formats of enterprises,  the employment practices of enterprises have also diversified.  In a market economy, it is an enterprise's right to decide whom  to hire. Suppose the person with no permit is the right person  for the job in question while another person with a permit is  the wrong man for the job. What should an enterprise do? On the  other hand, rural migrants are not solely motivated to find a  job in a particular enterprise. Many of them create their own  employment opportunities. In effect what they do is to recommend  themselves for a job, dispensing with the services of a  recruiter. Under these circumstances, the work permit is bound  to run into difficulties in practice.    The very design of the work permit is fraught with  limitations. It is a mere reaction to rural migration. Its  objective was to slow the tidal wave of rural migrants by  limiting the peasant's freedom of movement. Such a government  act, which revolves around restriction, overlooks the personal  freedom peasants have won since reform went under way and  ignores the employment autonomy enjoyed by enterprises in the  wake of reform. It may have some positive effects, but is  essentially negative and runs counter to the marketization of  employment.    Although government agencies in some labor-exporting and  importing localities work in concert to drum up support for the  work permit system, things are largely beyond their control.  Only very few employment areas fall within their sphere of  influence. At the labor-exporting end, most rural workers about  to join other rural migrants ignore the work permit system,  leaving home as soon as they get hold of an ID card and applying  for a work permit only as a last resort. At the labor-importing  end, enterprises subject to extensive government intervention  often have no choice but to go along with it reluctantly. As for  enterprises beyond the reach of direct government intervention,  they simply turn a blind eye to the system. Some governments at  the grass root and autonomous organizations even consider it  superfluous and refuse to cooperate with it. As a result, it is  not surprising that the system has not been as effective as  anticipated earlier in curbing haphazard migration. Judging from  the situation in some township and town enterprises in the Zhu  Jiang Delta, the decrease in the haphazard influx of rural  migrants has more to do with self-regulation by peasants than  with the functioning of the work permit system.    While the system's potential for good may not have been  fully  tapped, its adverse effect -- its direct erosion of the  peasants' rights and interests -- has been surprisingly  striking. In some localities, therefore, most peasants do not  just dislike the work permit system but are vehemently opposed  to it. First of all, it has made the economic burden on peasants  even heavier. The typical labor-exporting area is an  economically underdeveloped province or region where peasants'  earnings are low to begin with. They shoulder a heavy burden and  some are still struggling to feed and clothe themselves. When  these peasants hit the road to join the rural migration, their  main objective is to make a living. Yet local governments charge  an exorbitant fee for issuing a piece of paper, lining the  pockets of a department in the name of "bringing about orderly  migration." Peasants interviewed complained about the  unreasonableness of having to part with anywhere from 80 to 100  yuan even before they could find out how much they could make by  leaving home to look for work elsewhere. Some peasants said it  really hurt to have to pay such a hefty sum for a document,  considering that they could not even afford to send their  children to school. Second, peasants' employment autonomy has  been violated. In the past the people's commune controlled the  peasant's personal freedom administratively. Since reform went  under way, peasants have won the right to control their own  labor autonomously. Should they stay on the soil and farm the  land? Or should they go elsewhere to find work? This is a  peasant's basic right as an independent commodity producer and  operator. It is this right that has enabled peasants to utilize  their talents in many fields and carve out a niche of the market  economy for themselves ahead of others. Now government wants to  reassert control over peasants through the work permit system.  If they want to leave town, they need approval. If they want a  permit, they need to pay a fee. This is tantamount to forcing  peasants to buy their "migration right." Clearly this puts up a  barrier to the development of a labor market. If we follow  through with this logic, maybe peasants should also be required  to obtain a permit before they can go to the city to buy food.  What about urban workers? Should we demand that they obtain a  permit too if they want to leave town to find work? Workers  should enter the market like commodities--freely. The only  difference is that the worker and his labor are inseparable,  which is why the worker should have the necessary personal  identification, namely the ID card. This is what is required  under the universal law of the development of a capital goods  market. If we mandatorily require a peasant to seek government  approval before he can enter the labor market, we in effect  reject the notion that the peasant is the master of his own  labor. This would constitute a new discriminatory policy.    Some peasant workers disclosed that getting a work permit  back home requires no examination-and-approval process. The only  condition is that they pay a fee. Cough up the money and you get  a permit. It all boils down to money. The permit-issuing  department does not have the slightest interest in where the  peasant is going or what he is going to do. The practice of  requiring a peasant to enter "work permit" market before  entering the labor market effectively negates the very rationale  put forward by government for instituting the work permit system.  <H8>  3 </H8>   Some jurisdictions have been trumpeting the advantages of  the  work permit system as follows. For one thing, they say, by  requiring peasants to apply for permission from and register  with the government, we get a better knowledge of the peasants  who join rural migration. For another, control by examination  and approval will decrease the number of peasants who leave town  without careful thinking. In fact, both arguments are  problematic. First of all, if we are interested in gathering  information, we need not go into the business of examination and  approval, just report-filing and registration, functions that  need not involve a government agency since the village committee  or villagers' group can take care of them. Secondly, on what do  the examination and permit-issuing agencies base their decision  whether or not a peasant is a haphazard rural migrant, thus  granting or denying him a work permit as the case may be? You  say a particular peasant is a thoughtless rural migrant. The  peasant would say otherwise. Mind you, more than anybody else  the peasant does not want to be a rural migrant willy-nilly  because he is solely responsible for the consequences of such  thoughtlessness. Besides, entering the labor market is  inherently haphazard to a certain extent. There is no market  economy without some measure of haphazardness. The market is  haphazard in that it is risky. The vitality of the market  mechanism is intrinsically linked to this haphazardness.  Haphazardness implies exploration and innovation. The way to  avoid any haphazardness is to have the government place you in a  job. Since that is not an option, the only thing the peasant can  do is to strike out on his own, not without a degree of  haphazardness, to look for or create a new job opportunity. We  can see that if we proceed to regulate rural migration in  accordance with the work permit mentality, the right to enter  the labor market will be at the mercy of the subjective  assumptions of some government personnel, and the labor market  will be malformed. The very act of peasants leaving their  villages in search of work crates a labor market in itself. The  labor market spontaneously created by peasants is the most  dynamic and extensive labor market in China these days.  Nationwide between 50 and 60 million rural migrants have found  work today, in an overwhelming majority of cases thanks to the  market created and opened up by the peasants themselves. China  has so many peasants that there is little hope the government  can solve the unemployment problem through planned allocation.  This innovation on the part of peasants is a historic  contribution. Needless to say, there is indeed an oversupply of  labor in some areas, leading to certain economic and social  contradictions. Be that as it may, we should not attempt to  solve problems encountered in the development of the market  economy by resorting to traditional managerial methods. In a  market economy, the worker is master of his own labor. In  realizing its use value through market exchange, the worker  should only submit to the test and selection of the market, not  that of a government agency. Mandatory prior selection by a  government agency is actually a kind of selection that is  baseless, or, shall we say, a kind of selection based on the  wishes of government officials. To use administrative methods to  decide outright who can enter the labor market and who cannot  based on the wishes of government officials effectively deprives  some workers of their right to enter the market. The resultant  labor market is an unjust market, not conducive to bona fide  market competition. The work-permit system would only succeed in  preventing the formation of a unified open labor market and  perhaps leads to corruption by government agencies.    To solve the labor oversupply problem in some areas, the  government should focus on developing and nurturing a market  information system that will provide peasants with information  services. First of all, where an individual worker goes is a  macroeconomic decision on the labor market. The question can and  should be answered by nobody but the worker himself. Only the  worker is in a position to answer the question properly. This is  because the worker knows his conditions and aspirations best and  it is he himself who must ultimately assume responsibility for  his decision and bear the full cost of any thoughtlessness on  his part. He has the most interest in securing the best  employment opportunity with the least cost. More than anybody  else, therefore, he is a cautious decisionmaker. Second,  regionally speaking the labor supply-demand situation is a  macroeconomic issue on the labor market. Workers themselves are  powerless to influence the situation. Even more important is  government participation. The market system is huge, intricate,  and ever-changing. Individual decision-making must be based on a  certain amount of information. It is precisely government's role  in a market economy to do the things that the market cannot or  cannot do well. Now the foremost thing that rural migrants  cannot do or cannot do well is information. Clearly it would be  putting the cart before the horse if the government does not do  what the workers themselves cannot do or cannot do well while  getting involved in things the workers can do or can do well.  Instead of doing information work, the government goes into the  business of examination and approval and permit-issuing  ostensibly to reduce haphazardness but actually making the  haphazardness worse. Faced with the critical and practical issue  of the inter-regional migration of rural workers, therefore,  what the government should do is to provide information  services. Specifically, this means the government capitalizing  on its ability to regulate and control the entire economy,  utilizing the modern mass media, and using comprehensive  government and nongovernment organizations, even organizing  special social forces, to monitor market movements, analyze  market trends, and supply market information, thus providing  favorable circumstances for decision-making by workers. Armed  with more timely information, workers can make decisions on  their own and worker migration will naturally become less  haphazard. Note that government information work cannot be  interpreted simplistically to mean the market disseminating  information through government or peasants obtaining market  information from government. Market activities per se are  information activities. The market is disseminating information  even as it operates. What the government should do is to create  the conditions for the highly effective dissemination of market  information, on the one hand, and directly gather and  disseminate market information, on the other.  <H8>  4 </H8>   Rural migration has directly led to three major social  problems: overburdening the railway system, losing control on  family planning, and rising crime. Certainly we need to face up  to these problems, but they must not become the rationale for  resorting to administrative tools to limit rural migration.    To ease the burden on the railroad system, we need to expand  the system's carrying capacity to meet the transportation needs  of a growing economy as a whole, not just rural migration. In  the short haul, transport capacity will continue to fall behind  the demand for transportation, so we need to impose suitable  restrictions to relieve the pressure on the railroads. But such  restrictions must be comprehensive instead of targeting the  peasants alone. Everybody is free to use the huge transportation  system... tourists, people who travel on business or to attend  meetings. Only peasants on the move in search of a livelihood  are barred. This does not make sense. Every time the economy  picks up steam, the bottleneck effects of the railroads become  more pronounced. But people do not point their fingers at an  excess of cargo. Yet every time the number of peasants riding  trains increases and the volume of passenger traffic exceeds the  capacity, peasants get the blame. This too is unjustifiable.  Rural migration has complicated population control. What we  should do is to look into ways of improving family planning work  even more closely, including reforming the present population  control policy in conjunction with the reform of the permanent  residency registration system. The idea is to make things  convenient for peasants as well as controlling population  growth. As part of its pregnancy testing program, a local family  planning department insisted that an elderly woman in her 70's  travel hundreds of li to bring home her daughter-in-law, who was  working out of town. Furthermore, the locality publicized this  incident as something worthy of emulation. This is blatant  peasant harassment. Why couldn't they have been more flexible?  Solving this string of problems involves an important  ideological issue: Should rural migration be made to suit the  management systems and work methods of yesteryear? Or should we  reform the latter to accommodate the new reality of rural  migration? The same principle applies to law and order.    Rural migration is inherent in the development of a market  economy. Migration leads to disorder on certain fronts, which we  may consider the social cost of reform. The leading candidate  for reform is not the peasantry, but the government management  system. This too is part of government reform.

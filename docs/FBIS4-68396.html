			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Simonov: "MFER Decision Could Lead to </F> Bank War"]    [Text] According to a decision of the board of the  MFER [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] of Russia, the  accounts of all exporters of strategically important raw  materials commodities must be transferred to 15 authorized  banks. Special exporters received their list yesterday, and they  are supposed to select their financial agent by 10 April of this  year. Otherwise, their export certificates could be  suspended.    [begin box]  <H5>  List of Authorized Banks </H5>   1) Alpha-Bank, 2) Vozrozhdeniye [Revival], 3) Inkombank  [Foreign Commercial Bank], 4) Kredobank [Credit Bank], 5)  Mezhkombank [Intercommercial Bank], 6) Mosbiznesbank [Moscow  Business Bank], 7) MEHATEP [Interbranch and Scientific-Technical  Program], 8) Mosstroybank [Moscow Construction Bank], 9)  International Financial Company, 10) Nezavisimost  [Independence], 11) United Export-Import Bank, 12) Stroyinvest  [Building Invest], 13) Stolichnyy [Capital], 14) TOKOBANK, 15)  Moscow City Commercial Bank of Industrial Construction Materials    [end box]    MFER justifies its decision with the need to strengthen and  streamline control over the custody of the receipts of special  exporters (only oil and oil products for the time being). For  example, Vladimir Koshel, chief of the main administration for  the protection of state interests of the MFER, declared that to  control special exporters through a large number of banks was  for him personally "a task beyond my strength," and, therefore,  only several representatives among the major banks were  assigned. The "fact of the concurrence of the banks to sign an  agreement with the MFER was the criterion for selection."    Of course, as it turned out, only these same 15 banks were  acquainted with the text of the MFER agreement, which, as a  result, ended up on the announced list. But, at the very least,  this looks strange. For example, several major banks that  specialize in servicing enterprises of the raw materials  branches were not acquainted with MFER's intentions (and,  consequently, they did not get on the cherished list) (among  these are the Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank],  International Moscow Bank, Imperial, Yugorskiy, Russian Credit,  Surgutneftegaz [Surgut Oil and Gas], Yurga, Neftekhimbank [Oil  and Chemical Bank], Zapsikombank [West Siberian Commercial  Bank], and Tyumenpromstroybank [Tyumen Industrial Construction  Bank]. Also absent from the list is the Vneshtorgbank [Foreign  Trade Bank], which handles the accounts of almost 30 percent of  the special exporters. At the same time, the little-known  Nezavisimost Bank, which was only registered on 2 March of last  year, was among the authorized banks, and also the Moscow Alpha  Bank, which has a rather remote relationship to servicing  special exporters (if, of course, it is not taken into account  that Petr Aven, the chairman of the bank board, headed the MFER  at one time).    However, as Mr. Koshel assured a KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondent, the list of authorized banks is not final in  nature. Thus, at the present time, allegedly, the Vneshtorgbank,  the International Moscow Bank, and Imperial have already been  added. Nevertheless, the exporters who are supposed to determine  the selection of a financial agent do not know about this.    There is also another problem. In the course of the next day  or two, the clients that are "moving" are supposed to notify  their partners about new payment requisitions and also pay off  credit indebtedness to the banks that service them. The process  of the shift of clients to other banks can also be complicated  by the fact that frequently the following item is included in  contracts on account servicing: The transfer is possible only  after the complete payment of debt to the previous financing  agent.    Finally, it cannot be ruled out that the newly-fledged banks  will not be able to observe one of the main  normatives--sufficiency of capital. It is possible that it was  this fact that troubled the Central Bank, with whom the  announced list was not coordinated. In an interview with  KOMMERSANT-DAILY, representatives of the bank, in particular,  declared that, if the MFER decision will not be revised, "they  will publicize facts on some of their so-called authorized  banks." To which Mr. Koshel responded that Dmitriy Tulin, a  deputy chairman of the Central Bank, who led the discussions  with the MFER, "either did not understand the employees of the  ministry, or he is doing the bidding of banks that are not among  those that are authorized." However, as became known, the  Central Bank in principle is not against the idea of limiting  the circle of banks that work with special exporters. Moreover,  according to some information, the Central Bank is actively  working on the compilation of its own list of their financial  agents.    There is no doubt that differences exist among the  departments, and also that the negligent attitude of the  controlling structures toward legislation is stimulating yet  another wave of bank wars for the right to service such a  profitable clientele. In addition, there are a lot of volunteers  for taking part in it and, probably, among the Russian  officials, more and more of those will be found who give  preference to one or another successful commercial structure.  Understandably, the MFER made its decision under pressure no  less than that which, in the words of Mr. Koshel, is being  experienced today by Dmitriy Tulin. It is also understandable  that lobbyist efforts of some banks will negate their appeals  for a banking fraternity.    [begin box]    In the opinion of a high-ranking MFER employee, whom the  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent was able to contact, the adopted  decision will not cause any serious damage to the development of  exports and banking activity in Russia. All of the special  exporters were notified ahead of time about the possibility of  such a step by the government. As for the list of banks with  whom the special exporters were authorized to interact, it, in  the opinion of the MFER representative, is quite broad.  Moreover, if any bank from among those that did not get on the  list submits an application on the conduct of operations as a  special exporter, the MFER will examine it without fail. The  MFER representative also noted that the initiative for the  adoption of the document did not come from the ministry, but  from First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Oleg Soskovets.    [end box]  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   A reduction in the authorized banks that service the  currency  accounts of special exporters constitutes a long-standing dream  of Russian currency controllers--everyone is trying to make life  easier for himself. On 30 March at the last meeting of the  governmental commission on current questions, Viktor Kunya, the  head of the Federal Currency and Export Control Service,  complained that the special exporters of oil each have several  currency accounts even in Russian banks. But the MFER,  cherishing a unified automated currency control system, at one  time nurtured the idea of reducing the number of authorized bank  holders of accounts of special exporters to 10, and a pertinent  draft even existed of an MFER agreement with selected banks.  Later, it is true, the necessity for such an agreement  disappeared, inasmuch as special exporters now, "at their own  desire" submit information to the MFER concerning the movement  of currency in their own currency accounts (which allows the  ministry to get the right that is not given it by the law on  currency regulation and currency control). However, considering  the decision of the aforementioned meeting of the commission on  current questions, which recommended to the Central Bank to  establish by 1 May the authorized banks that will be granted the  exclusive right to conduct currency operations associated with  the export of oil and oil products, the MFER, apparently,  decided to return to its old "compilation" and submit to the  Central Bank an already preliminarily worked out list of banks.  The final decision, of course, rests with the Central Bank.    In principle, the reduction in the number of authorized  banks  permitted to have the accounts of special exporters should be  looked at in the overall context of reinforced currency control,  which has been transformed, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has repeatedly  written, into a key element of foreign economic regulation. In  addition, the administrative pressure that Russian exporters  have long since felt on themselves, is now also being applied to  commercial banks as well.

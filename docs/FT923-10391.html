			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Long bond surrenders earlier advances THE benchmark 30-year US government bond yesterday morning briefly hit a high for the year before giving up all of its gains in afternoon trading as profit-taking and an unimpressive five-year note auction took their toll on prices. In late trading, the long bond eased  1/32 to 106 5/8 , yielding 7.435 per cent after soaring to 107 23/32 in morning trading on top of its one-point gain on Tuesday. Movement was less dramatic at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was quoted  1/32 higher to yield 4.25 per cent after adding about  1/8 at mid-day. The long end of the yield curve led the market through most of the day, reflecting the long bond's renewed popularity with investors after several weeks of lagging shorter-dated maturities. The morning excitement was generated by Tuesday's consumer confidence report, which fell to 61.0 in July from 72.6 the previous months. Although most analysts had expected a modest decline in the index, the larger-than-expected drop prompted renewed speculation that interest rates might fall even further. However, a disappointing auction of Dollars 10.51bn in five-year notes depressed prices. Although the average yield was in line with expectations at 5.56 per cent, there was some surprise that 45 per cent was allocated at the 5.57 per cent stop rate. Enthusiasm was dampened by forecasts of a drop in initial US jobless claims of about 11,000 for the week ended July 18. The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market. Fed Funds were quoted at 3 1/16 per cent in late trading. THE Italian government bond futures contract tumbled late in the afternoon following news that Mr Vicenzo Scotti, the Italian foreign minister, had resigned. The Italian bond market, which had witnessed a relatively quiet day until the resignation announcement, was likely to remain in a volatile state, dealers warned. The futures contract traded in a range of 92.60-92.85, but fell back to 92.15 on the news. THE UK government bond market is continuing to focus on funding concerns as speculation mounts over when the Bank of England will announce its next auction of stock. Dealers believe the Bank will make an announcement by Friday week, targeting either the far end or the medium area of the gilt market. The money supply figures released yesterday showed a significant pick-up in overseas buying of gilts in June, leading to speculation that the Bank could choose a 10-year auction stock as this maturity is more likely to appeal to foreign investors. Net sales to overseas investors jumped from Pounds 378m in May to Pounds 726m in June. Net sales to domestic investors fell from Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 936m. The futures market ended little changed with the Liffe contract, which opened at 98.02, trading at 98.03 by late afternoon. In the cash market, long-dated gilt prices drifted lower with the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 falling from 100 3/4 to 100 19/32 . FRENCH government bonds saw a sharp sell-off on fears about the referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Most of the losses were recouped by late afternoon, and the Matif futures contract ended at 105.48 after opening at 105.40. The futures contract had fallen as low as 105.18, but dealers described the sell-off as rather exaggerated. GERMAN government bonds opened on a weak note and moved in a narrow range with the Liffe bund futures contract trading between 87.22 and 87.40. The futures contract ended at 87.37, slightly up on Tuesday's close. JAPANESE government bonds rallied early yesterday, but the gains were wiped out by profit-taking later on. This left the cash and futures markets slightly lower on the day. The market opened on a firm note, helped by the strength of the US Treasury bond market overnight. The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield of 4.87 per cent, moving to 4.865 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 4.905 per cent. In the futures market, the September contract climbed from its opening of 105.15 to a high of 105.23, but later fell back to close at 105.06 on reasonably high volume. Short-term interest rates continued to slip, with the rate on three-month certificates of deposit nudging down from 4.03 per cent to 4.00 per cent.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush opens US ports to E Europe PRESIDENT Bush, in a major revision of US policy, yesterday threw open all US ports to former Soviet satellite nations and declared his intention 'to stimulate commercial trade between the US and the region'. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said the decision was another step to ending Cold War restrictions and welcoming eastern Europe into 'the international community of democratic nations'. The action had been taken, after an intensive inter-agency review, 'in recognition of the progress these countries have made toward democracy and the rule of law'. The new port policy follows other recent moves to expand US trade with eastern Europe. Last month, the Bush Administration extended duty-free trade benefits to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia under the US Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP suspends tariffs for certain products as a means of helping developing countries, and to promote free trade. This year's list gave benefits covering Dollars 337m (Pounds 198m) in trade, more than half of which went to east European countries. The new port policy maintains the same delineation between the Soviet Union and the eastern Europeans that the Bush Administration has retained on other trade matters. Export controls, for example, have been liberalised towards the eastern bloc more than for the Soviet Union, which is denied GSP benefits. The new port policy opens all US ports for commercial, cargo, passenger and fishing vessels from eastern European nations. In the past, access for ships from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania was severely limited. They could not enter 12 'high security' ports at all and they were required to give two weeks' notice before entering other ports. Albania was denied entry to all US ports. Now the six will be required to give only 24 hours' notice for any ports. Soviet ships must give two day's notice at 49 US ports and two week's notice at others. Access is totally denied at the 12 high security ports. The 12 ports now open to the former satellite countries but still closed to Soviet ships are: Charleston, South Carolina; Hampton Roads, Virginia; Honolulu, Hawaii; Kings Bay, Georgia; New London, Connecticut; Panama City, Florida; Pensacola, Florida; Port Canaveral, Florida; Port Hueneme, California; Port St. Joe, Florida; Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and San Diego, California. The Bush Administration last month signed a 'framework' trade agreement with Bulgaria, which grants most-favoured-nation trading status, entitling it to the lower tariffs the US offers most of its trading partners. Bulgaria, in turn, guaranteed US companies national treatment, ensuring that taxes and licensing fees are no higher for American companies in Bulgaria than domestic businesses.</p>

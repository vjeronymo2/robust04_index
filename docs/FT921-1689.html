			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Way clear for very big Paris library THIS morning the builders will arrive with their bulldozers at the Quai de la Gare in eastern Paris to begin work on the Bibliotheque de France, the new national library which is the latest and most controversial of the French government's recent architectural monuments. The project, known as the tres grande bibliotheque in France, has been clouded by controversy ever since Mr Dominique Perrault, its architect, unveiled his first designs for a building with sunken study cloister and giant glass storage towers. Mr Perrault had conceived a building in which the readers would be 'buried' underground in the cloister and the books, now in the old Bibliotheque Nationale at the back of the Palais Royal in central Paris, would be stacked in the 20-storey towers. His design provoked a storm of criticism in the French press and from scholars who claimed that France's academic treasures would be roasted by the sun streaming through the glazed towers. President Francois Mitterrand eventually agreed to consider the complaints, despite the opposition of Mr Jack Lang, his minister of culture, who still supported the original design. Mr Perrault was forced to modify his plans. The much-criticised glass towers have been scaled down in size and more of the books will be stored underground. Even so, the construction of the library, scheduled to start last November and to open in 1995, had to be delayed when a group of homeless families squatted on the Quai de la Gare site. They have moved away, however, and the Conseil Superieur des Bibliotheques, which runs France's libraries, has approved Mr Perrault's new design. So the builders are finally free to begin work on France's tres grande bibliotheque.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: OMV expects loss of Sch300m in quarter OMV Group, the Austrian-based oil company, expects to make a first-quarter loss of around Sch300m (Dollars 25.8m) following deteriorating conditions in its plastics and chemicals divisions. However Mr Siefried Meysel, chairman, said the company would stick to its dividend policy and increase last year's payout by 1 percentage point to 20 per cent of equity capital of Sch2.4bn. The company saw pre-tax profit slip to Sch1.72bn last year from Sch1.85bn in 1990. However a reduction in its tax liabilities led to a 75 per cent rise in after-tax profits, to Sch1.42bn from Sch810m. OMV, which has interests in oil refining, gas marketing, chemicals and plastics, saw increased sales in all sectors. Turnover rose 6.5 per cent to Sch82.9bn from Sch77.87bn. The company is making a push into eastern Europe; last year it opened 13 filling stations in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It has just signed a contract to open 60 petrol stations in Slovenia and is looking at expansion into Bavaria and northern Italy.</p>

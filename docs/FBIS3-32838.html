			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newspaper of the Airwaves" newscast] </F>   [Text] Peru has recovered the trust of investors as a  result of structural reforms, the opening of trade to foreign  markets, and local competition, within the framework of a  serious economic stabilization program initiated in 1990, the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade stated today.    During an assessment of Peruvian trade policy, GATT  highlighted the reduction of tariffs in general as a result of  the government's goal of tariffs reaching 15 percent by January  1995; the elimination of price controls, subsidies, quantitative  and exchange rate restrictions; and the policy of state  intervention. The report states, however, that the private  sector's reaction to the changes is limited due to the high  levels of interest rates and taxes, sectoral competition,  infrastructure deficiencies, overevaluation of the exchange  rate, and terrorism.</p>

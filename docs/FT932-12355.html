			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Bundesbank lowers money market rate THE BUNDESBANK yesterday announced a sharp cut in money market interest rates as the central bank's president warned that further reductions were being hampered by high public sector deficits. However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the bank, also said he believed the Bundesbank's hard-line monetary policy was at last bearing fruit. In its first money market operations since it cut the official discount and Lombard rates on Thursday, the bank reduced the 'repo' rate, at which it supplies wholesale funds to the markets, to 7.75 per cent after the 8.09 per cent rate established last week. The cut was larger than the market had expected and weakened the D-Mark against some European currencies. Foreign exchange dealers had been expecting the rate to be reduced to about 7.90 per cent. The market also predicted further pressures on weaker European currencies after the Bundesbank announced it wanted a review of European Monetary System rules which force unlimited intervention to defend weaker currencies. 'The Bundesbank is shifting into another gear on monetary easing,' said Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. The cut reflected the bank's assessment that it had gone as far as it could in trying to tackle problems by means of tight interest rate policy, he added. Mr Schlesinger's remarks appeared to be consistent with recent Bundesbank tactics of sending mixed signals, partly to keep speculators guessing. But they also highlighted the bank's underlying concern about government fiscal policy. In the longer term, heavy government debts forced the central bank to keep interest rates higher than would otherwise be the case, Mr Schlesinger said in a television interview. Other negative effects included a drain on capital available for investment, and reduced fiscal policy options resulting from high interest repayments. The first positive results from the bank's 'persistent medium-term monetary policy' were to be seen in the recent slowing in money supply growth, Mr Schlesinger wrote in the preface to the Bundesbank's annual report, released yesterday. But he stressed that monetary policy had to be supported by all sectors. 'Greater discipline and adaptability in politics, business and among wage negotiators are all the more necessary . . . since economic output is moving into reverse,' his statement said. The bank justified last week's reductions in the discount and Lombard rates to 7.25 per cent and 8.5 per cent respectively on the grounds that money supply was coming back under control. However, most economists took the view that the main motive for the cuts - the third this year - was the depth of problems in the economy. The bank's annual report acknowledged that federal budgets would be strained by lower revenues and the need to increase spending stemming from recession. However, deficits had to be reduced 'as an important prerequisite for lasting economic growth', it said. The report noted that planned increases in tax and welfare contributions, amounting to the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross national product, 'have certainly not improved the growth prospects for the German economy'. In a separate section on lessons to be drawn from last year's crisis in the European monetary system, the report proposed a review of central banks' intervention obligations. The report suggested that the Bundesbank's attempts to control money supply last year had been blown off course by its intervention commitments, and complained about the losses incurred when exchange rate adjustments were finally made.

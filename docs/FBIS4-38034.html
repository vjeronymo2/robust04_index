			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, June 28 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni gunners  blasted the beleaguered southern capital Aden Monday [27 June],  killing at least 19 people and wounding 180, hospital sources  said.    Units from both north and south Yemen were locked in  intensive artillery duels around Madinat al-Sha'b, 10 kilometres  (six miles) west of Aden city centre, where northern forces  broke through on Saturday.    The sound of gunfire could be heard from within Aden itself,  an AFP correspondent said.    Al-Jumhuriyah hospital sources said the day's shelling had  killed six civilians and wounded a further 56, while 13 soldiers  were also killed and 124 injured.    Since June 11, an estimated 415 civilians have been killed  and more than 1,100 injured in bombardments in and around Aden,  according to statistics compiled from official and hospital  sources.    A southern military spokesman said meanwhile that southern  troops had managed to halt "new attempts by enemy forces to  progress towards Aden."    "Four northern tanks were destroyed and hundreds of enemy  soldiers and officers killed or wounded," the spokesman said,  while others had been taken prisoner.    A southern statement vowed that "Aden will resist and will  transform itself into a cemetery for the new invaders."    An unspecified number of northern aircraft earlier launched  a  raid on Aden's oil refinery, 18 kilometres (10 miles) west of  the city, the southern spokesman said, adding ground defences  had downed one plane.    Eyewitnesses said two planes fired four missiles at the  refinery, one of which hit an empty building. Another damaged  pipelines.    A spokesman for the north in Sanaa denied its planes had  launched an air raid. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the Business SNARK" file: "Transcaucasia Economic </F> News"]    [Text] Tbilisi [Dateline as received] -- Georgia spends 10  times more than allows the state of her economy, stated Nodar  Djavakhishvili, the president of Georgian National Bank, to the  SNARK newsman. In his opinion, the introduction of a new  national currency, lari, is now highly questionable, since even  a small stabilization of Georgian coupon is impossible.    "It is impossible to exist on account of emission. Every  quarter we increase the money issue, which is not secured by the  real content, thus subjecting the people to hyper-inflation",  said Djavakhishvili. He observed that "Georgian economy doesn't  even compensate its expenses for gas."    "If so, then we should not use gas at all. By the way,  nearly 80 percent of Georgian population actually do not use  gas. Only Tbilisi, Rustavi, Batumi, and Kutaisi receive gas,"  noted the head banker of Georgia. He also suggested that the  Georgian government would finally make a decision: "In the case  Georgia goes towards the ruble zone, rather than strengthens its  coupon, the government needs a new chairman of the National  Bank," said Djavakhishvili.</p>

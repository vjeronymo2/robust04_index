			<p>BFN     [Text] The expected split at the center of Mario Segni's  Pact for Italy officially took place this afternoon with the  presentation to the press of the Liberal Democrat Foundation by  dissident members of the pact. Alberto Michelini, Stainano,  Tremonti, Siciliani, and Pelanda announced their departure, a  little after the ultimatum given to them by Mario Segni: "With  me, or against me."    According to the dissidents, Segni's prejudicial opposition  is static, while they, on the other hand, are willing to enter  into negotiation with the government. As far as the question of  the government confidence motion is concerned, the dissidents  may vote against, abstain, or, if they follow their manifesto,  vote for the government.</p>

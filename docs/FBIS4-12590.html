			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 11 (AFP)--The  Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] Monday [11 April] renewed a  threat to murder Jewish settlers and said a suicide attack that  left seven Israelis dead and 45 wounded was only a beginning.    A leaflet distributed in Gaza warned that the group's  military wing, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, has "decided to hit at  settlers so they can get a taste of death and leave our land."    "The 'Afula operation is only a beginning," it said.    A Hamas suicide bomber last Wednesday blew up a bus in  'Afula.    A day after the bombing, Hamas threatened to fire rockets at  Israeli homes and said the attack was the first of five to come  on Israeli targets.    Meanwhile, the body of a Palestinian man with a bullet hole  in his head was dumped in the street in Gaza City. Palestinian  sources said he had been executed by Hamas for collaborating  with Israeli authorities.</p>

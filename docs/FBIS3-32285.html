			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio and other  high-ranking government officials reacted to the U.S. State  Department's report on Guatemala this Wednesday. The president  responded to a reporter's question about the report and the  activities of the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols.    [Begin De Leon recording] The State Department report says  many things [words indistinct]. You have referred to one of  them; that is, possible human rights violations by the Army,  Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, and security forces personnel in  general. The report only mentions the issue but does not include  any specific information or evidence. The State Department has  done the same with Peru and other countries. We are reviewing  [words indistinct] and I am studying it. The report includes  several recommendations that are acceptable and, admittedly,  several of the things mentioned are realistic. However,  responsibility for human rights violations falls on the state  itself -- be it this state or any other -- thus the report says  nothing new.    Regarding the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, the government  is willing -- especially this year, when we expect to sign a  peace agreement -- to eliminate them gradually. They have  already started to be turned into [word indistinct] legal peace  and development committees. However, the most important issue  is that [words indistinct] patrol members who commit crimes,  just as any Guatemalan citizen, will be tried and punished if  found guilty.    The State Department and the international community already  know this. We sent a letter sent to President Clinton  specifically expressing our willingness to improve the situation  and outlining the positive steps taken by the government. This  is alluded to in the report. As I recall, it mentions somewhere  that there is hope and that with the arrival of President Ramiro  De Leon Carpio, there has been a reversal in the attitude of the  Guatemalan Government. Thus, the report is not entirely  negative. We believe in some cases [words indistinct] is  correct but in others, it is a bit speculative. The report does  not present sufficient arguments or evidence to back its  assertions.    Just like any other State Department report, we will have to  study and review it. We will look at its ramifications and the  annotations and suggestions it makes to several ministries  regarding labor, economic, and social issues, on special [words  indistinct], assembly plants, and so forth. I would say it is  more or less a repetition of the reports that the State  Department has issued every year for the past three or four  years. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METROMEDIA IS IN TALKS TO SELL ITS 70% ORION STAKE  </P> <P> Metromedia Co., which is controlled by investor John Kluge, confirmed Friday  that is in "extremely preliminary" talks with several potential buyers of its  70% stake in Orion Pictures Corp.  </P> <P> Metromedia didn't identify the potential buyers, though recent published  reports have said Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis was among them.  </P> <P> Davis didn't return a call seeking comment on the reports.  </P> <P> Orion shares closed Friday at $22.50, up 75 cents, as 117,900 shares changed  hands in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Orion had said it didn't know of any corporate development that  would account for a $2.875 jump in its stock price that day.  </P> <P> Orion captured only about 4.2% of the domestic box office in 1989 -- down from  6.6% in 1988 and 10.4% in 1987 -- and has been plagued by repeated rumors of a  pending management shake-up.  </P> <P> An Orion spokeswoman said she wasn't aware of any major changes in company  management.  </P></p>

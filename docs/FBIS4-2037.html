			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wang Dongjin, director of the provincial </F> commission for restructuring of the economy, on the priorities  of Hebei's economic reform for 1994 by unidentified reporter;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] The year 1994 is a crucial year for  implementing the "decision" of the third plenary session of the  14th party Central Committee and the endeavor of promoting  package reform while achieving breakthroughs in key areas. What  are the guiding thoughts for Hebei to deepen reform this year?    [Wang Dongjin] This year, Hebei should adhere to the basic  idea of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider  to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining  stability, firmly aim at establishing the socialist market  economy system and building an economically strong province, and  emphasize the further transformation of the operating mechanism  of state-own enterprises and the exploration of effective ways  to establish the modern enterprises system. It should  accelerate the reform of the fiscal and tax, banking, foreign  trade and foreign exchange, planning, investment and money  lending, and state asset management systems and make a  substantial step in establishing a new-type macroeconomic  regulating and controlling system. It should promote  correspondingly the establishment of the market system focusing  on the markets for the essential elements of production; add  impetus to the reform of the social security and housing  systems; and continue to deepen the rural reform, carry out the  reform of the scientific and technological system and  educational system correspondingly, give a free hand to the  development of the nonstate economies, coordinate reform,  development, and stability, realistically address the  conspicuous contradictions and problems in economic activities,  and facilitate Hebei's sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development.    [Reporter] As deepening the enterprise reform is the central  link of the entire economic structural reform, what are Hebei's  major measures for it?    [Wang Dongjin] The basic orientation for enterprise reform  is  establishing a modern enterprise system under which the property  rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises  are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise  management are separated, and scientific management is  established. Based on our specific conditions, this system  should be promoted step by step by closely coordinating it with  the transformation of the operating mechanism after experiences  are accumulated and favorable conditions created. Focusing on  the transformation of large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises into shareholding ones and the reorganization and  flow of the property rights of difficult small and medium-sized  enterprises, we should carry out in a down-to-earth manner the  various basic work for establishing the modern enterprise  system. There are five major measures: First, we should  thoroughly enforce the "PRC law on the industrial enterprises  owned by the whole people" and the "regulations on  transformation of the operating mechanism of the industrial  enterprises owned by the whole people," resolve well the  difficulties in delegating power to enterprises, and grand  enterprises all the rights and responsibilities they are  entitled to. Second, we should continue exploring the specific  ways to effectively transform the operating mechanism of  enterprises, pay attention to the various measures for  enterprises to manage their property, and provide favorable  conditions for establishing the modern enterprise system more  rapidly. Third, we should follow the law governing the market  economy and the state's industrial policy to greatly facilitate  the restructuring of the organization of enterprises and enliven  the existing property. Fourth, we should deepen the supporting  reform within enterprises in line with the requirements for  establishing the modern enterprise system. Fifth, we should  realistically reduce the burdens on enterprises and provide an  environment for enterprises to compete on an equal footing.    [Reporter] All circles in society are deeply concerned about  the work to bring the relations in property rights into better  balance and to establish the modern enterprise system. Please  give us more specific details about it.    [Wang Dongjin] Based on state's unified arrangements and  Hebei's reality, we will focus on the implementation of the  following six measures for property management this year in our  effort to probe into establishment of the modern enterprise  system. First, based on the stipulations of the "PRC corporation  law," we will speed up transforming large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises along the direction of the corporation  system. 1) Based on requirements, we will transform the  following enterprises into limited liability companies or  limited liability stock companies in line with their different  conditions: state-owned enterprises provided with the necessary  conditions for the transformation, whose products conform to the  industrial policy and which are highly competitive and create  good economic efficiency, especially the large- and medium-sized  enterprises listed in the "dragon and tiger plan;" enterprises  that develop high and new technology and new industries; real  estate enterprises engaged in large-area renovation of old city  proper; enterprises that expand exports to earn more foreign  exchange and draw in foreign capital; and nucleus enterprises  that help improve the property right relations of enterprise  groups. In coordination with the reform of the investment  system, we will organize the key enterprises approved by the  state and the province in line with the shareholding system as  long as they are provided with the necessary conditions so that  new enterprises will implement new mechanisms. 2) We will select  30 enterprises which possess the necessary conditions and which  are invested exclusively by the state (mainly the state-owned  enterprises in the competitive trades which cannot be  transformed into shareholding enterprises for the time being and  the enterprises and construction projects in some monopolizing  trades, basic industries, and public welfare industries) to  experiment with the system of exclusively state-invested  companies and gradually disseminate this system after  experiences are gained. We will strengthen the standardized  management of the pilot enterprises experimenting with the  corporation system so that they will fully perform the function  of transforming mechanisms. 3) We will actively recommend the  limited liability stock companies with necessary conditions and  outstanding business performance for listing their shares and  strive to win approval for about five enterprises to issue A and  B shares and list their shares outside the border. We will  continue exploring the ways for legal persons to list their  shares. Second, enterprises under contracted management which  do not have the necessary conditions to transform along the  direction of the corporation system for the time being may renew  their contracts to last until the end of the Eighth Five-year  Plan period. They should conscientiously enforce the "general  rules on financial affairs of enterprises" and the "business  accounting standards" and successfully link them with the  policies for the new fiscal and tax systems. Policies for the  enterprises operated under the overall input and output  contracts as approved by the provincial government will last  until 1995. The investment of these enterprises should be  properly restructured, and efforts should be concentrated on key  projects so that they can yield output as soon as possible.  Third, when transplanting and renovating state-owned  enterprises with foreign capital, we should pay particular  attention to the coordination of mechanisms, tie the capital of  foreign firms in with the property of state-owned enterprises to  cultivate the operating mechanism compatible with international  practice so that the numerous purposes of clarifying the  property right relations, effectively using foreign capital,  delegating import and export authority, and exploring the world  market can be attained. Cities and prefectures should select a  number of projects to be transplanted and renovated, adopt  various measures to invite investment, and aim at the large  corporations, consortia, and companies with substantial economic  and technological strength in the world to develop large-scale  development. Some enterprises may try out the operating  mechanism of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises,  gradually suit their mechanism to the international practice,  and open up the channels for using foreign capital. Fourth,  regarding the small and medium-sized enterprises that earn  little profits or lose money, some may continue the contract  system, and others may adopt various measures for property  management which are characterized by state ownership and  management by the people, such as contracting or leasing out an  entire enterprise to a natural person who brings in funds,  leasing out branch plants (workshops), production lines, single  machines, or whole sets of equipment, and entrusting households  to produce the products which require simple techniques or are  more suitable for manual operation but letting the enterprises  to conduct the accounting. Fifth, enterprises suffering long  deficits may be put under the management of the large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, scientific research units,  township enterprises, or foreign firms, which then get  reimbursement from this. Sixth, while actively promoting the  public-owned economies, we will encourage the development of  individual, private, and foreign-funded economies and create  favorable conditions for the economies of various ownerships to  participate in the market competition on an equal footing. We  will speed up reforming the property right system of collective  enterprises and actively promote the shareholding system. Urban  and rural collective enterprises and nongovernmental scientific  and technological enterprises may be transformed into  shareholding enterprises, shareholding cooperatives, or  enterprises instituting the partnership system in line with  their specific conditions. When building new collective  enterprises, we should strive to adopt the shareholding  cooperative system from the very beginning and operate them  under new mechanisms. Small state-owned enterprises may also be  turned into shareholding cooperatives.    [Reporter] The state has issued fairly many measures for  reform of the macroeconomic system. How will Hebei implement  them?    [Wang Dongjin] The state has issued an unprecedentedly large  number of measures for reform of the macroeconomic system and  pressed ahead with them to an unprecedentedly large extent. In  line with the principle of doing active and prudent work and  ensuring their implementation, we will emphasize seven aspects.    First, in line with the requirement for establishing the  socialist market economy system, the principle of separating  government administration from enterprise management, and the  principle of simplification, unity, and efficiency, we will  accelerate the organizational reform at governments at all  levels, change their functions, bring the relations between  various sectors into better balance, streamline their  organizations, and divert their personnel so that government  departments will truly change their habitual direct management  of the production and operation of enterprises into management  mainly through economic, legal, and necessary administrative  means and will provide favorable conditions for enterprises to  transform mechanisms and establish new ones.    Second, we will promote reform of the fiscal and tax systems  in an active and prudent manner. We will further rationalize  the relations between the central and the local governments in  the distribution of revenues and change the current system of  progressive increase in the revenues to be turned over by  provincial governments to the central government into the  revenue-sharing system. We will ensure the smooth transition to  the revenue-sharing system in line with the principles and  targets defined by the central authorities and, at the same  time, carefully formulate and implement the policies for the  province to reform the fiscal and tax systems of cities and  prefectures, stimulate their enthusiasm, and facilitate economic  development. To coordinate with the institution of the  revenue-sharing system, local tax organizations should be  established as soon as possible. We will reform and improve the  tax collection system in line with the principle of "unifying  the tax laws, levying taxes fairly, simplifying tax systems, and  dividing power in a reasonable manner." We will extend the  indirect tax system based mainly on the value-added tax, cancel  the tax on raw materials and the industrial and commercial  integrated tax levied from the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises, and implement the new value-added tax system. We  will improve the methods for collecting value-added tax and  implement the system whereby the amount of tax to be levied is  written in the dispatch lists and the tax is collected according  to the dispatch lists. Meanwhile, the consumption tax, in  addition to the value-added tax, will be collected from some  special commodities during their production and marketing. The  business tax will continue in the noncommodity businesses from  which the original business tax levied does not include the new  value-added tax. A unified tax rate will be applied to the  income tax levied from state-owned enterprises, collective  enterprises, shareholding enterprises, and the enterprises  exercising various forms of joint management; and the new  personal income tax law will be enforced to strengthen the  collection and management of personal income tax. Collection of  the resources tax will be expanded to promote the effective  utilization of resources. Real estate value-added tax will be  levied in the trade of real estate.    Third, we will facilitate the reform of the banking system.  We will accelerate the transformation of the functions of the  People's Bank of China at the provincial level and below to  strengthen their responsibilities for monetary supervision and  management, investigation and statistical analysis, regulation  of lateral money supply, management of the state treasury's cash  allocation, foreign exchange management, and joint accounting.  Various specialized banks will be transformed into commercial  banks and will carry out management of the proportions of assets  and liabilities and management of property risks. We will  strive for establishment of agencies of various state  policy-lending banks in Hebei; rural credit cooperatives will be  separated from agricultural banks and will carry out management  of the proportions of assets and liabilities based on the  evaluation of the remaining sum to provide favorable conditions  for establishing rural cooperative banks; and transformation of  urban credit cooperatives into urban cooperative banks will be  accelerated, monetary institutions other than banks, such as  trust and investment companies and security companies, will be  greatly developed, and the managerial system for rural  cooperative foundations will be improved. We will deepen the  reform of the insurance system and establish Hebei branches of  the Taipingyang and Pingan Insurance Companies. We will create  favorable conditions to bring in institutions of foreign funds  and strive for foreign loans.    Fourth, we will speed up the reform of the planning system.  We will further reduce the mandatory plans in the fields of  production, commodity circulation, and distribution; establish  and improve the systems for state ordering, storage, and  allocation of goods; accelerate establishment of the new  guidance planning system; put the focus of the planning work on  the research and formulation of medium- and long-term plans,  comprehensive coordination of macroeconomic policies, and  application of economic levers; properly draw up the strategies  for provincial economic and social development, targets of  macroeconomic regulation and control, and industrial policies;  do a good job in economic forecast; plan for the economic  structure and production layout; and combine the fundamental  role of the market in distribution of resources with the  advantage of macroeconomic regulation and control through  planning.    Fifth, we will deepen the reform of the investment and  money-lending systems. We will further apply the mechanism of  market competition to the work of investment and money-lending,  strengthen the position of enterprises as major investors, and  gradually establish the risk-taking responsibility system for  legal person investment and bank credit. We will standardize  the activities of the major investors, reform the methods for  investment and money- lending, and improve the investment  efficiency. Enterprises as legal persons hold the  responsibilities and bear the risks for all the preparations,  fund-raising, designing, and construction of construction  projects and even the production, management, debt repayment,  and the maintenance and increase of the value of assets.  Regarding the new projects to be started and the projects  already under construction, we will determine their major  investors and, based on the sources and structure of the  capital, establish the enterprises which institute the  corporation system to hold the responsibility for the entire  process of the construction. We will fully develop the role of  the provincial construction investment company as the major  investor in the basic industries. We will establish and improve  the investment service systems provided by consulting,  designing, auditing, construction supervisory, and other social  intermediary organizations which serve the major investors.    Sixth, we will unify the exchange rate in line with state  unified arrangements, abolish the foreign exchange retention and  quota management systems, exercise unified foreign exchange  purchases and sales, and establish the system whereby  enterprises report foreign exchange income and expenditure.    Seventh, we will reform and improve enterprises' state-owned  asset management system. We should look squarely at the serious  losses in enterprises' state-owned assets, step up establishment  of the "methods for the supervision and management of the  property of Hebei's state-owned enterprises," and implement the  system under which state-owned assets are owned by the state in  a unified manner, supervised at different levels by governments,  and managed independently by enterprises. We should explore  ways to establish the major operators of state property rights  and entrust certain units or establish supervision councils to  experiment with the supervision and management of the  state-owned assets of selected key enterprises subordinate to  metallurgical industry, foreign trade, building materials,  chemical industry, auto industry, and petroleum industry  departments. After experiences are gained, they will be  extended throughout the province. In this way, the supervision  councils, while ensuring the enterprises' property right, will  conscientiously hold the responsibility for supervising the  maintenance and increase of the value of the property, but they  should not intervene in the management of the enterprises. In  the process of the reorganization and flow of the enterprises'  property, it is strictly prohibited to covert state-owned assets  into shares and sell them at low prices or even distribute them  to individuals without compensation; and it is strictly  prohibited to infringe upon state-owned assets and their  interests. To overcome the defects in the traditional  managerial system for state-owned property, we should follow  state arrangements to make inventory and accounting of property  step by step to ascertain the quantity, determine the property  right, clarify debts receivable and debts payable, appraise  property, verify the amount of property used by enterprises, and  adopt effective property organizations and property managerial  measures to make state-owned property yield due returns.

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Observer: Turned off Can't get your ganja in downtown Washington DC? Blame the European Union. Together with the Jamaican government, the EU is now claiming success in an eight-year struggle to persuade Jamaica's ganja - marijuana - farmers in the north of the island to produce other, less lucrative, but perhaps more stable crops. The EU has been subsidising some 5,000 farmers with seeds, chemicals and equipment, turning them off dope and on to carrots and other assorted veg. Jamaica traditionally has been the third-largest supplier of marijuana to the US, after domestic US supplies and Mexican imports. 'I'm not making as much money as I did from growing the other stuff,' confessed one convert. 'But what I am earning now comes in every week instead of twice a year. And I can sleep at nights knowing that the police will not be coming to burn my crop and arrest me, or that a drug trafficker will try to shoot me.' 'Pssst] Wanna score on some carrot juice?' Just doesn't have the same ring, somehow.</p>

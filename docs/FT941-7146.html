			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (11): All change at the KIO in London The Kuwait Investment Authority is now faced with two priorities as Kuwait emerges from the trauma of invasion and the KIA from past mismanagement, writes Robin Allen. They are to improve internal structure, particularly the chain of command and control, and to improve management. Central to this task is ensuring the London-based Kuwait Investment Office is firmly subordinated to the KIA's central authority and never again allowed to arrogate to itself the power to embark on uncontrolled financial adventures. The KIO's general manager since February last year, Mr Yousef al-Awadi, needed only one month to supervise the merger of KIO into KIA. This was completed last March. The second priority is to establish a mature relationship with a revived and forceful national assembly (parliament). This will entail KIA's (and the government's) acceptance of a degree of sustained public accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. If good intentions prevail, the new-look KIA will reassure Kuwaitis that their national wealth is in safe hands. Overall strategy is being fine-tuned by the 'Strategy and Planning Task Force', an internal committee due to complete its work later this month. Relations with the National Assembly should improve over time. The authority of the national assembly to scrutinise the KIA - and the government's policies that dictate the KIA's investment decisions - was further strengthened by its unanimous rejection last month of the controversial ministers' trial law. This imposed restrictions on ministers being brought to trial. The immediate issue was whether Sheikh Ali al-Khalifah al-Sabah, the former oil and finance minster, should stand trial following allegations of embezzlement from the Kuwait Oil Tanker Company. The trial opened on February 5, and Sheikh Ali was among those charged. The principle was as important as the immediate issue. Mr Ismail al-Shatti, an Islamic conservative who is head of the national assembly's finance committee, described it as a 'revolutionary law in Kuwait's financial life'.</p>

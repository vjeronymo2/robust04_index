			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Braer disaster hits 2.5m salmon THE OIL from the wrecked Braer tanker contaminated 2.5m farmed salmon worth Pounds 35m, the Shetland Salmon Farmers' Association said yesterday. The fish were in pens in 16 fish farms in the exclusion zone the government imposed off the west coast of Shetland after the Braer ran aground. The fish will remain in the cages and will be monitored by scientists. About half the affected salmon would have been ready for harvesting now, and the rest would have been ready next year. The association stressed that the remaining 75 per cent of Shetland fish farms were free of contamination and unaffected by oil. Scientists from the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department said all the salmon from inside the exclusion zone which were tested were 'tainted or badly tainted' with oil. But all the salmon from outside the exclusion zone which were tested were uncontaminated.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Tories accused of links to quangos LABOUR yesterday accused the government of setting up a new corporate state by transferring control over billions of pounds of public money to quangos staffed by central government 'placepeople'. Launching an analysis of appointees to 41 of these non-governmental public bodies, the party highlighted the number who had links to companies that donate money to the Conservative party. The situation gave 'serious cause for concern', the party said. 'It amounts to a new hegemony . . . in which the interests of the governing elite and big-business inter-ests are seen to merge.' Among the bodies singled out by yesterday's report was the Bank of England's 18-strong court of directors, six of whom were said to be associated with corporate donors to the Tories. Mr Gerry Malone, Conservative party deputy chairman, rebuffed the attack. To suggest a link between public appointments and Tory donations was 'an outrageous attack on people who offer their services to the public, often for little reward', he said.

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Ministers accuse Labour of 'muck-raking' on Iraq arms SENIOR MINISTERS accused Labour of 'muck-raking' in its attempts to put Mr John Major in the dock over the sale of defence related material to Iraq, as the political storm about the Matrix Churchill prosecution entered its second week. The opposition warned that pressure on the government would increase rather than diminish. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, said he would produce today further 'damning evidence' linking the prime minister with the affair. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, said there seemed to be a concerted effort by the opposition to tarnish Mr Major as in the case of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. He noted that Mr Major had been cleared in the Bingham report into the collapse. Similarly, in an interview on the Walden television programme, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, expressed confidence that the government would be vindicated in the independent judicial inquiry announced last Tuesday, and accused opposition parties of 'an attempt to muck-rake in the hope that the initial allegations will stick in the public mind'. In a move that underlines how seriously the government is taking the issue, Mr Major issued on Saturday a vigorous defence of his role in the Matrix Churchill affair, saying that Mr Cook should confine his comments 'to fact and not innuendo'. Mr Major said that while he was foreign secretary briefly in 1989 he had not been told of the row between junior ministers about exports to Iraq, nor had he been briefed to raise the matter with Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, whom he met in September 1989. While Labour concentrates on Mr Major's role as foreign secretary, some of the most recent revelations highlight the fact that the government was clearing export licences for the last batch of Matrix Churchill machine tools the very day before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Denying any government attempt at a 'cover up', ministers emphasised that the inquiry into the affair, to be headed by Lord Justice Scott, would be wide enough to enable the investigation of all the issues raised. The terms of reference are expected to be announced this week. Among Tory backbenchers, the main concern appears to be the way that Customs and Excise were able to proceed independently with the Matrix Churchill prosecutions despite the knowledge within government that the executives on trial had been working for the security services, rather than the details of the sale of machine tools to Iraq. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for an emergency Commons debate on the arms-for-Iraq affair. MPs have, however, lost an immediate opportunity to discuss the issue, because last week the Liberal Democrats did not choose the affair for debate today - one of the rare occasions when opposition parties decide what the Commons discusses.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- A corner of the main  lobby of the Great Hall of the People here became the busiest  part of the huge edifice half an hour before the opening of the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) at  9:00 AM [0000 GMT] today, as NPC deputies crowded around two  data service counters there requesting information.    Set up in the southern side of the lobby are a statistics  counter and a legal documents counter manned with 20 workers and  equipped with seven computer terminals.    When the bell rang for the session to start in the hall's  main auditorium, the desks had provided services for more than  100 deputies.    The two data service counters were set up by the State  Statistical Bureau and the Legislative Affairs Commission of the  NPC Standing Committee. The first has a data bank of rural  social and economic statistics of China's 2,300 counties  (cities), and the latter a data bank of state laws and decrees,  international business conventions, and the market practices and  norms of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France.    This is the third year that such services have been provided  for NPC deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, according to  Jin Zhaofeng, an official of the State Statistical Bureau.  During last year's session, he said, about 1,000 deputies  obtained data from the services.    Deputies have become increasingly eager to get information,  he said. The service counters are expected to serve more  deputies during the current session than before, he said, basing  his prediction on his first day's experience.    Deputies are more selective about data than before, he said,  and their selection reflects their concerns. For example, he  said, many deputies asked for statistics concerning economic  gaps between China's east and west, income disparities between  southern China and northern provinces and such hot issues as  China's growing migrating population of rural laborers seeking  jobs.    Li Yangkai, a deputy from Liaoning Province and a senior  engineer of an excavator plant, was satisfied with information  he obtained about patent rights. "This is exactly what I want,"  he said.    Tong Meijun, a member of the CPPCC National Committee and a  research fellow of the economic and technological center of the  Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, has visited the law-decree  counter several times. She said she wanted to collect relevant  laws and regulations of developed countries, which will serve as  reference when her enterprise is transformed into a joint-stock  company.    A deputy from Hunan Province said the services are valuable  since many bills and suggestions to be raised by deputies  involve legal issues.    Some journalists covering the session, including reporters  from Hong Kong and Macao and foreign correspondents, also  collected information from the counters.</p>

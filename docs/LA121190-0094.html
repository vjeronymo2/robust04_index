			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: A TURNING POINT FOR IRREPRESSIBLE ROY FIRESTONE  </P> <P> TV or not TV. . . .  </P> <P> THE SPORTING LIFE: Roy Firestone is on the phone from Maui.  </P> <P> It's suddenly peak season for television's best sports interviewer.  </P> <P> Firestone, who turned 37 on Saturday, is marking the 10th anniversary of his  daily ESPN series, "SportsLook." And changes are in store for the show, which  will sport a new name and a "more journalistic" approach right after the New  Year, says Firestone.  </P> <P> He'll also be the new co-executive producer: "We're going to be able to do  'Nightline' kinds of things. What we've been missing is the technology to get  out to everybody who's making news, not just who's in town."  </P> <P> Firestone's co-executive producer, Bob Seizer, says ESPN is trying to get title  clearance for "Up Close" as the new name of the half-hour series.  </P> <P> But first, on Dec. 28, Firestone will say farewell to his past decade with an  hour special of the "best moments from 'SportsLook.' "  </P> <P> Firestone has long led a double life -- performing as a comedian as well -- and  that career is also blossoming. He steps up in class starting Thursday by  co-headlining with Lou Rawls at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> "This is the first time I've co-headlined," he says.  </P> <P> HE AND SHE: Ken Olin has directed his wife, Patricia Wettig, before in  "thirtysomething," the ABC series in which they both star. But tonight's  episode is rather extra-special.  </P> <P> Titled "Guns &amp; Roses," it deals with how the cancer-stricken Nancy (Wettig)  deals with problems as her therapy begins to have an effect on her relationship  with her children.  </P> <P> Wettig has won two Emmys as Nancy.  </P> <P> And what was challenging about tonight's show, says Olin, was how it "deals  with the process of cancer and juxtaposes that with the details of everyday  life. This woman's a mother and wife, and you have to combine these things."  </P> <P> Olin knows viewers are looking for clues as to "whether she's going to live.  But this show is a thematic point rather than a turning point in the plot. It's  about this character deciding that she's going to take the risk to want to  live. It asks: When you're so sick, is it easier to not want to live?"  </P> <P> The next directing assignment for Olin on "thirtysomething," possibly for a  February air date, "is about Nancy's second-look surgery," he says. "I think  there will be some traces of whether she's going to be successful in beating  the illness."  </P> <P> Olin knows the answer, but won't say.  </P> <P> THAT'S NEWS BIZ: Make a note: Carol Burnett's "Carol &amp; Company" has a  wonderfully vicious episode Jan. 5 skewering TV news shows that take the  entertainment route. Burnett plays an anchor. Her news director came from game  shows and brings in a studio audience that decides, through boos and cheers,  which stories are broadcast.  </P> <P> THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: After Madonna's "Nightline" interview, the Jay Leno camp  was wondering: "What's next -- a Persian Gulf special on the 'Tonight' show?"  </P> <P> CLOWN PRINCE: What a brilliant performance Mort Sahl gave on the Ha! channel --  about a visit to the White House. It only made you aware, again, of the  inadequacy of most of TV's endless parade of stand-up comics, who know all the  patter, all the moves, all the shtick -- but have nothing to say.  </P> <P> TYPECAST: Really, Anita Morris is much too good to be stuck in another of those  routine sex-bomb roles in which she turned up last week in CBS' "WIOU."  </P> <P> BEING THERE: "The meek may inherit the Earth, but it's the grumpy who get  promoted." Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) in "MASH."  </P> <P> Say good night, Gracie. . . .  </P></p>

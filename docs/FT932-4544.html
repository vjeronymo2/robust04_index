			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Twelve agree plan for improved maritime safety THE European Community yesterday agreed a programme to improve safety at sea, following a spate of oil tanker accidents in EC waters. The European Commission is to introduce legislation within six months to enforce minimum standards on ship maintenance and inspection, and training of crews, 'with the objective of removing all sub-standard ships from Community waters'. EC transport ministers, meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, stopped short of banning tankers from waters near environmentally sensitive areas, but proposed that member states identify such nature reserves and put forward measures to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to protect them. IMO standards will be the basis for the safety measures. Some member states are expected to go further than this. Irish officials said last night that Ireland planned a 20-mile exclusion zone of its coast for oil tankers and vessels carrying dangerous waste that were in transit through its waters. Among the measures planned are: Common criteria for more thorough port inspection of ships, including criteria for detaining or refusing access to vessels; Common standards for the classification societies which guarantee seaworthiness; Minimum standards of training for crews based on IMO rules for tankers; Better reporting systems for vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods. The transport ministers also edged closer to a deal on road cabotage, giving road hauliers the right to ply for trade inside EC countries other than their own. A new attempt to get a breakthrough will be made at a special ministerial meeting on June 19.</p>

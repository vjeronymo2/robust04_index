			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniel Pensamiento from Chiapas] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez -- Mexican Army troops have  traveled to an area 5 km from the peasant settlements of Yalcoc  and El Encanto and to the communities of Progreso and Gabino  Vasquez, near the Lacandona Jungle, where they are digging  trenches to assume positions. Journalists have toured the area  and ascertained the Army is building two new camps where  soldiers will be posted until fighting resumes or peace is  signed.    A military checkpoint installed in El Encanto, 10 km east of  Chiapas, was moved 5 km toward the Lacandona Jungle during the  first half of January. The soldiers installed their  sophisticated weapons and radio communications equipment there.    The military chiefs are issuing orders for the deployment or  transfer of troops headquartered in Progreso and Gabino Vasquez  from their provisional headquarters in Yalcoc. Chiapas residents  have reported there was a routine mobilization of troops on the  streets of that town. "Trucks have suddenly arrived loaded with  numerous soldiers who were posted at the municipal presidency  and the park to apparently stand guard in the area," said  residents who have requested anonymity out of fear.    Agricultural laborers found the remains of Humberto  Hernandez  Conde, a municipal police agent who was presumably kidnapped by  the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] in early January.    Julio Latty, municipal police commander in Comitan, reported  a group of peasants found Hernandez' remains in San Antonio  Zeta, 7 km east of Comitan. "The peasants reported their  finding, and we immediately traveled there and recognized the  former police agent by his shoes and parts of his uniform,"  Latty has said. He recalled that Hernandez had been presumably  kidnapped by EZLN members in early January, when he disappeared.</p>

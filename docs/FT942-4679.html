			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper leads LME base metals rally  -Market Report COPPER led other base metals contracts higher in late trading at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. After dipping to Dollars 2,233 a tonne early in the day the three months position closed the afternoon ring at Dollars 2,270, up Dollars 28 on balance. But as investment fund buyers became active again in New York the LME price moved still higher in after hour trading, topping Dollars 2,300. The three months ALUMINIUM price consolidated morning gains to close at Dollars 1,373.25 a tonne, up Dollars 9.75. And it added a few dollars more after hours. At the London Commodity Exchange September delivery COFFEE futures recovered from a morning fall to Dollars 1,985 a tonne to close at Dollars 2,024, still Dollars 4 in arrears. 'It's not so much selling pressure as a lack of active buying that is keeping the market down,' said one trader. 'It's really very quiet, the market is trying to consolidate.'

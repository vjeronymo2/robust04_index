			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG BOARD UPHEAVAL WITHIN TAC  </P> <P> Four members of The Athletics Congress' drug-testing custodial board, which  monitors track and field's extensive domestic drug-testing program, have  resigned, apparently in protest.  </P> <P> The four -- Edwin Moses, Harvey Glance, Linda Sheskey and Doriane Lambelet --  sent their resignations to TAC offices in Indianapolis via fax machines late  Wednesday. On Thursday, a TAC spokesman confirmed the action but said the  organization would have no comment.  </P> <P> Glance, a two-time Olympic sprinter, also resigned his position as a TAC vice  president. However, he remained as president of the group's Athletes Advisory  Committee.  </P> <P> Moses and Glance did not return phone calls, and Lambelet could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> Sheskey, reached Thursday at her home in Woodstock, Ga., had little comment  other than to say the group would issue a statement soon.  </P> <P> She said her resignation consisted of a two-sentence letter stating that she  would no longer participate on the board, and that her reasons would be  forthcoming.  </P> <P> Asked the nature of the dispute with TAC, Sheskey would only say: "It's been  building for a while."  </P> <P> Although the board members, all athletes or former athletes, appeared reluctant  to make a public statement, one source close to the board said, "These guys  caught (TAC) in one too many lies."  </P> <P> The body has been under fire recently for its handling of various sensitive  issues. Four elite athletes have tested positive for banned drugs within a  month of each other, and another, steeplechase runner Henry Marsh, was given a  two-year suspension after he failed to appear for a random drug test last  month.  </P> <P> Long jumper Larry Myricks, hurdlers Greg Foster and Antonio McKay and UCLA  triple jumper McArthur Anderson all have tested positive for banned drugs found  in cold medicines. The athletes were each suspended for three months.  </P> <P> Several months ago, Moses and Glance called for an independent investigation of  drug use among American athletes, saying TAC had lost its credibility because  of its handling of the Chuck DeBus case.  </P> <P> DeBus, a former women's track coach at UCLA and Cal State Northridge, has been  accused of providing banned drugs to athletes. TAC was found to have offered  DeBus a deal in which he would receive a reduced suspension in return for  naming athletes who he claimed had taken drugs. Although DeBus provided a list  of names, the deal fell through. The decision in the DeBus case is expected  next week.  </P></p>

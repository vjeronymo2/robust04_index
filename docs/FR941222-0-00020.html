			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Safety analyses by NRC and the cask vendor show the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS can withstand floods and will continue to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptably. With regard to the Davis-Besse site, the licensee changed site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topography during plant construction. Specifically, the area was built up and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some dikes were added. The plant structure's ground floor elevation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 585 feet International Great Lakes Datum (IGLD), which is also the elevation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the pad. The licensing design basis for maximum probable static water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level on the site is 583.7 feet IGLD. As noted, the HSM and DSC were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated for flood conditions as required by 10 CFR 72.122(b). The HSM can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withstand a maximum water velocity of 15 feet per second and a static head of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 feet of water. The DSC can withstand a static head of 50 feet of water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any site that intends to use a Standardized NUHOMS design must evaluate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions at their site to verify compatibility with the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications of the system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. A number of commenters raised issues relating to the design,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation, and operation of the Standardized NUHOMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several comments related to the fuel to be stored in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter wanted control components contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies addressed in the SAR and SER citing DOE acceptance criteria. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter questioned how 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel now being used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized water reactors will be handled since the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rated to handle only 40,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel. Another commenter, citing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of current site-specific licensees for other NUHOMS designs, stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that higher burnup should be allowed if the decay heat and radiological source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms are within limits. Another commenter asserted that increased fission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products from higher enriched fuel may potentially increase embrittlement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fuel cladding and that this needs to be evaluated in the SER. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter further alleged that this would increase the probability of more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defective fuel being loaded into dry casks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The vendor designed the cask system for storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized water or boiling water reactor fuel assemblies meeting certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications. By limiting the use of the cask system to assemblies meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these specifications, the vendor made a decision that may partially restrict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of the cask. However, the NRC does not require that a cask be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universal for all types of fuel or be usable at every reactor site. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, none of the casks previously listed in 10 CFR 72.214 is usable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boiling water reactor spent fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel and fuel with initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrichments of greater than 4% will have to remain in the spent fuel pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because dry spent fuel cask designs to store fuel with this higher burnup and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial enrichment or related to DOE acceptance criteria have not yet been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed and evaluated by the NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several comments were related to criticality safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. One commenter questioned the conservatism of using 7.5-year cooled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel when 5-year-cooled fuel is the minimum specified and when older  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel may also be stored in the cask. Another inquired about criticality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety if the original basket geometry were compromised, as might be the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for brittle failure of a spacer disk. In the compromised basket geometry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case, the commenter also asked about the difference in criticality safety for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a helium atmosphere rather than a borated water medium. The commenter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referring to July 24, 1992, meeting minutes, inquired why all parties agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to spend any resources to make these criticality safety calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Standardized NUHOMS nuclear criticality safety analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is based on the following: (1) Babcock and Wilcox 15 &times; 15/208 pin fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of U-235 and (2) General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric 7 &times; 7 fuel assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U-235, for the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P and NUHOMS&hyph;52B designs respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The age of the fuel that will actually be stored is not relevant in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criticality safety analysis because the analysis assumes storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unirradiated fresh fuel that is more reactive than cooled spent fuel. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P system has administrative controls that limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irradiated fuel reactivity to less than or equal to 1.45 wt% of U-235  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent unirradiated fuel (Certificate of Compliance Section 1.2.1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The possibility of a criticality accident caused by the brittle failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the basket should not be a significant concern. No lifting or handling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DSC outside the spent fuel pool building is permitted if the basket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature is lower than 0 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. If the user does not determine the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basket temperature, the ambient temperature must be used conservatively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these temperature restrictions, the basket materials will not behave in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a brittle fashion. Consequently, the basket geometry would not be compromised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by brittle failure. As for the criticality safety consideration related to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> helium atmosphere versus a borated water medium, the k <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> eff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the fuel in a helium atmosphere is much less than the k <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> eff <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in borated water. Therefore, criticality calculations for the borated water are sufficient because they are more conservative and therefore would bound calculations using a helium atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters were concerned with shielding and dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter believed that using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10-year-cooled fuel for the dose assessment was nonconservative when 5-year- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooled fuel is needed to load the DSC to produce 24 kW of heat. Another,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referring to an NRC meeting with Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (PNFSI),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wanted clarification of an NRC request to delete a clause allowing the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to perform site-specific shielding calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

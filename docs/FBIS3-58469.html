Such was the question being asked yesterday in the lobbies of  the National Assembly by several members of the Foreign Affairs  Commission. They added that after "giving in to Iranian  threats" by sending two presumed terrorists back to Tehran even  though they were wanted by Swiss authorities, France, by letting  itself be pressured into tearing up its policy concerning the  sale of weapons to Taiwan, "allows China to treat it differently  than it does the United States."    Here is the gist of the official statement, released  yesterday: "Aware of China's concerns, the French Government  undertakes not to allow French companies to contribute to  Taiwan's armament in the future." Last year, the PRC had been  enraged by the announcement that France would sell 60 Mirage  2000 fighter aircraft and six frigates to Taiwan. The contracts  were vital for the French arms manufacturing sector -- France  being the world's second biggest arms exporter after the United  States. China had retaliated by unilaterally closing down the  French Consulate in Canton.  <H5>  United States Unaffected </H5>   And yet, the French were not the first Western nation to  decide to sell weapons to Taiwan. After the Tiananmen Square  massacre (1989), the Americans had gone back on their 1982  pledge not to sell any more weapons to Taiwan. Last July, a  vote at the House of Representatives had even confirmed and  broadened the U.S. policy change. Furthermore, in terms of  volume, the U.S. armament contracts (supplying 150 F-16  fighter-bomber aircraft and leasing a number of frigates) are  more than twice as large as the French ones. And yet Beijing  has not implemented any retaliation measures against the United  States, thus clearly breaking Mao's old iron law which states  that "China treats all nations, whether small or large, on an  equal footing."    At the time, the announcement of the armament contract with  Taiwan had not been criticized in France nor in the United  States. As shown by the December 1992 parliamentary election,  the Taiwan regime, turning its back to the Kuomintang  dictatorship, has become a Western-style democracy. Although  strictly unofficial, relations between thriving Taiwan and  mainland China are quite strong: Through intermediaries  operating from Hong Kong, "nationalist" Chinese have become the  leading investors in Communist China, thus contributing to the  latter's extraordinary economic growth. However, the PRC --  sole holder of Chinese sovereignty in the eye of both the French  and the U.S. Government -- has still not abandoned the idea of  forcibly bringing back into the fold the island, which seceded  in 1949. In such a context, asks a Western diplomat, "can one  prevent Taiwan from acquiring what it needs in order to  discourage Beijing's intentions?"    This same diplomat adds: "Sooner or later, the French  Government, which is usually just as ready to uphold the cause  of democracy as it is to protect its interests vis-a-vis the  United States, will have to dispel the ambiguity."</p>

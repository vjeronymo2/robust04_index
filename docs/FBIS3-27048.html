The provincial economic and political situation  is fairly good this year. Now, we are actually confronted with  a favorable opportunity of reform, opening up, quickening of  development.    The economic construction continuously develops at a faster  speed on the basis of the fast development in 1992. The  production and investment growth rates in 1993 surpass the  growth rates in the Seventh Five-Year Plan period and the first  two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. New headway has  been made in the enterprise reform dominated by the  establishment of the socialist market economic system and some  other auxiliary reforms. This year, the province has made the  biggest strides for opening itself to both domestic areas and  foreign countries. The province registers big increases in the  number of newly signed, newly started, and newly completed  projects relating to the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises as well as in the amounts of foreign exchange  earnings through exports by the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises. The province's situation characterized by political  and social stability has been consolidated and developed.  Prominent contradictions, problems, and difficulties are as  follows: When compared with the secondary industry which is  under rapid development, the primary and tertiary industries are  developing at a relatively slower rate. The readjustment of the  product mix of the trades with competitiveness fails to keep  abreast of the development of the market economy in the course  of developing the industrial economy. The pace of opening to  the outside world is not fast enough. The security situation is  still grim. The thinking and work style of the cadres  contingents cannot suit the setup of the grass-roots  organizations. These problems should conscientiously be solved  in the course of reform and development.    The next seven years is a key period for realizing the  province's second-step development target. According to the  guidelines of the 14th party congress, the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th Party Central Committee, and the Fifth Plenary  Session of the Fourth Provincial Party Committee as well as the  requirements as set forth in the "Hebei Economic Rejuvenation  Program," the province set forth three specific targets for  reform and development by the end of this century: First, the  province should ensure a 500-percent increase in its GNP and  strive to register a 700-percent increase, and ensure that the  people will become fairly well-off. Second, the province should  raise its ranking in the whole country in terms of the main  national economic targets and stand among the rank of  economically powerful provinces. Third, a new socialist market  economic system should take preliminary shape. Viewing the  practice in the first three years of the 1990's, we know that  the province will not only be able to completely register a  500-percent increase in the GNP but also have prospects for  making a 700-percent increase so long as in the next seven  years, the increases in the GNP and the input to fixed assets  are continuously maintained at 1993's levels.    To win a tough battle in reform and development in the next  seven years, we should double our efforts and conscientiously  achieve 1994 work. The year 1994 is a key year for our country  to promote the package economic reform and make breakthroughs in  key areas as well as a decisive year for our province to  implement the "program for rejuvenating the economy" and  realizing the second doubling target.    The provincial party committee's general requirements for  the  1994 work are: Resolutely implement the guidelines of the third  plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the  national economic work conference; work closely in line with the  main subjects of intensifying reform, expanding the scale of  opening up, quickening development, and building Hebei into an  economically powerful province; emancipate the mind; seek truth  from facts; work hard; and create new special features, make new  strides, and create new levels for the building of the two  civilizations. The key to realizing these requirements is to  further emancipate the mind, renew our ideas, and carry forward  the spirit of having the dare to think and do pioneering work.  We must not miss the favorable opportunities by hesitating or  by adopting a wait-and-see attitude, slow down our development  by grumbling and fearing difficulties, widen our differences by  making vertical comparison and being self-satisfied, or  obliterate our pioneering spirit with internal conflict. In  grasping the emancipation of minds at present, we should not  hold general and abstract discussions and should excel at  seizing practical problems that are affecting reform and  development. Through the upgrading of theoretical levels and  the renewal of concepts, we should enable the emancipation of  minds to be truly implemented in a down-to-earth manner and  regard fast or slow progress in dealing with these problems as a  yardstick in measuring the extent of emancipating minds.    2. We should earnestly implement central arrangements,  reinforce the strength of reforms, accelerate the pace of  reforms, and quicken the establishment of socialist market  economic systems.    In line with implementing the decision on several questions  of establishing the socialist market economy systems, which was  adopted at the third plenary session, and according to the task  of accelerating the establishment of socialist market economic  systems, the central authorities will issue a series of  important measures for reforms. Conducting reforms in line  with these measures will exert important influence on promoting  the organic integration between the socialist basic system and  the market economy, on promoting enterprises to advance toward  markets and to join in market competitions under fair or just  conditions, and on emancipating or developing productive forces.  This represents a crucial step taken in building the basic  frame of socialist market economic systems. Along with  implementing these measures, reforms will be shifted from  dealing with shallow-rooted problems to deep-rooted ones and  will directly deal with the deep-rooted economic relations and  contradictions. Reforms conducted by state-owned enterprises  will be aimed at shifting from conceding profits to deeply  straightening out property rights. Reforms conducted in  developing markets will be deepened from chiefly conducting  opening up among commodity markets to establishing the markets  of essential factors of production. Reforms conducted in  macroeconomic management will be carried out by chiefly doing  away with the mandatory plan and delegation of power to lower  levels by building systems of managerial measures and  operational mechanisms. Reforms conducted in tax systems, in  financial affairs, and in systems of investing and raising money  will be favorable for separating the ownership and business  right of enterprises from the official departments and for  creating an equal environment for market competition.  Therefore, the significance of various reforms we face is very  great and important. Party committees and governments at all  levels must fully discern the important significance and pay  attention to the following several tasks while conducting  organizational guidance over reforms: First, we should enhance  study and training and organize cadres at all levels,  particularly leading cadres at or above the county-section  level, to earnestly study the "decision" adopted at the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Second, we  should enhance propaganda through media and do a good job in  propaganda and explaining various reform measures by adopting a  lively style loved by the masses. Third, we should foster the  idea of "taking the whole country into account" and consciously  achieve subordinating lower units to their higher authorities  and having the partial observe the whole. Fourth, we should  correctly deal with the relation between reform and development  and integrate the enforcement of various reforms with the  economic development of our own localities and departments to  truly reach the goal of emancipating productive forces. Fifth,  we should correctly deal with the relation between reform and  stability; uphold the mass line; and deeply and successfully  conduct the work concerning the masses so as to ensure stability  in politics and society.    While doing a good job in grasping in an overall way every  reform set in the central arrangements, we should concentrate  our efforts on grasping reform in the following five aspects  next year: 1) By emphasizing the work of boosting large- and  medium-sized enterprises, we should shift the operational  mechanism of enterprises and establish modern enterprise  systems. We should organize 100 large- and medium-sized  enterprises in the province to take up the pilot work of  enforcing the shareholding system and establish modern  enterprise systems with the main contents of enterprise legal  person systems, limited responsibility systems, and  scientifically organized systems. Small- and medium-sized  enterprises that earn little profits or lose money should adopt  various measures to turn themselves into enterprises run by the  people, while remaining state-owned or public-owned or to lease  and sell themselves out. We should actively promote the  transformation of the property right system and establish a  property right supervision mechanism to make sure that  state-owned assets maintain and increase their value, and we  should also conscientiously explore specific measures to  eliminate enterprises' historical burden and social burden. We  should enliven the use of the assets in stock and facilitate the  restructuring of the organization of enterprises to promote the  fluidity and reshuffling of the property right of enterprises.  2) We should deepen the rural reform, with the focus on  developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient  large-scale agriculture and adjusting the production setup of  agriculture. In particular, the following three tasks should be  taken: We should stabilize and improve the responsibility  system with household-based contracts as the major form and the  dual operating system combining unified operation with  independent operation and strengthen the unified service  function of township and village collective economic  organizations. We should establish and improve the socialized  service system, greatly develop the integrated management of  farming, breeding, and processing; of marketing, supply, and  production; and of trade, industry, and agriculture; lead the  decentralized household operation to link to the integrated  large market, and promote the establishment and development of  various rural specialized commodity bases and regional pillar  industries. We should greatly develop the rural cooperative  shareholding system to enable town and township collective  enterprises to change their operating mechanism and establish a  new enterprise system more rapidly. We should continue to  implement the various policies favorable to agriculture and make  unremitting efforts to reduce the burdens on peasants. 3) We  should further cultivate and develop urban and rural market  system and facilitate the shaping of a integrated, open,  competitive, and orderly large market. The general demand is to  greatly cultivate and develop the market for essential elements  of production, improve the commodity market, and standardize  market activities according to law. 4) Party and government  organs at all levels should actively facilitate institutional  reform and establish the state public service system. They  should complete this task in a well-guided and orderly manner in  three years beginning next year and see to it that their  functions are changed, relations are brought into better  balance, organizations are streamlined, and efficiency is  improved. 5) We should actively establish the provincial-level  macroeconomic regulation and control system in the process to  promote the reform of state financial and tax, monetary,  investment, and planning systems.    3. We should regard opening to the outside world and  developing the export-oriented economy as a strategic task to  promote the entire economic development.    Opening to the outside world means to open our doors to  conduct extensive economic, political, scientific and  educational, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with the  countries and regions outside the country and outside the  border. Not only should we fully assimilate and use all the  advanced technology and experiences of the world that are useful  to us, but also, guided by the world market, we should actively  develop the export-oriented economy and participate in  international division of work, international exchanges, and  competition of the international market. Through bilateral  exchanges and cooperation, we should realize the rational  distribution of funds, personnel, technology, and other  essential elements of production. Opening to the outside world  and developing the export-oriented economy enable us to  effectively use the numerous favorable development opportunities  provided to us by the international economic environment, to  rapidly promote the adjustment and improvement of our industrial  composition and product mix, and to raise the starting point and  quality of our economic strategies, link with the international  market more rapidly, and promote the entire economic development  and social progress through the breakthrough in the  export-oriented economy. To build an economically strong  province, we should first build ourselves into a strong province  in opening up. All trades and professions and all localities  should open to the outside world more rapidly, use foreign trade  to lead the domestic trade, use domestic trade to promote  foreign trade, and strive for a faster and greater development  in the export-oriented economy.    First, we should persistently pay attention to and develop  foreign capital utilization, foreign trade, and foreign economic  relations simultaneously. We should adopt various channels and  various measures to introduce foreign capital to enterprises of  various ownerships and enterprises in various fields. Focusing  on using foreign capital to transplant and technically transform  large- and medium-sized enterprises, we should accelerate  enterprises' technical transformation projects and strive to  complete a number of such projects next year. All levels, all  departments, and all economic and noneconomic departments should  develop their respective advantages to strengthen ties with  international consortia, large enterprises, monetary  organizations, and noted figures and to build the bridge for  bringing in foreign capital and loans from abroad so as to  strive to make next year's amount of foreign capital we use  double that of this year. We should truly implement the idea of  developing large-scale foreign trade with everyone's efforts;  pool the efforts of all fields; export through numerous ports;  increase the growth rates of export volume, foreign exchange  earning; and foreign exchange received to the same level as the  growth rate of Hebei's gross national product, and make the  growth rate of local ordinary trade and exports of the "three  types of foreign-funded enterprises" equal to or surpass the  national average. We should actively develop the tourist  business involving foreigners. We should greatly intensify  labor service export and contracts for projects abroad, provide  great support for the localities and enterprises with favorable  conditions to export technology, equipment, and funds, and  develop overseas enterprises to change the backward outlook of  such work.    Second, we should make continuous efforts to develop the  coastal areas of Bohai Sea and the areas around Beijing and  Tianjin, achieve breakthroughs in key fields more rapidly, and  promote this work in an orderly manner. Leaders of the four  cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Cangzhou, and Shijiazhuang,  which are on the forefront of the opening up of the coastal  areas of Bohai Sea, should try every means to achieve some  significant breakthroughs in opening to the outside world and  speed up the change of the focus from domestic-oriented economy  to export-oriented economy. Relying chiefly on Beijing and  Tianjin, we should promote multidirectional opening to the  localities of the country and, in the meantime, promote  introduction of investment from abroad through the lateral  cooperation at home in order to lead a great development in  opening to the outside world.    Third, the province, as well as all cities and prefectures,  should define their work priorities and act in coordination and  pool efforts in opening to the outside world. From now on,  cities, prefectures, and enterprises should gradually become the  major participators in establishing foreign economic ties and  introducing foreign capital from abroad. Beginning next year,  the province should devote major efforts to the priorities of  work, namely establishing ties with major customers, bringing in  large projects from abroad, and winning the support of the  various large central ministries and commissions taking charge  of the work involving foreign countries, in addition to holding  one or two large investment-inviting activities every year so  that the scale and level of opening to the outside world can be  improved continuously.    4. Every means should be adopted to make the 1994 economic  construction at the same development level of 1993 or surpass it.    The major targets of Hebei's 1994 economic development has  been defined, but, in carrying out actual work, we should strive  to reach or surpass the 14-percent gross national product  increase registered in 1993.    First, we should aim at achieving a fairly comfortable  standard of living when drawing up overall plans for rural work.  Efforts should be devoted chiefly to the following three tasks.  1) We should speed up the development of high-yield,  good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. In grain  production next year, we should ensure steady growth, and, in  cotton production, we should be determined to change the  large-scale decline of output due to failure to fulfill planting  acreage plans. After this, we should adjust and optimize  agricultural structure more rapidly in line with market demand  in order to improve efficiency and increase the income of  peasants. 2) In line with the principle of attaching equal  importance to development and improvement, we should continue to  speed up township enterprise development. By carrying out  technical transformation and bringing in funds from abroad, we  should support and build a number of export-oriented township  enterprises that adopt new technology, produce good products,  and create high efficiency, expand their scale, and develop  enterprise groups. We should draw up overall plans to  coordinate township enterprise development with the construction  of small industrial zones and small cities, and promote the  concentration of township enterprises in geographical  arrangements to improve the intensive management level. We  should establish a strict mechanism of incentives and link the  interests of township and village cadres with the development of  local rural economy, especially the development of township  enterprises. 3) We should achieve success in family planning to  improve per capita production and per capita income. We should  conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for  population targets and make family planning a decisive criterion  for appraisal of work.    Second, by regarding as an emphasis the readjustment of  structure and the increase of economic results, we should  accelerate the development of industrial enterprises. We should  guide enterprises to study, calculate, and open markets; to  establish a mechanism with rapid and flexible market reaction;  to enhance their sale strategy; and to improve their production  in a timely manner according to development and changes in the  market. We should reinforce the strength in structure  readjustment and guide enterprises to improve their products  along the direction of high- and-new technologies, fine quality,  famous trade mark, standardized operation, and international  market standards. Efforts should be made to continuously  enforce the "dragon-tiger plan" and the "plan for establishing a  large number of enterprises in six fields," to achieve in  imposing clear duties on these enterprises and having them be  closely coordinated, to promote progress in enforcing the two  plans each year, and to carry forward the plans through to the  end. We should organize 100 senior specialists to spend one  year on investigation and study so as to enable them to put  forward suggestions and plans for our province to readjust  product mix during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" period. We should  have the out-dated enterprises enhance their technical  renovations. From 1994 to the beginning of 1997, our province  will have its industrial enterprises covered by the budget  conduct technical renovations in line with the demands of  products' renewal so as to upgrade the industrial quality as a  whole.    Third, we should adopt every possible way and means to  overcome funding difficulties and accelerate the construction of  infrastructure and key projects. We should strive for  investments with fundamental and competitive characters which  conform with the state industrial policies, as well as for the  credit funds provided by the state-owned police-lending banks  and the monetary institutions. Meanwhile, by having our feet  firmly planted in the province, we should extensively open the  channels for raising funds. Efforts should be made to vigorously  enforce the shareholding system and to establish shareholding  companies especially in charge of raising shares for  construction projects. We should formulate as soon as possible  the "provisional regulations on management over raising social  funds," standardize the act of raising funds, and guide the  enforcement of special policies on raising funds for key  construction projects.    Fourth, we should continuously encourage and support the  development of individually run and privately owned enterprises  in both urban and rural areas. The united front work  departments, the federations of industry and commerce, and the  industrial and commercial bureaus at all levels should be  closely coordinated and do a good job in line with their work  division in rendering services and creating a fine environment  and condition for the rapid development of individually run and  privately owned enterprises.    Fifth, we should accelerate urban construction with the main  tasks of building residential houses for urban people and  promote progress in modernizing urban areas. In line with  enforcing the state "1994-1996 project of having the people live  in peace," a good job should be done in dealing with the housing  problems encountered by the households that don't have homes,  whose per capita housing acreage is under four square meters,  and that are cramped with adult children. We should regard  teachers of middle and primary schools, medical and cultural  workers, and the staff members and workers of small industrial  and commercial enterprises as special targets for assistance.  We should work out measures to help them deal with their  housing problems. Efforts should be made to actively promote  reform in the housing system of urban areas and to enforce the  rational division among the state, collectives, and individuals  of the burden of housing construction. By meeting the needs of  opening up, we should enhance the construction of  infrastructures and reinforce the bearing capacity and  attraction of urban areas in opening themselves to the outside  world.    Sixth, we should accelerate the development of tertiary  industry. By proceeding from their reality, localities and  departments should formulate rational plans for developing the  industry; define their work emphasis; actively conduct guidance;  and accelerate the development of this industry. We should  concentrate our efforts on firmly grasping the development of  industries and trades that are extremely short and that should  be developed urgently. Efforts should be made to have the  state-owned, collectively run, individually run, privately  owned, and foreign-funded enterprises develop the tertiary  industry simultaneously and to adopt multiple and flexible  styles to make a greater breakthrough in developing this  industry.    Seventh, we should accelerate the pace of integrating  science, technology, and education with the economy and improve  as soon as possible the province's backward outlook in science,  technology, and education. Through efforts made in 1994 and  1995, we will enable a large number of large and medium-sized  enterprises to establish their scientific research units that  are actually able to develop new technologies and products.  Efforts should be made to stabilize and reinforce the  contingents of agricultural scientific and technological  personnel, and to set up or improve the network of popularizing  the agricultural technologies. In particular, we should  organize or establish a large number of service organizations  for science, agriculture, and trade so as to form a "unified"  system. Through the elimination caused by the competition we  should support, by aiming at the survived key projects, the  development and construction conducted by the high- and-new tech  industrial parks and improve or develop a large number of  technical markets. We should greatly encourage the  establishment of a number of non-governmental scientific  research institutes, non-governmental scientific and  technological enterprises, scientific and technological  enterprises owned by the state but run by the people, and "three  types of foreign-funded enterprises" engaged mainly in  scientific and technological development. Meanwhile, we should  pay attention to education next year. The focus is that  colleges and universities should deepen the educational reform  and succeed in the adjustment of their layout and curricula;  vocational and technical education should be consolidated,  improved, and upgraded from the current level, and 100  vocational education centers newly established; urban adult  education should continue to be made successful, and the  transfer of rural redundant labor forces should be resolved  through rural adult education; great attention should be given  to elementary education to prevent it from declining or being  affected; and the "teachers' law" should be conscientiously  enforced, and mistakes in wage payments to teachers should no  longer occur beginning next year.    5. We should adhere to the strategic principle of attending  to two tasks simultaneously and being competent in both and  should clarify the tasks, systematize the work, and specify the  responsibility for building the socialist spiritual civilization  and improving democracy and the legal system.    In line with this demand, we should focus on the following  work next year:    First, we should continue deepening the anticorruption  struggle. The general requirements on next year's work of  building a clean government and opposing corruption are to  prevent recurrence of the problems that have already been  corrected, step up efforts to address the problems that have not  been thoroughly solved, and take remedial measures to make up  for perfunctory work; and do a better job in addressing other  problems that the masses are most dissatisfied with. New  requirements should be put forward based on new conditions on  leading cadres' honesty and self-restraint; measures should be  intensified to step up the investigation and handling of major  and serious cases; the work to ban unwarranted pooling of funds,  wanton requisition of donations, and exaction of fees should be  carried out through to the end until actual results are  achieved; and conscientious efforts should be made to straighten  out and thoroughly correct the problems of some leading cadres  at and above the county level who vied with each other to buy  deluxe cars, used public cars for private purposes in violation  of regulations, wasted public funds in lavish wining and dining  and buying gifts, and abused power to occupy excessively large  houses, build private houses, or decorate private houses with  public funds.    Second, we should make great efforts to check four unhealthy  trends. We should strictly investigate and resolutely put an  end to the four unhealthy trends of abusing power for extortion,  swindling, cheating customers, and telling lies, making false  records and accounts, and selling fake and inferior commodities,  which have seriously affected Hebei's reform and opening up and  its image in foreign countries; local and trade protectionism;  as well as partiality in law enforcement for the benefits of  friends and relatives.    Third, we should be more resolute in eliminating  pornography,  the abduction of women and children, and the "six vices." We  should adopt the legal means to sternly crack down on all ugly  phenomena, such as production and sales of pornographic  products, prostitution and visits to prostitutes, abduction and  trafficking of women and children, gambling, and sex business.    Fourth, we should continue the struggle of "dealing strict  blows." We should make unremitting efforts to sternly crack  down on serious criminal and economic offenses and organize  special struggles in a timely manner to correct the practice of  replacing punishment according to criminal law with fines and  excessive leniency in punishment. Public security departments,  procuratorates, courts, and judicial departments should  strengthen coordination and cooperation to successfully perform  their function of dictatorship.    Fifth, we should achieve success in comprehensively  improving  public security. Through the comprehensive improvement  activities, we should reduce incidence of crimes, juvenile  delinquency, and serious mishaps and prevent the ugly phenomena  from spreading in society. Responsibility for the targets of  the comprehensive improvement activities should be resolutely  assigned to units and individuals.    Sixth, we should intensify the maintenance of stability  among the grass roots. In regard to the instable factors, the  grass-roots party and government organizations should  realistically assume responsibility in order to nip problems in  the bud so as to avoid their expansion and a worsened situation.  All localities should strengthen the work of handling visitors  and incoming letters from the masses; strengthen calculation and  prevention; and resolutely end and reduce the rising tendencies  of collective visits, particularly collective visits to the  province and Beijing. It is necessary to set up and perfect the  setup of the grass-roots security and civil mediation  organizations so as to strengthen the improvement of social  order by the masses.    Seventh, we should pay attention to the work toward  nationalities and religions. We should pay attention to  implementing policies for nationalities and religions. It is  necessary to vigorously promote and support the development of  the regional economy in the areas inhabited by the minority  nationalities. The proper religious activities should be  respected and protected. The unlawful activities of using  underground religious forces to disturb and damage social  stability should strictly be watched and legally be eliminated  and attacked.    Eighth, we should make big progress in setting up the legal  system. In line with the requirements of the new situation and  according to the order of importance and urgency, the provincial  people's congress and the provincial government should work out  plans to quicken the pace of economic legislation.  Simultaneously, we should conscientiously achieve propaganda  and education on the legal system and examine and supervise the  enforcement of laws.    Ninth, we should improve and strengthen media and  propaganda.  We should pay full attention to and bring into play the  propaganda departments and the mass media's functions for  encouraging, inspiring, and guiding the masses; and strengthen  the propaganda and education on patriotism, collectivism,  socialism, Comrade Jiang Z emin's pioneering spirit, and  revolutionary traditions. We should intensify the propaganda on  opening to the outside world and expand the influence over the  outside world. We should continue to regulate and control the  guidance of mass media and do a good job in running the press,  broadcasting stations, and television stations.    Tenth, we should vigorously carry out the mass cultural and  sports activities. We should build and rebuild some basic  cultural and sports facilities and pay attention to building  cultural facilities in enterprises, neighborhood committees, and  campuses. We should organize more high-quality and high-level  performance and competition activities and conduct various kinds  of mass cultural and sports activities that various kinds of  people are able to participate in.    Eleventh, we should further conduct the activities of  creating civilized units and civilized villages. In conducting  the army- civilian joint civility campaign, the  policemen-civilian joint civility campaign, and the campaign of  striving to be "double-support models," we should closely  proceed from reality and pay attention to real efficiency. We  should vigorously disseminate and popularize Jidong cement  plant's experience in creating a civilized unit and cultivating  civilized staff members and workers. We should vigorously  advocate and organize such autonomous organizations as mass  "wedding and funeral councils," "moral assessment societies,"  and "antigambling women's societies;" and carry forward good  folk customs.    Twelve, the mass organizations should bring into play their  functions for building the socialist spiritual civilization.  Under the leadership of the party committees, mass  organizations should positively engage themselves in the  construction of spiritual civilization, bring their roles into  play, and organize the activities with their own  characteristics. We should go to the grass roots to understand  the people's thinking, expectations, opinions, and requirements  and conduct the ideological and political work among the masses.    All departments concerned under the provincial party  committee and the provincial government should define targets  for the fulfillment of the aforementioned 12 tasks, define  responsibility to each unit and person, and also set up a  strict, scientific, and simple examination and assessment method.    6. The emphasis of party building should be placed on  successfully conducting various basic work and upgrading the  basic quality of the politics and careers of cadres.    We should have the party manage its affairs and the first  leading personnel of party committees should attach importance  on grasping party building. We should make all out efforts to  enhance the construction of leading bodies and of cadres'  contingent as a whole by regarding as a target the work of  upgrading the leadership level of leading bodies and the basic  quality of cadres' contingent and by proceeding from first  dealing with existing problems.    First, we should regard the study of Volume 3 of  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the  fundamental task in building party organizations and in having  the cadres' contingent carry out ideological and work style  construction. We should realistically do a good job in firmly  grasping the study. We should stress the study carried out with  a systematic manner; accurately understand and master its  fundamental ideology and viewpoints; pay attention to  integrating the theoretical study with experience summation; and  integrate the study with that of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  scientific attitude, pioneering spirit, and revolutionary  morale, with that of the decision adopted at the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and with the  promotion of programs in reform, opening up, and economic  construction. Localities, departments, and individuals should  strive to successfully deal with their prominent problems in  line with the integration between theories and practice. Through  steady study, we should vigorously upgrade the level of cadres  at all levels.    Second, we should realistically enhance the construction of  leading bodies at all levels. 1) We should adopt multiple  styles and measures to enhance the education conducted among  cadres at all levels and particularly among the leading cadres  at or above the county level or of large and medium-sized  enterprises with regard to the basic knowledge of socialist  market economic systems. 2) We should strictly enforce the  democratic centralism and uphold or perfect the specific systems  under democratic centralism so as to ensure the smooth  circulation of orders issued by the central authorities and the  provincial party committee and in order to maintain the unity  fostered by leading bodies. 3) On the premise of maintaining  the basic stability of leading bodies and in line with the needs  of building leading bodies and developing their work, we should  conduct consolidation in a planned, step by step manner among a  number of them and carry out personnel exchanges of cadres. We  should relentlessly and resolutely consolidate the leading  bodies that have indulged in disunity, still have not mended  their mistakes through education, adversely affected the work,  long lagged behind in work, and have committed some serious  problems. 4) A good job should be done in vigorously training  reserve cadres and upgrading their quality. We should dispatch  a large number of reserve cadres to enterprises or rural  villages to have them be trained there and upgrade or increase  their working capability in practice. We should increase the  proportion of reserve cadres at the provincial,  city-prefectural, and county levels, who come from the large and  medium-sized enterprises, the scientific research units, and the  higher educational institutions. 5) We should explore and  formulate a set of appropriate policies and methods to foster a  grand and outstanding contingent of entrepreneurs, appropriate  for market competition. We should attach importance on building  the contingent of entrepreneurs as we did for the contingents of  local party and government leading cadres. We should not  rigidly adhere to a form in selecting or introducing outstanding  talented personnel and adopt effective measures of encouragement  to stabilize the contingent of entrepreneurs, to create a fine  environment for the contingent's healthy growth, and to enable a  large number of outstanding talented personnel to show their  talent.    Third, we should enhance the managerial systems of cadres  and  establish an effective mechanism that can appraise the cadres'  achievements in a scientific way and employ cadres in line with  their achievements. The provincial party committee has decided  that effective from 1994 the province will conduct a  comprehensive appraisal at the end of every year according to  the "work outline" of the provincial party committee and the  demand set by the provincial people's government with regard to  the attainment of certain objectives over the work done by  various departments and commissions under the provincial party  committee, by various departments and bureaus under the  provincial people's government, and by various cities and  prefectures; as well as over the work done by leading bodies and  cadres. Meanwhile, appraised results will be regarded as the  main basis for replenishing and reinforcing leading bodies and  for carrying out rational readjustment among cadres. Those with  outstanding results should be commended; those with necessary  conditions should be promoted, put in important positions, and  awarded; those who are sluggish in making progress, stagnant for  many years, or even drop in ranking should be given a yellow  plate as warning and should change their outlook within a fixed  time; and those who make no improvement in work, are seriously  disunited, have unhealthy trends and many problems, practice  fraud, incite great dissatisfaction among the masses, and cause  serious problems that have adverse effect on the country should  be resolutely reshuffled. In short, those with achievements  will have official posts, and those without will not. Only when  we promote the cadres who truly have political integrity and  ability and have scored achievements and demote those who have  not, will we have hope for building an economically strong  province. For this reason, organization departments should  first straighten out their work styles, appoint personnel on  their merits, and never appoint personnel by favoritism or  appoint personnel to pursue benefits, not to speak of appointing  personnel according to their factions. Organization departments  at all levels should further emancipate the mind, update their  concepts, proceed from the "three advantages" in doing  everything, and evaluate and organize leading bodies and select  and use cadres to meet the needs of reform, opening up, and  economic development so as to serve as good advisers and  assistants to party committees.    Fourth, we should attach great importance to improving  grass-roots organizations and exert great efforts to strengthen  basic work. In the work to improve the party's grass-roots  organizations, rural areas are the weak link, and attention  should be concentrated on it next year. 1) We should solve the  problems of party branches whose work has paralyzed or half  paralyzed, which account for 3 percent of Hebei's total rural  party branches. Regarding the five types of villages pointed  out in the provincial party committee's "work outlines," we  should successfully rectify and transform them according to set  targets a group at a time. 2) We should attach importance to  improving party organizations of township enterprises. Township  enterprises without party organizations should step up efforts  to establish them; and those with party organizations should  improve their systems and start their activities as soon as  possible and enable them to play a good role as a political  guarantee. 3) We should adopt various measures to train all  rural grass-roots cadres through various forms in two to three  years. 4) We should study and formulate a package of systematic  methods for management for the cultivation, promotion,  appraisal, appointment and removal, training, reward and  punishment, and post retirement benefits of rural cadres. 5) We  should greatly encourage cadres at various levels, including  grass-roots cadres, to develop the work styles of doing  practical work and telling the truth and to refrain from  switching their behavior according to the intention of higher  levels and the expression of leaders, boasting by exaggerating  about their experiences and achievements, and telling lies and  making false records and accounts to harm the party, the state,  and themselves. "Fake and inferior" activities in leadership  work are even more harmful than the "fake and inferior" products  of enterprises, and they should be resolutely eliminated.  Cadres at all levels should greatly develop the spirit of  trying to distinguish themselves and be the best and develop the  work style of seeking truth. They should concentrate their  minds and efforts on doing work in a down- to-earth manner,  bringing more realistic benefits to the people, and making more  contributions to Hebei's rapid and healthy economic development  so that they can upgrade their work to a new level and achieve  new and still greater progress.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO DONATE $2,000 FOR GRAD-NITE  </P> <P> The City Council has agreed to donate $2,000 to the Cypress High School  Grad-Nite committee.  </P> <P> The June 20 event is aimed at keeping graduating seniors off the streets and  out of trouble during graduation night -- a night that has been historically  high in teen drunk-driving-related deaths, said Susan Ahlswede, event  coordinator.  </P> <P> Last year's inaugural event drew 76% of the school's graduating class. This  year, organizers hope to draw 90% of the seniors.  </P> <P> "We plan to keep them busy all night with live entertainment, a casino and  various carnival booths. The main purpose of having Grad-Nite is to have a  drug- and alcohol-free party. It keeps the kids in a sober atmosphere and out  of the driving situation," Ahlswede said.  </P> <P> Council member Cecilia Age voted against appropriating funds for the event,  saying that while it was a worthwhile program, the council could not contribute  to every community organization that asks for money.  </P> <P> "I support the event and will be the first to but tickets for it. But where do  you draw the line? Pretty soon you're spending funds on things that aren't city  functions," Age said.  </P> <P> Council member Gail Kerry voted to help fund the program and also praised its  worthiness. But she added that the school's booster groups should be doing more  to raise money. Kerry also suggested charging students a higher admission fee  to help further defray the cost.  </P> <P> Students will be charged $25 for admission to the event, which will be held on  the campus.  </P> <P> Ahlswede said last year's event cost $20,000, and estimated that this year's  festivities will have a similar price tag. She said the money is raised through  donations and ticket sales. GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

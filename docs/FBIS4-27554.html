			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Finnish mobile phone maker  Nokia aims to capture a 20 percent share in Japan's digital  cellular phone market, a senior company official said Wednesday  [1 June].    Nokia Vice President Jouko Hayrynen told KYODO NEWS SERVICE  he expects Japan to become a trendsetter in Asia's mobile phone  market as seen by the boom that followed the government's  decision to allow makers to retail instead of lease their  products. Helped by the deregulation, the number of mobile  phone suppliers in Japan has since doubled to more than 25.    Nokia, the world's second-largest mobile phone maker after  Motorola Inc. of the United States, will finish preparations for  volume production of models tailored to the Japanese market by  the end of this month, Hayrynen said. Hayrynen said the  Japanese mobile phone market is estimated at 1.3 million to 1.5  million units this year, of which about 50 percent will be  digital machines.</p>

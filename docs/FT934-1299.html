			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Arts: An end to the Gloriana myth - Opera This wonderful new Gloriana, which crowns a year of exceptionally successful activity at Opera North, surpasses all expectations. These were pretty high-pitched: for this is, after all, the first entirely new British production of Britten's 1953 Coronation opera for 27 years (and, indeed, only the third British production in the work's history). And it arrives soon after the issue, widely and justly praised, of the work's first-ever recording. The recorded Gloriana (on Argo) stimulated an excited reappraisal of the work's qualities. This new staging, a demonstration of British music-theatre at its most imaginative, will surely take the whole valuable process a great deal further. It can hardly be a coincidence that Opera North shares with Argo both the occupant of Britten's title role - Josephine Barstow, of whose sovereign vocal and theatrical gifts the occasion affords yet another priceless example - and an approach to the work that can only be described as missionary. The myth of Gloriana, the fruit of a misbegotten Coronation commission, savourless and even sterile in spite of its expertly deployed Grand Operatic machinery, has taken a long time dying. After Saturday evening its end must be nearer than ever. The glitter, sweep and zest of the performance, its speed of unfolding and command of memorable gesture, its decisive, intimate meshing of 'period' and 'modern' theatrical device, simply bowl one over. These are qualities as much musical as dramatic: for in look and sound, in the style and deportment of the large cast (dancers no less than solo and chorus singers), the show bears the hallmarks of closely unified thought among all its collaborators. A thread of unassailable theatrical logic binds the production. It is immediately evidenced in the springy freshness of the orchestral playing under Paul Daniel, who reveals his admirably firm grasp of the scope and purpose of Britten's scoring. Over and over the ear is struck by the particular way the large orchestra is used - 'weightlessly', with a layering of timbre that at once places the opera's formal and scenic contrasts and suggests the up-to-date tensions informing the evocation of historical situations and personages. Mr Daniel keeps the pacing taut; and so does the staging by Phyllida Lloyd in the designs of Anthony Ward, a brilliant piece of work. Leitmotifs of the Elizabethan theatre abound - a wooden-box arena (which put me in mind of the Hampton Court tennis court) containing every scene, huge shadows suddenly thrown by footlighting. Likewise, images taken from late 16th century iconography, bold costume textures and colours creating a sense of extravagant court ritual that affords the production its peculiar piquancy of flavour. There is humour in it, a lightness of touch showering unsuspected benefits in the Norwich Masque - although even the Lloyd-Ward brand of theatrical zip cannot render entirely free of Gainsborough Films-style rhubarb the London street scene and the plentiful embarrassments of its gnomic blind balladeer (a case for simply cutting the whole scene?). More important, an erotic energy is tapped from the relationship of Elizabeth and Essex that newly strengthens Britten's acute balance of private and public worlds - an uncomfortable and even painful balance, with its resonances alike in historical situation and in the composer's own emotional and psychological complexities. Neither previous account of Gloriana that I have seen (at Sadler's Wells and at the Coliseum) possessed this unflinching directness. It emanates directly from the pairing of Barstow's Elizabeth, crafty, tough, violent and generous by turns, and Thomas Randle's agile, poetic Essex, long locks, lean frame and sultry good looks perfectly in place, weaknesses and strengths impetuously commingled. Further playing-in will surely encourage her to deliver all the sung words as clearly and eloquently as she does those of the final spoken passages (given in full and wholly justified in context). He will surely learn to find sweeter lyricism in the lute songs. Already, both are unforgettable. Around them Opera North has assembled an attractive young cast, graced by Karl Morgan Daymond's handsome Mountjoy, Susan Chilcott's incisive Lady Rich, Yvonne Burnett's gentle Lady Essex, and the precise, distinctively uttered Spirit of the Masque of Paul Nilon. I love Kate Flatt's choreography, and the wit with which an all-male troupe carries it off. No weaknesses? Well, Eric Roberts lacks as yet the art of impressing subtle, grave authority on every syllable of Cecil's 'Song of Government'. And, as a general point, the re-disposition of a three-act opera into two parts (with a long pause at the three-quarter mark) allows the audience insufficient breathing space between scenes. It also denies them the full impact of Elizabeth's prayer, which Barstow sings with magnificent concentration - this should provide the opera's first great curtain-close and here fails to do so. Otherwise, highest praise all round. The production visits Covent Garden in February, and Nottingham, Manchester, Norwich and Hull after that. Head for the box office now.

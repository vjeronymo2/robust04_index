			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps considers stake sale MORE THAN 10 per cent of the shares of Pinault-Printemps, the French retailing group, may be sold in a public offer, the company said yesterday. In a prospectus Societe Alsacienne de Magasins, a subsidiary of Pinault-Printemps, said it planned to sell at least half of the 2.9m shares  -about 22 per cent of the total - it holds in its parent company. According to Samag, the shares are being sold to increase the number of Pinault shares in public hands. The move is also necessary under French company law which requires the disposal of Samag's stake in Pinault-Printemps within one year of the merger between Pinault and Printemps, completed in December last year. The sale of Samag's holding, which is conditional on market conditions, is through an offer on the Paris stock market and a private placing for international investors. The international tranche, to be placed by BZW, the merchant bank, will be subject to a 15 per cent clawback if the domestic portion is oversubscribed. Mr Francois Pinault, Pinault-Printemps chairman, and the other members of the Pinault family together control about 39.6 per cent of the capital of the group and just over 50 per cent of the voting rights. The family holding intends to take up sufficient shares in the tender to keep its stake unchanged.</p>

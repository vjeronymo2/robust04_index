			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE'S RESIGNATION  </P> <P> The Times presented verbatim highlights of Shevardnadze's speech in which he  clearly states that he is still a Communist (Part A, Dec. 21). Anyone who ever  studied Communism must know that it is a doctrine that advocates the  dictatorship of the proletariat. So, how can Shevardnadze resign his post  because of a threat of a dictatorship? Or perhaps, is it just a dictatorship  not to his liking?  </P> <P> IRWIN GROSSMAN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

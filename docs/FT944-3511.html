			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / People: Non-executive directors VCI, the video and audio publishing group which was floated on the London Stock Exchange earlier this year, has appointed Michael Grade non-executive chairman as from January 2. As chief executive of Channel 4, Grade, a former director of programmes at the BBC, is allowed to have two non-executive directorships. He is already a non-executive of First Leisure Corporation. Steve Ayres, at the moment both chairman and chief executive of the company, is to give up the chairman's role to concentrate on being chief executive. Ayres was a pioneer of the video 'sell-through' market in the UK - selling rather than renting videos. The company has since moved on to include audio tapes and is now experimenting with multi-media technology. VCI's stock reached a new high of 160p on news of Grade's appointment, valuing the company at more than Pounds 60m.</p>

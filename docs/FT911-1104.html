			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Operators review travel to Yugoslavia BRITISH tour operators and travel agents were yesterday reviewing the position facing travel to Yugoslavia after the latest outbreak of violence, David Churchill writes. They were concerned about the lack of firm guidance by the Foreign Office about travel to Yugoslavia. A number of leading operators are understood to support a move to ban holiday travel to the country in advance of any Foreign Office ruling. The latest Foreign Office advice is for travellers to avoid the area between Karlovac and Sisak in the north of the country and Split and Gospic to the south, including the coast road. They should also avoid travelling in the area of Croatia to the north of the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway. The Foreign Office said there was no reason for travellers to avoid the main cities in the tourist areas of Istria, Slovenia and Montenegro. Yugotours, the largest operator to the country and backed by the Yugoslav government, has some 2,500 Britons at present on holiday in Yugoslavia. Last year about 800,000 Britons went to Yugoslavia, mainly to the coastal seaside resorts, where holidays were considerably less expensive than their Spanish equivalent. Even before the Gulf War, however, the market this year was looking bleak because of the UK recession. Now Yugoslavia's tourist industry, its biggest foreign exchange earner, faces the effects of the nationalist upheavals. Tourism brought in an estimated Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.27bn) in 1989 and at least 10 per cent more last year.</p>

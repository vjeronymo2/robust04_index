			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Zedillo assails US measure: Proposition 187 violates human rights, says Mexican politician Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's president-elect, was ready to tell President Bill Clinton yesterday that he viewed anti-immigrant initiatives like that approved in California this month as 'a violation of basic human rights'. In a breakfast session with reporters prior to a White House lunch, Mr Zedillo said he would insist that cross-border issues like illegal immigration be dealt with bilaterally and not left to unilateral state action. He pointed out that Mexican laws already guaranteed the access to education and healthcare for all, regardless of nationality, that California's Proposition 187 would deny to undocumented aliens. He hoped the US would engage in an 'extensive' public debate which would end up by reflecting the 'traditional American values' which had always welcomed immigrants. Unlike the outgoing Mexican government, Mr Zedillo made no explicit link between illegal immigration and a deepening of the North American Free Trade Agreement, approved 12 months ago. He argued that Nafta should contribute to the sort of economic development which would lessen the pressures on Mexicans to seek employment in the US. The pact has already resulted in a 20 per cent growth in bilateral trade, turning Mexico into the fastest growing market for US exports. He also foresaw a wider hemispheric free trade area in the foreseeable future, starting with Chile. Mr Zedillo said he recognised with gratitude the position that Mr Clinton and his administration had taken against Proposition 187, the implementation of which, due next year, is already under challenge in state and federal courts. However, anti-immigrant sentiment has been fuelled by the California referendum and now threatens the social benefits of those foreigners legally resident in the US. One version of the draft welfare reform bill being considered by the new Republican majority in the House contains such a threat, with a few exemptions for the elderly. This bill would also require that welfare agencies report to the federal government any case in which a recipient is suspected of being an illegal immigrant, as Proposition 187 does for doctors and teachers. This week two former Republican cabinet members, Mr Jack Kemp and Mr William Bennett, again voiced their misgivings about immigration controls. Mr Kemp, former housing secretary and a potential presidential candidate, warned that the Republicans risked turning themselves 'inwards to a protectionist and isolationist and more xenophobic party', contrary to its traditions. But their arguments have already been directly criticised in the National Review, the magazine for conservative thinkers. One article in its latest edition, headlined 'America's identity crisis,' claims that all immigration, legal and illegal, 'strengthens and reinforces ethnic subcultures', produces minimal economic benefit and is directly responsible for what the author condemns as the flowering of multiculturalism and the growth of the welfare state.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries The 14 per cent jump in BAT's first-quarter pre-tax profits fully justifies the re-rating which its shares have enjoyed this year. The question after yesterday's 25p rise is whether investors ought to switch to one of the composite insurers with which the group now tends to be compared. The faint-hearted will cut and run ahead of a key US Supreme Court ruling on tobacco liability expected this summer. But the scope for BAT to use its relentless tobacco cash flow to increase dividends, combined with Eagle Star's turnaround potential, more than merits a prospective 6 per cent yield.</p>

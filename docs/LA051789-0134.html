			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VOICE' OF THE PHILHARMONIC TO BECOME CBS RADIO FILM CRITIC  </P> <P> Gail Eichenthal, the "voice" of the Los Angeles Philharmonic broadcasts for  more than 11 years and the first woman to announce the national radio  broadcasts of a major symphony orchestra, will leave her post at KUSC-FM (91.5)  to become a film critic for CBS Radio.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old Eichenthal has hosted the KUSC concert series -- distributed by  American Public Radio and heard on 95 stations -- since 1978 and in 1983 began  producing the show.  </P> <P> "I've been involved in concert music as a broadcaster and producer virtually  all my adult life and I love it passionately, but I've felt the need to stretch  myself in new directions for some time," she said.  </P> <P> Eichenthal's last live Philharmonic broadcast will be in June, but her  authoritative and informative broadcasts will be heard for several months  thereafter as the season's shows are repeated through December.  </P> <P> Though she is excited about her new endeavor (her reviews will be heard  nationwide), she is not without "a tremendous amount of sadness" in leaving  KUSC.  </P> <P> "This is like leaving home," she said. "In a lot of ways I grew up here."  </P> <P> Wally Smith, KUSC's general manager, said: "Gail (and her production team) have  set a new standard in the sound, production and quality of writing in live  concert music radio programming," Smith said. "Gail has been the linchpin in  that effort."  </P> <P> Her decision to leave KUSC was propelled, she said, by "a hankering for the  real world."  </P> <P> A self-described lifelong "news junkie," Eichenthal will also take on  newswriting and reporting assignments for KNX Radio, the local CBS affiliate.  </P> <P> The decision to move into other journalistic arenas has been several years in  the making, Eichenthal said.  </P> <P> KNX's news director Robert Sims has long been a fan of Eichenthal's. "She's a  particularly gifted writer with a wonderful sense of radio," Sims said. "That  kind of talent is quite a find regardless of whether the person is involved in  music or news."  </P> <P> Sims said Eichenthal's film reviews, which premiered April 17 and air Mondays  through Wednesdays, have been "very intelligent, thoughtful and insightful."  </P> <P>  Sims first called Eichenthal in 1985 and persuaded her to produce a series of  entertainment reports for his station.  </P> <P> When the film critic's job became available, he urged her to try out.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I had a chance," she said. "I was up against some real film  critics."  </P> <P> But, Sims said, Gail had that special spark, a rare ability to communicate  warmth and insight. "Gail's efforts had the sound of someone with something  special to say, despite her rather thin film background," he said.  </P> <P> Though a music major at UCLA, Eichenthal says she has been a film buff for  years.  </P> <P> "Films have been a great release for me," she said. "I go to movies  incessantly."  </P> <P> In a recent movie review, Eichenthal praised a small, low-budget film: "Right  under our noses the most marvelous mysteries are going on every moment if only  we realized it. That's the refreshing premise of 'Some Girls,' a terrific  romantic comedy with a French-Canadian flavor." She describes a house in the  film as "a Gothic masterpiece filled with ancient tapestries and spooky Art  Deco antiques," and a pack of relatives living in it as "so bizarre they make  the Addams family look like they fell out of a Norman Rockwell poster."  </P> <P> She would like to "keep a hand in classical music" and hopes to work on special  projects with KUSC and the Philharmonic.  </P> <P> "I'm so in love with the Philharmonic that if there's any way to continue that  association I will do whatever it takes," she said.  </P> <P> Among the highlights of her dozen years with KUSC and the Philharmonic was her  first national broadcast on Oct. 26, 1978 -- a date indelibly etched in  Eichenthal's memory -- the four foreign tours she has taken with the orchestra  and the opportunity to work with former Philharmonic music director Andre  Previn, who resigned April 25 because of dissatisfaction with the  organization's management.  </P> <P> Touring with the orchestra enabled her to learn more about the day-to-day life  of the musicians.  </P> <P> "Part of my job has been to impart a sense of what it is like for the  musicians," she said. She said she has endeavored to persuade listeners that  classical music is "not for an elitist audience," and has tried to humanize the  orchestra by giving listeners an idea of what is involved in being a concert  performer.  </P> <P> "I have a tremendous amount of pride in being associated with an orchestra of  that caliber," she said.  </P></p>

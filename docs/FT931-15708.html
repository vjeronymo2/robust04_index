			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Slovaks stage rush on banks Thousands of Slovaks, confused over the fate of their money, staged a rush on banks yesterday to get rid of Czechoslovak banknotes, Reuter reports from Bratislava. In an unusual response to monetary uncertainty, Slovaks queued for up to three hours at banks in Bratislava - not to withdraw cash but to deposit it. Others changed crowns into western currency. Behind the rush to the banks, officials said, were fears that banknotes issued by the defunct Czechoslovak federation might be worthless or be difficult to convert once a currency union agreed by the Czech and Slovak republics collapses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- President Lech Walesa vetoed a new  law on the rights and duties of MPs and notified Sejm Speaker  Jozef Oleksy about his decision on Thursday, the president's  press office announced on Thursday.    The main reason of the decision was that, according to the  proposed law, a lump money would be paid to deputies and  senators after the expiry of their terms of office if they were  running in the next elections, throughout the entire period  between terms. The president contends that this would actually  be a privilege jeopardizing those who run for the first time and  must continue their jobs.    The second reason was that the proposed law converted social  allowances paid to MPs into their regular lump payment and on  top of that, this article would have been retroactive to June 1,  1993, if not vetoed.</p>

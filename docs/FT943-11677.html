			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Tug-of-war over Italian PM's brother Lawyers were yesterday involved in a tug-of-war with Milan magistrates to prevent the imprisonment on corruption charges of Mr Paolo Berlusconi, younger brother of the Italian prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Milan magistrates issued an arrest warrant for Mr Paolo Berlusconi on Tuesday, alleging his involvement in paying bribes totalling L330m (Pounds 136,500) to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, over tax inspections of his brother's Fininvest group. The arrest warrant continued yesterday to cause nervousness in the financial markets about the stability of the right-wing coalition government. The lira was fluctuating below the psychological floor of L1,000 against the D-Mark, but recovered slightly to L1,003 in late trading. Anti-corruption magistrates in Milan have insisted on detention of the 42-year-old Paolo Berlusconi on the grounds that he might tamper with evidence. Two weeks ago the coalition introduced a decree which limited the judiciary's powers to use preventive detention. However, the Milan magistrates, who were then investigating the Fininvest media empire, threatened to resign - a threat which was largely responsible for forcing the government to withdraw the decree five days later. Mr Paolo Berlusconi is one of four people linked with Fininvest whose arrest has been ordered since Friday. Only one of these, Mr Salvatore Sciascia, head of the group's tax and accounting department, has surrendered himself. It was largely on the basis of Mr Sciascia's confessions that Mr Paolo Berlusconi was implicated for approving the payment of money to members of the Guardia di Finanza between 1989 and 1992. Milan magistrates were yesterday also seeking to establish the precise managerial role played by Mr Silvio Berlusconi while he was head of Fininvest and before he entered politics in last January. They are believed to be investigating ownership of the Telepiu cable television channel. They are checking whether Mr Berlusconi had a larger than declared stake through nominees. If this were proved, the prime minister could risk losing his commercial television licences. At the political level Mr Berlusconi has begun preparing to defend his role in the growing confrontation with the judiciary which has so weakened his government. He is scheduled to lead a parliamentary debate next Tuesday. In the meantime, he has rejected a suggestion by Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, to remove from government all those linked to Fininvest. The advice from Mr Fini, until now his most loyal partner in the coalition, underlines how isolated Mr Berlusconi has become over the Fininvest affair. Reuter adds: Mr Silvio Berlusconi will present a plan today to have a special committee oversee his businesses, according to political sources who declined to be named. They said the plan called for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the heads of the two houses of parliament to name the oversight committee. Managers of Mr Berlusconi's companies would still have powers of decision, but would need to have their actions approved by the committee. 'It's a real separation of powers. It will cut all links between Berlusconi and his company,' one said.</p>

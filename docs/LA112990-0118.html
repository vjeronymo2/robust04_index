			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD PUTS OFF VOTE ON ITS PAY  </P> <P> The Moorpark school board Tuesday broached the touchy subject of $200-a-month  compensation for board members, but concern over the district's budget prompted  them to put the item on hold until next year's budget discussions.  </P> <P> Supt.  </P> <P> Thomas G. Duffy was directed to draft board policy regarding compensation and  to check with comparable districts to see what payment board members receive.  </P> <P> Board member Cynthia Hubbard brought up the subject because board members' work  has expanded. The Moorpark Unified School District has seven schools, with an  eighth scheduled to open in September, 1991.  </P> <P> "There is so much business for us, including time off from business and  family," Hubbard said. "When we just had three schools, there was not as much  business as now."  </P> <P> Board member Tom Baldwin agreed. "It's been my observation that this position  has cost me $1,000 a year in phone bills, postage to constituents and time off  from work. I didn't run for the school board with any idea of getting rich, but  I don't think I should find myself in a losing situation."  </P> <P> However, Cynthia Coler, the teacher representative to the board, warned members  about the district's budget. "At our school site, things seem to be getting  tighter and tighter. My concern would be: How does this fit into the budget?"  </P> <P> The board policy will include the stipulation that any board member who does  not want compensation can donate the money back to the school district.

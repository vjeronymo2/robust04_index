			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.J. Tzou and Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Geneva, March 26 (CNA) -- Australia Friday [25  March] asked Taiwan to allow imports of Australian rice in  compliance with fair trade regulations laid down by the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    With unexpectedly friendly rapport, negotiators from  Australia and Taiwan exchanged views on Taiwan's economic and  industrial structures and possible tariff concessions during a  series of ongoing bilateral tariff talks here.    Chen Wu-hsiung, a Council of Agriculture official, told  chief  Australian negotiator Donald Kenyon and his party that Taiwan's  rice market would be opened slowly to allow rice farmers time to  adjust to foreign competition.    Chen proposed that Taiwan adopt the "Korean formula" of  allowing rice imports of one to two percent of domestic  consumption in the first six years of Taiwan's GATT membership.    Foreign rice imports would gradually increase to four  percent  by the 10th year, Huang said.    Kenyon, however, suggested that the "Japanese formula" would  be in Taiwan's best interests. Japan, at the end of last year,  agreed to rice imports of between four and eight percent of  domestic consumption for six years before moving to  tariffication.    The "Korean formula," according to Kenyon, will not  necessarily be a better policy for Taiwan, as Korea, while  winning key concessions on rice, was forced to give ground on  other farm product markets.    "Which may beget heavier losses for Taiwan," Kenyon said.    Taiwan has held a series of bilateral tariff negotiations  with Hungary, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, Turkey and  Australia during the past week here.    A total of 21 countries have requested tariff-reduction  negotiations with Taiwan. Results of these talks will be key to  Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade body before  the end of this year, according to chief Taiwan negotiator Huang  Yen-chao.</p>

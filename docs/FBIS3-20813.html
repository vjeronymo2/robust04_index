			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Baczynski: "Left Side, Right Side"] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] When ministers dispute how to  apportion budget outlays, it means that it is the last stage of  work on the budget. The basic framework of the budget is created  by professionals at the Ministry of Finance (in cooperation with  the Central Planning Office and the National Bank of Poland). It  usually begins with an analysis of the current economic  conditions, a forecast for the next year, and determination of  the so-called fixed obligations of the budget. Only then is  superposed a grid of political and economic priorities that can  be debated. Any breach of this logic or any major error of the  forecast can lead to a crisis of public finance. We have  experienced such crises on our own skin; in the last few years  the real world of the budget kept diverging from the assumptions.  <H5>  The Minister's Dream </H5>   Errors could not be avoided in 1993 either, although this  time they were positive errors, such as every minister of  finance dreams of. Last year budgetary receipts were more than 4  percent (17.5 trillion zlotys, or Z17.5 trillion) higher than  planned, while outlays were 2 percent (Z10 trillion) lower, and  the deficit is certain not to exceed Z60 trillion instead of the  anticipated Z81 trillion. These surprisingly good results were  due chiefly to higher receipts from the personal income tax and  a decline in the number of old-age pensions and annuities as  well as the delay in revaluing them, along with lower outlays on  servicing the foreign debt (a decline in interest rates, absence  of an agreement with the so-called Club of London), and... the  known difficulties in financing the budget deficit. At any rate,  H. Suchocka's government bequeathed to its successors an  underutilized "deficit cap," meaning that the growth in domestic  debt was less (by Z28 trillion) than expected. When speaking of  the dramatic condition of public finance it should also be borne  in mind that in October 1993, for the first time in a long time,  there was a budget surplus and in November the budget was  balanced. Hence, a definite trend toward an improvement in  public finance arose in 1993, which greatly facilitated the  start of the new government under Prime Minister Pawlak.    Likewise, the economic situation in 1993 (despite the  unemployment and a negative balance of foreign trade) warrants  an optimistic forecast for 1994. According to the recent report  of the Central Planning Office, for 1993 industrial output will  be 7 percent higher than in the preceding year; foreign trade  began finally to improve as of last October (owing to the August  devaluation); and the financial performance of enterprises and  their possibilities for raising wages also are better.... Were  it not for November and December, when food prices soared,  inflation would remain at the planned level. [passage omitted]    The macroeconomic assumptions for 1994 of W. Pawlak's  government do not diverge from those announced earlier by the  previous government: That is, a 4.5 percent increase in the GDP;  27-percent inflation (23 percent as measured from December 1994  to December 1993); a faster increase in exports (6 percent) than  in imports; the maintenance of a creeping (in measure with the  inflation) devaluation of the zloty; a limited growth of  unemployment (to up to 190,000); and maintenance of  civil-service salaries at the level of 91 percent of the wages  paid in the private sector. We can thus expect a peaceful  continuation and strengthening of positive tendencies in the  economy. Fortunately, the rationale of the 1994 budget law  contains no trace of the campaign rhetoric about the tragic  recession, the need to stimulate growth by spurring inflation, a  radical change in the exchange rate of the dollar, or printing  more money in measure with the perceived social needs. As Deputy  Prime Minister Borowski said recently in the Sejm, "Life has  taught everyone to distance himself from promises and to  perceive the reality humbly."  <H5>  Five Priorities </H5>   I emphasize that the 1994 budget is largely predicated on  continuing the economic policy of the preceding government,  although that is certainly not politically convenient to the new  government. But since I myself, following the elections last  September, had expressed fears that the new government might "go  on a rampage" and thus risk economic stability, I wish to state  now that the government of Waldemar Pawlak is displaying a  commendably realistic and responsible attitude. This does not at  all mean that the 1994 budget draft lacks some leftist emphasis  that clearly reflects the change in political priorities.    When speaking of the 1994 budget, Deputy Prime Minister  Borowski mentioned five assumptions on which its final draft was  based:    --Halting the decline in outlays on government operation.  This concerns increasing civil-service salaries to keep in step  with the inflation and maintaining the real value of material  expenditures.    --Strengthening the protection of the neediest by, among  other things, increasing expenditures on welfare, raising the  minimum old-age pensions and annuities, and providing funds for  so-called housing allowances.    --As to restructuring the economy, providing the funds  needed  for social protection due to the shutdowns of unprofitable  mines, maintaining arms industry plants in operation by giving  them government orders, building roads and highways, and  providing debt relief for enterprises and banks.    --Stimulating the economy by broadening investment tax  relief; promoting exports and investments by, among other  things, providing government loan guarantees and credit  insurance.    --Providing the funds needed to successfully complete the  steps being taken to reduce foreign debt and to utilize foreign  capital more efficiently.    It is worth noting that these five priorities differ from  the  traditional so-called branch priorities. Thus, they make no  mention of any privileged treatment of, e.g., education,  culture, or health services, and neither are there any points  devoted to agriculture, national defense, or the police. The  proposed priorities are certain to meet with criticism from many  deputies lobbying for the interests of their constituencies, but  at the same time, on resorting to the transfer method, they  should make for easier discussion with representatives of branch  interest groups.    However, an important provision is missing from the above  enumeration, and this casts a huge reflection on the shape of  the 1994 budget. Namely, the minister of finance has earlier  declared, "The possibilities for balancing the budget by  slashing expenditures are exhausted." As a result, the most  characteristic feature of the 1994 budget will be a considerable  increase in the outlays and receipts of the state.  <H5>  Receipts, Outlays, and the Deficit </H5>   The 1994 budgetary receipts are envisaged at Z610 trillion,  i.e., 35 percent more than in 1993, or, in real terms, after  allowance is made for price increases, 6.5 percent more. As for  budgetary outlays, they are envisaged at Z693 trillion, which  means a nominal increase of 37.5 percent, or an increase of 8.3  percent in real terms. Hence, the planned budget deficit is to  amount to Z83 trillion compared with, let me point out, Z60  trillion in 1993.    We already know more or less where the higher receipts will  come from. Chiefly from taxes: This year the government intends  to collect Z506 trillion from taxpayers, compared with Z363  trillion in 1993. Thus, we have new income tax rates, the  lump-sum tax payable by small businesses, the extension of the  VAT to businesses with incomes of more than Z1.2 billion a year  (previously the minimum level was Z4 billion), and the  restrictions on certain tax exemptions and relief. The brunt of  financing the greater obligations of the state budget will be  borne by consumers and small businesses.    On the expenditures side a special place is occupied by  servicing the foreign debt (Z30 trillion) and the domestic debt  (Z82 trillion). The nation's total foreign debt in 1993 was  about Z1,000 trillion, and domestic debt Z360 trillion.  Fortunately, we are servicing our foreign debt only partially,  but even so, taken as a whole, the burden of servicing both the  domestic and the foreign debt will consume as much as 16 percent  of all budgetary outlays. To the government this is a warning to  desist from hastily contracting any more loans for financing  budgetary outlays and to utilize foreign credit rationally. Of  the Z693 trillion in outlays, after the outlays on debt  servicing are deducted, there remains about Z580 trillion, of  which Z362 trillion is to be spent on civil-service salaries and  similar government expenditures.    In the budget draft the expenditures are listed in several  hundred tables. In view of the occasional differences in  calculating techniques, not all the figures are directly  comparable with the expenditures in 1993. Even so, assuming the  classical breakdown by ministries, the largest beneficiaries of  the 1994 budget are the ministries of: labor and social welfare  (outlays higher by more than one-third), transportation, foreign  trade, and science. On the other hand, lower than average  outlays are planned for construction, communications, higher  education, the judiciary, public security, and national defense.  Education will be given somewhat more money (relatively  speaking) than health care. As regards the kinds of outlays,  those increasing the most are, in addition to debt servicing,  the outlays on housing loan guarantees (increased to Z7 trillion  from Z2.6), the mortgage credit fund (to Z800 billion from  Z100), expenditures on industrial restructuring (to Z6 trillion  from Z2), and on old-age pensions and annuities for the defense  ministry's personnel, and chiefly on subsidies for social  security (to Z140 trillion from Z104). This listing reveals  quite unambiguously the priorities of the current government.    In any budget debate--and this time it will not be otherwise  either--the question of how realistic the budget is must be  raised. The 1994 draft budget seems to be very tightly  stretched. The figures on planned tax revenues seem rather  optimistic, as do the possibilities for financing the deficit,  especially in view of the unbending attitude of the National  Bank of Poland [the central bank], which has offered only Z30  trillion to support the budget. The inflation rate envisaged for  this year seems rather optimistic, even if assuming slower price  increases--and higher inflation may make shambles of the entire  budget. In its turn, the marked increase in the tax burden may  affect adversely investment and the growth in personal  consumption, thus slowing down the anticipated rate of economic  growth. Furthermore, the need to finance the high deficit may  reduce the supply of credit available for the economy. The  perils involved in executing such an expansive budget are  numerous--and in this case, unlike in politics, the left side  (receipts) must always be in accord with the right (outlays).    In brief, the government has undertaken a risky attempt to  increase public expenditures, motivated by important social  considerations. Still, contrary to many previous fears, the  presented draft budget does not exceed the limits of permissible  political corrections, even though it is very close to the limit  of economic safety.

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Huhtamaki improves 63% to FM399m STRONG demand and the benefits of rationalisation led to a 63 per cent increase in 1992 profits at Huhtamaki, the Finnish confectionery, pharmaceutical and packaging group. The group increased its profit after financial items to FM399m (Dollars 73.8m) from FM245m, as operating earnings climbed 41 per cent to FM561m and net sales rose 9 per cent to FM6.58bn from FM6.03bn. The dividend is being increased to FM3.20 per share from FM2.70, reflecting a 72 per cent growth in earnings per share to FM11.07. A further increase in pre-tax profits is anticipated in 1993 with sales expected to exceed FM7bn. Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, said: 'Huhtamaki's profitability has improved to a new level earlier than envisaged. Key products enjoyed a strong demand despite tight market conditions, while consolidation and rationalisation programmes boosted profitability in each business sector above targeted levels.' Finland accounts for less than 20 per cent of Huhtamaki's sales, so the group was a beneficiary of the sharp weakening of the markka during 1992. The Leaf group, one of the world's top 10 confectionary producers, saw operating profits rise 31 per cent to FM312m as net sales climbed 18 per cent to FM3.86bn. The Leiras pharmaceutical unit lifted operating earnings by 77 per cent to FM148m on a 10 per cent increase in net sales to FM744m. The Finnish banking sector's combined credit losses will be about FM20bn this year compared with about FM21bn in 1992, the Finance Ministry said in an economic forecast, Reuter reports from Helsinki. 'The number of bankruptcies will stay very high and banks' credit losses (in 1993) are likely to remain at last year's level or about 20bn markka,' the forecast said.</p>

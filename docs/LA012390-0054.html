			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSICIANS UNION SAYS IT IS PREPARED TO STRIKE;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF MUSICIANS SAYS IT WILL FIGHT TO KEEP  A SPECIAL ROYALTY AND A FREE CONCERT FUND.  </P> <P> The entertainment industry, which was hit by a crippling 22-week strike by TV  and movie writers in 1988, is bracing for a possible walkout by the American  Federation of Musicians, which has told its 185,000 members that it will strike  if record companies carry out plans to end payments to two special union funds.  </P> <P> As contract negotiations get under way today, federation officials have said  they are prepared to fight to keep a special royalty fund as well as the Music  Performance Trust Fund, set up in 1948 to pay for free live concerts. The  latter fund has been the subject of a heated dispute at least since 1973, when  the record industry began arguing that its original purpose -- to provide jobs  for live concert musicians displaced by the growth of the modern studio-based  recording industry -- has become obsolete.  </P> <P> "We have been put on notice by the (record) companies that their primary  demands will be the elimination of the Music Performance Trust Fund," said  President J. Martin Emerson in a letter sent to union members earlier this  month. "They also seek elimination of the Special Payments Fund. . . .  Apparently, the companies are intent on inviting a strike."  </P> <P> It is unclear, however, whether musicians will support a strike over the issue.  The federation says it has 185,000 members, but only about 27,000 of them work  regularly in the record industry, union officials estimate.  </P> <P> Emerson could not be reached for comment Monday, but a federation spokesmen  said the union plans to press the issue of maintaining the two funds. A strike  could delay completion of film and television sound tracks as well as disrupt  the recording industry.  </P> <P> The Special Payments Fund pays studio musicians based on a complex formula  devised by the federation and recording industry. The payments, which have  declined substantially in the past two decades, are similar to the "residuals"  earned by actors in the film and TV industries.  </P> <P> The Music Performance Trust Fund was established in 1948 as a nonprofit public  service organization through negotiations with the federation and record  companies. A royalty fee from the sale of record albums and tapes is paid by  the record companies to the fund to finance free musical performances at  veterans' hospitals, schools, nursing homes and other facilities.  </P> <P> While record industry officials say about $320 million has been paid into the  performance fund since it was created, federation officials say it has received  less and less industry support in recent years. In 1989, for example, royalty  fees paid to the fund totaled $8.3 million, compared to $10 million in 1987.  </P> <P> Norman Samnick, a New York lawyer who is the record industry's chief  negotiator, argued that "the (trust) fund has gone beyond its time. We want to  eliminate the trust fund and cut the" special payment fund.  </P> <P> Samnick also said that the $6.2-billion-a-year record industry has grown large  enough that it should be able to provide work for displaced musicians, many of  whom drew their salaries from performing on live radio shows. These displaced  musicians have already been compensated through the performance trust fund, he  claimed.  </P> <P> "It's like when the plumber comes and fixes the bathroom," Samnick said of the  recording industry's position, "you don't (then have to) pay every time you  flush the toilet."  </P> <P> Three years ago, former federation President Victor W. Fuentealba was defeated  in a reelection bid, in part for his failure to press the trust fund issue. And  this year, for the first time, the union has launched a high-profile campaign  to win public support for continued funding of the free concerts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, several record industry officials -- who said they are worried about  the threat of a walkout -- are trying to speed work on some forthcoming albums  to avoid being hurt by any possible strike.  </P> <P> A CBS Records official, who declined to be identified, said a musicians strike  could have as much impact on the record industry as the writers strike had when  it disrupted TV production, forcing network television executives to scramble  for replacement programming two years ago.  </P> <P> "Sure, the industry is worried about it," the official said. "You can't make  money off of reissues (of albums) forever," the official added.  </P> <P> MUTE CONCERN  </P> <P> Labor Columnist Harry Bernstein says the recording industry is being  shortsighted in its attempt to end funding for free live musical concerts.

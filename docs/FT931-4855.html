			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Greggs improves to Pounds 6.97m GREGGS, the bread, confect-ionery and savoury products group, reported a 15 per cent rise, from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 6.97m, in pre-tax profits for the year to December 26. The result, taking in a Pounds 134,000 loss on a property disposal, was achieved on turnover up 6 per cent to Pounds 101m, against Pounds 95.5m. Describing 1992 as a 'much better year', Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said stable ingredient prices, improved efficiency and cost control had more than offset the effects of recession, increased competition and further escalation in rents. The company was trading from 487 outlets at the year end, a net increase of 13. Net cash stood at Pounds 6.7m, up Pounds 1.7m. Earnings per share rose to 40.6p (36.8p). The proposed final dividend is 10p, making a total of 15p (14.125p).</p>

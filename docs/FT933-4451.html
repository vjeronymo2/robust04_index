			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / EC offers Pounds 385m aid to West Bank THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday injected fresh momentum into the Middle East peace process by announcing plans for a Ecu500m (Pounds 385m) five-year aid package for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The funds are intended to encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to capitalise on the historic breakthrough on self-rule in the occupied territories and reach a full settlement. In a linked move, Mr Hans van den Broek, the EC commissioner responsible for external political affairs, appealed to Syria and Lebanon to end their boycott of the multilateral talks on regional co-operation in order to complete the process of reconciliation between the Arabs and Israel. The Commission aid package, which must be approved by the 12 EC member states, is part of a three-pronged Middle East policy. This includes forthcoming negotiations on a new partnership agreement between the Community and Israel; aid to the occupied territories; and a concerted effort to use EC money and expertise to promote closer regional co-operation. A senior Brussels official said a draft EC negotiating mandate would propose offering Israel an updated 1975 trade agreement and closer political ties. 'Put crudely, they will receive a little more than the Maghreb but less than Poland,' he said. The EC initiative comes amid accelerating international moves to channel hundreds of millions of dollars to the Middle East, intended to cement regional peace efforts. Officials from Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Gulf states are to meet at the World Bank on September 20 to discuss new infrastructure including roads, communications and water. Mr Manuel Marin, the Spanish commissioner responsible for EC development policy, said the EC funds for the occupied territories would be split equally between EC grants and EC loans from the European Investment Bank. The grants would cover education, food aid, and health projects; while the EIB loans would be used to attract private capital into much-needed infrastructure. 'The only way for lasting stability is greater regional co-operation,' he said. The EC is already the chief supplier of aid to the Palestinians, raising its contribution from Ecu60m to Ecu90m this year. The latest aid package will be drawn from existing funds and will require cuts in other unspecified areas. Resignation hits Rabin; PLO may target expatriate funds, Page 6</p>

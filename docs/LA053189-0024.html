			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV/VIDEO  </P> <P> Actress Kelly McGillis is working hard to increase awareness on the subject of  rape. McGillis, a rape victim herself, recently hosted "Against Her Will," a  documentary on the Lifetime cable network about rape on college campuses. "The  fact that so many men (1-in-13) admitted to forcing women into sex was amazing  to me," she says. "I thought it was incredibly high. The number of women who  had been forced into sex and didn't know it (73%) at the time was amazing too."  McGillis also recently worked with a Santa Monica rape crisis center to make a  video that will be distributed on college campuses, and she and her husband are  working on another video for victims of violent crimes.

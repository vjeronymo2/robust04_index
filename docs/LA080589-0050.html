			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIA OFFERS PULLOUT SCHEDULE TO SRI LANKA  </P> <P> India on Friday offered to withdraw 1,500 troops a week if the largest Tamil  guerrilla group observes a cease-fire, government sources here said.  </P> <P> About 45,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to enforce a July, 1987, peace  accord aimed at ending ethnic strife in the Indian Ocean republic, where the  government is dominated by the Sinhalese majority.  </P> <P> Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry sources said the Indian offer came Friday before  the two sides ended a weeklong talk in New Delhi aimed at finding ways to make  India withdraw its troops. Indian government officials in New Delhi were not  available for comment on the proposal. India has said that a hasty withdrawal  could cause even more bloodshed.  </P> <P> At the same time, Sri Lankan police said a strike called Friday by Sinhalese  radicals to protest 150 deaths during protests last week disrupted normal life  in the island nation but reported no incidents of violence.  </P></p>

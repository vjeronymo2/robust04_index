			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Missiles fired at Aden Northern Yemeni forces fired at least two missiles at Aden early today, as they tightened their grip around the southern rebel stronghold, Reuter reports. Aden officials said one missile landed within the military airport complex but missed the runway. Soldiers said a second missile landed in the sea. A new northern troop offensive against Aden came as UN Security Council members held consultations in New York on a request for a meeting on the conflict. Five Gulf states and Egypt pressed for a UN session. Southern Yemen officials have been hoping the Security Council will stop the month-long civil war.</p>

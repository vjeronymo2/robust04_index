			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / All party leaders find some cause for comfort All the main party leaders in Germany appeared to be celebrating last night, although really only the former east German communists had good reason to do so. Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared beaming with self-confidence in front of his Christian Democratic Union party workers, declaring his wafer-thin majority, and the party's worst vote since 1949, a victory. The CDU and its Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union, remains the biggest single group in the Bundestag, but government will be difficult. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic party (SPD) leader, has failed to dislodge Mr Kohl from his office. But he was able to cheer a 3 percentage-point improvement in the party's score, to around 37 per cent of the vote. He denounced the Kohl coalition as 'a coalition of losers', although he had failed to win. As for Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and leader of the Free Democratic party (FDP), anyone might have thought he had won, as he burst, confetti-covered, into his party headquarters. 'We have made it, and I am happy,' he said. 'It was incredibly difficult to get there.' What he meant was, getting back into the Bundestag at all. For the FDP had lost ground from 11 per cent of the vote last time to around 7 per cent yesterday, seeing its representation slump by 30 seats to under 50 in the 656-member parliament. In the other three state elections yesterday - in the Saarland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Thuringia - the FDP failed to cross the 5 per cent hurdle needed to get into the state parliaments. But it managed it in the federal parliament, which means that Mr Kohl's coalition can just survive. The man who really had cause to celebrate, however, was Mr Gregor Gysi, the parliamentary leader of the PDS, the Party of Democratic Socialism, based on the old communist party of East Germany. For according to mid-evening predictions, he and his colleagues were set to win four seats in east Berlin outright on the first vote, giving the party the right to full parliamentary representation of around 27 seats. 'It would have been good if we could have forced a change of government,' he said. 'But for the PDS, this was an historic achievement, because we did it against the opposition of all the other parties.' The PDS is also left holding the balance of power in both the east German states which voted last night. According to the latest projections, the party polled 23.2 per cent in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, against 38.9 per cent for the CDU and 27.8 per cent for the SPD. That means that the two big parties will have to form a coalition, unless the SPD does a deal - against everything the party leadership has promised - with the PDS. In Thuringia, the PDS was forecast at 17.5 per cent, against 43.2 per cent for the CDU and SPD 28.9 per cent. Neither the FDP nor the Greens managed to gain 5 per cent, leaving the PDS again controlling the balance of power. The one party which suffered a complete defeat was the far-right Republicans, who looked unlikely to gain even 2 per cent of the vote, leading most political commentators to predict a total eclipse of the coming years. The support of the PDS remains overwhelmingly in east Germany, where the party was forecast last night to win some 19.2 per cent of the vote, against just 0.9 per cent in west Germany. The largest party in the east remains Mr Kohl's CDU, with a predicted 39.7 per cent, while the SPD was expected to win 31.5 per cent. In the Saarland, the third state to vote yesterday, Mr Oskar Lafontaine of the SPD narrowly retained his overall majority but saw a drop to around 50.1 per cent of the vote, compared with over 54 per cent four years ago. Yet again, the FDP failed to get into the state parliament, although the Greens were on the verge of doing so, with 4.9 per cent.</p>

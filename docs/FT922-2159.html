			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (19): Transatlantic link offers big benefits - Video-conference network saves hundreds of man-hours for Citibank CITIBANK'S European headquarters in London is to upgrade its international video-conferencing facilities to provide pictures to near-broadcasting quality. Video links have now been established with the bank's offices in New York and on the west coast of the US, as well as the Middle and Far East. Frequently, as many as 12 Citibank staff in London take part in transatlantic face-to-face video-conferences, with a similar number taking part in New York. The bank saves an estimated 200 man-hours of travel time by a single meeting of this kind. Citibank, a subsidiary of Citicorp, one of the world's largest financial institutions with assets of Dollars 230bn, has representation in 100 countries with 800 branches in Europe, alone. Prior to the setting up of the video-conferencing network early last year, senior officials at Citibank's London headquarters found it very difficult to find time for essential meetings with colleagues in the bank's head office in New York. Howard Mills, head of graphics and audio-visual support services and George Blake, voice and communications manager, were made jointly responsible for setting up the video-conferencing facility when the decision to install the system was made during the Gulf War crisis. A video-conferencing network was already operated by Citicorp in the US, but the threat of terrorist activity during the Gulf crisis meant that Citicorp executives - like those of many other US corporations - were grounded. Mills and Clarke were given the task of setting up the video operation in London as quickly as possible; the contract for the work was given to Internet Technology of Bristol. Internet also supplies video-conferencing solutions throughout Canada, via its subsidiary, Internet Technologie, based in Montreal. The company is also UK distributor for Compression Labs, a leading supplier of video codecs, the devices used to compress and digitize video and audio signals for transmission over standard digital telecommunication circuits - a technique that dramatically reduces transmission costs. The new network won immediate acceptance by London executives and has since proved 'a very viable alternative to expensive and time-consuming transatlantic travel,' say users. Citicorp's chairman in New York has used the link to address groups in London. And recently a cable run from the studio to a video projector in the Strand office's restaurant enabled a gathering of 150 Citibank staff in London to exchange views with the head of the corporation. The London studio can set up a video link with only about an hour's notice. The facility, which is used for about 70 hours a month, will probably attract even more users after the upgrading project is completed.</p>

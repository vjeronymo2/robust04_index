According to some representatives of the Komarno meeting of  ethnic Hungarians, the police carried out inspections on the  roads to Komarno before the meeting, which prevented several  participants from attending. Hungarian deputies to the Slovak  Parliament said they would make an interpellation with the  interior minister.    The inspections were made as part of a Slovakia-wide road  check on Friday and Saturday [7 and 8 January], the spokeswoman  said.    Three buses heading for Komarno were intercepted on  Saturday,  she said. Two of them did not have a document confirming  payment of the road tax, while the third driver had alcohol in  his bloodstream, she added.</p>

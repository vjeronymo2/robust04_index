			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Arts: Australian Ballet The Australian Ballet has come a long way in 30 years. The tour which now brings the troupe to the Coliseum is more than mere celebration: it speaks of a confidence in the company's identity which is well founded, and it is an assertion of the progress the ensemble has made during the decade of Maina Gielgud's directorate. The decision to open the season on Tuesday night with Coppelia was wise. The production is intelligent, fresh, respectful enough of tradition not to offend against the work's own history, and it provides a flattering setting for the company's style and its artists. The classic dance is a discipline, not a strait-jacket, and as we see it with the Australian Ballet, it has a vitality quite as impressive as the academic rectitude of the dancers' manner. The performers look assured, alert to the possibilities of movement, and they bring an enthusiasm, a full tone to step and drama, that is entirely right in this dear ballet. They are, and this seems to me most significant, a coherent ensemble, whose dancing is strong, and identifiably Australian in its brightness of purpose. This Coppelia was set by Dame Peggy van Praagh, founder of the company. With great good sense, she entrusted the production to a theatre director, George Ogilvie, who shaped the action, integrated character and movement, without destroying the identity of the traditional text. There results a dramatic logic - 'In Coppelia?', marvels the balletomane - that touches each character, each scene. Narrative winds skilfully through general dances; bravura moments spring easily from mimetic action; there is even, in the second act in Coppelius' house, a frisson of Hoffmannesque mystery. The greatest compliment that can be paid to this staging is to say that it does not minimise the beauty and emotional felicity of Delibes' miraculous score - which, with a couple of additions from Sylvia and La Source, sounded well under Ormsby Wilkins' baton. Design by Kristian Frederikson - attractively traditional, and with enchanting costumes - sets the scene in the Galicia of nineteenth century operetta, and is very fetching. Coppelia is a ballet crammed with good things, more vivid and more beguiling than managements often seem to believe. Its story is serious in requiring young love to prove itself against the lure of alchemy. Its choreography - in spanking national ensembles and in classical numbers - demands wit, prowess, an unfailing sense of style. These challenges the Australian Ballet handsomely meets. Miranda Coney sparkled as Swanilda, and pouted, and dealt joyously with virtuoso demands. David McAllister was her Frantz, playing and dancing with an eager verve. Colin Peasley was a Coppelius entirely serious, and in the role's darkest moment at the end of Act 2 - the old alchemist surrounded by his gesticulating dolls, clutching the inanimate Coppelia - a figure of tragedy. These are admirable performances, and they are framed by a company having the right dash for the czardas and mazurka, and a disciplined and well-mannered style for the classic ensembles (in which the men also get a chance to shine). In this happy masterpiece, the Australian Ballet made a happy - and impressive - start to the season. The Australian Ballet season continues at the London Coliseum (071) 836 3161, with varied programming, until July 18. Tour sponsors include Qantas and the Australian National Line</p>

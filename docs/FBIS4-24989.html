The campaign for "summer  harvest, summer sowing, and summer field management [three  summers]" is making its progress from south China to north China.    The year 1994 is crucial for China to establish a socialist  market economic system. The success or failure of agricultural  work and whether or not a bumper harvest is reaped will  determine, to a great extent, the speed of development for the  entire national economy. The Agricultural Department  specifically pointed out: The general objective for this year's  efforts is to increase peasants' income and to ensure the supply  of essential agricultural products. It has important  significance for arousing the enthusiasm of peasants for  production and for promoting the development of a market economy.    In light of China's farming situation, we should focus the  entire year's agricultural work on "three summers." If we want  to reap bumper harvests the entire year, first we must strive to  succeed in doing "three summers" work. Tens of thousands of  peasants have rushed to the forefront of "three summers" and the  party and government departments in all areas have assigned a  large number of cadres and technicians to draw up specific plans  and to guide summer harvest, summer sowing, and summer field  management. Materials, transportation, grain, and banking  sectors have already allocated various materials, funds, farm  machinery, and vehicles necessary for "three summers" to their  proper users. The broad masses of peasants are getting ready to  give full play to their abilities on the "three summers"  battlefield.    Thanks to the importance attached by the party Central  Committee and the State Council stabilizing the agricultural  sector and to vigorously promoting agricultural production,  coupled with the propitious weather this spring, crops are  growing satisfactorily. To really obtain summer grain, all major  grain producing areas should use all the manpower, material  resources, machinery, and facilities at their disposal to  harvest any plot of farmland with ripe grains, thresh grains  immediately after they are harvested, and store every harvested  grain in warehouses. Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and other major  grain producing provinces already joined the forces of large  combine harvesters to harvest wheat from provinces in south  China to those in north China according to the time when wheat  becomes ripe in each province. The interprovincial operation  expedited the harvest's progress and improved the utilization  ratio of large farm machinery. Owners of wheat farmland were  satisfied and harvester operators were pleased. It was as good  as a kind of creation by peasants under the new situation of a  market economy; and it expedited, to a greater extent, the  process of agricultural modernization.    Summer grain will be harvested soon. Grain procurement  departments should prepare adequate grain-storing facilities and  procurement funds, and should create every favorable condition  whereby they can immediately buy up the grain once it is  delivered. They should pay cash to peasants for the grain  delivered. According to the requirements of the party Central  Committee and the State Council, grain procurement departments  are prohibited from issueing IOU's, refusing to buy available  grain, and retaining payments for peasants' grain under various  pretexts. Protecting peasants' enthusiasm in producing grain is  a major principle that overrides all other minor principles.    China's autumn grain production is a major event. Pursuing  the principle of enhancing productivity, efficiency, and  quality, various localities should pay attention to weather  conditions and make use of favorable geographical positions.  Once a piece of farmland has been harvested, we should promptly  sow seeds on it. If the topsoil is moist, we will use it  immediately; otherwise, we will wet the topsoil before using it.  We should create all favorable conditions so as to adequately  and properly plant autumn grain. We should take realistic and  effective measures to resolutely reverse the decrease in the  acreage of farmland so as to maintain a steady rise in grain  production. Such moves are not only prerequisites to ensure an  effective supply of grain, but are also requirements to  stabilize the agricultural sector as the foundation of the  national economy.    Proper summer field management will ensure a bumper harvest  for the entire year. As the saying goes: "Planting tasks will  contribute to 30 percent of the outcome, whereas management will  make the other 70-percent contribution." Planting is the  foundation and management is the key. Mismanagement in  flood-prevention, drought-resistance, weeding, pest-termination,  or fertilizer application will adversely affect the entire  year's harvest. Raising investment to enhance scientific and  technological progress is an important link in summer field  management. According to predictions, various pests will still  be serious in certain localities in 1994. Bollworms, in  particular, caused a massive reduction in cotton output in some  major cotton-producing regions in 1993. Various  cotton-producing regions should mobilize corresponding  scientific and technological personnel to strictly terminate  bollworms. Various scientific and technological departments in  the agricultural sector should earnestly apply scientific and  technological achievements in the field and integrate summer  field management as a part of the comprehensive scientific and  technological services, which include checking the conditions of  seedlings, preserving the water content and fertility of the  soil, preventing pests, and enhancing the plants' growth.    Now that the "three summers" tasks are being carried out, we  can expect a bumper harvest of summer grain soon. So long as  the leadership and the rank and file make concerted efforts in  unison, let the market economic mechanisms play their full  levering-roles in the economy, and victoriously complete the  "three summers" tasks, we can lay a firm foundation for a bumper  harvest in the agricultural sector for the entire year.</p>

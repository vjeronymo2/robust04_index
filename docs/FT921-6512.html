			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Appointments: Mining potential at Telecom Eireann Brendan Hynes, executive chairman of Glencar Explorations, the Dublin-listed mining company, has taken up his assignment as the new chairman of the state-owned Irish telephone company, Telecom Eireann. He replaces Michael Smurfit, flamboyant businessman and prominent one-time Charles Haughey crony, who became embroiled in the wave of scandals that contributed to the toppling of the Irish premier. Smurfit resigned last September from the chairmanship of Telecom after controversy surrounding his interests in a property deal for the com-pany's new headquarters the previous year. Hynes says the new job is 'part-time', thus enabling him to continue at Glencar. While he emphasises that Smurfit bequeathed him a well-run organisation, he forecasts that he will not be idle in coming months - he will be tackling a number of areas, notably the current cost structure. 'A lot is going to happen in the next 12 months - and I'm not talking about privatisation,' he asserts. In recent years Telecom has conducted an IPounds 2bn modern-isation of 'an extremely antiquated system' and Hynes therefore considers the company particularly well-placed to capitalise on eastern European developments. It already has a contract advising Hungary's tecommunications company, a project that may lead to equity investment, and Hynes says he also has his eye on Poland and Czechoslovakia. Although Hynes has spent much of his career in spec-ialised mining and exploration companies, including as chief executive of Tara Mines before moving to Glencar three years ago, he was until 1974 personal assistant to Peter Grace, chairman and chief executive of the US multinational W R Grace.</p>

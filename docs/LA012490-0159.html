			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KATHLEEN TURNER RETURNS AS 'MAGGIE' IN 'HOT TIN ROOF'  </P> <P> Actress Kathleen Turner said Tuesday she's thrilled to be back on stage,  particularly in a role she's yearned to play for years.  </P> <P> Turner is starring as Maggie in Tennessee Williams' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."  </P> <P> The Pulitzer Prize-winning drama began a two-week run Tuesday at Pittsburgh's  Benedum Center. After that, it goes to Boston, Philadelphia and then Broadway.  </P> <P> "The challenge is in the material, not in doing stage . . . versus film per  se," Turner said at a news conference. Turner said she always had intended to  portray Williams' Maggie, a beautiful Southern woman who pines for a husband  who shuns her.  </P> <P> "It's quite delightful to play her. It's so alive to me to always be thinking.  She changes so fast and thinks so fast. I like the level of aliveness."  </P> <P> Appearing with Turner in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" are Charles Durning, Polly  Holliday and Daniel Hugh Kelly.  </P> <P> The current production, which is Williams' original version, is quite unlike  the altered 1955-56 Broadway production starring Barbara Bel Geddes, Ben  Gazzara and Burl Ives. It's also nothing like the 1958 film with Elizabeth  Taylor, Paul Newman and Ives.  </P> <P> Turner said she purposely avoided seeing the earlier productions, except for  the 1958 film.  </P> <P> "I make a point of trying not to see roles that I will probably do because I  don't want any other images in my mind. I want to create it fresh," she said.  </P> <P> Turner, 35, a native of Missouri, started in theater but it was movies that  made her a star. She's appeared in more than a dozen films, including "Body  Heat," "Romancing the Stone," "Prizzi's Honor," "Peggy Sue Got Married" and  "The Accidental Tourist."  </P></p>

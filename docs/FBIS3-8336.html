			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W. and PAD: "Strike Action of Solidarity; </F> From Slupsk to Mines"]    [Text] The strike at two plants in the Slupsk Region of  Solidarity started a protest action of the trade union. Monday  [7 March] was "the first day of large-scale money collection" in  regions for the strike fund. On each day now, there are  supposed to be increasingly more serious strikes. Between 0900  and 1100 today, steel workers in 74 plants, primarily in  Silesia, will go on strike. Beginning Wednesday, "the  significant regions"--for example, the plants in the Lodz  Region--will strike for two hours. At that time, in Lodz, the  National Committee [KK] of Solidarity will debate the current  situation and further steps concerning the action. On Thursday,  pit-coal mines will strike for two hours and block coal  shipments for the entire day.  <H5>  Strike for Minimum Wage </H5>   According to Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the Solidarity  KK,  each member of the union will pay on average between 50,000 and  100,000 zlotys [Z] to the strike fund; the size of the  remuneration for the participation in the strike has been  initially set at approximately Z75,000 per day (minimum day's  earning). However, everything will depend on the state of the  account.    On 7 March in Bialystok, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz  Cimoszewicz said that the Solidarity strikes are political and  "disrespecting to the law." "No government established as a  result of truly democratic elections can accept such a dictate,"  said Cimoszewicz, suggesting that Solidarity should ask itself a  question concerning responsibility to the state.  <H5>  Stoppages and Flags </H5>   According to "Solidarity," 95 percent of the work force of  the Wood Industry Plants in Slawno and the Heat Energy  Enterprise participated in the four-hour strike. In the latter  action, the water temperature was lowered by 10 degrees Celsius.  If the weather had been frosty, the strike would have been felt  by town inhabitants. Head of the region, Edward Muller, said  that next time "people will get 100 percent of the heat,  industry--zero."    In Elblag Voivodship, in Pieniezno, the supply of heat was  completely cut off. A warning strike was also organized on 7  March in the Agricultural Machines Factory in Czarna Bialostocka.    The strike alert has been announced in the Lomza and Suwalki  Voivodships, where there will probably be no great strikes. The  following regions are getting ready for active participation in  the action: Bydgoszcz, Torun, and the region of Kujawy and  Ziemia Dobrzynska (Wloclawek), which on 7 March announced a  passive strike. The Swietokrzyski Region has announced a higher  state of strike readiness.    In Malopolska, strike readiness has already been reported by  approximately 70 enterprises, including the metal branch and the  Polish State Railroads. The first strike will probably be held  there in the middle of this week.    Also 12 enterprises of the Bialystok Voivodship and several  of the biggest plants in the Bielsko Biala voivodships have  announced their readiness for an active strike. In the Mazowsze  Region, referendums among work forces are still under way.  <H5>  Steel Workers and Miners </H5>   On 8 March, 74 plants of the National Steel Works' Section  of  Solidarity, including the Tadeusz Sedzimir Steel Works in  Krakow, will go on strike. A several-hour-long progressive  strike will be organized in several plants in Koszalin. Lodz  will be on strike on 9 March, and the Silesian branch of  Solidarity will continue its progressive strike. On 10 March,  there will be a two-hour warning strike in all pit-coal mines;  miners will block the shipment of coal for 24 hours. Miners'  Solidarity Spokesman Adam Jawor did not rule out the possibility  that in some mines the strike may last eight hours. On 10  March, a one-hour warning strike is supposed to be staged in  Gdansk.    On 7 March, Solidarity Head Marian Krzaklewski requested  that  the industry minister present him with data on the average  demand for electricity in the morning and evening rush hours  from the energy grid. This has to do with the possibility of a  strike in the fuel-energy sector: "The data are indispensable  for coordinating the supply of as much fuel as is needed by the  system to ensure electricity production exclusively for  individual customers," wrote the head of Solidarity.</p>

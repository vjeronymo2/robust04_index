			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH STREAK ITS 3, NEW MEXICO STATE'S 22  </P> <P> It took a while for George Allen to believe that Cal State Long Beach's 31-27  victory over New Mexico State before 3,926 in Veterans Stadium Saturday had  given the 49ers a three-game winning streak.  </P> <P> "Three in a row, holy Moses," he finally said. "I feel drained because I know  we could have lost it."  </P> <P> Long Beach, which had not won three consecutive games since 1985, improved to  3-3 overall and 2-1 in the Big West Conference in Allen's first season.  </P> <P> "These guys are playing so hard and they beat a team that is tough to play  because they have been losing," Allen said. "It makes you think you're not  playing a good team."  </P> <P> New Mexico State made a late bid to end the longest current losing streak in  Division I when it scored on a nine-yard pass from David Chisum to Richard  Sanchez with 1:24 to play. But an onside kick attempt failed, sending the  Aggies (0-5, 0-2) to their 22nd consecutive defeat.  </P> <P> The 49ers, who have depended mostly on passing, finally showed a balanced  attack with 216 yards rushing and 212 through the air.  </P> <P> Four Long Beach runners gained more than 40 yards, led by Freddie Leslie, who  had 74. Quarterback Todd Studer completed only 13 of 30 passes, but two went  for touchdowns.  </P> <P> "We made big plays on offense and defense when we had to have them," said  Allen.  </P> <P> One of the biggest came with 10 minutes left and the 49er lead down to 24-21.  On fourth and one on the Aggie 24, Leslie ran to the six. Three plays later,  Rickey Clark scored on a one-yard dive.  </P> <P> The Aggies took their only lead, 7-0, on an 11-yard pass from Chisum to Alvin  Warren. Long Beach tied the score on a two-yard run by Herman Nash and took a  14-7 lead on a 27-yard pass from Studer to Jeff Exum. The 49ers led, 17-14, at  the half.  </P> <P> An 18-yard TD pass from Studer to Sean Foster extended the lead to 24-14. But  then Jimmie Mitchell, who gained 120 yards, scored on a three-yard run that was  set up when Chisum, who was sacked seven times, hit Warren on a 46- yard pass  play.  </P> <P> "This is a great tribute to our players," Allen said of the winning streak. "A  lesser team would have said the season's over."  </P></p>

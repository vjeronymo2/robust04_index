			<p>BFN     [Text] The capital of Cuanza Norte Province has been  liberated. The Republic of Angola's flag was once again raised  in N'Dalatando today. Izidro Sanhanga reports:    I have striven to get the confirmation. After all, it is  true. N'Dalatando has been liberated and that is why the people  sing. [crowd sings Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola  slogans and informal musicians play peace song] The people sing  peace and freedom. It looks as if freedom reins. Actually the  Republic of Angola's flag has been raised once again.    This is now a free land where state administration has been  reinstated. There is a great deal more to report about these  long months of UNITA's [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] military occupation. Cameraman  Boaventura Canjanja has shot whatever he could. So, Cuanza  Norte will be in focus in the next news bulletins.</p>

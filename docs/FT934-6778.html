			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: UK growth gives lift to Kenwood Growth in UK sales helped Kenwood Appliances, the household appliance manufacturer, lift interim pre-tax profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 5.35m. The figure for the six months ended September 1993 compared with a pro forma Pounds 5.03m. The Hampshire-based group was floated in June last year. Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said the group had produced 'a solid set of results.' UK turnover had improved by 12 per cent as consumer spending recovered after a flat two years. Exports had also advanced strongly, with both the Kenwood Chef and food processors performing well. Overall turnover rose by 21 per cent, from Pounds 45.3m to Pounds 55m. Operating profits rose from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 6.08m. The latest pre-tax figure included Pounds 400,000 of exceptional items, reflecting changes in the group's distribution systems in the US and Germany. The group's products will be distributed in the US by the Rival Manufacturing Company from January 1, while a sales operation is being set up in Germany. Mr Parker said this reflected the board's decision to concentrate the international sales effort on Europe and the Far East. He described the Far East as offering the most exciting opportunities. Last year Kenwood paid HKDollars 36.5m (Pounds 3.2m) for Tricom, a supplier of small kitchen appliances with a factory in China's Guangdon province. Last month it paid Pounds 4.33m for Precision Engineering (Reading), which includes Waymaster, a maker of water filters and kitchen scales. Mr Parker said the group was on the look-out for further acquisitions along similar lines. Interest payable of Pounds 332,000 compared with a pro forma Pounds 232,000. Earnings per share rose from 9.2p to 9.6p. The interim dividend of 3p compares with 1.5p paid last time for the part of the period when the company was listed.</p>

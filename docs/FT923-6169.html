			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Courting the agents of change Is environmental improvement really worth the effort for business? Frequently not. It is expensive, tiresome and does little in the way of immediate returns. Yet given that environmental improvement is a fact of life - even a condition of business - most companies will have to come to terms with it in the end. The challenge is in finding the commercially most suitable way forward. A management report* from the Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology (Cest), the government and industry-funded research group, looks at these questions in a constructive light. It addresses many of the problems which inhibit businesses when it comes to dealing with environmental matters. Cest's experience has shown that environmental opportunities are usually not obvious to those who might gain. The reasons are: A wider range of stakeholders need to be involved in exploiting the opportunity than most companies are used to: for example, public interest groups. The payback often comes in the medium term, and commitment cannot be justified solely against short-term objectives. Companies have to interact with different constituencies in order to generate the necessary understanding and influence. Cest's answer is that businesses should look for opportunities in the growth of environmental concerns, and should reduce their own uncertainties by getting to know - and trying to influence - agents of change. Companies must also appreciate the growing role that new technologies will play, and learn to understand that there are social values and processes at work, which they will have to take into account. As purchasers of materials, disposers of waste and manufacturers of products with potential environmental liabilities, they must build systematic relationships with other companies. *Environmental Opportunities: Creating Benefit out of Uncertainty.

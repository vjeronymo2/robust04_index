			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV SHINES KLIEG LIGHTS ON CAST FROM KREMLIN;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: LEADERS FACE CITIZENS' TOUGH QUESTIONS. THE GOAL IS TO FORCE  ALOOF FIGURES TO BE RESPONSIVE.  </P> <P> "Politburo: The TV Show" made its debut on state-run television Monday night  with a high-powered cast and almost everything else a civic-minded Soviet  viewer could want.  </P> <P> It had Phil Donahue-like suspense as the Communist Party's new No. 2 official,  put under the klieg lights before a nationwide audience, was asked point-blank  whether he is a relative of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa. (He  said he isn't.)  </P> <P> There was emotion, as the highest-ranking woman in the Communist Party  expressed compassion for mothers whose sons have been sent to the Caucasus  region to quell ethnic violence there.  </P> <P> Even a hint of soap opera-type scandal intruded, as the Kremlin high and mighty  talked about whether they and their children get special privileges not  available to the masses. (They said they don't.)  </P> <P> For the Communist Party, which has taken its share of hits from the new  openness in mass media, the premiere of what was officially called "Political  Dialogue: Who's Who" was a 90-minute televised opportunity to show citizens  from Siberia to Smolensk that the new breed of party official does care.  </P> <P> Four members of the Politburo and Secretariat elected at this month's party  congress sat behind a horseshoe-shaped table to answer questions from viewers  relayed by moderator Igor S. Fesunenko, and they seized the occasion to do some  image shaping.  </P> <P> "We've all come up though the work collectives; we understand life," said  Valentin A. Kuptsov, party secretary now in charge of forging links with other  emerging, potentially rival political parties. Communist officials, he was  saying, are not bureaucrats and know firsthand what it's like to work with  their hands.  </P> <P> The "Who's Who" show, slated to be the first in an occasional series, opened up  the once-remote and untouchable Kremlin figures to questions from their  countrymen that could be very tough and that bared the deep suspicions about  the leadership that some harbor here.  </P> <P> It was another step in Gorbachev's effort to force Soviet officialdom to be  responsive, but it also gave the 18-million-member party a chance to shore up  its standing at a time when it is losing members and even party polls show its  influence is waning -- and when it is being forced to compete for votes.  </P> <P> One Moscow TV watcher specifically wanted to know whether Vladimir A. Ivashko,  the party's new second-in-command, had gotten where he is because of nepotism  -- more precisely, because of purported blood ties to Raisa Gorbachev, who like  him spent her childhood in the Ukraine.  </P> <P> "I don't turn my back on any of my relatives," the 58-year-old Ivashko quipped,  smiling gamely at a question few would have dared ask a few years ago and that  in any case would never have been heard on TV.  </P> <P> He went on to say that he has no relatives in Moscow, including Mikhail and  Raisa Gorbachev.  </P> <P> If a star emerged from the premiere of "Who's Who," it was new Politburo member  Galina V. Semyonova, the only woman in the top party institutions. For the past  nine years, the journalist from Smolensk has been editor in chief of the  magazine Krestyanka (Peasant Woman) and clearly prefers plain talk.  </P> <P> "No slogans and empty promises," she vowed to viewers.  </P> <P> In charge of a new party portfolio on women's affairs, Semyonova, 53, promised  that she will regularly receive callers in her office and that such "reception  days" will be announced beforehand in the press.  </P> <P> That, too, will be a great contrast to the typical remoteness of party leaders.  </P> <P> As "Who's Who" wore on, scraps of paper piled up on the table in front of  Semyonova recounting sad stories telephoned in by Soviet women: mothers whose  sons serve in army or police units in violence-torn Azerbaijan and Armenia,  women whose children are invalids, a 73-year-old who never leaves her  apartment.  </P> <P> "All I can do is express my sympathy," the silver-haired Semyonova said at one  point.  </P> <P> Though "Who's Who" premiered one week after Gorbachev signed a presidential  decree freeing state-run television and broadcasting from the party's control,  the first guest list was a reminder that the powers that be haven't changed, as  least for now.  </P> <P> Ivashko, Kuptsov, Semyonova and party ideologue Alexander S. Dzasokhov were  invited -- in lieu of non-Communists -- because the party "is the most  organized, mightiest political force of the country," said Fesunenko, answering  viewers' questions about whether rival parties would also be given air time in  weeks to come.  </P> <P> That is not to say that Fesunenko was in awe of the new party leaders.  Answering a viewer's question about whether his children received some sort of  privileges because of his job, Ivashko said no.  </P> <P> Fesunenko persisted, asking if they didn't have their own Chaika limousines.  </P> <P> No, no Chaikas, Ivashko said.  </P> <P> "It's hard to believe, but that's the way it is," said Fesunenko with a smile.  For at least one viewer, there seemed to be a hint of wry incredulity in the  remark.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the Commission </F> on Citizenship Issues under the President of the Russian  Federation, and Eduard Nekhay, expert with the Citizenship  Issues Department of the Administration of the President of the  Russian Federation, under the rubric "Carte Blanche": "The  Development of Institutions of Citizenship Continues: But Latvia  and Estonia Are Not Fulfilling Undertaken Obligations"]    [Text] In 1991 we witnessed the disintegration of the USSR  and the formation of a number of new independent states, which  became full-fledged members of the world community. Having  proclaimed their sovereignty, they among other things assumed a  heavy burden of responsibility: New independent states  encountered the need to deal with the difficult task of building  their statehood in keeping with the principles of democracy.    The institution of citizenship as one of inalienable  attributes of a state represents a stable legal connection  between the individual and the state, which is expressed in the  totality of their mutual rights and responsibilities and is used  for determining the relationship between a citizen and "his  state," between a citizen and a foreign state, and between a  foreign state and this particular citizen's state.    In essence the institution of citizenship is closely tied to  human rights, and refusing to grant citizenship leads to  negative consequences both in this area and in other, no less  important, ones. First of all, this infringes on such  inalienable rights as the right to vote, the right of free  movement (traveling abroad is impossible without properly  formalized documents, in order to receive which, in turn, it is  necessary to establish that one belongs to a certain state), and  some social rights and freedoms. In addition, a state cannot  extend diplomatic protection to persons who are not its citizens.    Persons without citizenship residing in a state create an  extremely undesirable situation when the question arises as to  which state bears responsibility for such a person traveling  abroad, or to the territory of which state he may return when  necessary. It may also be a potential source of an international  conflict. Forty years ago such arguments brought into existence  the 1954 International Convention on the Status of Stateless  Persons, which defines the basic rights and responsibilities of  persons not considered by a state within its legal framework as  citizens.    International law traditionally applies a norm that  envisages  that every state has the right to decide which persons are and  are not citizens. This norm is codified in a convention produced  as long ago as 1930 in the Hague.    According to Article 1 of this convention, each state, in  accordance with its laws, has the right to determine who may be  a citizen. Regardless of this, however, it should be noted that  the state bears responsibility for not increasing the number of  stateless persons living on its territory. This is confirmed by  Article 4 of the same convention, in which another principle of  international law is enunciated, which limits the sovereignty of  states with respect to the issue of citizenship: "Citizenship  laws are recognized by other states to the extent that they  correspond to international conventions, international customs,  and the commonly accepted principles of law with respect to  citizenship."    Finally, Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights of 1948 sets forth: "Each person has a right to  citizenship. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of citizenship  or the right to change his citizenship."    In the opinion of some scholars and specialists in the area  of citizenship, the provisions of this article may not serve as  a decisive argument in favor of limiting the sovereignty of  states with respect to issues of citizenship, since they do not  mention which state precisely must grant citizenship.  Nevertheless, in most instances it is possible to identify such  states by taking into account the principle of a stable  association between the person and one or another state. This  argument is particularly topical in the case of disintegration  of the USSR and, in particular, as applied to the policy  conducted by Estonia and Latvia with respect to ethnic Russians  living on their territory.    A change in sovereignty of one or another territory as a  rule  affects the citizenship of persons living within its  boundaries--in other words, results in loss of such. This  immediately brings up the issue of acquiring the citizenship of  a state that has been formed in place of the "old one" by the  persons who live in it.    The principle of stable association in this case assumes  that  the state formed on this territory has an obligation, in  accordance with customary international law, to grant  citizenship to all permanent residents of this territory, with  the exception of citizens of third countries.    Nevertheless, the Russian-speaking population living in  Estonia and Latvia has fallen into the category of foreigners  who are de facto persons without citizenship. Part 3 of Article  20 of the Estonian Republic law on foreigners (1993) says  directly: "A foreigner who has resided in Estonia since before 1  July 1990 and continues to live in Estonia, resides in Estonia  on the basis of a permanent residence permit of the former  Estonian SSR until he receives permanent resident status, but  for not more than two years from the moment this law goes into  effect."    Moreover, in 1991 Russia signed agreements "On the  Foundations of Interstate Relations" with Latvia and Estonia, in  which the states take upon themselves the obligation to  guarantee those living on their territory the right to preserve  or obtain citizenship of one of the parties to the agreement in  accordance with the freely expressed will of these persons.    By conducting a policy of discrimination against ethnic  Russians, Estonia and Latvia are thereby grossly violating not  only generally accepted principles of international law and  international agreements, but also the principles codified in  their own constitutions, namely, the primacy of international  law over domestic legislation.    One of the positive examples of a solution to this problem  was the signing on 23 December 1993 of an agreement between  Russia and Turkmenistan, which represents an important step  forward on the road of the development of the institutions of  citizenship in the newly independent states.</p>

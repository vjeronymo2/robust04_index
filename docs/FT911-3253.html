			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / EEF and CBI in talks on merger THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry and the Engineering Employers' Federation are in talks that might end in the two organisations' merging to provide a unified voice for the manufacturing sector. The two bodies said yesterday that they had agreed over the 'absolutely essential' need for manufacturing industry to have a single, powerful representative organisation to promote its interests. The CBI, which was formed in 1965, represents more than 250,000 businesses employing about half the nation's workforce. Members include most of the 100 largest companies, along with 150 trade association and employers' organisations. More than 5,000 businesses are represented by the EEF, the UK's largest single-industry representative organisation. Mr Peter Brighton, EEF director-general, said: 'Britain has a unique public lack of recognition of the importance of engineering and manufacturing industry to the health of the overall economy.' Neither party would predict the outcome of a joint working party of senior officials, which is due to report in the autumn. Mr John Banham, CBI director-general, said that whatever body emerged, it would be within the 'overall umbrella' of his organisation. The move, which will replicate recent initiatives among trade unions to create stronger representative organisations, was originated by the EEF. The federation's role has been diminished since the end, two years ago, of its role in national negotiations on minimum pay and conditions. Mr David Lees, EEF president, said both organisations recognised that neither the CBI nor the EEF in their present forms could resolve the difficulties facing manufacturing industry. The decision to establish a working party was endorsed yesterday by the CBI Council. Sir Brian Corby, CBI president, said a joint organisation would improve the effectiveness with which the interests of manufacturers were represented in Westminster, Whitehall and Brussels.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wiggins Wiggins Group, the property developer, reported reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 84,000, against Pounds 359,000, for the six months to September 30. The period was one of restricted activity, directors said, while negotiations for restructuring were in progress. Accordingly, the loss principally reflected costs of keeping the company operative. The negotiations led to a capital reorganisation, acquisition of development properties and injection of new capital on October 5. Turnover amounted to just Pounds 12,000 (Pounds 1.25m). Losses per share were cut to 0.5p (2.3p).</p>

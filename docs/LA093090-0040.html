			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS AND BRIEFS: KINGDOM OF BHUTAN TO REOPEN SOME SITES  </P> <P> The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which closed all monasteries, temples and  other religious sites to tourists nearly three years ago, will reopen selected  sites beginning Jan. 1, according to officials of the Bhutan Tourism Corp.  </P> <P> The move is one of several recently announced changes in tourism policy that  may result in the remote nation attracting more visitors, which now number  fewer than 1,500 a year.  </P> <P> Other changes include a lowering of tourist rates by 10% to 30%, although fees  during peak season will continue to top $200 a day, including board, meals and  guides.  </P> <P> The tiny Tibetan Buddhist country, which places unusual emphasis on the  preservation of its national heritage and identity, has in the past severely  restricted entry to foreigners and still virtually prohibits individual travel.  </P> <P> Under the new policy, according to Jigme Tshultim, managing director of the  Bhutan Tourism Corp., up to 4,000 visitors a year can be anticipated. The  corporation, previously run by the government, now is privately run, but will  continue to coordinate all tour groups. Three other private tour agencies also  have been established in Thimphu, the Bhutanese capital.  </P> <P> In closing all monasteries, temples and dzongs -- religious and administrative  fortresses -- to foreigners in January, 1988, the government was responding to  pressure from the Central Monk Body, the nation's premier religious  institution. The monk body had been receiving complaints from more remote  villages about tourists taking photographs in temples and handling artifacts,  both of which are still prohibited.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the national airline, Druk Air, has announced that it will increase  its flights to Bangkok to twice a week beginning Oct. 27.

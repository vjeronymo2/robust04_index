			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drives on as Australia rests BUYING by public funds and dealers on the first day of trading for December settlement bolstered activity, and the Nikkei average rose for the sixth consecutive day, its longest winning streak since February last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei advanced 177.03 to 17,479.04. It fell to the day's low of 17,226.98 in the morning on uncertainty over the parliamentary testimony by Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister. However, active buying by public funds in the afternoon prompted trading by dealers and arbitrageurs, and the index rose to the day's high of 17,601.91. Volume rose to 310m shares from 213m. Advances outnumbered declines by 736 to 261, with 146 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 8.92 to 1,303.06 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.42 to 1,049.80. In spite of active trading by domestic investors, traders said foreigners were absent. 'Foreign investors don't know what to do since they think the market's too expensive, but they realise that the officials want to push prices up,' said Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel. Traders were relieved that little fresh news emerged from Mr Takeshita's sworn testimony before parliament concerning alleged gangster links and involvement with the Sagawa Kyubin bribery scandal. But caution prevailed due to an announcement by Nomura Securities that it would repay holders of its asset-backed bonds because it had not explained the full risks of the product. Brokerage issues remained weak. But selling was limited since Nomura said it would not alter its earnings estimates as a result of the sale of assets to offset the Y23bn repayment losses. Nomura fell Y20 to Y1,400 while Yamaichi Securities lost Y5 to Y545. High-technology issues rose on purchases by public funds. Hitachi advanced Y23 to Y726 and NEC gained Y33 to Y683. Shipbuilders were steady, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advancing Y1 to Y535 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y2 to Y376. Banks were mixed as dealers adjusted their positions ahead of earnings announcements due after the market's close. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y20 to Y2,400 but Sumitomo Bank gained Y20 to Y1,770. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 251.93 to 18,733.39 in of 27.8m shares. Pharmaceuticals and electronics rose on short-term buying by dealers. Roundup AUSTRALIA took a breather after its recent rally, and there were more rises than falls elsewhere in the region. NEW ZEALAND carried on where Australia left off. The NZSE-40 index ended 25.57 or 1.7 per cent higher at 1,525.21 for a cumulative gain of 5.4 per cent over the last four days. All of the rise in the index was achieved in the first 15 minutes of trading. Turnover fell from NZDollars 55.7m to NZDollars 41.6m, but Wednesday's total had been boosted by some big block sales. The forestry and resources conglomerate, Fletcher Challenge, rose 11 cents to NZDollars 1.99 for a 25 cent gain over the last four days. Improving sentiment for FLC was based partly on a better long-term outlook for its key exports. Air New Zealand closed down 6 cents at NZDollars 2.42 on rumours of changes to the board of directors. SINGAPORE was encouraged by the 3.9 per cent growth in US GDP and institutional funds began buying more aggressively. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 17.20 or 1.2 per cent higher at 1,436.99, while volume moved up from 129m to 177m shares. Brokers said there was still retail speculation in Malaysian OTC stocks, and this was helping the volume figure to move up. BANGKOK and SEOUL both staged technical rebounds. The SET index of Thai stocks climbed 10.91 to 858.24 as turnover remained thin at Bt3.7bn, compared with Bt3.4bn on Wednesday. The Korea composite index rose 8.47 to 660.94 in volume up from 34.4m shares to 44.3m. The recovery in Bangkok was led by small- and medium-sized banks, Siam City Bank leading the most active stocks as it rose Bt1 to Bt15. Seoul brokers detected an effort by institutional investors to pull up the market. But securities houses and large manufacturing shares, which have a decisive impact on the index due to their heavy weighting, fell victim to selling late in the session. AUSTRALIA closed weaker for the first time in eight trading days. The All-Ordinaries index closed 8.3 lower at 1,450.9 after a rally which has taken the index up by 6.8 per cent since November 16. Volume was inflated by Westpac to 121.4m shares worth ADollars 256.2m. After the close the media magnate Mr Kerry Packer said he had an 8.27 per cent stake in the bank. MANILA extended its setback to a ninth consecutive trading day with the composite index down 17.49 or 1.4 per cent to 1263.69, down 6.2 per cent since November 13. HONG KONG eased slightly in thin trading, as modest early gains were erased by an afternoon bout of profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 5.36 lower at 5,913.18 following a 54-point loss on Wednesday. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 1.81bn from HKDollars 2.46bn. HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, led the way down with a fall of 50 cents to HKDollars 59. The bank is continuing to suffer from comments by its chairman, Mr William Purves, who said in an interview earlier this week that analysts might have overestimated the group's 1992 earnings. BOMBAY's BSE index dropped 69.45 to 2,487.11 on widespread liquidation on the last day of the account.</p>

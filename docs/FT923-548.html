			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / UAE and Iran in islands talks Negotiators from Iran and the United Arab Emirates opened talks yesterday on a territorial dispute in the Gulf that could plunge the world's main oil region into new crisis, Reuter reports from Abu Dhabi. Gulf diplomats said the Emirates were preparing to insist that Iran should not only rescind measures which it says amount to the annexation of the island of Abu Musa, but should also hand back two other Gulf islands. They said the UAE would demand the return of the Greater and Lesser Tumbs, seized by the former Shah of Iran in 1971. The diplomats said if the talks failed to make headway, the UAE would raise the issue at the UN when its foreign minister addressed the General Assembly on September 30.</p>

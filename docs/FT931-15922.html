			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: A resort much maligned - Arnold Wilson discovers that, in spite of its image, Les Menuires has a lot to offer the serious skier / Skiing LEO LACROIX, ski racer and ski maker extraordinaire, put it in a nutshell: 'When I was racing in America and people asked me where I came from, they said Les Menuires sounded like a huge pile of steaming manure.' Regine Jay-Grillot, the resort's public relations director, who has quite a task on her hands, agrees there is a problem. 'The English have difficulty with the word 'Menuires,'' she says. The French Olympic resort unquestionably has an image problem, even though the locals gallantly refer to it as 'the smile on the face of the three valleys'. 'Hideous assembly of apartment blocks,' (Filofax's Skiing Travel File) and 'one of the ugliest blots on the alpine landscape' (The Good Skiing Guide) are among the least kind descriptions, albeit both written by the same man. If you throw in the unfortunate-sounding name, you start to wonder whether Les Menuires will ever be taken seriously, especially when its neighbours are as chic as Courchevel or as easy-on-the-ear - and eye - as St Martin de Belleville. Well, my daughters, who arrived here for a family holiday with all kinds of misapprehensions and forebodings, say we have got it wrong. I am not going to pretend that since my last visit the least attractive of the Trois Vallees has turned from ugly duckling into white swan. But the valley is, after all, part of the most extensive ski area in the world which encompasses almost limitless permutations of supremely good skiing. Lucy Dicker, of Touralp, who had the daunting task of organising the British University Ski Championships in Les Menuires this month, is often heard to say: 'Les Menuires is quite lovable really.' Well, she would say that. But my daughters agree with her. But with day after day of cloudless blue skies, excellent snow and superb skiing, Les Menuires can seem quite attractive. The new-found friendliness, encouraged during last February's Olympics, still lingers. On my first day I needed to get from the satellite village of Reberty-les Bruyeres to the Menuires nerve centre at Le Croisette to pick up my lift pass. But, without the pass, how could I persuade a surly lift-operator to let me on to the local lift in order to make the journey on skis rather than walking or catching a navette? The first lift operator I approached not only gave me permission to use the chairlift, but also explained that I might have difficulty finding my way because it involved taking two more chairs before I would be high enough to cut across - so why not take the gondola? The prospect of finding two French lift operators prepared to be kind seemed optimistic. But the man checking lift passes at the gondola was equally helpful and off I went. Ten years ago, when I had a similar problem in Tignes during a tour of the Tarentaise, a stubborn, lantern-jawed lift operator refused me one 'free' ride out of the resort after I had inadvertently packed my lift-pass in my onward luggage. I was forced to ski all the way down to the road and hire a taxi in order to catch up with the group. This has changed in France. Val Thorens, the highest ski resort in Europe, and rather a desolate place, is trying to build its way out of its bleak image. Like Flaine and La Plagne, when the resort puts up new chalet blocks, they are built in a much more traditional, attractive alpine style. Val Thorens now has a pretty alpine church in pink and copper. 'We wanted to celebrate our 20th anniversary,' said the resort's Tourist Office director, Francois Gros, a renowned climber and high mountain guide. 'But in France you are not supposed to use public funds to build churches. So we got some private subscriptions and pretended it was going to be a village hall until the last minute - then we put the steeple up. We only finished it on Christmas Eve.' The serious skiers who patronise the swashbuckling slopes of Val Thorens and Les Menuires go there for the skiing rather than the architecture, but a little extra charm has not gone amiss. The huge army of university skiers - 1,500 in all - has certainly enjoyed village life as well as the ski slopes. In spite of Les Menuires' image, the students chose it for the British Universities Ski Championships because 'Val Thorens didn't have enough rooms, Val d'Isere was too expensive and Tignes will not have us back'. The giant slalom and slalom - long, tough, icy courses on man-made snow on the same slopes used in last Febuary's Olympics - were dominated by Scottish Universities, although Southampton snapped their heels. Aberdeen finished third in the men's giant slalom. Michael Folkman from Edinburgh University achieved a remarkable double, winning both the men's events. The Scots - the only British nation with any ski resorts - have long been a threat, so much so that, until this year, the event was called the English and Welsh Universities Ski Championships, excluding Scottish teams. The focal point of the local skiing is the challenging La Masse, where 100 instructors carrying torches spelled out '1993' on the mountainside on New Year's Eve, and Val Thorens' Cime de Caron, where a big cable car whisks skiers up to more than 10,000 feet. When the cable car was first built, the tourist office proudly asked a visiting Australian skiers what they thought of the new toy. 'Well, mate,' came the response, 'it's just another cattle truck.' They were not far wrong. Skiers frequently moo good-naturedly as they herd into the 150-person cable car. At the top a panoramic view extends deep into the distant Italian Alps and features the jagged slopes of La Meije, towering above Les Deux Alpes and La Grave. You can now ski on from the Cime de Caron down into the beautiful and desolate Maurienne Valley. An excellent alternative route runs via the summer skiing area near the Pointe de Thorens, where a dramatic, but not dangerous, traverse-cum-trudge of 20 minutes or so brings you close to the Col de Pierre Lory. From there a beautiful, sweeping and not too steep off-piste descent is perfect for carving out giant slalom turns on hard, wind-packed snow (or powder, if you are fortunate) all the way down to lunch at the Chalet de Plan Bouchet. Another classic descent from the Pointe de Thorens is achieved by hiking for half an hour or so up to a col behind the jagged Aiguille de Peclet and skiing 10 miles down into Meribel. From here Courchevel, the most chic resort in France is only a quick (queues permitting) up-and-over. My visit to Les Menuires and that of the students was organised by Touralp (UK), 1, Berghem Mews, Blythe Road, London W14 OHN. Tel: 071-602-1952. I stayed at the three-star Latitudes Hotel in La Bruyeres, which has an outdoor swimming pool and skating rink at the foot of the slopes.</p>

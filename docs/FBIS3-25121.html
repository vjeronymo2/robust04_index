SACOB's business confidence index [BCI] improved  by one percentage point to 104.9 from 103.9 in November last  year.    Releasing the data, chief economist Ben van Rensburg however  warned that political electioneering before the polls in April  could result in uncertainty over economic policy and thus harm  confidence. Electioneering had not helped to bring any clarity  to economic policy and would increase uncertainty as political  campaigns intensified. Reconciling populist strategies aimed at  winning votes with realistic policies which would promote  business confidence was difficult for many of the political  players.    Dr Van Rensburg said a key measure of this type of  uncertainty was the capital account which experienced outflows  of about R[rand]15-billion last year. The index was higher over  the last two months as a result of an improvement in seven of  the 13 sub-indices which make up the BCI.     -  Stock market prices continued to reach new highs,    -  The value of building plans passed climbed markedly,    -  Real retail sales were higher on a monthly seasonally  adjusted  basis,    -  Short-term interest rates edged lower, and    -  The gold price firmed on international markets.       Negative influences on the BCI included:     -  The number of new passenger vehicles sold eased,    -  The volume of merchandise imports were lower,    -  The exchange rate of the commercial rand against the US  dollar  worsened, and    -  The official inflation rate increased slightly.       Although the economy was definitely in the recovery stage,  Dr  Van Rensburg stressed it was vital to achieve a political  inclusive settlement. This would bolster business and consumer  confidence leading to an easing in capital outflows as well as  underpinning the economy.    SACOB has forecast a growth rate of between two and 2.5 per  cent this year following on the economy's contraction over the  last four years.</p>

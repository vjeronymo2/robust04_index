In addition, the State's proximity to its public allows it to evaluate priorities in light of the public need more readily than USEPA. Consequently the USEPA believes it is appropriate to defer to the State in the matter of prioritization of waterbodies for TMDL development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Revisions to the Proposed Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the public comments received and continuing review of the proposed notice by the USEPA, the following changes have been made to the final identification of the section 303(d) water quality-limited segments for the State of Minnesota:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The final list of waterbodies for which TMDL development would be appropriate has been revised to include the 23 additional steam segments which the State has requested be included on the list, due to proximity to, and influence upon, other waterbodies for which TMDLs are being developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Waterbodies for which fish consumption advisories exist, and for which remedial measures lie outside the control of the State of Minnesota have been separately identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The final list of waterbodies for which TMDL development is appropriate excludes 65 stream segments included in the proposed list, for which the State has provided documentation that the information leading to the USEPA's decision to include these segments on the proposed list was not based on the most current information, and the more current information reveals that TMDLs are no longer appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The final list excludes nine stream segments identified in the State's comments which were described as meeting the designated uses, since the exceedences of numeric water quality criteria noted by the USEPA as the basis for our proposal to include these segments on the 303(d) list were due to naturally occurring background concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Final Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice is being issued pursuant to section 303(d)(2) of the CWA. Under this section, the USEPA is required to publish an identification of water quality-limited segments if a state submission is disapproved. The disapproval of the Minnesota submission occurred on August 9, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice identifies 72 water quality limited waterbodies for which TMDL development is appropriate and further identifies three waterbodies for which TMDL development is scheduled to be initiated over the next two years. This notice further identifies 245 waterbodies for which TMDL development is not feasible at this time. This constitutes USEPA's final determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 2, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David A.

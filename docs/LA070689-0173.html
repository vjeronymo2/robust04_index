			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH PLEASED NORTH WAS NOT SENT TO PRISON  </P> <P> President Bush expressed pleasure today that Oliver L. North was not sentenced  to jail for his Iran-Contra convictions, but sidestepped a question about  whether he has considered pardoning the former White House aide.  </P> <P> "I'm happy he's not going to jail," Bush said in answer to a question during an  interview with a group of journalists. "I'm not going to comment further  because this matter is under appeal and is in the federal courts."  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced North on Wednesday to a  three-year suspended sentence, two years' probation, $150,000 in fines and  1,200 hours of community service work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gorbachev's Call Deflected  </P> <P> On another topic, Bush deflected Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call  for swift negotiations over short-range nuclear weapons, noting that NATO  leaders agreed not to entertain such talks until an accord has been reached on  conventional forces.  </P> <P> "I don't want to get off track" by reopening the issue of short-range nuclear  forces that Western leaders agreed to in Brussels in May, Bush said in a  nationally televised session with foreign reporters designed to set the stage  for his European journey Sunday,  </P> <P> In a speech earlier in the day in Strasbourg, France, Gorbachev offered to make  additional and rapid cuts in his country's nuclear arsenal if NATO accepts  negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons. (Story, Page 2.)  </P> <P> Bush said he hoped to use his visits to Poland and Hungary to nudge both  Communist-controlled countries toward democracy.  </P> <P> He insisted that he is not trying to stir up trouble in Gorbachev's back yard,  saying, "That is not what 1989 diplomacy is about."  </P></p>

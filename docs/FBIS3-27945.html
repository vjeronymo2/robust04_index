			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 2 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In preparation for the Japanese-U.S. summit talks on  11 February, on 1 February Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  discussed the economic framework talks with Takakazu Kuriyama,  ambassador to the United States and who is on temporary home  leave, and listened to the views of nonlife insurers as passed  on by Chairman Takashi Onoda of the Marine and Fire Insurance  Association of Japan on the negotiations in the insurance sector.    A government source said on 1 February that U.S. President  Bill Clinton strongly pressed for the setting of numerical  targets in the framework talks during his telephone conversation  with Hosokawa on 31 January and that U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR) Mickey Kantor was sent to Tokyo as a special envoy to  make Japan implement such a demand.    High-ranking government officials, however, stated on 1  February that it would be difficult to set numerical targets for  automobiles and auto parts as the United States demands. If the  United States sticks to its principles, it is not likely that an  agreement can be reached at the summit talks.    In his briefing to the prime minister, Kuriyama said that  while Japanese-U.S. relations are basically taking a favorable  turn and that "the United States shows a sympathetic disposition  toward the Hosokawa administration, it is taking a tough  approach to the framework talks. I hope that the prime minister  exercises leadership to conclude the talks." He stated that the  prime minister will exercise his leadership to bring about  progress in the framework talks.    After the briefing, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura and Yukio Sato, director general of the North American  Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, joined the  discussion on how to handle the talks.    In the economic framework talks, the United States is  demanding that numerical targets be set in the priority sectors:  automobiles and auto parts and insurance. Negotiations with  Japan, which rejects setting such targets, have been going  nowhere. The prime minister recently discussed with Toyota  Motor Corporation Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda ways to break this  deadlock, but it seems that the domestic situation is not  conducive at all to accepting numerical targets.    As for automobiles and auto parts, senior government  officials say that "Automobiles are one sector where laws and  the administration are not deeply involved; it will be difficult  to have numerical targets. It is a private sector." They  reiterate their belief that it would not be possible to agree to  the U.S. demand to set numerical targets.</p>

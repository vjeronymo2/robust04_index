			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Lion Nathan buys brewing assets of Australian group LION NATHAN, the New Zealand-based brewing and soft drinks group, is set to lift its share of the Australian beer market from 40 to 46 per cent after buying the brewery operations of South Australian Brewing Holdings. If approved, the takeover will consolidate Lion Nathan's position as the biggest brewer in Australia and New Zealand. SA Brewing's main brands are Southwark, West End and Eagle. Lion Nathan yesterday said it was paying ADollars 225m (USDollars 152m) in cash for SA's brewing division, including the modern Southwark Brewing and Kent Town Malting, plus 105 hotels in the state of South Australia. In addition, it has agreed a long-term contract for SA Brewing to continue to supply aluminium cans for SA brewing products, and later this year for Pepsi-Cola bottlers in New Zealand. On expiry of the existing contract, SA Brewing will have the right to supply Lion Nathan's other aluminium can requirements in Australia and New Zealand, provided it can match competitive pricing. Lion Nathan recently raised funds to retire debt and to help finance the purchase of the brewing interests. It said the purchase would underpin its hopes to increase its share of the South Australian market and the overall Australian beer industry. Lion Nathan said it had not yet decided whether to retain the hotels, noting that it did not own many in Australia and was selling them in New Zealand. The purchase of the assets would increase Lion Nathan's assets in Australia to over 75 per cent of its total assets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- The State Duma Council sees no  grounds for thinking that the State Duma exceeded its powers and  violated the law and the consitution with its decision on the  amnesty. That was the conclusion reached by the participants in  today's session of the chamber's council.    The council discussed the situation that has developed over  the anmesty decision and the negative reaction to it from the  president's staff.    Commenting on the course of the session at the request of  the  ITAR-TASS correspondent, Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of  the Duma, said: "Several of the country's political figures have  spoken in the press about the amnesty and stated that the act  adopted by the State Duma should be regarded more as a pardon  than as an amnesty." However, "there are clear legal criteria  that make it possible to distinguish between these two acts. An  amnesty is a legislative instrument that is binding for all. A  pardon is an act that is applied individually and must be  applied strictly to a specified person. Furthermore, a pardon  covers only the convicted. An amnesty also covers those under  investigation, as in this case."    "In my view, there are no grounds whatsoever for saying that  the State Duma exceeded its rights and violated the law and the  constitution; the Duma Council registered this opinion in the  record, and there were no objections to this view," Valentin  Kovalev noted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arsen Baghdasaryan: "Ashot Manucharyan's Fourth </F> Return: The Mysterious Recluse Begins to Speak"]    [Text] It is a recurring pattern: Every time the situation  in some important domain of the republic assumes critical  proportions, Ashot Manucharyan returns--unexpectedly for  some--to the political stage. This time, according to  Manucharyan, the problem is that Karabakh will most probably be  able to halt the enemy's massive offensive and achieve a  breakthrough in the war's progress in the coming days and that  it is very important that we achieve peace and not lose the  favorable moment for a second time. During a press conference at  the Armenian Republican Party's headquarters yesterday,  Manucharyan called on parties, public and political  organizations and others to work together and "to turn the wheel  in the direction that is essential for us." He expressed the  hope that the next 2 to 3 months will have a determining role in  the achievement of peace.    Commenting on anticipated provocations, the former  presidential advisor stated that a dignified solution must be  found to the Karabakh problem and that one the requirements is  that the people of Karabakh must have guarantees for its secure  development and it must not be under anyone's rule. Mr  Manucharyan said that this is the minimum requirement and did  not rule out any situation which may be agreeable to Karabakh  but which may not satisfy Armenia. Mr Manucharyan also commented  on the CSCE and Russian peace efforts and stated that the latter  incorporates mechanisms which make the resumption of military  activities impossible but that it has many flaws. As for the  well known proposal made by [Yeltsin adviser] Andranik  Mihranyan, Mr Manucharyan said that that proposal is very close  to Russia's general posture.    Having been deprived of the opportunity to ask questions to  the mysterious politician for a long time, the reporters  naturally tried to learn about his views on the government, the  president and the Ministry of the Interior. It turns out that  the former presidential adviser has a very low opinion of the  government's work, that, in his opinion, the present government  cannot rectify the situation and that it must be replaced by a  new one. The Ministry of the Interior was the target of more  severe criticisms: Mr Manucharyan said that that ministry "is  out of control and not subject to authority." According to Mr  Manucharyan, if this situation continues there will be nothing  in the republic except the Ministry of the Interior. He  criticized the Ministry of the Interior for contributing to the  economic crisis and said that business people are fleeing the  republic today because of the shadow taxes that ministry has  imposed. With an expression of boyish amazement, Mr Manucharyan  cited a few examples of how those shadow taxes operate.    Mr Manucharyan also criticized certain episodes of the  president's foreign policy but declined to identify them  because, in his words, they are related to state secrets and  cannot be publicized.</p>

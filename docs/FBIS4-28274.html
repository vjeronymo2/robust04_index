			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- There is no basis to  believe North Korea's claim that there is still a chance to  trace back its past nuclear activities, Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said Thursday.    Arriving from Beijing, after two-hour strategic talks with  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Han said he is "satisfied  with the substance of the discussions with Qian."    He emphasized that South Korea, Japan, and the United States  are working for a U.N.-backed sanction resolution on North Korea.    "We are not working on assumption that the resolution will  not be passed at the Security Council," he said when asked about  the possibility of actions outside the United Nations.    Despite reports that Qian insisted on more dialogue with  North Korea on the nuclear crisis, Han said he expects China to  continue playing a constructive role.    "The problem is that dialogue hasn't taken us very far,"  said  Han, "China has said it will play a constructive role, and I  expect such role to continue."    Asked whether Qian said clearly whether Beijing will or will  not oppose sanction resolution, the foreign minister said he did  not anticipate a yes-or-no answer to begin with.    "The meaning of consultations such as this is in mutual  understanding, widening our consensus," said Han.    He belittled North Korea's insistence that the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can still recount the history of its  nuclear activities.    "From the information and facts gathered so far, there is no  basis to believe that the history can be recounted," he said.    "But if North Korea does present the ways to reveal its past  activities and fully cooperate with the safeguards agreement,  then that will open the road to dialogue," he said.</p>

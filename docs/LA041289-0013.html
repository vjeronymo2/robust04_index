			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKYER'S BILL ON WAITING  </P> <P> Lockyer writes, and acts, on the frustrations of doing business in today's  society. As a state senator, he has introduced a bill giving the consumer power  to penalize businesses which do not keep their appointments.  </P> <P> Hurray for him.  </P> <P> There are, however, some amendments I'd like to suggest. Certainly deserving of  heavy fines are the people who promise to "get back to you," and are never  heard from again. Also those who leave the phone to determine a fact and leave  you fuming for five minutes or so before you get notified by the buzz that your  "conservation" is over (this tends to happen on toll calls). Perhaps an even  higher fine for those who do finally return to the phone with patently false  information that they could not possibly have retrieved from any source better  than the office coffee machine.  </P> <P> Good luck, Sen. Lockyer; may you achieve success before you get cut off.  </P> <P> WILFRED COUZIN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

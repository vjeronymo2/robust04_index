			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "An Absurd Remark Reflecting </F> Their Real Intention"]    [Text] According to a report, on 23 May at the puppet  national assembly's foreign affairs and national unification  committee meeting, puppet national unification board [NUB]  minister Yi Hong-ku, while laying the blame at our nuclear  problem again, openly clamored that the North-South joint  declaration of denuclearization has virtually become null and  void. This is tantamount to promulgating the nullification of  the joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula which was adopted in 1992 and is, therefore, a grave  challenge to our fellow countrymen and the world's peace-loving  people who want to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.    Announcing the invalidity of the joint declaration of  denuclearization, Yi Hong-ku babbled that it was because of what  they call our nuclear problem. This is indeed a shameless  sophistry designed to conceal their true colors.    It is a widely known fact that since the joint declaration  of  denuclearization was adopted, the puppets have hindered by all  means the implementation of the joint declaration, including  withholding the realization of follow-up measures for the  declaration, while laying the blame on our nuclear problem.    Furthermore, the puppets have been mad only for their  nuclear  development manuevers while casting away the pledge they made  before the nation. The fact that the puppets who have already  secured a large amount of plutonium are now attempting to secure  more plutonium by even developing fast-breeder reactors, the  fact that the puppets have signed an agreement with Japan for a  nuclear development program, the fact that clamoring that the  time has come for them to have nuclear capability, the fact that  the puppets are asserting that the national assembly should  raise the voices calling for nuclear development, and the fact  that they are openly talking about nucleaar sovereignty, all of  these facts vividly show how frantically the puppets are running  wild for nuclear development.    In view of these facts, we can be clearly aware that it is  precisely the South Korean puppets who have reduced the joint  declaration of denuclearization to a scrap of paper and that it  is also precisely the puppets themselves who should be blamed  for the failure in realizing the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula.    This notwithstanding, the puppets are laying the blame at  our  nuclear problem. This is none other than a foolish trick  designed to shift to others the resonsibility for their having  nullified the joint declaration of denuclearization by  misleading public opinion.    Over 1,000 U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed in South Korea  today, and the puppets, as well, are not only accelerating their  own nuclear development program, but are also staging a nuclear  war exercise everyday. Such being the situation, whether or not  we can realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a  very important problem which has the direct bearing not only on  the survival of the nation, but also on the world's peace and  stability.    This is why the situation of the Korean peninsula today has  become a focus of today's world's politics. Therefore, all of  the Korean people, as well as the people of the world, are  strongly calling for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from  South Korea and for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    Nevertheless, the puppets who have been raising even growing  their own nuclear mushroom under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, are  challenging to the joint declaration of denuclearization by  openly announcing its nullification.    The absurd remark of the puppet NUB minister who has  promulgated the nullification of the joint declaration of  denuclearization reveals their real intention to remove the  burdensome obstacles to their nuclear weapon development project  and, thus, to accelerate in earnest their nuclear weapon  development. Therefore, his absurd remark is tantamount to a  declaration for their virtual nuclear armaments.    The puppets are interested neither in the nation's destiny  nor in the country's peaceful reunification. The Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique is a group of intolerable nuclear fanatics who are  trying to increase the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean  peninsula and to drive the nation into the disaster of a nuclear  war.    The entire nation will not allow the puppets' dangerous  maneuvers to make the Korean peninsula the site of a nuclear war  in collusion with outside forces. The South Korean puppets will  bear responsibility for all catastrophic consequences arising  from their maneuvers to nullify the joint declaration of  denuclearization.    As long as the Kim Yong-sam ring, a ring of nuclear war  fanatics, continues to exist, our nation will not be able to get  rid of the disaster of a nuclear war. Those who really oppose a  nuclear war and who think of the destiny of the country and the  nation should rise up and sternly check and frustrate the puppet  clique's maneuvers for nuclear weapons development.</p>

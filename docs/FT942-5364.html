			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Motoring: Fiat scores a point For months, Fiat's new supermini-sized Punto and I have been avoiding one another. Nothing personal, you understand. It was just that when Fiat asked me to go somewhere to drive it, I was committed elsewhere. But at last a Punto came my way. Having driven it for a week I can say, hand on heart, that it was worth the wait. The model I tried was a 55 S 1.1 3-door, at Pounds 6,350 the cheapest and least elaborate of them all. There can be few cars less favoured with goodies. It was the first I had driven for many years that lacked a trip mileometer. The windows were hand wound (no great hardship); there was no rev counter, no central locking, no split rear seat backrest and no power steering, which was bothersome only at very low speeds or when parking. That, however, just about sums up this most basic Punto's downside. The upside included a willing engine (55 horsepower at 5,500 rpm); a five-speed gearbox with the nicest shift of any Fiat in recent years, even if getting reverse called for a strong push down; and a good ride due to the wheel-at-each-corner design. The driving position is excellent because neither pedals nor steering wheel is offset and - most unusually - there is a proper rest for the left foot away from the clutch. Headroom is more than adequate, with no sunroof runners to reduce clearance. There is no sunroof. The tailgate opens on to a reasonable boot. It will not take two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys without folding the back seat - but I cannot think of any car in this size and price class with a boot that does. Punto's styling is trendy and practical. I rated it as pretty and original as that of the 'one-box' shaped Twingo that Renault, to its discredit and probably ultimate regret, has said will never be made with right-hand drive. The body is easy to see out of and is well protected, front and rear, from minor knocks by whacking great plastic bumpers. But the flanks of the Punto 55 S look vulnerable to careless multi-storey parkers; they lack the rubber side-strips that are standard on every other Punto model from the 55 SX 1.1 3-door (Pounds 7,350) upwards. Height-adjustable seatbelts with pre-tensioners are part of the package; airbags for driver and front passenger are a Pounds 540.50 optional extra. Full marks to Fiat for equipping all Puntos with an inertia switch that de-pressurises the fuel line from tank to engine in a crash to reduce fire risk. Neither power steering nor anti-lock brakes are available as an extra on this entry model though they are on some of the dearer ones. Another nice touch, unusual in a small, cheap car is the choice of fresh or recirculated air from the heater. Although a car of Punto's size and engine capacity is likely to spend more of its life in towns and suburbs than on long journeys, it does not run out of steam on motorways. At normal third lane cruising speeds it sounded fairly busy but unstressed. On smooth tarmac it ran quietly, but coarsely textured surfaces created a surprising amount of tyre noise. Fuel consumption should average around 44-45 mpg (6.42-6.27 l/100 km). For a mix of performance, comfort and value for money, the Punto 55 S must be the best buy among supermini-sized family hatchbacks, There are some slightly cheaper ones, but they are mainly basic versions of yesterday's cars, such as the Fiat Uno, Rover Metro, Renault 5 Campus, Citroen AX and VW Polo that are nearing the end of their lives. The most competitive of its up-to-date price rivals are the Peugeot 106 Kid 1.0i and Vauxhall Corsa Merit 1.2i 3-door, listed at Pounds 6,375 and Pounds 6,645 respectively, Nissan Micra 1.0 L 3-door (Pounds 6,855) and Seat Ibiza 1.3 CLi 3-door (Pounds 6,895). Perhaps its most formidable challenger will be the new Volkswagen Polo, due to be launched in the UK in October. Prices will have to match Punto's closely. Fiat has not had a happy time in the British market for several years but in the last 12 months has been pulling out of the doldrums. The Punto's arrival can only speed up the process.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHELBY STEELE ON PREFERENCE  </P> <P> The Times gave so much play to Steele's new book because it says what every,  even minimally racist white person or pitifully misguided "Uncle Tom"  African-American wants to hear -- that the "free ride" blacks have supposedly  gotten through affirmative action is not only unfair to whites but hurts  blacks.  </P> <P> Bullstripes! Racism hurts black people directly and others indirectly.  </P> <P> All affirmative action does, in the rare instances where it is actually  enforced, is give blacks, women and other minorities a chance. That's all we  want in the first place. It is ingrained and institutionalized racism that  keeps us from getting that chance.  </P> <P> My parents taught me the truth, as did Steele's parents, that as a black  person, I have to be twice as good as a white person to be considered as  capable. It is my experience that affirmative action programs allow a few more  of the overly qualified black people to get a shot at middle management. We  are, more often than not, still cut off from the top.  </P> <P> Except for pockets of prejudice in states like California and Texas, other  minority groups have not and do not face the same level of discrimination that  black people do. White people don't have to feel guilty for the injustices  historically visited upon the black race; there's plenty of current crapola to  feel bad about.  </P> <P> E-K.

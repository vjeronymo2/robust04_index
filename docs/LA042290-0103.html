			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> POLITICIANS GET DIRECT LINE TO SUPPORTERS  </P> <P> For $2 a minute, anyone with a phone can hear a "Beat Helms" message sponsored  by a critic of Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina.  </P> <P> For $12.50 a month, anyone with a bank account can support Helms and other  Senate Republicans by allowing automatic deductions from their bank books.  </P> <P> In the competition for campaign cash, candidates and political groups are  trying out new fund-raising gimmicks and dusting off reliable old ones.  </P> <P> "It gets intense out there when everyone is asking, so sometimes being  different works," said Michelle Davis, executive director of the Republican  Governors Assn.  </P> <P> Davis describes the traditional fund-raiser like this: "You dress up, you go to  a dinner, you listen to people give speeches, you write your check and you go  home."  </P> <P> The big money in politics still comes from these big-name fund-raising dinners  and from the huge "soft money" contributions that corporations and labor unions  make to party organizations.  </P> <P> But some of the newest fund-raising methods rely on high-tech gimmicks such as  900-number telephone lines and electronic fund transfers that allow fast and  easy access to contributors' bank accounts.  </P> <P> The Republican governors' group, meanwhile, is adding a little glitz but  sticking to basics as it tries to offer contributors more than a chicken dinner  for their checks. The group is holding smaller, more intimate sessions at which  donors can chat with governors and other prominent Republicans.  </P> <P> "We have to do more than we have in the past -- to add a little cachet," Davis  said.  </P> <P> The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to  the House, this year added the Preakness to the lineup of big sporting events  for which it offers tickets in exchange for contributions. Super Bowl parties  long have been fund-raising favorites.  </P> <P> The committee, hard pressed for cash, also is raising more money than ever from  Democratic incumbents who have cash to spare in their huge campaign war chests.  </P> <P> The anti-Helms effort, sponsored by a North Carolina State University  professor, is but one example of the growing popularity of 900 phone lines as a  political tool. The National Rifle Assn. started the trend a year ago and  quickly raised $2.5 million.  </P> <P> Kent Hance, defeated in the Texas GOP gubernatorial primary this month, charged  $3.95 a call for a message from his anti-tax group. The campaign pocketed $2 a  call.  </P> <P> The Helms and Hance phone lines come cheap when compared to the two 900 lines  set up by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the Senate's 1989 fund-raising  king. The senator charged $25 and $50 for two 900 lines that gave callers  recorded voter registration information and details about a fund-raiser Gramm  was holding with President Bush.  </P> <P> The Federal Election Commission has looked at a number of legal questions  related to political use of 900 lines, which critics say can easily be used to  avoid or bend contribution limits.  </P> <P> Democrats also are raising questions about the National Republican Senatorial  Committee's "Candidate Escrow Funding" program -- the $12.50 a month  direct-deposit gimmick. Participants get a $25 check in exchange for  authorizing monthly bank debits that will increase 10% a year.  </P> <P> "Leave it to the Republicans to figure another way to con you," Texas  Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle said of the GOP effort.  </P> <P> The Republicans have revised the fund-raising letter that goes with the $25  check to make it clearer that people will pay out more than that in the long  run and have set up a toll-free telephone line to answer questions.  </P> <P> Some more traditional fund-raising gambits also still stir controversy from  time to time, such as mailings that cash in on someone's name without their  permission.  </P> <P> Some 200,000 letters mailed out by "Friends of Dan Quayle" late last year  sought contributions to support the conservative agenda, yet Quayle had nothing  to do with the mailing and gets none of the money.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nadzim Ahmad Jamalludin] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 25 January--Police have broken up a  heroin drug distribution network in the Lembah Klang area  following the arrest of three persons during a raid on a drug  processing laboratory at Taman Desa Petaling [Petaling Village  Center] on the afternoon of 24 January.    Assistant Principal Commissioner II Hassan Mutalip, chief of  the Kuala Lumpur Office of Criminal Investigation, said that  during the police raid the police also seized a variety of  heroin processing equipment and a large quantity of drugs.    It is thought that the heroin seized weighed about 20 kg,  including what had not yet been processed.    When Assistant Principal Commissioner Hassan Mutalip met  with  reporters in Kuala Lumpur on 25 January, he said: "Earlier this  afternoon at around 1300 a police detachment from the Capital  Anti-Drug Branch raided a block of flats at Winner Court B in  Petaling Village Center."    "In the building police arrested two men and one woman in  their 20's."    "Also during the raid the police seized eight blocks of  material containing heroin which had not yet been processed and  a large quantity of processed heroin."    Hassan said that the police believe that the flat which was  raided was used by the men and the woman involved to process  heroin there.    However, he said, the police are still investigating to  determine how long the men and the women were processing heroin  there.    According to him, the police are still interrogating the men  and the woman who were arrested and will charge them under  Section 39B of the Dangerous Substances Act of 1952, which  carries the mandatory sentence of death by hanging if they are  found guilty. It is thought that the men and woman who were  arrested are members of a heroin distribution syndicate in the  Lembah Klang area.    It is believed that the men and the woman converted the flat  into a heroin processing center because it was outside the more  crowded, central area of Lembah Klang.</p>

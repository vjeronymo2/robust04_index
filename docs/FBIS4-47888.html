			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking in Tete Province yesterday, President of  the Republic Joaquim Chissano announced that the government has  decided to temporarily suspend its troop demobilization process.  As a reason for such a decision, the Mozambican head of state  said that the Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] troop  demobilization process had not been balanced. He also noted the  need for making technical corrections to the figures and lists  that Renamo has been supplying to the UN Operations in  Mozambique Technical Unit.    NOTICIAS reports that President Joaquim Chissano made that  announcement after visiting the troop assembly area in Ulongwe,  the capital of Tete Province's Angonia District. NOTICIAS also  reports that the Mozambican head of state warned the soldiers of  the need for them to remain in the area for a while longer. He  explained that it is an area that continues to deserve special  attention. NOTICIAS says President Chissano was indirectly  referring to the fact that Renamo soldiers continue to be  powerfully armed and terrorizing the civilian population in many  parts of Tete Province.    The president of the Republic traveled 260 km on the road  between the city of Tete, the provincial capital, and Angonia  District. He passed many areas where Renamo continues to  prevent the Mozambican Government from implementing the National  Reconstruction Program and other political organizations from  doing their political work.    NOTICIAS also reports today that a South African citizen was  distributing photographs of Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama in one  of the areas visited by the Mozambican head on his way to  Angonia District. That South African citizen had not been  allowed to come into the country from Malawi, but was  subsequently seen in Mozambican territory.</p>

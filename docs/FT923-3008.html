			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Ministers delay Ulster electricity sell-off COMPLETION of the privatisation of Northern Ireland's electricity industry was postponed last night. Unexpectedly Mr Robert Atkins, the province's economy minister, said a number of outstanding matters needed to be resolved. 'The most important of these relates to the funding of the proposed interconnector to Scotland and an application which the government has made to the European Commission for assistance towards its costs,' he explained. 'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success, but recognises the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough evaluation of it. 'Consequently, although one option for the flotation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be possible to complete the sale this autumn.' NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector project earlier this year, and the government is believed to be seeking about Pounds 70m from the Commission towards the cost of construction. The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power stations went into private hands. British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne; Nigen, an American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot and Belfast West; and a management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury's coffers. It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply business would raise another Pounds 350m for the government. Advertisements have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television. NIE is the last UK electricity company to be privatised and is small and isolated in comparison with the distribution companies on the mainland, David Lascelles writes. The government is keen to create an interconnector with Scotland to improve sources of supply and sharpen competition. A link with the Irish Republic has also been proposed. The Scottish link, rated at 250MW, would be capable of supplying 20 per cent of Northern Ireland's electricity demand, although as the province's own generation capacity expands it might begin exporting power to Scotland. There are also plans to connect Northern Ireland to the UK gas pipeline network. The delay means that NIE will now probably have to wait for the completion of the sale of British Coal.</p>

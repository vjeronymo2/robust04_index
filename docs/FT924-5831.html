			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Bhutto keeps heat on a besieged Sharif: Law and order central to Pakistan investment hopes A WEEK after the biggest political challenge by Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani opposition leader, to the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the capital Islamabad looks like a city under siege. Riot control policemen wearing protective gear and armed with batons and tear gas shells remain on standby. Small enclosures built with sandbags have just been dismantled and loops of razor wire pushed to the roadside. They were among the remaining signs of the crackdown last Wednesday, which involved police and soldiers, to stop Ms Bhutto from leading a public demonstration demanding Mr Sharif's dismissal on charges of corruption. More riot police were on alert last night as she arrived at the railway station in Lahore aboard a train from Karachi in an attempt to reach the outskirts of the capital. The confrontation is becoming Mr Sharif's most difficult political test since he came to office two years ago. There are few signs of a compromise. The clash grew from a call by Ms Bhutto for a march on parliament to protest against alleged government corruption and demand fresh elections. The demonstration was banned and she was barred from Islamabad for a month. While Ms Bhutto has vowed to continue her struggle, Mr Sharif maintains that the opposition is trying to destabilise democracy. Ms Bhutto has widened her coalition by seeking fresh alliances with such prominent politicians as Mr Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, former prime minister. Mr Jatoi, a former Sharif ally, ruled over an interim government after Ms Bhutto's dismissal in August 1990, but broke ranks from the ruling party earlier this year. Mr Sharif commands a parliamentary majority despite cracks in his ruling alliance and there are few signs of large-scale public unrest to unseat him. However, he is regarded by many observers as more vulnerable. Earlier this year, the government sent troops to curb growing lawlessness in the southern province of Sindh, a stronghold of the opposition where a Sharif-backed government rules. Some order has been restored, but many businessmen and politicians say the ultimate solution lies in improving economic factors such as employment and better prospects for landless peasants, some of whom have turned highway robbers. In addition, there is a need for compromise with the opposition to curb political discontent. The Sindh army action also led to a crackdown against a government ally, the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), a powerful regional party based in Karachi, the heart of Pakistan's business activity. Mr Sharif was forced to break ranks with the MQM which has exposed his alliance to the possibility of fresh opposition from Karachi once troops return to their barracks. There have also been growing differences with the Jamaat-i-Islami, a religious party which supported Mr Sharif in his election campaign. Most recently, the government has faced resistance from human rights activists and religious minorities who are opposing plans to require non-Moslems to identify their religion on national identity cards. Every Pakistani is required to hold such a card for identification by police and other officials. New economic constraints are also expected to put pressure on the government. The country's privatisation programme, one of the pillars of economic policy, is proceeding on track, and the government argues that efforts towards liberalisation of the economy will continue. But recent floods are estimated to have damaged roads, bridges and other infrastructure at a cost of between Dollars 1.6bn and Dollars 2bn. There is now concern that businessmen will be discouraged from investing in new projects. 'This sort of thing gets bad press. It discourages investors from coming here,' says one western diplomat. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, acknowledged in an interview: 'Political instability is not good for investment or economic growth,' adding that if government-opposition confrontation 'lasts for several weeks or months, then obviously it will affect the investment climate'. However, Mr Aziz argues that the confrontation has so far not had an effect on the economy, adding that neither has the stock market index fallen nor has there been a large outflow from the country's foreign exchange bank accounts - two of the most visible signs of nervousness. There remain few signs suggesting Mr Sharif's imminent downfall. Neither of the two most important institutions in Pakistani affairs, the president and the army, is likely to intervene either to change the government constitutionally or through the use of force - unless there is a further breakdown of order. But the government-opposition rift will have to end before Pakistan can again seek to build an image of political stability.</p>

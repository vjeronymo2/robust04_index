			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Will Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's strategy to  influence Prime Minister Hosokawa and dispose of Shinseito  Secretary General Ozawa succeed?    Reportedly Prime Minister Hosokawa has recently placed more  priority on Ozawa than Takemura.    "I received a necktie from Liberal DEmocratic Party [LDP]  LDP  Secretary General Mori." "Even Mr. Gotoda agreed with my idea."  Recently, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has been going out of  his way to emphasize his substantial ties with the LDP. It is as  if he is saying that he will establish an agreement with the LDP  concerning passage of the political reform bill.  <H5>  Scathing Comments Made About Ozawa Off the Record </H5>   "Oh! This is an off-the-record comment. Don't make a record  of it." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 59,  habitually smiles wryly and he licks his somewhat thick lips in  making this statement.    It is the political reporter's role to pump for confidential  information when he hears such off-the-record conversations and  notes incipient friction emanating in the Hosokawa government.    Recently, holding informal discussions with Takemura has  become popular among political reporters. That trend is not  based solely on the fact that he has a lot of information  because of his position as the chief cabinet secretary. The  reason is that they can hear Takemura's sensitive comments about  Shinseito President Ichiro Ozawa, 51, who is the second major  functionary in sustaining the coalition party and whose  political beliefs and methods differ from those of Takemura.    Takemura versus Ozawa. The rivalry between the two was well  known when the current government came into being. However, as  deliberations on the political reform bills reach a critical  period, differences in the objectives of the two have become  more obvious. Both tread on common ground in aiming for passage  of the reform bills with the support of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's intense popularity, but they differ widely about the  design of the second political restructuring. The chief cabinet  secretary wants to establish ties with a reformed LDP and part  ways with Shinseito. On the other hand, the leading personality  of the ruling party would like to gain the support of those  sympathetic to his cause and eliminate Takemura--with whom he is  incompatible--and his group from the coalition. These two who  hold the key to passage of the bills are waging a "desperate  battle" about negotiations with the LDP in the face of the  pending Diet vote on the bills. This is why interviews with  Takemura, who has a tendency to be verbose, is so popular.    In any event, allow me to introduce a number of Takemura  statements based on the evaluation of political editors of  national newspapers who say, "interviews with Takemura are  richer in information than the regular press conferences held by  the Prime Minister's Official Residence."    The first quote concerns the research group arranged by  former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi which became a topic of  conversation as having resulted in the establishment of ties  between Ozawa and former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe.    (27 September) "Even Hiroyuki Sonoda and Shusei Tanaka of  our  Sakigake were invited to join the research group. No way will  they join. However, `Chinnen' Yamaguchi occasionally joins some  of the key individuals and does some astounding things. He has  even visited the Prime Minister's Official Residence. Mr.  Hosokawa doesn't particularly like `Chinnen,' but the latter has  critical information. That's because someone is manipulating him  in the background."    There's no need to mention that "someone...in the  background"  is Ozawa and it seems that Ozawa's temerity in unhesitatingly  attempting to recruit officials from Sakigake displeased  Takemura. Even so, this particular quote can be regarded as a  light diversionary statement, though in the form of a sharp  off-the-record remark.    (4 October) When one reporter asked, "In Russia, is Yeltsin  of greater value than the congress?" Takemura replied, "Your  question is akin to asking, `Is Mr. Ozawa of greater value than  Mr. Seiroku Kajiyama, former LDP secretary general. Are you  going to make a memo of my statement? If so, please write, `I  pray for the earliest possible return of Mr. Ozawa.'"    At the time, the comment was made in view of the fact that  Ozawa was taking convalescent leave.    Although supposedly an off-the-record comment, the reporter  makes a memorandum of the statement and turns it in to the  newspaper company. The contents of the memorandum are conveyed  to Ozawa via reporters in charge of covering Shinseito. It can  be considered a shrewd statement made by Takemura knowing that  it would reach Ozawa's ears through this particular circuit.    And, concerning the rice tariff issue, Takemura once made a  very suggestive statement that Ozawa went over the head of  government officials in concluding a secret agreement with the  United States.    (14 October) "Before he left Washington, Agriculture  Secretary Espy who visited Japan on the 10th, made a statement  saying, "Noteworthy progress has been made." I wonder who did  the negotiating. Were there any key personnel who made a trip to  the United States at this stage? I wonder who went..."    In the latter part of September, Ozawa was making a trip  through Europe. That statement was skillfully used to refer to  rumors that Ozawa had made a secret side trip to the United  States.    On the other hand, Takemura indirectly points out Ozawa's  lack of popularity by saying, (18 October) "The discussions were  very lively today at the government's ruling party summit  conference, because Ozawa was absent."    And adds, (18 October) "Mr. Ozawa's draft law to revise the  Diet goes too far. The mass media should provide greater  coverage of the proposed revisions and issue cautionary  comments."    Such statements represent frontal attacks on Ozawa and are  only a couple of such statements made in rapid succession to the  effect that Takemura does not wish to share the same destiny  with Ozawa.    Fresh in the minds of the public is the episode when Ozawa  denied a request for interviews by two newspapers and Takemura  publicly criticized Ozawa with the comment, "Politicians are  public figures. They should aggressively seek out involvement  with reporters."    One wonders why Takemura dislikes and uses diversionary  tactics so extensively in reference to Ozawa.    One reason is the sudden intimacy between Ozawa and  Hosokawa.  Ozawa and Hosokawa became closer by the day as the political  reform bill neared passage. Because of that situation, rumors  have it that Takemura who was said to have honeymoon-like  relationships with Hosokawa from before establishment of the  current government is no longer an insider.    According to sources at the Prime Minister's Residence,  Ozawa  and the prime minister are holding frequent secret sessions  using the Prime Minister's Residence and hotels in Tokyo. They  are being held at the pace of more than once a week. Telephone  calls are being made more frequently at the rate of two calls a  day."  <H5>  Ozawa Confidant Says, "Takemura Is a Scoundrel" </H5>   Now, the question is, why is Ozawa suddenly approaching  Hosokawa and why is Takemura being avoided? Influencing the  situation is the decisive difference in the blueprints  envisioned by the two individuals concerning a second political  restructuring.    According to a source close to the prime minister,  Takemura's  strategy goes this way. "Takemura visualizes elimination of the  bloc consisting of Shinseito and Komeito and reorganization of  the government using former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu  Gotoda, LDP reformists, and the Japan New Party. Takemura's move  is highly disadvantageous to Ozawa because of the strong  anti-Ozawa sentiment in the LDP. This is why Ozawa is suddenly  approaching Hosokawa and assuming a strategy to separate the  latter from Takemura."    Takemura is a liberal in a political sense. He cannot agree  at all with Ozawa who advocates constitutional revision and aims  at making Japan a political power. He wants to avoid Ozawa's  approach and tie up with LDP reformists with whom he enjoys  commonality in terms of constitutional and national principles.    According to sources at Shinseito, "Takemura has been making  frequent contact with Gotoda at hotels in Tokyo and over the  telephone, as well as contacting Masasuke Kitamura who rapidly  gained prominence among young LDP reformists. Concurrent with  such contacts, Gotoda is continuing talks with LDP President  Yohei Kono on political reform, forming a Takemura-Gotoda-Kono  lineup. The confrontation between Ozawa and Takemura has come to  a stage where it is no longer reversible."    If Takemura has written off Ozawa, the same is true in  reverse with Ozawa. Based on past episodes, he has already  decided, "I can no longer deal with Takemura."    The strategy envisioned by Ozawa calls for a split in the  LDP, disposal of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake, unification of the Japan New Party,  Komeito, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and a quick  reorganization.    According to earlier quoted sources at Shinseito, "The  plotting goes on unmistakably. One form it is taking is the  contacts with the prime minister and plotting with the LDP is  being conducted confidentially. The first targeted group is  Michio Watanabe and his group. Ozawa has held confidential talks  with Watanabe himself on at least two occasions. Serving as  intermediary was Mutsuki Kato. Ozawa can expect 30 followers in  the Watanabe group. He has also contacted the Komoto faction and  has met directly with Komoto at the end of August. Ozawa  reportedly said, `I won't ask you to join Shinseito, but when  the next political restructuring takes place, I would like to  work with Kaifu and other reformists.' It seems Ozawa said that  in return he would take care of Saburo Komoto, Komoto's son,  when he decides to change over to the House of Representatives.  Up to mid-September, Ozawa has also met twice with Kaifu."    In addition to such movements, Ozawa is also circulating  information that is unfavorable to Takemura. Recently, sources  close to Ozawa are constantly leaking such statements as,  "Takemura is a scoundrel. His goal is to destroy the Hosokawa  government. He's plotting for a change in government by  preventing passage of the political reform bills by yearend and  splitting the LDP. He's stating that he will push Gotoda to lead  the next government, but it is already known that Gotoda will  not accept. His intentions are to assume leadership of the new  government at that point."    Newspapers and other mass media are now saying that the  situation is developing so as to favor Ozawa, in view of the  foregoing circumstances.    However, that is no more than a superficial observation. The  basis for that conclusion is that, "Ozawa's only ace in the hole  is Hosokawa."    Sources at Sakigake comment, "If the coalition government  should fail, the party most adversely affected would be  Shinseito. Sakigake, the Japan New Party, the DSP, and the SDPJ  could align themselves with the LDP which has acquired a clean  image because of President Kono, but as long as Ozawa is around,  the LDP and Shinseito could never join forces. Ozawa has no  choice but to continue supporting Hosokawa as a leader."    There are many aspects to the situation which are a  disadvantage to Ozawa. Kajiyama, who once waged an "internecine  war" and is now a natural enemy of Ozawa, has begun to move  actively. He frequently contacts SDPJ Committee Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama with whom Kajiyama has been on close terms  since he was chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee. Even  Murayama has publicly stated, "The SDPJ can win 100 seats at the  end of the year if the midsized electoral district system is  retained." There is a strong possibility that Murayama will join  Kajiyama in a movement to defeat the political reform bills. LDP  and SDPJ goals are in agreement.    If the LDP and SDPJ join to defeat the reform bill, Hosokawa  will definitely move to dissolve the cabinet and call for a  general election.    If that should become the case, it would clearly be  disadvantageous for Ozawa who is using the strategy of  preserving the Hosokawa government as long as possible and  conducting an election only after decimating the LDP's support  structure.  <H5>  Making Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara an Ally </H5>   That is the very reason why Ozawa is desperately pushing  passage of the bill and plotting a split in the LDP, but aside  from such adverse movements, Ozawa has another weak point. We  are speaking of his relations with Komeito with whom he is said  to be very close.    Members of the LDP are very sensitive about the Soka Gakkai,  which is Komeito's support organization, and have intensified  their attack on unity of church and state ever since Komeito  became a part of the coalition government.    According to LDP sources, "However, since Ozawa will have no  choice but to join hands with Komeito as a matter of strategy,  those attacks will have a severe adverse impact. The presence of  members within Shinseito who are sensitive to the Soka Gakkai  renders Komeito a double-edged sword for Ozawa."    On the other hand, developments such as failure of the  reform  bills to pass and dissolution and general elections won't have  much of an adverse impact on Takemura.    The earlier quoted sources at Sakigake comment, "Takemura  has  the added advantage of the option of joining with the LDP.  Takemura also anticipates dissolution."    Diet member Seiichi Ota has publicly stated that he cannot  join Ozawa but could do so with Takemura.    Ota remarks, "The only reason the present coalition parties  are maintaining a semblance of balance is because of the  presence of Takemura. We need to give him positive recognition  for this fact. If Takemura did not exist, Ozawa's Shinseito and  Ichikawa's Komeito would join forces to control the current  government. The only reason why the two are not able to take  such action is because of Mr. Takemura's lone struggle. The  liberal faction of the LDP is ready to form an alliance at any  time with Takemura who opposes the Ozawa-Ichikawa bloc."    Further, the real chief of staff within the Prime Minister's  Official Residence, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo  Ishihara in charge of administration, was senior to Takemura in  the Ministry of Home Affairs. In the past, Ishihara is said to  have favored Ozawa, but with Takemura's appointment to a  position in the Prime Minister's Official Residence, he is said  to have altered his stance. Even on the issue of imposing  tariffs on rice, Ishihara has joined hands with Takemura in  negotiating with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries.    After reviewing the situation as covered thus far in this  article, one comes to the conclusion that there is more  flexibility in Takemura's strategy calling for support for  Hosokawa until the very end, while maintaining liaison with  liberal factions of the LDP such as Gotoda and Kono so that he  can join hands with them if the need arises.    Diet man Susumu Yanase has said, "Mr. Takemura is a  politician with sound judgment. Mention is made that he clashes  often with Mr. Ozawa, but if he thinks clashing would be to his  advantage, he will do so in the manner of a stage show. He does  not clash with others with any serious motivations."    It appears Yanase is saying that Takemura skillfully  conceals  his true intent while steadily working for points. Another  Sakigake official remarks, "The current government was  established, to begin with, because of the close relationship  between Takemura and Hosokawa. Although Hosokawa appears very  easy-going, he is very shrewd in dealing with Takemura and Ozawa  and sustaining the current government. He will probably allow  Ozawa to conduct himself as he wishes until he wins passage of  the political reform bills. However, the important point is that  Mr. Hosokawa and Ozawa are of two different types. In the end,  there will be a Hosokawa-Takemura team and Ozawa will be  discarded. Takemura exercises confidence in this respect."    Takemura had dinner with Hosokawa in the evening of 22  October. He licked his lips as he said, "We talked about many  subjects. We even talked about Ichiro Ozawa. After all, the  situation is such that we couldn't avoid the topic."    Even if there is a change in government, there will be no  change in efforts to determine the intentions of opposing  parties or in Machiavellianism. In order to realize Prime  Minister Hosokawa's public pledge to "implement political reform  by the end of the year," it will be essential to gain passage of  the bill in the House of Representatives by the middle of  November. As confusion in the political situation deepens, the  question is, who will have the last laugh--Takemura or Ozawa?    It appears the main battle of the cold war concerning  political restructuring is yet to be fought.</p>

An absolute majority of top officials of rayon executive  committees and city mayoralties have submitted these documents  and information in a timely manner.    Executive committees of such rayons as Kamenskiy,  Komratskiy,  Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon Executive  Committees, as well as the mayoralties of the cities of Bendery,  Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol ignore the provisions of the  elections law and directives of the Central Electoral  Commission, refusing to send the necessary information and  organize the preparations for, and the conduct of, elections to  Parliament.    The aforementioned rayon executive committees and city  mayoralties block the preparation for and the conduct of  elections in respective rayons, and prevent residents of these  population centers from exercising freely their right to elect  and to be elected.    Based on the above, the Central Electoral Commission  resolved:    1. To demand the Government of the Republic of Moldova  jointly with the executive committees of Kamenskiy, Komratskiy,  Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon Executive  Committees, as well as mayoralties of the cities of Bendery,  Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol, take appropriate measures for  the preparation for and the conduct of elections in these  population centers in accordance with the provisions of the Law  on Elections of Parliament and Parliament's Decree on the  Procedures for Enacting the Law on the Elections of the  Parliament dated 19 October 1993.    2. To make it incumbent upon the chairmen of Kamenskiy,  Komratskiy, Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon  Executive Committees, and the mayors of the cities of Bendery,  Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol to submit for the Central  Electoral Commission's approval the composition of a technical  group and announcements of the mayoralties of respective  population centers regarding electoral precincts, their  boundaries, location, and telephone numbers, as well as  proposals with respect to candidates for chairmen of precinct  electoral commissions, and decisions of communities and cities  councils on the composition of precinct electoral commissions  before 20 December 1993.    3. To inform the Republic of Moldova's procurator of  noncompliance with the Law on Elections to Parliament on the  part of aforementioned rayon executive committees and city  mayoralties in order to take appropriate steps in accordance  with the current legislation.    [Signed]Central Electoral Commission Chairman Nicolae  Timofti    Central Electoral Commission Secretary Raisa Botezatu    Chisinau, 14 December 1993</p>

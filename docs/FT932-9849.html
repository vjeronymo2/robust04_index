			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major refuses to confirm Lamont's future SPECULATION ABOUT a summer cabinet reshuffle gathered fresh momentum yesterday when Mr John Major refused to confirm that chancellor Norman Lamont would present this year's second Budget. Challenged repeatedly by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major responded aggressively but stopped short of the requested assurance. While it would be virtually unprecedented for a prime minister to comment on possible cabinet changes in the way demanded, Mr Major's refusal to be drawn reinforced expectations at Westminster that Mr Lamont will be moved in a July reshuffle. Coming in the wake of Monday night's embarrassing backbench revolt over the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel bills, the prime minister's remarks added to the impression of a government in disarray after last week's disastrous Conservative performance in elections across the country. His remarks contrasted sharply with the vote of confidence he offered Mr John Patten, the beleaguered education secretary, behind whom he said he stood 'four-square'. At the very least they indicated Mr Major was keeping all his options open. Arriving in the chamber to now customary Labour shouts of 'Resign],' Mr Major was immediately challenged by Mr Smith, who asked: 'Can you tell us if the Budget in November will be presented by the present chancellor?' Mr Major retorted by branding the question 'a hoary old chestnut' and saying he had 'not yet even begun to contemplate cabinet changes'. He went on to praise Mr Lamont while avoiding giving a direct answer to Mr Smith's question. The chancellor's was 'an excellent record' that people would recognise long after Mr Smith's 'undignified sniping' had been forgotten. When Mr Smith repeated his question, asking for a simple 'yes or no' answer, the prime minister responded more aggressively, referring to last week's Labour mix-up over an article published in the leftwing Tribune newspaper by Lord Desai, the party's economics spokesman in the Lords. The Conservatives have plunged to their lowest poll rating for seven years according to an ICM poll in today's Guardian. The findings (with last month in brackets) are: Labour 43 per cent (46), Conservatives 29 per cent (34), Liberal Democrats 23 per cent (15). The figures do not add up to 100% because of supporters of other parties not recorded. ICM interviewed 1,458 voters last Friday and Saturday.</p>

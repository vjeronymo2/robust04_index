			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Between 1,000 and 2,000 men  are needed for the operation in Rwanda, the French foreign  minister said during his visit to Cote d'Ivoire yesterday.  Alain Juppe reaffirmed the strict humanitarian character of the  operation proposed by France. He also insisted that France will  not and cannot go alone to Rwanda:    [Begin Juppe recording] We have said very clearly that our  intervention should be given the green light by the United  Nations. We are examining the type of resolution that could give  a mandate to member states to intervene to save the population,  which is the prime concern. Several European countries that we  have contacted have told us, some publicly, that they approve of  the principle of the operation. I spoke to my Italian, Spanish,  and British colleagues, and other contacts have been made in  Paris. Several African countries have also expressed their  support in principle.    We are now examining the concrete modalities of the  operation, whose duration should be limited; it should have  precise objectives and should be exclusively humanitarian. The  aim is to save people who might be wiped out within the next few  days. It should be carried out by several countries. To avoid  any ambiguity, France does not wish to go in alone.

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Rumours boost dollar Rumours of a rise in US interest rates and ongoing fears of central bank intervention yesterday helped the dollar bounce off recent lows, writes Philip Gawith. These factors overshadowed the release of US consumer inflation figures which were in line with market forecasts - a 2.5 per cent year on year rise to June. As with Monday's producer inflation figures, the market's initial response was to sell the dollar as the figures did not seem to provide cause for the Fed to tighten policy. The dollar finished 1 1/2 pfennigs higher against the D-Mark in London at DM1.5383 from DM1.5235. Against the yen it closed at Y98.155 from Y96.8050. The dollar's bounce came amid evidence of increasing nervousness in the market that the currency might be close to the bottom. Sentiment remains negative, but investors are wary of being caught short. The D-Mark turned in a mixed performance in Europe, amid evidence that investors have used the currency's recent strength as an opportunity to take profits. The Belgian franc finished unchanged at BFr20.61 against the D-Mark after the central bank cut its central rate to 4.90 per cent from 4.95 per cent. This brought Belgian rates in line with German rates following a two basis point cut in the German repo rate to 4.91 per cent. The good inflation data in the US released yesterday and on Tuesday did not deter markets from working themselves into a frenzied lather of expectation about the Fed raising rates. Initial rumours involved a 50 basis point rise in the discount and Fed funds rates. The size of the likely increase later grew to 100 basis point. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, said the relatively modest bounce in the currency suggested the market was not altogether convinced by the rumours. But Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, said the bounce 'shows the market is slightly nervous about these levels. The lower we get, the more nervous the market gets.' Mr Cocker said there had been reasonable buying from a wide variety of sources, but underlying sentiment remained deeply negative towards the dollar. He said the dollar was enjoying a 'corrective rally' rather than a sustainable upward move. The Chemical analyst said the further rumour that the Fed was taking prices 'added to the sense in the market that the Fed is keen to stabilise the dollar now.' He said the rate of decline in the dollar on Tuesday had been approaching levels which central banks might have considered inappropriate. The German newspaper Handelsblatt, meanwhile, reported that 'sources in the US president's delegation let it be known on Tuesday that a consensus had been in Naples to accept a dollar level of Y96.98 or DM1.50 and (only) to intervene heavily below this level.' Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, said the sober performance in recent days of the D-Mark, against European crosses, was a 'possible early indicator that the bear market in Dollars /DM may have been overdone.' He said the 9 per cent fall in the dollar since the beginning of June was difficult to understand since all the explanations put forward - such as a large trade deficit and adverse capital flows - had been present all along. Mr Luxton said that if the Fed were to raise rates now, against a benign inflation background, this would be very well received by the market. It would show that the Fed was responding pro-actively to inflation - the market has worried that it has fallen 'behind the game' - and that it was not bowing to the Clinton White House which has made clear that it does not feel rates need to rise. Short sterling futures had a heady day after the release of better than expected retail prices inflation. It fell to 2.4 per cent in June from 2.5 per cent in May. Volumes were heavy, with the December contract trading nearly 55,000 lots to close 16 basis points up at 93.85. Analysts said the market was buoyant, with rates converging on the cash rates after a protracted period of extreme interest rate pessimism. A gilt auction at the end of the week, and the health of sterling, are the main obstacles to further advances. The sterling index closed slightly firmer at 79 from 78.8. The pound was slightly firmer against the D-Mark, at DM2.4089 from DM2.3958. It slipped slightly against the dollar to finish at Dollars 1.566 from Dollars 1.5725. The Bank of England provided Pounds 680 of late assistance to UK money markets after earlier forecasting a Pounds 850m shortage. The Bank had earlier provided Pounds 63m assistance. Overnight money traded between 4 1/2 and 7 per cent. German call money eased slightly to 4.90/5 per cent from 4.95/5.05 per cent after the Bundesbank sanctioned a two basis point decline in the repo rate to 4.91 per cent. With the small fall in the repo suggesting rates may be close to the bottom, euromark futures lost ground. The December contract closed at 95.05 from 95.09.</p>

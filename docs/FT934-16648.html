			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P upgrades Chrysler's debt CHRYSLER, the US carmaker, yesterday had its debt rating upgraded to investment grade from speculative by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. The move was foreshadowed in June, when S&amp;P placed Chrysler's double B plus senior debt rating on creditwatch with positive implications. Yesterday, S&amp;P raised its rating on Chrysler and its credit arm, Chrysler Financial Corporation, to triple B. The company had about Dollars 12.8bn in outstanding debt at the end of June. S&amp;P's action completes Chrysler's goal of cutting its borrowing costs. Moody's Investors Service last month lifted Chrysler's debt rating to investment grade. The higher grade allows Chrysler access to a broader investor base. It is particularly important for Chrysler Financial Corp, which borrows frequently in the bond markets. Chrysler has staged a dramatic financial recovery in recent years. S&amp;P praised the company's well-designed and fortuitously-timed new products, in addition to its improved operating efficiency. 'Management continues to demonstrate a conservative financial policy, lending confidence that the surplus cash generated in coming years will be used to further increase cash reserves and reduce debt, putting the company in a much better position to weather the next downturn,' the agency said. However, S&amp;P noted that Chrysler has a relatively thin product line and depends on a fiercely competitive market in North America. As a result, Chrysler's fortunes are expected to continue to fluctuate widely, 'limiting the potential for additional rating upgrades', S&amp;P said.</p>

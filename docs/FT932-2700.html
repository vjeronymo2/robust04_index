			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Good times keep rolling for junk bonds - The market's insatiable appetite for high-yield debt So far this year Dollars 23.7bn in new high-yield debt - junk bonds - has been issued in the US, putting the market on course to smash last year's record-breaking Dollars 38bn total. Although the mid-to-late 1980s are traditionally regarded as the heyday of junk bonds, the volume of high-yield debt coming to the market over the past 18 months has far exceeded anything seen when Mr Michael Milken, the one-time junk bond king of Drexel Burnham Lambert, was at the height of his powers. Companies have been queueing up to issue junk bonds and investors have been eager to buy them, rushing to get into high-yield debt because the returns have been so rewarding. In the past 18 months high-yield securities have outperformed most other leading asset groups. Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street securities house, says that its master index of high-yield debt achieved a total return of 18.2 per cent in 1992. In comparison, the Standard &amp; Poors' 500 index of leading US stocks returned 7.6 per cent last year, and 10-year US government securities returned 6.5 per cent. Junk bonds are also outstripping the opposition this year. In the first five months of 1993 Merrill's high-yield index posted a return of 8.4 per cent, against 4.5 per cent for the S&amp;P 500 and 6.1 per cent for 10-year government securities. The huge volume coming to the market has inevitably raised questions about how long the boom in junk bonds can last. And if the boom does end, will the market come crashing down as it did at the end of the 1980s? Fears of a sharp downward correction have intensified in recent months because of the pace of new issuance, and the willingness of investors to buy higher-risk debt from companies with very low debt ratings. At the same time, concern has grown that interest rates may be heading higher if the Federal Reserve is forced to tighten monetary policy to curb inflation. Rising interest rates would make junk bonds look less attractive compared with other assets, and if a number of low-rated issuers were to start defaulting on their paper because of the poor state of the economy, investors might stampede out of junk and into more secure assets, triggering a collapse in the high-yield market. This may be the worst-case scenario, but it has escaped no one's notice that similar conditions existed prior to the collapse in junk bond values at the end of the 1980s. Yet, Wall Street remains upbeat about the outlook for the junk bond market - which is not surprising, because securities firms and investment banks earn huge fees underwriting and selling high-yield debt. Much depends on the direction of interest rates. The key factor behind the boom in junk bonds has been the sharp decline in US interest rates over the past two years. To maintain their income stream, yield-sensitive investors were forced by falling rates to buy either longer-dated investment-grade debt, higher-yielding junk bonds, or stocks. Of the three categories, junk bonds benefited most from the huge inflows of investor cash. If the short-term rates rise, however, those inflows to the high-yield market will certainly slow, warns Mr Martin Fridson, head of high-yield research at Merrill Lynch. And if investors' appetite for high-yield debt shrinks, the number of companies issuing high-yield securities would also fall. How far and fast the market tumbles depends upon how far and fast interest rates rise. He believes that as long as any rise in short-term interest rates is modest, a dramatic slump in the high-yield market is unlikely. The only event that could shatter the junk boom would have to be so calamitous that it would probably wreak havoc on other asset groups as well. Mr Fridson is optimistic, however. He says. 'I don't see anything out there that would cause the high-yield market to collapse that would not also affect equity and long-term bond markets.' An analyst at another big Wall Street firm says the same thing: 'I don't see a reason, unique to the market, for a pull-back.' Most analysts do not believe that comparisons between the current market and 1989 are valid. Four years ago one of the key problems was the growing share of the market taken up by relatively small (under Dollars 100m) issues of very low-rated debt - the category of debt that is the least liquid and the most likely to default. Although more small, low-rated issues have been coming to the market in the past year, Mr Fridson says this is not particularly worrying, because what matters is not the absolute number of low-rated small issues, but their dollar share of the overall market, which is still low by historical standards. Between 1987 and 1988, 60 per cent of the junk market was taken up by the high-risk category of low-rated debt issues. Last year, that share was only 15 per cent, and in the first five months of this year it has fallen further to 10 per cent. The number of high-risk issues may have been rising, but they have been far outnumbered by the volume of better-quality debt coming to the market, says Mr Fridson. 'Overall, this is still a pretty conservative market.' Ms Diane Vazza, director of high-yield research at the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors, agrees. She says that credit quality has improved considerably over the past two years and the recent surge in small, first-time issuers has done little to undermine that improvement. Also, for the junk bond market to collapse, issuers would have to start defaulting on their debt. Yet, default rates are currently running at low levels. The rate peaked in 1991 when 10.7 per cent of high-yield issues defaulted. By last year, however, it had fallen to 5.9 per cent. This year, the market looks even more stable, says Ms Vazza. In the first five months of 1993 there have been only four defaults of high-yield corporate debt, representing Dollars 300m of a market total of Dollars 200bn. Ms Vazza says: 'We expect the default rate this year to be down dramatically from 1992.'</p>

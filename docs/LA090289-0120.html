			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE BLOCKS PRINTING OF TAX MEASURE BALLOT ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> A judge Friday blocked the printing of ballot documents both supporting and  opposing the proposed countywide half-cent sales tax for transportation  projects, ruling that more time is needed to sort out mutual charges of  inaccuracy.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore set a hearing for Friday to take up both  sides' complaints.  </P> <P> Under the law, all registered voters in Orange County must receive a pamphlet  before the Nov. 7 general election and it must include written arguments for  and against all measures on the ballot.  </P> <P> Dana Reed, the treasurer of Citizens for Measure M, the group supporting the  tax, filed the lawsuit seeking a court order directing county election  officials to remove allegedly false statements from the ballot argument against  the measure.  </P> <P> Reed targeted a claim that approval of the sales tax would lead to "massive  indebtedness" of "$18 billion, plus interest" because the county would be able  to borrow more with the new revenue. He said that a public utilities code  limits bond indebtedness to $3.1 billion.  </P> <P> The tax would raise $3.1 billion for highway and transportation projects over  the next 20 years.  </P> <P> On Friday, Russell Burkett, a named defendant in Reed's suit, filed papers  alleging in turn that endorsements contained in the ballot arguments by  supporters are misleading.  </P> <P> Proponents listed the names of nine persons supporting the proposal. Four are  identified with the names of organizations with which they have been  affiliated.  </P> <P> Burkett contended that the tactic suggests "that the organizations have  themselves endorsed Measure M." He said that the law requires a signed consent  of the organization be included in the ballot statement, and that none had  filed such a consent.  </P> <P> Bruce Nestande, the chairman of Citizens for Yes on M, said such listings used  were meant as descriptions of what the people do, not necessarily an  endorsement by the groups .  </P> <P> "Under no conditions do we feel that this is misleading at all," he said. "It's  a description of what these people do in life. It was not meant that these  organizations endorsed it."  </P> <P> In dispute are the listings of: Randy Goodwin, former executive director,  Howard Jarvis Tax Reduction Movement; Audrey Redfearn, chair, Democratic  Foundation of Orange County; Charlotte Mousel, Republican national  committeewoman; and Bob Balgenorth, executive secretary, Orange County Building  Trades Council, AFL-CIO.  </P> <P> Cynthia Hanna, the executive director of the Democratic Foundation, said her  organization endorsed the sales tax Aug. 27, but didn't file papers with the  county's registrar of voters.  </P> <P> Greg Haskin, the executive director of the Republican Party of Orange County,  said the Republican National Committee had not taken a position on the tax and  probably would not.  </P></p>

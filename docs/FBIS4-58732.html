			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] Secretary  General Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid expressed his deep satisfaction and  welcoming of the signing in Cairo of the agreement between the  PLO and Israel on the implementation of the agreement on  transitional self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    In a statement today, he said that this agreement was an  important turning point in the history of the Palestinian people  and a decisive step in the course of its just struggle, during  which immense sacrifices were made toward the achievement of its  legitimate rights including the right to return, the right to  self determination, and the setting up of its independent  Palestinian state on its national territory with Jerusalem as  its capital.    The secretary general welcomed the courageous and wise steps  taken by the PLO under the leadership of His Excellency  President Yasir 'Arafat in defense of the proud Palestinian  people's rights and interests during this stage of hard talks.    Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid stressed the Muslim nation's fundamental  and constant support of the Palestinian people in its fight to  regain its basic national rights.    He called on the international community to provide all  forms  of support to the Palestinian people during this historic period  of constructing and developing its vital utilities and  infrastructure and its national social and economic institutions  as the fundamental pillars for its national authority on its  land, thus bolstering security and stability in the region.    The ICO secretary general praised the efforts made by all  parties to the peace process that contributed toward achieving  this agreement, particularly the efforts made by Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak in this regard as well as the peace  process cosponsors, the United States and Russia. He called on  them to continue their efforts in order to achieve tangible  progress on all other Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese peace  tracks in a way that will guarantee a full Israeli withdrawal  from all occupied Arab territories and the establishment of a  comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on the basis of  international legitimacy.</p>

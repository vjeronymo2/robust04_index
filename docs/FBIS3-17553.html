He said that Ukraine is short of money for fully-fledged  cooperation with NATO. However, the participation of one or two  representatives of the Ukrainian general staff is possible in  planning training operations.    Grechanynov said that Ukraine's involvement in peace-keeping  operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina effectively means participation  in the Partnership for Peace program.    A NATO delegation stayed in Ukraine for several days. It  studied possible practical steps for cooperation with NATO. The  delegation met the chief of Ukrainian general staff Anatoliy  Lopata and Deputy Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk.</p>

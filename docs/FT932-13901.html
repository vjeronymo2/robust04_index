			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price starts improvement ABITIBI-PRICE reined back losses in its first quarter, helped by a strengthening newsprint market and tight cost controls. The loss from continuing operations was CDollars 28.8m (USDollars 22.9m), or 42 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 37.9m, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 471m, against a restated CDollars 379m. 'Though we are not yet profitable, we have shown the first year-over-year improvement in quarterly results of our core newsprint business since 1988,' said Mr Ronald Oberlander, president. Mr Oberlander told the annual meeting in Toronto he expected results 'to pick up steam quarter by quarter in 1993'. Rising newsprint demand was based on advertising gains in the eastern US, and a build-up in inventories - partly due to fears of stoppages in eastern Canada mills. Abitibi's shipments to Europe came up against Scandinavian competition following last year's devaluations, but Asian and Latin American markets were firm. The office products division posted higher sales and operating profit in the US and Europe.</p>

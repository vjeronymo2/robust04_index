			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> STORY STRUGGLES TO RECONCILE MEXICAN, U.S VALUES  </P> <P> The first element one expects to be struck by in "Simply Maria, or the American  Dream" is that it is the work of a young playwright, Josefina Lopez, who was  only 17 when she sent the play to the California Young Playwrights Project two  years ago.  </P> <P> How delightful then to find that this one-act play, as seen in a KPBS-TV  production, is a touching tale of a young girl's struggle to reconcile her  traditional Mexican values with America. The play has rough edges, both in  production and writing, but an unmistakably strong -- and often funny -- voice  clearly comes through.  </P> <P> Frankly autobiographical, "Simply Maria," a co-production by Sarah Luft of  KPBS-TV and Deborah Salzer of the playwrights project, tackles the marriage of  her parents and the lessons they try to impart in brief vignettes that move  swiftly from reality to fantasy. To be a good Mexican girl, must Maria marry  and have children just like her mother? As an American girl, isn't she entitled  to compete and explore and have adventures? And can she be a hybrid, a  hyphenated Mexican-American, walking a tightrope between two cultures, without  compromising herself?  </P> <P> What saves Lopez's strong, feminist message from being didactic is her biting  sense of humor and her style, as witnessed in a wedding scene. The priest asks  the woman a long litany of questions, including, "Do you promise to love him  even if he beats you and in return ask for nothing?" and ends with "You may pet  the bride."  </P> <P> Lopez's courage in following the furthest reaches of her own imagination is her  strength. Her creation of three female figures, who serve a variety of roles  from Greek chorus to Maria's inner and outer voices, is inspired. Her flaw is  that she does not focus more attention on her central character.  </P> <P> Then, too, her youth shows in the groping way in which she tries to deal with  passion.  </P> <P> If we could see more of Maria's tenderness in her relations with her parents or  the Mexican boy she fantasizes as marrying, the conflict in her heart would be  more deeply affecting.  </P> <P> The direction by Luis Torner and Donn Johnson keeps things flowing nicely.  There is an innocence to the unpolished but earnest acting by the ensemble -- a  simplicity matched by Beeb Salzer's utilitarian set design. Amy Jacobson's  performance as Maria stands out in its exploration of the painful shadows  lurking under the role. Lawrence Czoka's sound design weaves in a subtle, but  unmistakably Mexican flavor.  </P> <P> The playwrights project, which encourages young writers to express themselves,  could not have found a better ambassador than Lopez, who seems so utterly  unafraid to say what she thinks. One moment she attacks Mexican machismo, in  the next she guns down America in a scene in which Maria's father is sneaking  into the country. While the Statue of Liberty smiles beneficently on some  immigrants, it is quite a different story as she turns her torch into a  spotlight in an attempt to stop Maria's father from entering the United States.  </P> <P> Despite Lopez's complaints with her father, they have something in common --  there is no stopping her, either.  </P></p>

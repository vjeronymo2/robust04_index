			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Poll date virtually rules out June general election - Monmouth by-election A JUNE general election has been virtually ruled out by senior Conservatives, the party indicated yesterday when the government announced that the Monmouth by-election will be on May 16. By moving the writ in the Commons for a contest just two weeks after the May 2 local elections, the Conservatives signalled that they were hoping for a swift campaign with minimal political damage. The decision does not completely rule out a general election in June or July but, if the government had intended that, the by-election would probably have been delayed until the rest of the country went to the polls. The Tories have selected Mr Roger Evans, a 44-year-old barrister, to contest the poll, which follows the death of Sir John Stradling-Thomas, a former Tory deputy chief whip. Labour, which came second in the Monmouth poll in 1987, hopes to mount an effective challenge as a springboard for the general election. Mr Peter Mandelson, former director of campaigns, has been brought in as a campaign adviser and is expected to take a significant role in directing the party's campaign. A poll by BBC Wales suggests Labour is starting the contest with 41 per cent of the vote, against 39 per cent for the Tories. The party's candidate is Mr Huw Edwards, a 38-year-old lecturer. A senior Liberal Democrat official said the contest 'has all the ingredients of another Ribble Valley', but the BBC Wales poll gave the party just 16 per cent. Its candidate is Ms Frances David, a 57-year-old school teacher. 1987 election: Conservatives, 22,387. Labour, 13,037. SDP/Alliance, 11,313. Plaid Cymru, 363. Conservative majority: 9,350.</p>

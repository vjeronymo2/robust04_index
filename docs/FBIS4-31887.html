			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 15 June (MTI) -- Hungarian Ambassador to  the United States Pal Tar has sent his letter of resignation to  Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky. In the letter, the  ambassador pointed out that he had accepted the honorable  position three years ago, at the request of the Antall  government; however, his term has ended with the elections in  Hungary.    In his reply, the Foreign Minister said he understands and  acknowledges the reasons for the resignation, and he accepts it.  The resignation comes into effect on July 5, 1994, until which  time the ambassador will continue to perform his official duties.    The cabinet chief of the Foreign Ministry, Ferenc Oberfrank,  commenting on the resignation, told MTI that although there have  been no precedents over the last years for an active ambassador  to resign, a decision of this kind cannot be termed exceptional  in a well-operating democracy. Steps of this kind, when someone  decides he can no longer identify with the new situation, or  does not wish to continue on in the position, are very honorable  in democratic, law-governed states, the cabinet chief pointed  out.    Oberfrank said that while he is not aware of other diplomats  considering similar steps, this cannot be excluded. The natural  rotation schedule of ambassadors will mean that some two dozen  ambassadors will end their tours. New ambassadors were  appointed in greater numbers in 1990, at the time of the change  in system, but there were relatively few political appointees  among them.    Ambassadors usually spend four years in their posts, but  they  can essentially be called back at any time. When Ambassador  Tar's resignation takes effect, the senior diplomat in line  after him will take over the embassy as charge d'affaires ad  interim until a new ambassador is appointed.</p>

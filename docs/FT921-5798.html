			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Ashdown force advances on main parties' flanks: Lib Dem hopes of battle honours THE Liberal Democrats are in confident mood. As the war of attrition between the two main parties has churned the electoral landscape into a muddy battlefield Mr Paddy Ashdown's third force has begun to advance. Its gains are so far undramatic but the lesson for its more powerful Conservative and Labour rivals has been that they cannot afford to ignore their flanks. For the first few weeks of the year, opinion-poll support for the Liberal Democrats seemed stuck at around 15 per cent - enough to ensure the party's survival at the general election but presaging the loss of perhaps a third of its 22 seats at Westminster. Since early February that support has picked up steadily, and in the latest batch of polls stands at 18 per cent. Awkward publicity about Mr Ashdown's personal life appears to have helped rather than hindered the party. His ratings rival those of Mr John Major and remain far ahead of those of Mr Neil Kinnock. So the party's claim that its vote on polling day will be more than 20 per cent no longer looks incredible. On present form it should keep most, if not all, of its seats. The early start to election campaigning has provided the Liberal Democrats with the oxygen of publicity, bringing forward the traditional pre-election 'lift' in third-party support. The intensely negative strategies of his rivals meanwhile have left Mr Ashdown the beneficiary of an unusually strong 'plague on both your houses' factor. Disenchanted with slanging matches, voters have been impressed by the way the Liberal Democrats' have stood above the fray. Party strategists argue that an emphasis on policy - in particular on setting out the case for constitutional reform, on plans for economic recovery and on the need for higher education spending - has generated a more positive appeal. The result is what the strategists see as a virtuous circle. Liberal Democrats thrive on publicity. Strong opinion poll ratings - and the guarantee in the campaign proper of near-parity of television coverage - provide the exposure which again boosts those ratings. But Mr Ashdown cannot afford to be complacent. During much of last year the Liberal Democrats prospered at the expense of Labour as Mr Major's popularity eroded the strong lead which Labour had built up towards the end of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's leadership. The general assumption was that the resultant split in the opposition vote would keep Mr Major in Downing Street. More recently, however, the Liberal Democrats have taken votes from the Conservatives as 'soft' supporters of the government have reacted to the deepening economic gloom. The risk is that the third-party vote will be hit by the traditional two-party squeeze. The threat of a Labour victory might encourage a shift back to the Conservatives. Those determined to remove the government might judge that a vote for Mr Kinnock is the only option. Liberal Democrat leaders are aware of the threat. Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign director, has drawn up a strategy designed to confront the 'wasted vote' charge. The constant refrain will be that in two-thirds of Conservative-held seats, the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour provide the main challenge. It will gloss over the fact that most of those constituencies are Tory strongholds rather than vulnerable marginals. By setting out clearly the party's conditions in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Ashdown hopes to avoid the confusion which dogged the Liberal-SDP Alliance campaign in 1987. He is determined to escape in advance the blame for a second election. It will not be easy. For now, Mr Ashdown can content himself with opinion-poll findings showing that the electorate's disenchantment with the Conservatives is matched by its mistrust of Labour. His fear must be that, in the end, the voters might be more horrified still at the prospect of a hung parliament.</p>

This idea has undergone a marked evolution in Meshkov  himself in recent weeks -- from abrasive statements about  secession from Ukraine to prudence, a phased approach, and  reasonableness in everything concerning the peninsula' future.    In this regard some people are already talking about Yuriy  Meshkov's repudiation of basic points in his manifesto -- the  Crimea's return to the ruble zone, the granting of the right of  dual citizenship to the republic's citizens, and the lifting of  the moratorium on a referendum on the status of Crimea. Some  people regard this as a move away from the fundamental line of  rapprochment with Russia and a tentative move toward Ukraine.  But these unduly categorical and overstraightforward judgments  do not match up to reality. He is not repudiating his manifesto  and its basic points. Meshkov is simply acting as a  level-headed, prudent politician occupying a centrist position  rather than swinging in one or the other directon.    "I am not an advocate of conflict between the Crimea and  Ukraine," Meshkov told journalists recently. "I am an advocate  of maintaining and developing our prevailing links with Russia  and other CIS countries. The process of acquiring autonomy is  not something you accomplish in a day. It is a long process of  negotiation. Moreover, Crimea's autonomy has to be supported by  the people of the peninsula in a referendum."    The stance of the Crimea's first president on military  questions is as follows: In addition to Black Sea Fleet units,  a considerable number of Ukrainian ground troops are stationed  in the Crimea; in this regard the Crimea will as an autonomous  republic propose to Russia and Ukraine the demilitarization of  the Crimea, with its defense secured as part of the  Commonwealth's collective security system.    According to Meshkov, it is essential to maintain in the  Crimea on a treaty basis only the Russian Black Sea Fleet base,  border subunits, and the air defense system. Citizens of the  peninsula should perform their military service exclusively in  the Crimea, with service outside the Crimea solely on a contract  basis. While in the future compulsory military service is to be  abolished. Crimea does not need its own army apart from a small  republic guard. As far as Sevastopol is concerned, Meshkov's  opinion is that it forms an inalienable part of the Crimea and  should remain the Russian Black Sea Fleet's main base.</p>

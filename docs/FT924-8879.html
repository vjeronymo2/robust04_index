			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony With Alexander Lazarev in charge, the BBC Symphony transmitted Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony with singular power on Thursday, to a Festival Hall audience arranged in the ideal way: all eagerly crowded around the platform, front and sides, as close as numbers permitted. Never mind the rows of empty seats at the back of the Terrace, and in the Grand Tier (thrifty music-lovers know that every BBC concert will sooner or later be broadcast in digital stereo); the BBC's new pricing-policy - a flat Pounds 9 for any seat, all unreserved - has secured a heartening result. Too many South Bank and Barbican concerts find themselves with little strips of audience in the Stalls, arranged according to disposable income (or pecking-order within a corporate patron) and insulated by unoccupied gaps, while the cheaper seats far away may be crammed full. Along with Valery Gergiev, whom we know so far chiefly in opera, Lazarev - now the BBC's Principal Guest Conductor - is the happiest discovery among the newer Russian maestros. This Shostakovich Fourth was superbly prepared (the BBC Symphony, swollen for the occasion, on their best form - a serious compliment these days) and enacted with knife-edge dramatic sense. The composer finished it in 1936, after his popular triumph with Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk had been curdled by Stalin and Zhdanov's disapproval. That was a crisis-point. It can be no accident that the Finale is so restless and distracted, where his original intentions promised something more incisively confident; nor that the lingering, frozen coda is so fraught with passive foreboding. Willy-nilly, the Fourth became Shostakovich's first large-scale exercise in compromise and concealment. Yet it tingles with compositional vitality, which Lazarev rendered in vivid colours (including the strangest, most haunted ones) and tautly ordered succession. Even the best digital stereo cannot have captured the full force of this searching performance. Before it Ida Haendel played Britten's Violin Concerto with her usual grace and flawless musicianship. In her silver-age years, she is becoming as much of a prodigy again as at the precocious start of her career. The Concerto remains the product of a fluently gifted young composer (he was 26, newly self-exiled to America) with no pressing urge to write one thing rather than another. The piece parades a lot of wry, ingenious detail without an overriding purpose. There is no particular reason why Lazarev should feel any special sympathy for it, but he did it proud: I don't remember any previous performance in which Britten's inventions have sounded so red-blooded and buoyant.</p>

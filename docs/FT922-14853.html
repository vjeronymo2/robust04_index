			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities easier after volatile session A RELATIVELY steady perf-ormance by sterling and modest gains in gilt-edged stocks helped to underpin a fragile equity market still liable to lurch sharply in either direction in response to opinion polls. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index settled 3.2 off at 2,405.4, having swung from positive to negative territory during another active trading session dominated by a further batch of big placings and a flurry of small programme trades. Dealers were encouraged by the level of activity in the market which, although less than on Wednesday, when volume was the highest so far this year, remained well above average daily levels during the first quarter. Turnover yesterday amounted to 607.2m shares, compared with the previous day's 701.6m, and was boosted considerably by sizeable placings of shares in BP and BET. There was also evidence, according to traders, of exceptionally large selling pressure related to end of the tax year considerations. Dealers also mentioned talk of hefty 'bed and breakfast' activity, selling of 'Peps' and suggestions of sizeable selling by company directors linked to worries about the increased possibility of a Labour victory in next Thursday's general election. At the outset of trading, marketmakers, relieved that the latest opinion polls indicated a much tighter outcome than the polls of the previous session, hoisted their opening levels and drew in 'cheap' buyers, pushing the Footsie up to the day's peak of 2,424.1 within minutes of the opening. But mid-morning saw several large blocks of shares come on offer. These tended to cause temporary disruption in the market, as did the programme trades. Turnover tended to fall away during the afternoon, in spite of hints that an opinion poll published today would show Labour leading the Conservatives by four points. The Footsie drifted off to post a 14.5 net decline before stabilising and ending marginally down on balance. The late rally was stimulated by Wall Street. A host of individual features emerged from the market. Fisons, the pharmaceuticals/ chemicals group, moved sharply higher following the appointment of a new chief executive and the re-emergence of stories that Medeva, the fast-expanding pharmaceuticals concern, may be preparing a bid for the company. Vodafone shares gave a ready response to a handful of buy recommendations, notably from Henderson Crosthwaite and Lehman Brothers, highlighting the first signs of a pick-up in new subscribers for cellular radios. Redland's results were also given a warm welcome by the market. Equity strategists remained extremely cautious on the short-term outlook for the market. Kleinwort Benson's strategy team, in their April Market Outlook, said that either an outright Tory or Labour win, along with a recovery in the US economy and an upturn in UK earnings, should push the Footsie into new high ground by the end of the year. Election worries produced more strong support for big overseas earners such as Reuters, RTZ and BAT Industries.</p>

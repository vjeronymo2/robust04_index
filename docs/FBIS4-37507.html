			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "The Israeli Aspect of the </F> Korean Crisis"]    [Text] In his testimony to Congress, the deputy director  of the CIA warned that if North Korea comes out of the  confrontation over the development of nuclear weapons with the  upper hand, it would pose a threat to Israel and Europe. But  this crisis has an Israeli angle no matter what happens. Even  if we assume that a solution would be found to the crisis, and  Pyongyang renounces nuclear weapons and meets the terms for  outside supervision, for Israel it would mean that the time is  approaching when the international community would insist that  it join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The club of  states suspected of developing nuclear weapons will be reduced,  and it is only natural that there will be an effort to cut it  back even further prior to the treaty's renewal in 1995.    Israel is unlike North Korea in every way, but on that issue  it might look like an obstacle to an improved world order, and  that would make it more difficult for Israel to explain why the  time has still not come to join the treaty when it is renewed  next year.    The Korean crisis must teach Israel one other thing: That  small states cannot cut themselves off from the NPT as they  please even if they have good reasons for doing so. The current  treaty says that each signatory state has the right to pull out  after giving three-months notice of its intention, which is what  North Korea did. Yet North Korea found that it had joined a  club that includes ties to a Catholic marriage, which does not  recognize divorce. An attempt to withdraw from the treaty for  any reason could bring sanctions and even a military  confrontation with the international community. There is a  difference between somebody suspected of possessing nuclear  weapons, but is not a signatory to the treaty, and somebody  suspected of violating the treaty, the policy toward the latter  being much tougher.    A North Korean victory in the current struggle would  complicate matters greatly for the international community, but  for Israel it could end with a direct threat. The threat does  not come directly from North Korea. The immediate circle  affected would be the Far East. North Korea's neighbors would  find it hard to go on with normal business while its radical  neighbor arms itself with nuclear weapons. In Japan, which has  large quantities of plutonium, the demand to develop nuclear  weapons despite its troubled past would swell. The same is true  for South Korea and Taiwan. Regional stability would be  undermined, something China also fears.    The second circle to be affected is made up of states like  Iran and Iraq, and perhaps also Algeria in the future. If  Washington fails in its stand off with Pyongyang, why should  Tehran be put off developing nuclear weapons, and why should  Saddam Husayn not go back to his old plan after sanctions are  lifted on Iraq? It is only natural that Tehran and Baghdad have  a direct interest in what is currently happening in the Korean  peninsula. Washington therefore views the conflict as a  confrontation over world order and not only as an attempt to  restrain the North Korean regime.    The danger to Israel also derives from the possibility of  Korean aid to others developing nuclear weapons and the sale of  vital components. There can always be a negative precedent,  especially when so much money is involved. There is no need to  sell a nuclear bomb, it is sufficient merely to accelerate the  development stage, and there is surely somebody prepared to pay  huge amounts for that. North Korea has already made a major  breakthrough in the field of surface-to-surface missiles (in  Syria, Iran, and previously in Egypt) and we should not rule out  the possibility that could also take place in the nuclear field.    There is an impression that none of the players, direct or  indirect, in the Korean crisis want war. They all want to  achieve their aims without using force, and this includes North  Korea. South Korea is in a very sensitive position. If war  breaks out it would be conducted on its soil. The capital Seoul  is located some 32 km from the border. Some 16 million South  Koreans live in the northern part of the country and if North  Korean divisions invade there would be huge damage, and from  their viewpoint, it does not matter if the North is finally  defeated. Japan and China also do not want a military solution  to the crisis.    South Korean intelligence says that the Pyongyang regime is  expected to collapse sooner or later due to the economic crisis  and the north's isolation from the international community. The  Americans respond by saying: What would happen if North Korea  manages to produce nuclear weapons before the downfall of its  ruler? Will it then be possible to return the nuclear genie back  into the bottle? It seems that U.S. intelligence nevertheless  lacks complete information on what the North Koreans have  already achieved. What they have is the report that the north  has a certain quantity of plutonium and that tests have already  been conducted on detonators for nuclear weapons.    From Washington's point of view, it is a race against time  and its tactics toward the crisis are largely derived from that.  The goal is to achieve the aims as soon as possible without  sparking a general conflagration. It is clear that North Korea  is trying to gain time thereby increasing the suspicion that it  wants to be armed with nuclear weapons should war break out; or,  it hopes to manage to satisfactorily hide such weapons before it  is forced to sign the NPT and accept international supervision.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Trelleborg vice-president to head Esselte MR BO LUNDQUIST, executive vice-president at the Swedish mining and industrial group Trelleborg, will become president and chief executive of Esselte, the office products company, writes John Burton in Stockholm. His appointment follows the decision last month by Mr Rune Andersson, the Trelleborg chairman, to head the Esselte board of directors. He also acquired an option for a 21 per cent voting stake, which would make him the biggest shareholder, through his private company Gettinge Intressenter. Esselte's new leadership yesterday emphasised that there were no plans for Trelleborg to become directly involved in the troubled office products group. Mr Kjell Nilsson, Trelleborg president, declined an invitation to join the Esselte board to underline this. Mr Lundquist denied speculation that Mr Andersson planned to break up the company and sell its divisions to gain quick returns from his investment.</p>

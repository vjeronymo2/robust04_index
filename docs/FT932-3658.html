			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Gardening: A climactic year of marvellous muddle - As his garden rapidly blossoms, Robin Lane Fox is already planning his strategy for late summer FLOWERS have run riot and gardens are on an all-time high. I cannot remember such a year or such a week. If you dither you will miss it, like all such peaks, and will end up wondering what it all meant. Quite simply, everything has come to a climax at once and I have never seen the equal in 35 years' hard gardening. In the old Tory heartlands, gardens used to peak between June 20 and July 10. The heartlands are becoming wetlands, but the change is not the reason why the calendar has been brought forward. A cold, wet May delayed plants which had been brought to the threshold by the mild winter and favourable spring. The recent sunshine has been like a trigger, setting off the late-comers and bringing the front-runners into early flower so that both have collided. I see the evidence all along the big double borders of my Oxford college. These are meant to span three phases but have run at least two of them into a single, unprecedented show. Against the background of annual examinations and academic stress, I have been walking contentedly down clouds of blue catmint, delayed pink and white lupins, double white peonies, retarded abutilons, accelerated mauve buddleas, clouds of pale purple thalictrum, and day lillies which are a month ahead of themselves. Among this extraordinary collision, there are irregularities which I do not pretend to understand. Almost all of the old-fashioned roses have burst into hundreds of flowers about three weeks before their usual date, while the wild species seem to have obeyed their calendar and gone no faster than in a normal season. We have the extraordinary sight of midsummer roses - like the wonderful pink Fantin Latour and the best of the pink and white albas - in full flower beside the neat little clusters of Scots Burnet rose bushes which are usually the prelude to the heavy French varieties later this month. Meanwhile, the modern bush roses and hybrid teas seem to be following their usual rhythm. Is it, perhaps, that the old-fashioned varieties appreciate a mild winter and have been brought into full bud by the first adequately wet spring for three years? I cannot see other good reasons for the difference. Meanwhile, the simultaneous show ought to be recorded in photographs. I have never seen the old-fashioned forms of dianthus flowering profusely beneath peonies which usually are associated with late May. Buddleias look remarkably chic among dark blue anchusas which have been having a field day among their new neighbours, the border campanulas of normal July. My personal prize at home goes to a phygelius in full flower among the silver-leaved saxifrages of late May, with layers of late June's campanulas to keep the peace between them. It is like a dream and, even on the edge of the thunderstorms, I cannot stop marvelling at it. Climactic years bring problems with them, though. Traditionally, garden tours and foreign visitors aim at late June or early July for the great southern rose gardens like Sissinghurst and Mottisfont. If you have the option, bring forward the visit to this weekend and next, because the roses will have raced before you if you stick to the normal schedule. As for colour planning, this season is making a marvellous muddle for all the experts as well as the increasing flood of books on the subject since publishers fastened on to it a few years ago. Those charts and diagrams which suggest the right combinations have been thrown out of order by a simple trick of the weather. If you are setting out on a new garden, and feeling unnerved by experts' insistence that particular flowers should be matched only with particular varieties, remember that 1993 has turned the experts' suggestions inside out and that nature has brought on its own combinations, usually for the best. Oxford borders are enjoying rather more of a Blue Period than I had intended, but I cannot say that premature nature has altogether ruined the result. Be sure to see this extraordinary climax in a great garden, somewhere; but what, though, when it is all over? We need to look two months ahead, because July will be an early hiatus and we cannot leave August to become a dead brown flop. Thereafter, I will be using groups of blue, autumn-flowering crocus, on offer from the best bulb merchants until late July. Meanwhile, it is no use relying on retarded bedding plants from most of the main shops. Annual bedding plants are far ahead of their old rhythm and there is not much of quality which has not been brought on and sold off already. Instead, I am relying on cuttings and young plants of half-hardy perennials which have more staying power and which can even be bought as late as the Hampton Court flower show on July 5 and 6 without being too far behind to make a serious show in late August. I am referring to the daisy-flowered osteospermums, scented heliotropes, bits of pink diascia, fragments of shrubby salvia, and other soft plantings which companies such as Hopleys, Brian Hiley and Rushfields of Ledbury bring to the summer shows and sell off to those with an eye for quick quality. Give our gardens the slightest whiff of Maastricht and they seem to make a continental dash for early growth. Over there in Europe, southern gardens have to use the tactic of late summer perennials, bedded out in a second sequence during late June. Now that we are going European in our seasons, and the boring old calendar has lost its sovereignty, we will have to react to this new paradise by adopting these secondary tricks and extending our season by cunning.</p>

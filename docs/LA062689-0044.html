			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> JONES WINS IN CANADA AS BURROUGHS FALTERS  </P> <P> Steve Jones became the first three-time winner on the PGA Tour this year, but  he didn't win the Canadian Open golf championship at Oakville, Canada, as much  as Clark Burroughs lost it.  </P> <P> Jones, who won the first two tournaments of 1989, caught Burroughs on the 16th  hole and passed him with a birdie on the 17th. He finished with a final round  of two-under-par 70 and a 72-hole score of 271 on the Glen Abbey Golf Club  course in Ontario, winning by two strokes.  </P> <P> "To win, I thought I'd have to play better than I did," Jones said.  </P> <P> Jones trailed most of the day but made his move on the last three holes with  some help from Burroughs, who was in contention for the first time in his  three-year tour career. Burroughs missed putts on the last three holes.  </P> <P> "Three putts," he said after a final-round 74. "Four feet, eight feet, six  feet. Yip, yip, yip. My hands were shaking on the short putts. That's where I  lost the tournament, on the greens."  </P> <P> Burroughs was tied at 273 with Mike Hulbert, who shot a 64, and Mark  Calcavecchia, who had a 69.  </P> <P> Jim Dent sank a short eagle putt on the 17th hole to overtake Dick Hendrickson  and win the $300,000 MONY Senior tournament at Syracuse, N.Y.  </P> <P> Dent overcame a five-stroke deficit to win $45,000.  </P> <P> It was the first PGA victory for Dent, who was winless in 18 years on the  regular tour. He joined the Senior PGA Tour last month.  </P> <P> Dent, 50, of St. Petersburg, Fla., shot an eight-under-par 64 final-round for a  54-hole total of 201.  </P> <P> Hendrickson, the leader after each of the first two rounds with consecutive  66s, finished at 203 after a 71.  </P> <P> Hendrickson, who bogeyed the final hole, slipped into third place behind Al  Geiberger, who closed with a 63 for a 202 total.  </P> <P> Betsy King passed third-round leader Shirley Furlong and won the LPGA  McDonald's Championship at Wilmington, Del., by shooting a four-under-par 67.  </P> <P> King, who overcame a six-shot deficit over the final 16 holes with her  six-birdie, two-bogey performance, finished with a 72-hole total of 272 for her  fourth victory of the year. She earned $82,500 and moved ahead of Nancy Lopez  into first place on the 1989 money-winning list with $365,986.  </P> <P> Furlong, who led by four shots after three rounds, struggled to a 73 and  finished tied with Pat Bradley for second place at 274. Bradley, the LPGA's  all-time leading money-winner, shot a 68.  </P> <P> Pearl Sinn of Bellflower won her second consecutive U.S. Women's Amateur Public  Links title at Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old 1988 U.S. Amateur champion defeated Kelli Akers of French Lick,  Ind., 2 and 1.  </P> <P> Sinn said she plans to turn professional today.  </P> <P> Buz Greene, Craig Steinberg and Paul Mohler led the South team past the North,  4 1/2-1 1/2 in the opening event of the 78th California Golf Assn. Amateur  Championship at Pebble Beach.  </P> <P> Individual play begins today.  </P></p>

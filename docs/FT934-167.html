			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: German brewery invests in Bulgarian group Brau und Brunnen, the German brewery, is paying DM4.112m (Dollars 2.42m) for a 67 per cent stake in Kamenitza, one of Bulgaria's leading breweries, in the first substantial foreign investment in Bulgaria's brewing sector. Up to 20 per cent of the shares have been offered to employees in compliance with Bulgaria's privatisation laws. Under the contract, the Dortmund-based holding company has to make an additional investment of at least DM3.8m within two years. The company will continue to manufacture and market the Kamenitza brand for the next three years at least, and will start producing Schultheiss beer under licence for the domestic market and export. The brewery's current annual production of 33m litres will be doubled in two years. Mr Michael Brenscheidt, Brau und Brunnen's executive director, said the acquisition was another step in the group's long-term strategy.</p>

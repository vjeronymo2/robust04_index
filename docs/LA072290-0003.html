			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK MURDERS  </P> <P> Betty Broderick is a pathetic, vindictive and psychotic ex-wife who deserves to  be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, including the death penalty.  </P> <P> Not a soul should shed a tear for this cold-blooded and deranged killer. The  only sympathy I feel is for her badgered and verbally abused children, who bore  the brunt of her tantrums over the years.  </P> <P> Dan and Linda Broderick were never allowed to begin their new life together.  And Betty stands to pay the price.  </P> <P> BRIAN J. BANCROFT  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

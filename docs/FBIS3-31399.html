Pawlak stressed the need for Poland's increased effort to  join western structures, and above all for intensified strivings  for NATO and the EU membership. He also discussed the question  of Poland's participation in the "Partnership for Peace"  programme.    The prime minister confirmed in the presence of the  ambassadors the Polish Government's guarantees for western  investors and assured that the government would respect any  agreements that were or will be concluded with them.    Foreign Minister Olechowski told newsmen that the two-day  session of Polish diplomats will centre on the question of  Poland's security and her closer contacts with the European  Union which are crucial elements of the Polish foreign policy  which the ambassadors attending the meeting will frequently have  to deal with.    According to Olechowski, the meeting should help the  ambassadors learn about the approach of the "state's top  figures" to the problems of foreign policy. The foreign  minister also said he expected information from the ambassadors  on the existing possibilities in Poland's contacts with western  countries.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BT wanted The spotlight was turned on BT shares at the outset of trading as the market reacted firstly, and crucially, to news of a significant price war initiative whereby BT intends cutting the cost of weekend calls. Secondly, dealers were keen to see the reaction of the big institutions to a story in the weekend press suggesting that BT was stalking Thorn EMI with a view to a potential takeover of the latter. The Thorn story was immediately disregarded by market analysts - 'the first I have heard of it and an unlikely tie-up,' was the view of one top-rated specialist. The price-cutting initiative was not viewed as damaging by telecoms and general market analysts, who continued to view BT as one of the market's best defensive stocks. BT is scheduled to report second-quarter numbers on Thursday. NatWest Securities is forecasting a 9.75 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 6.75p and for profits to come out at Pounds 715m - up 66 per cent from the comparable figure last year - to make first-half profits of Pounds 1.472bn. At the close of trading, BT shares were 3 1/2 higher at 465 1/2 p on relatively low turnover of 4.5m, while the partly-paid were 1 1/2 firmer at 214 1/2 p.</p>

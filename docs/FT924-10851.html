			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Kenyan poll due after parliament is dissolved KENYA'S first multi-party elections for 26 years are expected to take place by mid-December following President Daniel arap Moi's dissolution of parliament yesterday. President Moi did not give a date for the poll. Under the constitution elections must take place within 90 days of a dissolution and the government must set the date for the elections six weeks in advance of voting. However, opposition politicians in Nairobi said that they thought it unlikely that Mr Moi would choose to delay the exercise beyond Christmas. The ruling Kenya African National Union's (Kanu) main challengers will be the two wings of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) and the Democratic party of former vice-president Mr Mwai Kibaki. The split in FORD was ostensibly over internal party elections, but behind the dispute lie tribal divisions and personality disputes. The bickering between the two factions has played into Mr Moi's hands, eroding FORD's initial popularity and enhancing Kanu's electoral prospects. Altogether at least 10 parties have been formed and there is little hope they will unite before the elections.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Miners look to public opinion to save them: NUM stokes up campaign to halt closures MINERS' leaders hope that, if industrial muscle can no longer save the pits, they can still stop the closures with the help of a poll-tax-style wave of public discontent. Yesterday's National Union of Mineworkers conference in Sheffield held back from calling an immediate strike ballot, preferring to stoke up a national and European campaign against the closures. Statements by NUM delegates before and during the closed conference session appear to have persuaded Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, that to call for an immediate strike would risk splitting a severely weakened union with little certainty of changing the government's mind. Unusually for him, the miners' leader steered clear of making confrontational statements. He focused instead on appearing to argue a rational case on economic and social grounds in a language capable of being understood by an audience wider than that formed by his more militant supporters: 'I just want (Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary) to act decisively and sensibly and save an industry that is economic rather than substitute it with an industry that is uneconomic.' During the conference a delegate from the Derbyshire region warned that his members were simply not prepared to go on strike because of the fear of either losing their jobs or their redundancy packages. The leader of the NUM's white-collar section, Mr Ken Hollingsworth, said before attending the conference: 'Our men are having to weigh up that their money might go if they take action . . . I don't think they will take the gamble. There isn't the stomach for a fight over this but there is a great deal of anger. It is the public that can say 'enough'.' Another official said: 'There seems to be something stirring out there. The fact that we are now so weak makes it a case of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and a lot of people don't like it.' He added that the campaign would unashamedly wrap itself in the Union Jack and argue that Britain cannot afford to let another industry disappear like the motorcycle and shipbuilding industries. Pressure on miners not to strike was reinforced yesterday when Mr Heseltine repeated a warning from British Coal that mineworkers risked 'throwing away' redundancy payments if they took industrial action. Meanwhile Mr Roy Lynk, president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, last night began his protest with an underground sit-in at the Silverhill colliery in north Nottinghamshire. The mine is scheduled to close today.</p>

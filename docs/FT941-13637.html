			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Pit closures could continue after sales British Coal intends to complete most of its pre-privatisation pit closures programme by March, leaving determination of the final size of the industry to its successors. That means the operators of the privatised industry might face politically sensitive decisions on whether to close mines almost as soon as they have bought them. British Coal is expected to be in private hands by the spring, or next year at the latest. But corporation executives and the government are working to go ahead with almost all pre-privatisation closures by the end of the financial year in two months. They are likely to be cautious, leaving more pits open than the market can sustain in the long term. Between five and eight of the 22 operating pits face closure, leaving about 15. All 22 pits will be offered to the private sector. But together with opencast operations, the 15 or so will form the core of the five packages the government will offer for sale. Although the government has promised to be flexible in the negotiations, it will be reluctant to close any of the pits operating after March. Political considerations provide one explanation for the government's approach. Although pit closures are less controversial than they were a year or so ago, ministers are anxious lest they reappear as an issue while the industry is still in state hands. In addition, the government believes the new owners will be best placed to decide on the number of deep mines they need once they take them over and start running them. The exact number of deep mines that will survive much beyond privatisation will depend on how much more productivity the new owners can squeeze out of miners, on how quickly they run down coal stocks and on how much opencast mining they carry out. It seems unlikely, however, that there will be much room in the market for more than about a dozen of the 15 or so in the core packages. NM Rothschild, merchant bankers advising the government on coal privatisation, forecast two years ago that there was a future, after the sell-off, for 14 pits. Since then, however, the prospects for coal have diminished considerably as a result of a marked improvement in performance by nuclear power plants and a faster move than expected by generating companies into gas-fired generation. In addition, the 15 or so pits that will be offered for sale in the five packages will face competition. That is because several pits closed by British Coal in the past year are likely to be mined under licence by private operators. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday published consultation documents on the proposed licensing regime for the privatised coal industry. He published a an explanatory note describing how the Coal Authority, which will license mining, is to carry out its functions. The note also sets draft model licensing documents. British Coal Enterprises, the job creation agency established 10 years ago to bring employment opportunities into coalfield areas, announced yesterday it had placed 100,000 people in work.</p>

NPF&hyph;39 and NPF&hyph;85, which authorize operation of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2. The licenses provide, among other things, that the license is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facilities consist of two boiling water reactors located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is stated in 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), that ``The licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort *&blank;*&blank;*.'' It also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee proposed to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep their badge with them when departing the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated August 10, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> III. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide measures for protection against radiological sabotage provided the licensee demonstrates that the measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the LGS units, unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a combination badge and keycard. (Hereafter, these are referred to as badge.) The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees and contractor personnel, who have been granted unescorted access, are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plant's physical security plans, neither licensee employees nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed system, each individual who is authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared with the previously stored template in the access control system to verify authorization for entry. Individuals, including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the site and thus eliminate the process to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges do not carry any information other than a unique identification number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

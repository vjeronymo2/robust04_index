			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: SE Banken Sentiment has certainly changed towards Swedish banks. Shares in SE Banken have virtually quadrupled to SKr27 since their low on April 22. Last week the excitement became so intense that the bank had to bring forward first-quarter results showing a 60 per cent increase in operating profits. The strength of operating income is gratifying since, in theory at least, it demonstrates the scope for recovery once the crisis finally abates. That does not mean, though, that progress will henceforth be linear. Among the factors bolstering operating income were several that may not last. Sharp swings in the Swedish money market enabled the bank to widen its interest margin; market turbulence boosted foreign exchange trading profits; commission income was helped by a strong stock market. The harder part will be to maintain the momentum when these factors subside. It is not as if the recession is over. The need for provisions may continue awhile. The tantalising possibility is that SE Banken's improved fortunes may limit its need for state assistance to rebuild its capital. Worries that such help would not come without cost to shareholders have held back the price. Handelsbanken has managed without state aid and now trades at a discount of only 25 per cent to book. SE Banken's discount of around 45 per cent suggests more room for recovery. Until the shape of the government rescue package is decided, there is no telling how far existing shareholders will be the beneficiaries.</p>

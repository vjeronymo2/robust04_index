			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW SINKS 85 POINTS BUT RECOVERS TO CLOSE OFF 3.69  </P> <P> Computerized program trading led the stock market on one of its most erratic  days Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 85 points before it  reversed course, trading briefly above Monday's close, before ending the day  off 3.69 at 2,659.22.  </P> <P> The market's wild ride was set in motion by the apparent collapse of any hope  for a buyout soon of UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines. This prompted a  selloff at the start of the trading day of airline and other potential takeover  stocks. In addition, economic news about a fall in durable goods orders in  September was widely interpreted as a possible sign of a recession and was  cited as a factor in the initial heavy selling of stocks.  </P> <P> But the wide swings in stock prices throughout the day were attributed mainly  to program trading, as specialized investors sought to profit from the  seesawing differences between the prices of futures contracts for baskets of  stocks and the prices of the stocks themselves. Traders said the heavy trading  volume -- 237.96 million on the New York Stock Exchange, compared to 135.86  million Monday -- masked the fact that many institutional investors retreated  to the sidelines rather than risk trading in the face of unpredictable price  swings.  </P> <P> Brad Weeks, senior vice president for equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;  Jenrette Securities, called the market's volatility Tuesday "absolutely  ridiculous" and said it appeared to be almost entirely related to computerized  arbitrage trading between stocks and stock index futures, such as the Standard  &amp; Poor's 500, a futures contract for a basket of 500 stocks, and the major  market index, made up of stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average.  </P> <P> Jim Creber, a partner at the brokerage Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp; Co., said,  "We're seeing (program traders) play around with this market and whip it  around."  </P> <P> The sharp drop in futures prices early in the day triggered a temporary trading  halt in the S&amp;P 500 futures contract. The halt is part of the so-called  circuit breaker mechanisms implemented since 1987 in an effort to curb wide  swings in stock and futures prices, and it goes into effect when the contract  falls below a 12-point limit. Some market analysts said the brief halt  contributed to the recovery of futures and stock prices later in the day.  </P> <P> News late Monday that UAL's board had decided to keep the company independent  for now, and the apparent evaporation of hope for a new bid soon, led to a  massive selloff of the stock by speculators in takeover deals, known as  arbitragers. The fate of the UAL deal has had a profound impact on the stock  markets since Oct. 13, when the Dow index dropped 190 points in response to  news that the group trying to take the company private had failed to obtain  financing for its $6.75-billion, $300-a-share offer.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, trading of UAL was delayed because of a sharp imbalance of sell  orders over bids to buy. Later, the stock traded down as much as 30 points from  its close on Monday. But rumors that one or more brokerages were "sweeping the  street" with large buy orders for the stock fueled speculation that a new  takeover offer might emerge. This caused the stock to bounce back, closing off  only 8 3/8 at 170.  </P> <P> The rebound of stock prices late in the day mainly affected the blue chips. On  the New York Stock Exchange, declining stocks outnumbered rising ones by 3 to  1, with 360 up, 1,213 down and 381 unchanged.  </P> <P> In addition to UAL, other active issues included Security Pacific, which fell  7/8 to 44 1/2; Philip Morris, up 5/8 to 44 1/2; Chase Manhattan, down 7/8 at 38  7/8, and AMR, down 1 3/4 at 68 7/8.  </P> <P> Prices of stocks traded over the counter fell, wiping out most of the recovery  made late last week. The NASDAQ composite index of OTC stocks fell 5.52 to  close at 461.70, only slightly above its recent low on Oct. 17 of 459.93.  </P> <P> Despite the recovery by blue chip stocks late in the day, traders said  Tuesday's economic news was discouraging and could put a damper on the market  in coming weeks. The Commerce Department announced that orders for durable  goods slipped 0.1% in September. Traders noted in particular that if the  volatile defense sector is excluded from the figures, remaining durable goods  orders fell 3.9%, the biggest drop in four months. The figures came as several  large companies Tuesday reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings.  </P> <P> "This is confirmation that the economy is slowing down," said Anthony Woodruff,  managing director in charge of equity trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stock prices closed lower in brisk trading, with the key 225-share  Nikkei index slipping 58.97 to close at 35,526.55 after climbing 99.14 on  Monday.  </P> <P> The initial decline in the U.S. stock market Tuesday led to nervousness in  London. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed sharply  lower, off 40.4 at 2,1149.3.  </P> <P> THE DOW EVERY 15 MINUTES  </P> <P> Chart shows index on the quarter-hour. Its lowest point -- 2,577.25, an  85-point drop -- occurred at 10:36.  </P> <P> Source: Knight-Rider TradeCenter  </P></p>

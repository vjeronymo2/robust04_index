			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPREE OF A LIFETIME;  </P> <P> YOUNG CANCER PATIENTS WRAP UP A MAGIC WEEK  </P> <P> Christmas music chimed through the Glendale Galleria. Santa Claus jounced  toddlers on his knee. And seven children with cancer, four of them from Mexico  and three from Los Angeles, were on a shopping spree arranged by Los Angeles  police officers.  </P> <P> "How about some of these?" Officer Gilbert Escontrias asked Mike Dighero,  holding up a pair of jeans for the frail, 6-year-old Boyle Heights boy.  </P> <P> The little boy looked less than thrilled -- then he caught sight of something  else.  </P> <P> "El nino Bart Simpson!" he shouted, ecstatic.  </P> <P> By the time he left the mall, Mike sported a Bart Simpson T-shirt and warm-ups,  a Mickey Mouse hat and a pair of Reeboks. The rest of the group walked out with  packages full of Barbie dolls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Air Jordans and a  Nintendo game.  </P> <P> Advertising had brought the glamour of brand names into East Los Angeles  housing projects and even into dirt-floored homes in Mexico, where the onetime  expense of a black and white television yields years of entertainment. But  until Friday, for these seven families, the money to buy such products had  remained out of reach.  </P> <P> On Friday, children who had never seen a department store, and in two cases,  parents who had never shopped anywhere but public markets in a town square, set  out for the mall. Each family had a mission to spend more than $250, which was  raised by the Hollenbeck community relations unit of the Los Angeles Police  Department. The shopping spree was the climax of a five-day trip to Los Angeles  that included outings to Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, and, for one  15-year-old boy, an artificial leg.  </P> <P> Such sprees are conceived as once-in-a-lifetime voyages into happy oblivion, a  magical few hours where poverty and illness are left behind. On Friday, in  fact, children seemed to forget the chemotherapy treatments and all the painful  months in hospitals. They were no longer kids with cancer; they were kids at  Christmas.  </P> <P> Separated from their parents for part of the spree on the assumption that they  would feel freer to buy what they really wanted without supervision, they asked  excitedly for things whose names they had heard on TV, or from friends.  Meanwhile, their parents -- a mom or dad accompanied each child on the trip --  were each given $100 to spend on themselves and their families back home.  </P> <P> The children started out in a shoe store, where the six boys each asked for  favorite brands, in some cases according to the stars (Michaels Jackson and  Jordan) who had endorsed them. Raudel Gonzalez of Jalisco, Mexico, who lost one  leg to cancer last June, couldn't stop smiling as he explained to the clerk  that he was about to get another foot for the Nike that was left in the shoe  box.  </P> <P> The only girl, Rocio Romero, 13, spurned "boys' shoes," and chose a pair of  low-slung black boots. Rocio, who comes from a small town outside Guadalajara,  said all her family shopping is done in the public market in her small town.  She gazed longingly at a $69 confection of pink nylon lace, but chose a more  practical outfit, barrettes for her older sisters, and a neon T-shirt that said  "California" across the chest.  </P> <P> During this trip, children, who had never met one another and had little in  common except those things they prefer to forget, turned into a kind of  extended family. One frail 10-year-old, Salvador Gudino, who did not speak when  he arrived, learned to use a telephone at the motel where they were staying,  and kept ringing his new friends just to say hi. His mother, Juana Torres, 40,  who described herself as a peasant with 10 children, went around saluting  police officers with a "high five."  </P> <P> In the Glendale Galleria, cancer proved easier to forget than poverty.  </P> <P> As the boys walked through the aisles of a toy store, Officer Maria Martinez  suggested that they avoid toy cars with batteries. The children understood  instantly; batteries wore out and at home there would be no money for more.  </P> <P> The three fathers, left alone to shop with their $100 bills, chose gifts for  their wives and outfits for the children left at home.  </P> <P> The mothers, however, walked through J.C. Penney almost without touching  anything. They glanced at one another over the counters full of holiday  trinkets and assorted perfumes. They wended their way past ties for Dad and  sequinned tops for New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> Still, they bought nothing.  </P> <P> Torres and Elisa Romero, Rocio's mother, each have nine other children at home.  Mike's mother, who lives in a housing project in Boyle Heights, has four other  children. Would it be possible, they asked politely, to take the cash and spend  it elsewhere? The store the police officers had chosen for its low prices was,  they said, for "monied" people.  </P> <P> On the way out, Romero, in one impulsive moment, picked up a small box of  gift-wrapped perfumed soaps for $7. Guilt flashed across her face. But, after  the tough going, even the toughened, a mother with the 10 mouths to feed,  wanted to go shopping. Just this once.  </P> <P> She smiled shyly at her companions. Then she handed the clerk her single, crisp  $100 bill.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Yi Ki-taek, president  of South Korea's largest opposition Democratic Party, at a press  conference in Washington Wednesday said the position of his  party was to oppose the imposition of "sanctions" on the North  for nuclear inspection and find a peaceful solution to the  nuclear issue, a foreign news report said.    He said diplomatic means was the only way to ease the  tensions on the Korean peninsula. He hoped the nuclear issue  could be settled peacefully through DPRK-USA talks.    He declared that the Democratic Party did not welcome the  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea.</p>

Social  organizations, religious associations, the news media, the  country's political forces, and all citizens are decidedly  against violence. A defined and clear sentiment exists in favor  of a solution that saves lives and ensures the path of justice.  The efficient action by the Mexican Army and the decision for a  unilateral cease-fire have increased tranquillity in the  affected areas of Chiapas and in the country. The government  has taken the path of conciliation and union among Mexicans so  this painful situation will not be repeated. For that reason, I  have decided to ask the Permanent Committee of the National  Congress to immediately convoke a extraordinary period of  sessions. I will submit a bill to grant a general amnesty to  everyone who participated in the violence that has affected  several towns in Chiapas from 1 January to 1100 [1700 GMT]  today, 16 January. Any criminal action against towns or the  Mexican Army after that time will not receive the benefit of  amnesty.    With this decision, the Mexican state is making it clear  that  it seeks peace. Those who have entered into a confrontation  with the state no longer have any pretext for refusing to  peacefully rejoin their communities and participate in the tasks  of meeting needs and overcoming vices through solidarity. In  the days ahead, I will implement an overall justice program in  the upper and jungle areas of Chiapas. With this program the  federal government will join the decisions and work by all  Chiapas residents without exception. I will continue to act in  favor of the security, tranquillity, and greater justice Chiapas  State needs. I will continue asking for cooperation from all in  these decisions and for the indispensable participation of  Chiapas residents in the responsible search for peace and  justice. In this way Congress will play the key role that  befits it to continue advancing toward the restoral of peace in  that area of Chiapas.    Fellow countrymen, the president continues making all  decisions available to him to protect the people, avoid  violence, and find justice. With this amnesty law initiative  and the additional effort for justice, we will strengthen the  harmony of the republic and the unity of the nation. Thank you.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: One firm's bright Chicago future is another's gloom - Barbara Durr finds that groups too small to survive are being bought - many of them by the Japanese Falling commissions, increasing costs and slimmer-than-ever profits have led many leaders of the Chicago futures industry to predict that the number of futures trading firms will decline in the next few years to about 150 from the present 400. Some of the biggest players in this realignment are expected to be Japanese. Mr Leo Melamed, who last year retired from executive duties at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, recently sold control of his family firm, Dellsher, to a Japanese bank, Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank (MTKB). Mr Melamed has long predicted that large well-capitalised firms would increasingly dominate the market, leaving small firms to go bust, sell out or exist only as niche players. 'I was one of the firms that was going to be extinct if I didn't take my own advice,' he said. With 55 employees and Dollars 11m in capital, Dellsher is a small player. MTKB says it looked at several other Chicago futures commissions and considered the option of setting up its own in-house futures unit. It decided on Dellsher because of the price - undisclosed - of the deal and because of Mr Melamed's prestige. According to Mr Tomohiko Sumihara, vice-president of business management in New York for MTKB, some Japanese firms which began futures units in Chicago have had trouble 'being accepted in that circle'. He believes that the Melamed name will smooth MTKB's path. Purchasing Dellsher was also less costly than developing its own expertise, said Mr Sumihara. MTKB - which, with total assets of Dollars 402bn in 1990, ranks as Japan's second largest bank - is keen to offer the full menu of services to its clients. Last December, it formed MTK Global Capital, a derivative products subsidiary, and Dellsher will come in handy to help lay off risks incurred through, for example, over-the-counter currency and interest-rate swaps. MTKB's splash into Chicago's markets is part of a steady stream of Japanese companies and banks since 1987, when the Japanese government loosened regulations to allow firms to trade foreign futures. The 'big four' of the Japanese securities houses - Daiwa, Nikko, Nomura and Yamaichi - have chosen to establish in-house futures expertise. Nomura has adopted a strategy of head-hunting big-name New York talent and local stars in Chicago. Unlike other firms that have kept most of their authority in Japan, Nomura has given its US team free rein. As a result, the Nomura futures unit has become profitable in a short time, said Mr Robert Fitzsimmons, Nomura's Chicago chief. The president of Nikko Securities International, Mr Masumi Yamaguchi, explained that when his firm sought a Chicago partner, it found that small trading firms were mostly privately held without public disclosure statements, making an investigation of their creditworthiness and the quality of their client base difficult. Nikko has been an aggressive Japanese firm: it was the first to open its own office and the first to launch a futures fund for Japanese investors. Daiwa has also sold a futures fund for Japanese investors and says it is pleased with its Chicago business. Japanese futures funds are kept offshore by Japanese regulatory authorities. But that could change due to a law under consideration in Tokyo. If it does, Chicago is expected to attract much of that new Japanese trading. Japan only has a limited financial futures market of Japanese government bonds and stock index futures. However, if regionalist trends hold, Japan's markets may develop later and take back some of that business, according to Mr Morton Lane, president of Discount Corporation of New York Futures. Mr Lane expects the futures industry worldwide to divide into three main spheres of trading - Europe, the US and Japan. Eager for experience and expertise, Japan's role in Chicago is likely to grow.</p>

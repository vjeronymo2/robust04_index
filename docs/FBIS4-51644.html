			<p>BFN     [Text] Implementing the Lao Government's humanitarian  policy toward the families of American personnel missing in  action during the war, and based on the 1994 cooperation plan  approved by both sides, the Lao-American Joint Technical Team  will carry out a joint operation in the two northern provinces  of Houa Phan and Xieng Khouang from 4 May to 1 June. This will  be the fifth joint operation carried out under the 1993-94 plan.  During this fifth joint operation, technicians from both sides  will investigate plane crash cases and look into information  about American nationals the U.S. side believes are still alive.  They will also conduct surveys and excavations at a total of  nine sites in the two provinces. This is the largest number of  sites surveyed and excavated since the first instance of  cooperation. During the planned joint operation, technicians  from both sides will be divided into three groups -- two  excavation groups and one investigation group. The joint  operation team is expected to complete its work in these two  provinces before moving on to work in other provinces.    The Lao side has done its best thus far to uphold its  obligations in accordance with the plan agreed to by the two  sides.</p>

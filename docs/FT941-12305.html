			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Japan plans Pounds 85bn economic stimulus The Japanese government this week plans to follow its agreement on political reform with a long-delayed package of tax cuts and government spending, estimated to total at least Y14,000bn (Pounds 85bn). Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said at the weekend he aimed to announce details by the end of the week. His seven-party coalition government would seek co-operation on economic policy with the opposition Liberal Democratic party. The Nikkei rose more than 900 points by mid-morning today. Brokers said investors welcomed the reform deal because it cleared political uncertainties. The economic package will come as a relief to the US and to Japanese business organisations, which have been urging steps to relieve the recession. Until the weekend, the coalition's ability to act on the economy had been paralysed by its attempts to win parliamentary agreement on plans to redesign the electoral system and curb corruption. However, parliament on Saturday voted in favour of a compromise on reform. The newly confident coalition plans to hold elections 'anytime from this autumn', said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. Ministers responsible for the economy started work on the package at the weekend. Early drafts envisage Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn in income and residential tax cuts, plus Y4,000bn of government spending on infrastructure, according to government officials quoted in the Japanese press. The package is also said to include increased loans for housing and small businesses, plus possible tax concessions for corporate land sales. The government will draw up its budget for the coming fiscal year by February 15, said Mrs Manae Kubota, director of the Economic Planning Agency. It may expand an existing five-year programme of public works, worth Y430,000bn. This week's package will be the fourth and possibly largest pump-priming plan in 14 months. Mr Hosokawa will have evidence of attempts to stimulate domestic demand when he meets US president Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. US-Japanese trade relations have been strained by failure to agree on US demands that Tokyo should accept numerical targets for reducing its trade surplus.

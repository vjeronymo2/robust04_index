			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Leased Housing Association (NLHA) supported the proposed rule, but believed that it should have gone further in spelling out the details of HUD's mortgage sale program, in order to provide an opportunity for public comment. In particular, NLHA wanted more detail regarding the FHA mortgage insurance programs to be used, the minimum bid requirements, any borrower right of first refusal and right to bid policies, and the nature of the bid process. It recommended that mortgages be sold individually, bidders have adequate time in which to perform due diligence, and workout agreements be permitted to be terminated by agreement between the new mortgagee and the mortgagor. All of this advice is well-taken. The Department has consulted widely, and will continue to consult, in the development of its mortgage sales program, but does not believe that such details concerning mortgage sale procedures should be codified in regulation. Instead, the Department intends to adopt mortgage sale policies that are consistent with these regulations and are suited to the characteristics of the mortgages offered for sale. This approach also will allow the Department to learn from experience and feedback from all affected parties as it pursues a series of mortgage sales. Auction procedures will be spelled out in a bid package distributed prior to each auction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One mortgagor recommended a carefully considered set of policies for mortgage settlements with owners. These recommendations will be considered as HUD works with its financial advisor to develop a mortgage settlement policy. A law firm urged special attention to participation by small investors in the mortgage sale program, including negotiated sales to small investors. HUD seeks to encourage participation by small investors by offering nonperforming mortgages in small pools; however, it is not authorized to negotiated sales to private entities. A development and property management firm recommended against the sale of HUD-held mortgages on the ground that they would be too deeply discounted; however, if they were sold, the firm recommended that the mortgages be sold individually, rather than in pools, to receive the highest price. HUD will determine whether to offer mortgages individually, in pools, or both, based on the characteristics of the mortgages offered for sale and other terms and conditions of the auction. The Chinese-American Golden Age Association recommended the sale of Section 202 loans. HUD is considering various options for these mortgages at the present time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section-by-Section Changes From Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some of the provisions in the final rule have been reformatted, to aid in clarity. Substantive changes made to the proposed rule are identified below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 207.270  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new provision has been added to part 207 which authorizes the Department to modify the terms of the mortgage reinsurance pursuant to section 223(c) of the National Housing Act when the Department sells a mortgage with FHA insurance. This change is necessary to take into account the fact that mortgages may be sold to investors at a discount rate due to fluctuating interest rates. When mortgages are sold at a discount rate, HUD will adjust the amount of the reinsurance to reflect the purchase price of the mortgage, not the original mortgage amount. HUD will determine the amount of the reinsurance at the time of the mortgage sale. This regulatory change codifies existing Departmental policy for mortgage sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 290.3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of subsidized mortgage has been clarified to indicate that purchase money mortgages (PMMs) for previously subsidized projects will be treated like subsidized mortgages. The definition of subsidized project has been conformed with the Multifamily Property Disposition Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 290.200 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Language has been added to the section describing the purpose of the new subpart D, Sale of HUD-held mortgages, to state that, except for negotiated sales to State and local governments, HUD will sell mortgages on a competitive basis. Language has also been added to explain that the Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying mortgage for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered mortgage from sale. The procedures set out in the remaining sections of this subpart apply only when the Secretary has determined that a qualifying mortgage is to be sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 290.201(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department agrees with commenters that existing tenant protections should be preserved. Consequently, a paragraph has been added to include language from section 203(k)(1) of the HCD Amendments of 1978, prohibiting the Secretary from selling a HUD-held mortgage on a subsidized project unless the sale is made part of a transaction that meets certain qualifications. The transaction must ensure that the project will continue to operate at least until the maturity date of the loan or mortgage in a manner that will provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program under which the original mortgage was insured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 290.202(b)(2) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The language has been changed to incorporate the changes made by the Multifamily Property Disposition Act in the treatment of unsubsidized projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW, Washington, D.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically, the requirements of this rule are directed to HUD administrative procedures, and do not impinge upon the relationship between Federal government and State and local governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12606, the Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Family, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

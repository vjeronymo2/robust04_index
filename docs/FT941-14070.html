			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium prices slide as producer talks drag on Aluminium prices fell back sharply at the London Metal Exchange yesterday as traders became increasingly nervous about the outcome of the Brussels meeting at which leading producing countries were seeking a multilateral solution to the supply glut that recently drove prices to all-time lows in real terms. In the morning some delegates had appeared hopeful as they entered on an unscheduled third day of negotiations. 'We are moving towards an agreement. . . hopefully today,' an Australian official told the Reuter news agency. And Mr Georgy Gabunia, leader of the Russian delegation, claimed that his team was adopting 'a very positive approach'. A flood of Russian material on to the world market following the collapse of the Soviet Union has been widely blamed for the present oversupply and there were indications on Wednesday that agreement had eluded delegates during the first two days of talks because of Russia's determination not to shift from its opening offer. The early bullishness of the delegates was reflected at the LME, where the aluminium price for delivery in three months rose to Dollars 1,214 a tonne from Wednesday's close of Dollars 1,205.50. But the mood seemed to have have changed as delegates emerged for the midday recess. Mr Gabunia was putting a brave face on things. 'We are still talking,' he told Reuter, 'so we still hope to get an agreement.' But a western diplomat reported that little progress had been made. 'Most of the talking seems to have been between the US and the Russians,' he added. That apparent erosion of earlier confidence sapped the spirit of the market, and as an agreed news blackout ruled out further progress reports there was nothing to halt the ensuing price decline. As the talks dragged on into the evening the LME three months price closed at Dollars 1,186.75 a tonne, having touched Dollars 1,180 at one point. Trade delegates were still struggling late last night to thrash out an agreement that would take enough aluminium capacity out of operation to give fresh heart to the market. Analysts believe cuts amounting to at least 1.5m tonnes a year, or about 10 per cents of current ouput, would be needed to achieve this. Daily average primary aluminium output in December 1993 was down to 40,500 tonnes from 40,700 in November and 41,900 in December 1992, provisional figures from the International Primary Aluminium Institute show. Total production in December (31 days) was 1.256m tonnes, compared with 1.22m in November (30 days) and 1.3m in December 1992.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> PUC PLANS 2 HEARINGS ON WATER RATE  </P> <P> At the request of the city of Ojai, the California Public Utilities Commission  has scheduled two public hearings on a rate increase proposed by Southern  California Water Co.  </P> <P> The company is seeking rates 25% higher next year for its 2,688 customers.  </P> <P> The hike would increase an average residential water bill by $6.17 a month and  would be followed by smaller increases the next two years.  </P> <P> The Ojai City Council formally objected to the proposed rate structure after  City Manager Andrew Belknap said it would do little to encourage water  conservation and would actually penalize those who are most thrifty.  </P> <P> The two public hearings were scheduled for June 25 at 3 and 7 p.m. in the  council chambers of Ojai City Hall, 401 S. Ventura St. Attorneys for the  utility and PUC staff will present their reports on the proposal to  Administrative Law Judge Eric Stalder, who will also take comment from the  public.  </P> <P> The firm offered to make unspecified modifications to the rate request in a  letter to the city from Floyd Wicks, Southern California Water Co. Vice  President of Operations in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Wicks also asked that the council endorse the company's attempts to swap water  with Casitas Municipal Water District, which he said would benefit the  company's Ojai customers and would save 500-acre-feet per year of Lake Casitas  water.  </P> <P> Neither the City Council nor the Casitas Water Board has publicly considered  the water exchange proposal to date.

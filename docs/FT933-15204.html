			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan opens way for foreign securities firms THE Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission is to relax entry conditions for foreign-based securities firms. The move is aimed at attracting more foreign dealers to further internationalise and enliven Taiwan's stock market. This has a total share value of more than Dollars 110bn with over 260 companies listed. Under the new rules, foreign securities investment firms will need NTDollars 170m (Dollars 6.4m) to set up brokerages and engage in purchases on margins and short sales. The similar requirement for a local company is NTDollars 200m. Foreign dealers can begin operations with only NTDollars 80m, again compared with the NTDollars 200m capitalisation requirement for a prospective local dealer. A foreign-based underwriter requires NTDollars 90m, according to the new rules. The SEC said that any foreign company with representative offices in Taiwan for more than two years can apply to set up a branch. Mr K. C. Chen, vice-president of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management, said the lowering of the capitalisation requirement for new dealerships 'is the most attractive portion of the new rules'. He added that leading foreign brokerage firms, with higher commissions than local firms, had found it difficult to compete with local counterparts. But Mr Chen said Jardine Fleming and other foreign underwriters were more competitive in underwriting because of their greater experience and technical expertise.</p>

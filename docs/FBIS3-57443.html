The recent changes in the government's composition were  minor  compared to those made last September, Shokhin, who recently  replaced Yegor Gaydar as economics minister, told a news  conference in Moscow on Monday.    But he said certain amendments would nevertheless be made to  the economic policy on the basis of recommendations by  economists and politicians. He expressed readiness to cooperate  with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the  Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc. He said use would also be made  of work done by a team led by Academicians Leonid Abalkin and  Nikolay Petrakov and a team led by Academician Stanislav  Shatalin.    As for Boris Fedorov, it was still unclear whether he would  remain in the government, Shokhin said. He said President Boris  Yeltsin on Monday did not accept Fedorov's resignation.    The main economic problem facing the government today is  "combining the line towards macroeconomic stabilization with a  more careful microeconomic policy," Shokhin said. "That is what  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had in mind when he spoke  about non- monetarist measures," he said. In particular,  selective financing of economic sectors and tight control of  taxation had to be introduced, with "budgetary revenues  drastically increased by administrative methods." None of those  measures contradicted the former financial policy, Shokhin said.    He said the government should not be seen as consisting of  "conservatives" and "reformers" and condemned "the campaign  against the Chernomyrdin government, which is run by Mikhail  Poltoranin," and is a "serious political game" aimed at  "organizing a nationwide political strike in April or May,  overthrowing the government and taking power."</p>

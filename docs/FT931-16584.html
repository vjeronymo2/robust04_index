			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Radio 4 listeners to march on BBC RADIO 4 listeners, angry at the prospect of losing their favourite programmes on long wave, have again threatened to march on Broadcasting House. Original plans for a march were cancelled in October after BBC executives persuaded the organiser, Mr Nick MacKinnon, a Winchester schoolmaster, that the protesters had prevailed. The march is now planned for April. The BBC governors postponed the planned launch of a 24-hour news service on long wave until April 1994. The BBC also promised that the new service would not go ahead unless 'the transmission arrangements for Radio 4 meet the listeners' needs throughout the UK'. New booster FM transmitters are being built. Miss Rachel Mawhood, the new UK co-ordinator of the Radio 4 Campaign, is sceptical about BBC promises, saying FM is difficult to receive in many parts of the country. She listens to Radio 4 programmes on long wave to get better reception even though she lives in the Greenwich area of London. 'They can put 24-hour news on FM or Radio 5 if they want to,' Miss Mawhood said. The BBC argues that Gulf war coverage demonstrated the need for a 24-hour news service that will also carry the main Radio 4 current affairs programmes such as Today. On Saturday in the Call To Account programme on Radio 4, Mr Michael Green, the channel controller, said the BBC wanted to add a service that would be of value to listeners. 'The question is where do we put it,' Mr Green said, apparently suggesting that the issue was not entirely cut and dried. Mr Green insisted it would not be practical to put the news service on Radio 5. View of broadcasting, Page 13</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Size of oil spill awards lifts Exxon shares Shares in Exxon, the US oil company, jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 yesterday after a Federal jury in Alaska decided the corporation should pay Dollars 286.8m in compensation to Alaskan fishermen whose livelihoods were hit by the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster five years ago. The market's favourable reaction resulted from the fact that the award was less than a third of the Dollars 895m the fishermen had asked for. More important, it raised hopes that the jury would later impose punitive damages at a much lower figure than the Dollars 15bn the plaintiffs had sought. The jury's verdict was delivered late on Thursday in the second stage of a three-stage trial that began 15 weeks ago in Anchorage, Alaska. The first stage came in June when the same jury found that reckless conduct by Exxon and Mr Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the Exxon Valdez, contributed to the ship's running aground shortly after it left the state's main oil port in March 1989. In the second stage, the plaintiffs - about 10,000 fishermen - had sought Dollars 895m in compensatory damages, but the jury of nine women and three men decided after 23 days' deliberation that a much lower figure was appropriate. It works out at about Dollars 28,680 for each plaintiff. In the third stage of the trial, due to resume on August 22, the jury has to decide on punitive damages. If the fishermen's claim of Dollars 15bn were awarded, each would become a dollar millionaire. However, after Thursday's verdict, Wall Street analysts were tentatively suggesting that the final settlement would be much lower. Since the figure of Dollars 15bn was originally calculated as a multiple of the compensatory damages sought, there was speculation that the final figure for punitive damages might be reduced in similar proportion - in other words, to less than Dollars 5bn.</p>

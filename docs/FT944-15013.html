			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Book Review: Let gnat-size robots do the dusting The New Biology of Machines By Kevin Kelly Fourth Estate, Pounds 16.99, 520 pages Readers who are intrigued by the plethora of articles and programmes about 'information superhighways' and want to know more about what they really mean will find Out of Control an excellent introduction that captures the genuine spirit behind the publicity. This book by Kevin Kelly, California's leading new wave techno-journalist, lives up to its title as it weaves wildly between 1,001 subjects: from electronic banking to the art of beekeeping, from the Gulf war to post-Darwinian evolution. But in the process it conveys brilliantly the end-of-millennium excitement felt by many techies about the coming convergence of computing, communications and biology. The first primitive manifestation of this convergence is the information superhighway or I-way. It may lead to the creation of artificial life some time in the next century, Kelly argues. In Kellyspeak, out-of-control is the ultimate accolade for a complex system, whether it is a communications network, a robot or an artificial organism. It means that the system is evolving beyond the original specifications of its (human) designers, developing of its own accord into something more capable and powerful than they could have devised by themselves. Kelly concludes the book with 'Nine Laws of God' which should be followed by anyone aiming to create an out-of-control system. The first two laws give the essence of his message: 1. 'Distribute being'. The spirit of a beehive, the behaviour of an economy and the thinking of a supercomputer are distributed over a multitude of smaller units, whose interactions give the whole system a life that is far more than the sum of its parts. 2. 'Control from the bottom up'. The collapse of centrally planned, Soviet-style economies shows that no system can run for long on commands passed down from the top, Kelly says. 'A mob can steer itself, and in the territory of rapid, massive and heterogeneous change, only a mob can steer.' Imagine that you are given a million units of intelligence - call them neurones - to start a system of artificial life. You will achieve more in the long run if you distribute the intelligence equally among 10,000 creatures, giving 100 neurones to each, than if you create 100 super-beings with 10,000 neurones each. The reason is that a myriad of different creatures can work together and evolve in a way that is impossible for a small number of beings, however intelligent each may be. Robots to help around the house are a good illustration of Kelly's many-is-beautiful philosophy. He is not keen on the idea of a few humanoid robots trundling around like R2D2 in Star Wars, serving us beers or vacuuming our carpets. Instead, Kelly enthuses about the prospect of filling our homes with vast numbers of unobtrusive insect-like 'microbots' - an idea pioneered by Professor Rodney Brookes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For example a tiny 'gnatbot' (Kelly loves coining words) will live in the corner of the television screen and come out to eat the dust off the glass when the TV is switched off. Slightly larger cleaning robots will hide under every piece of furniture, programmed to emerge when they detect that the humans are away. Out of Control is far from perfect. It contains inaccuracies, unsupported generalisations and non-sequiturs galore. Some passages are maddeningly short; others (such as the chapter on 'Post-Darwinism') ramble on far too long. And Kelly, who is executive editor of Wired, the Californian magazine for network surfers, is not critical enough about the futuristic speculations of his friends and contacts. Indeed the harshest criticism in the book is aimed at the late George Orwell. 'No one has been more wrong about computerisation than Orwell in 1984,' Kelly writes. 'So far nearly everything about (computers) indicates that they are the end of authority and not its beginning.' Yet, for all its faults, Out of Control is a joy to read, both for its detail and for the enlivening impression it provides. One reason the book works so well is that Kelly obviously had fun writing it. His joie d'ecrire carries the reader happily through all 520 pages. There is a striking contrast between Out of Control and The Quark and the Jaguar, another important science book published this summer. Both are wide-ranging books with complexity theory and the emergence of order from chaos as central themes. But Murray Gell-Mann, the Nobel prize-winning author of The Quark and the Jaguar (Little, Brown, Pounds 18.99), laboured long and hard on his book, repeatedly rewriting passages to make them as clear as possible. After all the effort, much of Gell-Mann's prose is indeed reasonably readable but it does not bubble like Kelly's. As a famous physicist, Gell-Mann is concerned to maintain his scientific reputation, and so resists the kind of bold but plausible speculation that makes Out of Control so fascinating. In terms of content rather than style, however, Kelly could have borrowed a few thoughts from Gell-Mann, particularly the latter's emphasis on the all-important role of chance in the evolution of every system in the universe. Kelly is too optimistic to consider the risk that sheer bad luck could wreck his rosy scenarios. If the out-of-control biocomputer systems of the future do take on a life of their own, will they necessarily develop in the benign human-friendly way that he predicts? In the end, Kelly's infectious optimism suppresses such doubts. Out of Control leaves the reader with a sense of heightened anticipation, looking forward to riding on the information superhighway to a symbiosis of people and machines some time in the next century.</p>

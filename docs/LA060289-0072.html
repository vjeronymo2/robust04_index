			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Polish-born American millionaire agreed to try to save the birthplace of the  Solidarity trade union, the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, from closure by Poland's  Communist government. Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, who inherited a fortune from  her U.S. businessman-husband, signed a preliminary agreement in the Baltic port  with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the shipyard manager, Czeslaw Tolwinski,  to form a company to save the yard. The three said in a statement that they are  planning to start operations by Jan. 1, but they did not say if the new company  will take over all or part of the shipyard. The government last October ordered  it closed due to heavy financial losses.  </P></p>

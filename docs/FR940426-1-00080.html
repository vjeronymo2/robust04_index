			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Standards Applicable to EPA Review of OTC Recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 184 of the Act specifies two general criteria that EPA is to apply in evaluating whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC recommendation. These are, first, whether the additional control measures that the OTC recommends are ``necessary'' and, second, whether the additional control measures are ``otherwise consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with th[e] Act.'' If the recommended measure is necessary and consistent with the Act, EPA believes it would be obligated to approve the recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Necessity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that it has substantial discretion to interpret the ``necessary'' test, and is considering a number of approaches, discussed below. EPA's evaluation of ``necessity'' could involve two fundamental analytic steps: First, EPA believes it should consider the magnitude of emissions reductions in ozone precursors needed for the nonattainment areas in the OTR to attain. Second, it may be appropriate to consider other potential emissions reduction measures that may be available to satisfy the needed magnitude of emissions reductions, and compare the LEV program to alternative measures. In connection with the magnitude of reductions needed for attainment, EPA is considering: (1) how it should address the geographic dimension of determining where the LEV program is necessary for areas in the OTR to achieve attainment; (2) how it should account for the timing of when the LEV program would generate reductions that could contribute to attainment; and (3) whether EPA can take into account the need for the LEV program for maintenance purposes. In connection with alternatives to the LEV program, EPA is evaluating relevant aspects of (1) the recommended LEV program; (2) the FLEV alternative that the auto manufacturers have proposed; and (3) other possible emissions reduction measures identified by EPA, the OTC, or other State bodies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Necessity Finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that more than one approach to defining what is ``necessary'' is conceivable. One possible approach is to consider as necessary any additional control measures that contribute to attainment, as long as measures specifically required by the Act or that are otherwise in place are insufficient to achieve attainment. Under this approach, the relevant question would be whether additional reductions are needed for attainment, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of alternative control measures would not be relevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second approach is to first consider what emissions reductions are needed for attainment and then to compare the LEV program to alternative measures that could be adopted to achieve those reductions. Before enactment of the 1990 Amendments, EPA interpreted the term ``necessary'' generally in this manner under section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, in the context of preemption of State fuel requirements. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The section 211(c) provision specifically addresses how alternative measures should be compared for purposes of evaluating necessity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Other provisions of the Act also involve a ``necessary'' standard. Under section 110, the Administrator is to approve a State's SIP revision if it meets the applicable requirements of the Act, including the requirement in section 110(a)(2)(A) that the SIPs include measures ``as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of this Act.'' Prior to the 1990 Amendments, section 110(a)(2) provided that the Administrator shall approve a State's SIP if it includes measures ``as may be necessary to insure attainment and maintenance'' of the primary and secondary NAAQS. The Supreme Court has interpreted the ``as may be necessary'' language to mean that ``the Administrator must assure that the minimal, or `necessary,' requirements are met, not that he detect and reject any state plan more demanding than federal law requires.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  427 U.S. 246 at 263 (1976) (footnote omitted). EPA currently does not believe that this test, and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Court's analysis, are applicable under section 184. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Court explained that the language, structure, and purpose of the Act, are consistent with a State's decision to be stricter within its borders than Federal law requires, here, in contrast, section 184 appears to indicate that EPA is to disapprove the OTC's recommended measures if those measures are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  necessary. Further, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Court's analysis is inapplicable here because a majority of OTC States is seeking to impose requirements on dissenting OTC States over their objections. EPA requests comment on this view.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, in connection with its study and rulemaking under section 202(i) related to ``Tier 2'' motor vehicle emissions standards, EPA is to determine whether ``there is a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> need <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  for further reductions in emissions.'' (Emphasis supplied.) As discussed below, EPA has not yet completed the Tier 2 study or the subsequent rulemaking, and thus has not yet interpreted this standard in that context. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

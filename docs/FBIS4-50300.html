			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 KYODO -- Three inspectors from the  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Beijing on Monday [16  May] on their way to monitor the refueling of a North Korean  nuclear facility.    The team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency is  scheduled to leave Beijing for Pyongyang on Tuesday and to begin  inspection of a 5-megawatt experimental nuclear plant at  Yongbyon, near Pyongyang, on Wednesday.    Despite a North Korean announcement Saturday that it had  removed seals and started replacing spent fuel rods at the  reactor, the team will continue with a previous agreement and  monitor the refueling process, team leader Olli Heinonen said.    An IAEA spokesman said Saturday in Vienna that if North  Korea  commits a serious violation of the nuclear safeguard agreement,  such as removing seals from the fuel rod container, the team may  suspend the scheduled inspections.    "We just want to check and see for ourselves and then we'll  all be much wiser," Heinonen told KYODO NEWS SERVICE in Beijing.    Heinonen, who has been to North Korea "many times," refused  to comment on the nuclear situation there, nor would he comment  on whether his team shares any concerns over North Korean safety  precautions.    "We've been to many countries and we've seen many plants and  many situations," he said.    The Yongbyon plant is at present supposedly undergoing its  initial refueling, although U.S. intelligence reports say the  plant may have been refueled in 1989.    The IAEA inspectors hope to verify whether refueling took  place in 1989 and whether or not any of the spent fuel has been  diverted to other uses, particularly military uses.    The IAEA team also hopes to inspect a laboratory that it was  denied access to during an uncompleted inspection in March,  Heinonen said.    Western countries suspect the lab is involved in a program  to  produce nuclear arms.    Heinonen said his team will collect as much data as possible  and return "in about a week" to Vienna where the inspectors will  formulate a report with other IAEA experts.</p>

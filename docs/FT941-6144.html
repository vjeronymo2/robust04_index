			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Railtrack to inherit Pounds 2bn of BR debt Railtrack, the company which takes over responsibility for British Rail's track and signalling in April, will inherit Pounds 2bn worth of BR debt, Mr Bob Horton, BR chairman, said yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes. Railtrack will have to achieve a return on its Pounds 6.5bn of assets which will allow it to service that debt, Mr Horton told a conference of the Bow Group, a Conservative think-tank. It has already been set a target by the government of a 5.6 per cent return on assets, rising to 8 per cent after four years. Railtrack has yet to decide whether to continue to service the debt or make an early repayment, the company said. The final details of Railtrack's financial arrangements with the government will be decided soon. The broad outline was announced by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, last month with an announcement that Railtrack expected to levy track charges of Pounds 2.2bn on train operating companies. That would be matched by subsidies.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Anglo-Scots pipeline is mooted SCOTTISH Enterprise, the development body in Scotland, may study the feasibility of building a privately funded pipeline to carry water from southern Scotland and northern England to the drought-prone south of England. The pipeline, which would involve a 140-mile tunnel through the Pennines, might cost Pounds 1.5bn. The idea has run into opposition, as the Scottish Office considers privatising the water industry . Scottish Enterprise may contribute Pounds 500,000 to a two-year project study. Consulting engineer Mott MacDonald is understood to be interested, as is Bank of America. The scheme would take water from the rivers Nith, Dee and Annan in Scotland, gather water from the rivers Eden and Esk in north-west England before going to Kielder reservoir in Northumbria. The pipeline would then go by tunnel to Carsington, where it would link with the water supply system for East Anglia and south-east England.</p>

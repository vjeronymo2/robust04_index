Superficially and without going into details, he has  responded to those who have dared to question the presence of  these troops in the country. The U.S. troops are already in  Juanchaco, but the debate on whether their presence should have  received Senate approval is just beginning to get hot.    [Begin Senator Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa recording] What is  understood by the term troops is an armed and trained group  under the command of an officer and the flag of a certain  country. This is exactly what came to Colombia. [end recording]    Notwithstanding, the president told Senators Fabio Valencia  and Gustavo Rodriguez, who demanded an explanation, the  construction of a school and a health center did not merit a  report to the Senate.    [Begin Senator Rodriguez recording] As a result of this  theory or subterfuge by the president, which I believe is an  effort to disregard the Constitution, we are yielding our  national sovereignty to foreign troops, no more and no less.  [end recording]    In addition, the Defense Ministry explained the entry of  U.S.  troops is backed by a mutual assistance defense agreement signed  in 1952.    [Begin Carrizosa recording] The Constitution takes priority  over any agreement signed by the Defense Ministry in 1952 and  the Constitution demands permission from the Senate. [end  recording]    While the controversy continues, 259 U.S. soldiers are in  various parts of the country working on construction projects in  spite of the opposition.</p>

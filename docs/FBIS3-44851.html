			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jan (XINHUA) -- Zhang Junsheng, deputy  director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, held that despite its  repeated expressed hopes of resuming the negotiations, the  British side has hitherto not shown sincerity.    When he arrived in Hong Kong on 7 January for a visit,  Deputy  British Foreign Secretary Goodlad indicated that the British  side is ready to hold further talks with the Chinese side on the  three-level framework and the "through train" issue. In  answering a question on this issue asked by a Hong Kong media  reporter, Zhang Junsheng said:    The Chinese side has always hoped that there will be  "through  trains." The Basic Law has also made arrangements concerning  this matter. Even when Patten dished out his "three violations"  political reform program in October 1992, which undermined the  "through train" arrangement, the Chinese side was still willing  to continue the negotiations. During the 17 rounds of  Sino-British talks, it was the British side which closed the  door to negotiations.    Zhang Junsheng said: If the British side sincerely hopes for  a resumption of talks, it must withdraw completely Patten's  [political reform] program which has been submitted to the  Legislative Council and demonstrate its sincerity to the Chinese  side through an official diplomatic channel. But up to now, the  British side has not yet given any official, explicit reply.</p>

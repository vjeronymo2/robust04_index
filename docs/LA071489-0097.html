			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Vestron Misses Payment: Vestron Inc. said it will consider a merger or sale of  all or part of the company. Best known as a videocassette company, Vestron  scored a hit in the movie business with "Dirty Dancing" but last week missed a  payment on a $25-million note owed to Wells Fargo Bank. The Connecticut-based  company said it will still produce "Dirty Dancing II," but it has asked its  financial advisers to continue trying to raise money or find a purchaser for  "The Video Store," its retail video operations.  </P></p>

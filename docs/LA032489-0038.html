			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SEA-CHANGE AT GULLIVER'S IN MARINA DEL REY  </P> <P> It's obvious now that Gulliver's was all wrong for Marina del Rey. Flagons of  ale, serving wenches, the beef of Olde England -- pshaw! A boaty seafood  restaurant, that's what the Marina really wanted all along.  </P> <P> So the old Gulliver's has been metamorphosed into Marinela -- stripped and  sanded and put through a total sea-change so that the wood no longer looks dark  and clubby but sun-bleached and salt-pitted. The ceiling is now full of  bright-colored catamaran sails and the effect is quite boaty indeed. In fact,  the decks can get pretty crowded on a weekend.  </P> <P> Avast the hearty trencherman motif; Marinela is for oceanic grazing. There are  only six steaks and chops against a couple of dozen seafood entrees, to say  nothing of 50-odd appetizers and salads. The owner is also the proprietor of  the Bicycle Cafe, so we can expect a degree of eclecticism: the odd dash of  curry, salmon with dill here and there, a New England clam chowder. Mostly,  though, the food is Mediterranean.  </P> <P> And altogether it's pretty lively -- things like charred swordfish with lime  butter, or an appetizer of scampi grilled until they get an almond-like flavor,  served on three-colored pasta. It must be said that Marinela does sometimes go  overboard on pasta. The well-cooked osso buco (oddly topped with orange peel  instead of lemon peel) comes with linguine instead of rice, practically  impossible to eat with the wide-tined fork and the thin sauce.  </P> <P> At one point, Marinela announced it would be a Basque restaurant. All that's  left of that idea, apparently, is a simple dish of chicken stewed with  tomatoes, peppers and strong-flavored, paper-thin slices of Basque ham, and a  fish chowder called thoro (often spelled ttoro, and correctly pronounced  something like "choro" in Basque). However you spell it, thoro is a winner,  thickened with toasted bread crumbs and strongly dosed with saffron.  </P> <P> Saffron, in fact, is a dominating note here. There's a wonderful appetizer of  poached oysters flavored with saffron and aniseed and topped with a buttery  froth. There are mushrooms stuffed with crab in a surprisingly serious crab  sauce (more saffron), and very acceptable paella with chicken, mussels, clams  and saffron. Of course there's bouillabaisse, consisting mostly of shellfish in  this case, with a lot of saffron and Pernod.  </P> <P> The small onion tart on the appetizer list is a little odd, a puff pastry shell  filled with threads of onion that have been fried dark brown in oil and topped  with some black olives. It's savory but rather oily, and really more like an  overgrown canape than an onion tart. The only real clinker I've found here,  though, was a shrimp cocktail with shamefully mushy prawns.  </P> <P> For dessert there are a lot of ice creams in such concoctions as a mocha and  hazelnut coupe, but mostly it's a big pastry selection. The most distinctive  are a warm apple tart (made with ordinary apple slices rather than the usual  paper-thin ones) and an elaborate strawberry shortcake, more or less a frosted  cake with whole strawberries in the filling.  </P> <P> So it's the end of a beef-oriented era at this location. Those sounds you hear  are the clatter of mussels in sauce poulette and the crunch of calamari. And  the creaking of the yardarm and the keening of the gale, too, I suppose.  </P> <P>  Marinela, 13181 Mindanao Way, Marina del Rey. (213) 821-8866. Open for lunch  and dinner daily. Full bar. Parking lot. American Express, Diners Club,  MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $41 to $73.  </P> <P> </P></p>

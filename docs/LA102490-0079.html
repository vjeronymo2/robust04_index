			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-HOSTAGE'S JOY IS TEMPERED BY THOSE STILL HELD  </P> <P> Jack Frazier's days as an American hostage inside a Baghdad safe house passed  quickly enough. The Santa Ana man filled the long hours scouring the home's  upstairs bathrooms and leading a daily exercise class for 20 fellow hostages.  On Fridays, he would cook for the others sharing the house.  </P> <P> But after dark, the pain and pressure of captivity would bear down on him, the  53-year-old construction superintendent said Tuesday. Too much time to think  about mistakes, about little slights done to loved ones.  </P> <P> "I think the worst part that I had was the nights," Frazier said during a phone  interview from his Amman, Jordan, hotel room, where he was taken along with 13  other American hostages released by Iraq Tuesday.  </P> <P> "When you shut the light out at night, your mind kind of plays games on you.  Incidents would pop back in my mind that I didn't really handle too well. I may  have got upset at my son. At the time, it wasn't a major item. But when you  wake up at 2 in the morning and say, 'My God, I'm in Baghdad and I'm a  hostage!' Well, it makes you place appreciation and affection on things that  maybe were trivial before."  </P> <P> After arriving in Amman, Frazier immediately called his mother and fiancee in  Whitefish, Mont., and his daughter, Kimberly Albrecht, in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "It's a mixture of the happiest day in my life, and the anticipation of getting  everybody else back home safely," an emotionally shaken Albrecht said after  speaking to her father.  </P> <P> Frazier will fly to New York today, catch up on some sleep and arrive in Los  Angeles on Thursday, he said.  </P> <P> "I guarantee you," he said, laughing, "I will kiss the ground on arrival."  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the 14 Americans released  Tuesday included six from a list of 69 people in urgent need of medical care.  Frazier, a construction crew manager for San Francisco-based Bechtel Power  Corp., is a diabetic who takes oral medication.  </P> <P> Frazier was among 700 to 800 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait since Aug. 2,  when Iraq invaded the small emirate.  </P> <P> Iraqis call them "special guests," and while those in the group were not  rounded up and detained, they have been hostages since shortly after the  conflict erupted, when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein banned the departure of  thousands of foreigners whose governments are trying to drive him out of  Kuwait.  </P> <P> For the first three weeks after the invasion, Frazier remained at the Sheraton  Hotel, where he had been living. Then, he and numerous other Americans were  told to move to the American Embassy or other safe havens. Frazier declined to  identify where he stayed because other hostages are still there.  </P> <P> Frazier said he spent the past several weeks in a two-story house, a hostage  without blindfold or physical torture but trapped nonetheless.  </P> <P> "I was most certainly being held against my will," he said Tuesday. "We were  told not to go outside for our own safety."  </P> <P> Frazier said he was told not to discuss why he and the others were selected for  release. But he said a group of Iraqi-born Americans called the Iraqi  Businessman's Assn. secured freedom for the 14 hostages after discussions with  Hussein.  </P> <P> When he left Baghdad, he said, it was with a mixture of relief and anguish.  </P> <P> "One of the toughest moments in my life was when I got into the vehicle and  stood there and saw my friends who remain," he said. "I found it rather  difficult to even put the feeling into words. It's been eight hours since then  . . . but it's tough. They are friends for life, those people."  </P> <P> Albrecht said her father was saddened during his departure from Iraq because he  did not want to leave the other hostages who, because of their unique ordeal,  had become "bonded together."  </P> <P> "He was crying on the flight out of Baghdad," she said. "My father was working  with the Iraq-American (group) over there. He wanted to make sure there is  nothing more that he can do before he leaves the Middle East. He said he would  do everything he could to help get the rest of the hostages out of there."  </P> <P> It would be three weeks after the Iraqi invasion before Frazier's family  learned that he was alive in Baghdad. Prayers, Albrecht said, were the family's  only solace.  </P> <P> "We were very worried. It took about three weeks for us to receive word from  the State Department," said Albrecht, who, during the two-month ordeal, has  acted on behalf of her family with State Department representatives. In turn,  she would contact each member of the Frazier family, including her two  brothers, Scott of Santa Ana and Robert, a captain in the U.S. Army at Ft. Ord.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the emotional roller-coaster finally ended for the family.  </P> <P> The ride for Frazier himself wasn't quite over. Still revved up from his ordeal  and travels, Frazier talked eloquently of the life lessons he had learned as a  hostage.  </P> <P> "At 53 years old, I've got a whole new education," he said with a sigh. "I  learned a lot of compassion. I've learned that there's a lot of agony and pain  in this world that I wasn't aware of, and that there's a lot of very hard  people who have no compassion.  </P> <P> "The comrades I was with, we tried very, very hard to bolster each other and  not allow each other to get down," Frazier said. "But at night, you look out,  and you see the stars, and you wonder: 'I wonder what my daughter's doing? I  wonder what my fiancee's doing?' Nobody can tell you what an emotional  roller-coaster it is."  </P> <P> Frazier several weeks ago said he hoped "when this history finally is written,  and that last chapter is over, I will get a chance to read it."  </P> <P> Now on his way home, he said, he hopes to work on his health, to find a new job  with Bechtel and catch a couple of homes games of his beloved but beleaguered  Los Angeles Rams.  </P> <P> "I think things will turn around for them now," he said confidently.  </P></p>

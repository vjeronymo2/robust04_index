			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Nationals help Utd Newspapers to Pounds 110m A STRONG performance by Express Newspapers helped lift United Newspapers to pre-tax profits of Pounds 110m in 1992. Operating profit rose 14 per cent, from Pounds 104m to Pounds 119m, on sales of Pounds 832m (Pounds 819m). Lord Stevens, United's chairman, said the improvement in operating profit reflected 'an excellent performance in Express Newspapers and encouraging results elsewhere, most notably in regional newspapers, US advertising periodicals, Morgan-Grampian and PR Newswire.' The higher profit levels had been achieved despite 'acute competition and poor trading conditions.' Operating profit at the group's national newspapers - the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star - increased 36 per cent from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 33m, helped by the relaunch of the Sunday Express as a tabloid. Overall profit figures are complicated not just by the FRS 3 accounting standard, but also by disposals, closures and investments. The Pounds 110m pre-tax figure, up from an adjusted Pounds 48.8m the previous year, also benefited from a net Pounds 10.4m from the sale of Reuter shares. The 1991 figures included net exceptional costs of Pounds 28.8m relating to losses on the sale of businesses. The restatement reflects the altered treatment of goodwill. Excluding all the exceptional items, pre-tax profit rose from Pounds 77.6m to Pounds 99.5m. A 0.5p increase takes the final dividend to 14p and the year's total to 21.5p (21p). Earnings rose from 10.9p to 40.1p. Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at Kleinwort Benson, described the result as 'good across the board.' Given the degree of cost-cutting achieved the company seemed well placed for recovery. Mr Terrington is looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 110m next year, against Pounds 99.5m this time excluding exceptionals. Mr Graham Wilson, group managing director, warned that any signs of economic recovery were patchy and specific to individual publishing markets. The share price rose 17p to 588p.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL TO STUDY RELOCATION OF SKILLS CENTER;  </P> <P> PASADENA: THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW PLANS TO PUT THE CENTER ON A  CITY-OWNED SITE IN A LARGELY RESIDENTIAL AREA.  </P> <P> Mayor Jess Hughston on Tuesday appointed a 10-person citizens committee to  study a controversial proposal to build a permanent home for Pasadena City  College's 22-year-old Community Skills Center at a city-owned site in East  Pasadena.  </P> <P> The skills center, which provides job training and English-language  instruction, is now at McKinley Junior High school. The plan for its relocation  will also be scrutinized by city staff members.  </P> <P> The Board of Directors voted 6 to 0 to consider the matter after hundreds of  skills center supporters appeared at Tuesday night's board meeting, many  wearing green buttons reading, "C.S.C. Just Say Yes."  </P> <P> Hughston abstained, since he is an instructor at Pasadena City College, which  plays a part in operating the center.  </P> <P> But a number of people who live near the proposed site also showed up to  protest having the skills center in their largely residential area.  </P> <P> "We do not object to the skills center; we do not object to the people who go  to the skills center," said Pat Rowan, of the Daisy Villa Homeowners Assn. "But  every time we say we don't want the traffic, we don't want the environmental  impact, we are treated as if we are attacking motherhood."  </P> <P> Rowan said more than 800 neighbors have signed petitions against the skills  center, compared to only 118 residents who have signed petitions supporting it.  </P> <P> In response to the homeowners' concerns, directors also instructed the  committee and staff to investigate building homes on the 8.5-acre site.  </P> <P> The site, at 3000 East Orange Grove Blvd., lies underneath Southern California  Edison power lines, east of Sierra Madre Boulevard. It is a narrow strip of  land that stretches from Orange Grove south to Foothill Boulevard.  </P> <P> Plans call for two 25,000-square-foot buildings on the site and a parking lot  for up to 600 cars. A student cafeteria and a child development center would  also be included.  </P> <P> College officials said building costs have not yet been determined. They hope  that state funds can be used to finance the construction.  </P> <P> About 7,000 adults attend the skills center each year. "Literally thousands of  lives have been changed," said Jack Scott, president of Pasadena City College.  </P> <P> The center is a joint project of the city, the college, which staffs and  operates it, and the Pasadena Unified School District, which has provided a  site for the last 10 years at McKinley Junior High at 325 S. Oak Knoll Ave.  </P> <P> However, the district has informed college officials that it may soon reclaim  the McKinley site for use as a middle school.  </P> <P> City officials turned to the East Pasadena site because it is the only publicly  owned piece of land that can accommodate the skills center, City Director  Kathryn Nack said.  </P> <P> "We have been looking for eight years," Nack said. "Each (of the three  agencies) has scoured their property and has not been able to come up with  anything of that size."  </P> <P> But resident Kenneth Moye said the skills center would create traffic problems,  with up to 4,000 auto trips a day through the area.  </P> <P> Other residents said they feared that the skills center will need to expand in  the future and that the residential land surrounding the site would be  converted to parking lots and fast food restaurants to accommodate the  students. Some complained that they would lose their back-yard view of open  space.  </P> <P> But after hearing their opposition, City Director John Crowley appeared to lose  patience with the residents, saying, "I'm getting a little bit of a sense that  you don't want any change at all."  </P> <P> Opposition from neighborhood groups put a stop to previous city development  plans for the site as an auto mall and a retail store.  </P> <P> The current proposal will be studied until February, 1991, when final hearings  are planned.  </P> <P> Those appointed to the citizens committee are Robert Ahfeldt, Vincent  DeStefano, Christopher Love, Lucille Lyon, Tom May, Michael McEvoy, Robert  Monk, Kenneth Moye, Tim Price and John Takvorian.  </P></p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Spending at the European Bank: President rejects criticism over slowness in committing funds COMPLAINTS about the EBRD's slowness in committing funds and its lengthy bureaucratic procedures are commonplace in east and central Europe. But criticism is often tempered by appreciation of the way the tireless Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, visits the far-flung outposts in his chartered jet, helping to remind the world of this vast area's growing problems. Compared with the Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn) of equity investment poured into the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland by multinational companies and private investors in the past three years, the disbursement of Ecu126m (Pounds 101m) is minimal. But Mr Attali is adamant that it is 'wrong to measure the bank in terms of (loan and equity) disbursements . . . I don't see the slow disbursement as a problem in itself, because it's a demonstration of cautiousness. It's not a sign of failure'. For example, the bank has spent an estimated Ecu80m (Pounds 63m) on 'technical co-operation programmes', which are typically studies of the appropriate methods for modernising infrastructure or of how to carry out privatisation programmes. He also says that even if the institution had not lent a penny since its launch, its existence would have been justified by the recent creation of the Nuclear Safety Fund which consists of money donated by western governments to make safe the nuclear power stations of the former eastern bloc. The nub of the issue is why disbursement has been so low. The problem does not appear to be that the bank has been excessively slow in approving loans and investments. The bank has built up a substantial 'pipeline' of its own and joint projects in various stages of maturity. These often focus on much-needed projects unlikely to attract commercial attention - such as a small power plant in war-impoverished Armenia, or privatisation in St Petersburg. By the end of last year the board had approved projects with an EBRD contribution of Ecu1.8bn, only slightly less than the bank had forecast for the period. Potential borrowers have not, however, met the conditions needed for them to draw on this finance. There is an important intermediate stage in the status of an EBRD project between board approval and disbursement. That is the stage when all parties to the deal have signed the contract. Only 53 projects, involving bank finance of Ecu1bn, had been signed by the end of February - well below the forecast level. Mr Attali says the main cause of the delays in signing off on the deals is impossible for the bank to control - it is the inexperience of eastern European countries in the process of negotiating and concluding such deals. The bank does have control over disbursing the funds once the contract is signed. It will distribute the funds only when it is certain that the project is going ahead. The reason, says Mr Attali, is that he is particularly concerned about possible fraud. 'I would prefer that we do not take risks and find our money has been transferred to a Swiss bank.' That precaution seems sensible in view of the widespread allegations of fraudulent behaviour in the region. But up until now many of the investments made by the bank's merchant-banking arm have involved foreign investors - such as Air France, Nestle and BSN in the Czech republic or General Motors in Poland. The slowness of disbursement may have been exacerbated by one of its fundamental investment tenets - that its equity injections should only be a small proportion of the amount that it lends. According to Mr Attali an equity injection can be used for working capital or for investment, and disbursement can rapidly follow approval of the finance. Loans are often made to finance infrastructure projects, however, such as improvements of roads or telecommunications, or oil and gas production. Bank funds are released only as physical progress is made with these projects. Mr Pierre Pissaloux, director in charge of planning and budget, said equity was typically disbursed in full two years after approval. The rate of disbursal for an infrastructure loan was much slower, however, taking five to eight years. Mr Pissaloux said the bank had set itself a target of disbursing between Ecu700m and Ecu820m this year. It also planned to approve more than 100 new projects, with a bank contribution of between Ecu2bn and Ecu2.6bn. If the rate of disbursement fell below target its shareholders might encourage it to approve more equity injections. That would require the bank to take more risks, however, since equity investments are by definition more risky - and anyway potentially viable businesses are currently thin on the ground in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Mr Attali said: 'I think there is a real choice for the bank. I need to have the clear view of shareholders.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article; part 28 in the series "The Coalition </F> -- A Revolving Stage": "Strange Phenomena in Nagata-cho at  Year-End; Dietmen Uneasy, Caught by the Wind of the Diet  Dissolving"]    [Text] With the formulation of the 1994 budget having been  passed over into next year, Nagata-cho [town where the Diet is  located, thus referring to the Diet itself] at a year-end like  this year's would normally be bustling with people from the  dietmen's constituencies arriving at their offices to make all  kinds of petitions and requests. But this year, Nagata-cho is  strangely calm, and the dietmen are uneasy.    Deliberations on political reform bills in the House of  Councillors are not making progress, and the dietmen hear  leaders of both ruling and opposition camps making unsettling  comments like "the lower house should be dissolved and a general  election conducted" if the bills fail to get passed.    On 17 December, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and Wataru Kubo, general  secretary of the party, met at party headquarters.  <H5>  Party Leaders With Aching Heads </H5>   One said: "With things in this state, there is no other  choice but to dissolve the Diet and hold a general election."  The other agreed, "Maybe we should start getting ready for it."    But they need funds to prepare for a general election, and  the party's vault is empty. One senior party secretariat  official said: "We need at least 1.2 billion yen in election  funds just for the party headquarters." The party raised only a  little over 1 billion yen for the last general election held in  July -- 600 million donated by supporting trade unions and the  balance borrowed from banks. The party is not sure when it can  pay back the outstanding bank debts.    The senior secretariat official said in anguish: "How can we  raise the needed money?" The secretariat first thought about  providing 1 million yen to each current lower house member in  the year-end operational funds. But they were unable to come up  with the 76 million yen necessary for that, and had to give up  the idea.    Things have not been going well with the SDPJ recently,  anyway. Some within the party think the party should avoid the  situation of dissolving the Diet if possible. They say if the  party starts preparing for an election, it could give an  impression to other parties that the election is forthcoming,  thus causing alarm. Their thinking is that there is no reason  why the money-short SDPJ should act rashly.    Within the coalition camp, even Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] has not provided year-end "gift expenses" to its members.  The ostensible reason for this is that the party has no money,  but one senior party member admitted: "If they go back home and  run around using the money, it can put fire in the mood for Diet  dissolution."  <H5>  Local Constituencies Are Not in the Mood </H5>   The fact is that local districts are not in the mood for  another general election yet. A senior Shinseito member said:  "If I go back to my district and suggest an election, all I  hear is `what do you intend to do about economic stimulus  measures?'" A Komeito official said: "The supporters' mood is  that we had an election only half a year ago; do not even talk  about another election."    Speaking at a gathering held in commemoration of the late  Dietman Shigeru Hori on the evening of 20 December, Shunpei  Tsukahara, who is in charge of finance at the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], said: "I was afraid of how much political  donations I would be able to raise from corporations. But the  funds for the latter half of this year have come in. In  addition, the banks have agreed to extend our debt payment. If  the election is to come, we have ample money. Please rest  assured of that."    In September following the changing of hands in government,  the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren]  decided it should stop recommending its member corporations  donating to political parties. And at the time of the July  general election, the LDP had to borrow about 14.5 billion yen.  With the current economic woes coming on top of that, the LDP's  treasury should be hard-put as well.  <H5>  LDP Forwards Money Through Banks </H5>   Anyway, insisting that the lower house can be dissolved any  day, the party financial division got banks to accept extension  of its payment of 4.5 billion yen due this year. The party's  calculation is that "if it has about 10 billion at its disposal,  it will be able to manage the next election somehow. Tsukara's  remarks about "resting assured" probably meant that the party  would be able to cope with a financial pinch that comes at the  end of a year.    On the following day -- 21 December -- the LDP gave out  the traditional year-end "gift expenses" of 3 million yen each  to about 210 upper and lower house members of the grade who have  not been named to cabinet posts yet. But now being a time when  political reform is so widely talked about, the party leadership  agonized over whether it should distribute the money until the  last moment. With speculations on the Diet's dissolution rising  and with the party Diet members calling for funds, the party  eventually decided to give out the money as it has done in the  past. However, the amount given out this year was smaller than  in previous years and it was forwarded through banks where money  flow can be said to be highly transparent. Apparently, the  party was concerned about how the public will see it.    Now, there is the question of whether or not the lower house  will be dissolved. No doubt, the deliberations on the political  reform bills in January foretell a danger comparable to trying  to foretell who will win in a duel of warriors. There are not  enough days for the bills to be acted on, while the gap between  the ruling and opposition camps is not narrowing. The coalition  parties often fall into disarray. There is no denying that the  situation is grave, and that if the bills do not get passed,  political responsibility will be asked in the form of the  cabinet resigning or the Diet dissolving.    Shinseito General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, who is a pillar of  the ruling coalition, declared on 20 December that he was going  into a "rest" and has not showed up since in any official  meeting. Among the ruling coalition, there are many  speculations about this, and one Social Democratic Party  official asked, "Could he be doing something about a showdown in  January?"    The LDP is poised to be tough. Party General Secretary  Yoshiro Mori declared: "An opposition party must be able to  respond to the call for Diet dissolution at all times." But a  senior member of the party's Obuchi faction admitted: "All that  we can say is we will respond. We now have less power to  initiate Diet dissolution from our side." With so many general  contractor-involved scandals being brought into the open  recently, one official said: "We are not too confident about  winning in an election."    On 21 December, a plenary session of the party Tax Research  Council was held at party headquarters. They had orange juice  ready for 80 people. But only 25, including senior officials,  were present. Until last year, some 100 Diet members had  attended such events. With representatives of industrial  organizations and officials concerned of government offices also  attending, people used to overflow into corridors outside the  hall where the meeting was held. The dietmen sense the rising  air for the Diet's dissolution. Many of them have gone back  home, and are running around their districts.</p>

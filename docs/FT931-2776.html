			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs say Lamont should seek further public spending cuts in November THE fundamental review of public spending announced in February will be essential in meeting the tough targets for reducing the proportion of national income spent by the state, Mr Portillo said yesterday, Alison Smith writes. Some Tory MPs have already said they believe that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should have revised the spending plans downwards on Tuesday, or should be seeking further public spending cuts in November. Officials in the four departments making up the first stage of the fundamental review - social security, health, education and the Home Office  -are already working on areas where savings could be made. After initial ministerial discussion preliminary results of that work will go to the public-spending cabinet in June. Mr Portillo warned there were 'hard decisions ahead'.</p>

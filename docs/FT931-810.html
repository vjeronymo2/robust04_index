			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A rare package: cheap and simple  -Computing ONE OF the healthiest developments in software is the increasing interest vendors are taking in the Soho ('Small Office, Home Office') market. All the big companies - Lotus, WordPerfect, Microsoft - are active here. The most common Soho product is the integrated package, combining the three base applications of word processor, spreadsheet and database into one. So, for example, you can use the word processor to write your letters, the spreadsheet to keep track of sales and purchases, and the database to store names and addresses of contacts. Integrated packages are the Ford Sierras of the software market. Although attention invariably focusses on the Rolls Royce products, for most of us an integrated package will more than fit the bill, and at a bargain price too. Why pay Pounds 300-Pounds 400 apiece for Microsoft's Word and Excel when Works for Windows gives you the essentials of both packages plus a very decent personal database, all for Pounds 145 the lot? So it is worth notice that this month's edition of PC Magazine evaluates eight of the leading integrated packages on the market. Anyone who has tried reading product reviews in computer magazines will know that many are incomprehensible, written by experts who are difficult for the layman to understand. PC Magazine is written for the corporate power user and its reviews run true to form, with tests to find out which package is the fastest in handling documents 15,000 words long or spreadsheets 100,000 characters in size. In real life few will buy an integrated package for this sort of heavyweight application. PC Magazine also conducts 'useability tests'. A group of office employees with experience of word processors and spreadsheets were given a set of tasks to perform on each package. Their progress and their responses were monitored. In contrast to the reviews, which can be safely ignored, PC Magazine's useability reports deserve close study, since they give the best approximation to how a new user is likely to get on with a package. The overall winner of the eight tested and 'editor's choice' was Microsoft Works (so it should have been, since it was virtually identical to what many of the testers were used to already). Works is a classic package and superb value for money. I use it myself. However, it is a sophisticated piece of software which presumes considerable prior knowledge of computer concepts. The manual and on-line tutorial contain reference material only and help the experienced user, rather than the beginner. Most Soho users are working on their own and cannot call upon outside help. Nor can they afford to call in training consultants or to go off on courses at Pounds 350 per day like the corporate user. So Microsoft Works may not be ideal for novices unless they are the sort who relish a challenge and have bags of time to puzzle everything out. If the main reason for buying a computer is to improve productivity, it becomes self-defeating if the buyer then has to drop everything else for a fortnight in order to learn how to use it. I would guess that some intelligent layman learning by trial and error, might take between three to 12 months to master all of Microsoft Works, with a lot of wasted time and false starts. Software packages grow ever more complex, packed with more and more features. There are few on the market about which one can say to an intelligent novice who does not need sophisticated features: 'This is the package you want; it is simple and straightforward and all the help you need is in the manual' and be confident that they can start being productive right away. The only such integrated package I can think of is PFS First Choice from Spinaker Corporation, included in the PC Magazine review and praised by the testers for its simplicity as 'a good choice for novices and home users.' If you just want to do the basics and are willing to forgo the fancy fonts and graphics in order to become productive quickly, PFS-First Choice is the package to get. The normal price is Pounds 159, but PC World stores (part of Dixons) are offering both PFS-First Choice and its companion PFS-First Publisher, a desk-top publishing package, for Pounds 79. The manuals of both contain really excellent tutorials which will get you off to a flying start. Also on offer are Windows versions of both packages. These are more 'modern' and sophisticated, but if it is productivity you want you've got to keep it simple. Stick to the older DOS versions. PC World stores are at Croydon (081-649-9000), Lakeside (0708-869869), Brentford (081-560-0000) and Staples Corner (081-450-0909). Alternatively, contact Spinnaker on 081-742-7222.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: European drugs market stagnant Europe's drugs market continued to stagnate during the first 10 months of last year, following healthcare reforms in Italy and Germany. The value of the seven largest markets fell, in dollar terms, from Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28.8bn) during the 10 months to October 1992, to only Dollars 37.9bn for the equivalent period last year. Net of exchange rates, the seven markets registered no growth, according to figures compiled by IMS International, the specialist market research company. Germany remained the market most severely hit. Pharmacy drugs sales fell 10 per cent at constant exchange rates, down from Dollars 12.25bn to Dollars 10.4bn following the Seehofer reforms introduced in January last year. The Italian market also fell as sales dropped from Dollars 9.33bn to Dollars 7bn (down 3 per cent in lira terms). The British, Spanish and Dutch markets continued to demonstrate double-digit growth in local currencies. Sales in the UK fell from Dollars 4.6bn to Dollars 4.2bn in dollar terms, but increased 10 per cent in sterling. Spanish sales also fell in dollar terms, down from Dollars 4.1bn to Dollars 3.7bn, but rose 11 per cent in local currency terms. The Dutch market increased from Dollars 1.26bn to Dollars 1.33bn, a rise of 11 per cent in local currency. The French and Belgian markets continued to grow, though more slowly than other markets. Pharmacy sales in France dropped from Dollars 10.1bn to Dollars 9.9bn, but increased 6 per cent in franc terms. The Belgian market was static at Dollars 1.2bn, but rose in local currencies by 5 per cent. Some important therapeutic areas registered zero or negative growth. Sales of cardiovascular drugs dropped from Dollars 9.7bn to Dollars 8.4bn, a decline of 3 per cent in local currencies. This was mostly because of a decline in prescribing patented ace-inhibitors and cholesterol-lowering drugs in Germany. Sales of alimentary and metabolism treatments - mostly H2-antagonists for ulcers - were static in local currency terms, but fell from Dollars 7.3bn to Dollars 6.4bn. Musculo-skeletal drugs - mostly anti-arthritic compounds - registered a 5 per cent decline in local currencies, down from Dollars 2.6bn to Dollars 2bn. Blood agents also recorded a fall, down 3 per cent from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 1.7bn. No therapeutic area registered double-digit growth. Central nervous system treatments increased sales by only 2 per cent, while respiratory drugs - mostly for asthma - were up only 3 per cent. The fastest growing sector was anti-infectives - antibiotics and anti-virals - up 5 per cent in local currencies.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credit Commercial advances 8% Credit Commercial de France, the French banking group, yesterday reported net profits up 8.6 per cent to FFr585.6m (Dollars 110.9m) for the first half of 1994 compared to the same period last year. Mr Charles de Croisset, who took over as chairman last year, said the bank had followed a prudent policy and the profits and quality of its loan risks were good. 'Difficult is not the word,' he said. He said the results marked the return to the 'more classic' performance of the bank after an 'exceptional' period last year in the markets and from sharply higher provisions related to regional banking. Net banking income was unchanged at FFr4.6bn, but operating costs rose 4.2 per cent to FFr3.12bn, which reduced operating profits after depreciation by 7.8 per cent to FFr148bn for the six months to the end of June 1994. Net new provisions declined by 37 per cent to FFr484m, compared with FFr769m in the first half last year and from FFr662.8m in the first half of 1992. Balance sheet assets were up to FFr337bn from FFr318.7bn. Deposits during the first half rose 15.1 per cent to FFr74.2bn compared with FFr64.5bn last time. Credits in the same period rose 2.6 per cent to FFr90.5bn. Mr de Croisset also said that he believed the prospects for the French economy were healthy, with all the indicators suggesting a recovery.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Housing starts beat predictions US housing starts rose by an unexpectedly strong 6.2 per cent in December to an annual rate of 1.54m, the Commerce Department said yesterday, agencies report from New York and Washington. Wall Street economists had expected December housing starts at a 1.43m annual rate. The housing figure, up from 4.3 per cent in November, was coupled with an even more impressive 7.4 per cent increase in building permits last month. Meanwhile, Mr Roger Altman, deputy treasury secretary, said yesterday that fourth quarter growth rate 'could have been' as strong as 6 per cent in real terms. 'It's clear that (the fourth quarter) was a strong quarter - a very strong quarter - and we hope that despite this weather the first quarter will maintain that momentum. . . I'm not suggesting that the first quarter will be in the 6 per cent area. I doubt that very strongly. But it should be a good quarter.' The department said December housing starts, which were up for the fifth month in a row, were at the highest level since January 1990, when they stood at 1.55m. Starts for all last year climbed to an unadjusted 1.29m, the highest annual total since 1.38m in 1989. Economists said the permits increase, to an annual level of 1.475m, suggested more housebuilding strength in the next few months, though building was likely to drop off this month because of the severe cold weather in the east and the Los Angeles earthquake. Vice President Al Gore said recently that gross domestic product could expand at an annual rate of as much as 6 per cent, after eliminating the effects of inflation, in the fourth quarter.</p>

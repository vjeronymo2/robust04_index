			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPTON SCHOOLS PROJECT $7-MILLION SHORTFALL  </P> <P> A shortfall of $7 million to $9 million is projected for next year's school  budget, meaning that more than 70 teachers, clerks, janitors and security  officers could lose their jobs, school officials said this week.  </P> <P> Music and art programs may suffer the most, with five of the district's 10  music instructors listed for elimination in a budget report presented Monday  night to the Compton Unified School District trustees.  </P> <P> "It's not an easy recommendation to bring in," Acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez  told the board.  </P> <P> In direct instructional services alone -- not counting equipment and supply  costs -- the cutbacks may total $2 million to balance the budget, according to  the report. Other proposed cuts range from field trips to $4,500 worth of new  classroom clocks to replace those that have stopped ticking.  </P> <P> The report listed a total of $5.1 million in cuts, which means that additional  cuts would have to be made if shortfall projections are correct.  </P> <P> Use this as sub for grafs now set:  </P> <P> The district's financial staff projected revenues next year of $118.3 million,  but estimated that expenses would surpass revenues by $7 million to $9 million.  </P> <P> Pay increases budgeted for teachers and other employees would add about $8  million in expenses next year, the staff estimated.  </P> <P> The exact amount of next year's shortfall depends in part on the amount of  money the state sends to school districts. If the state money includes a 3%  cost-of-living increase over the amount sent last year, Compton's budget  shortage will be $9 million, said G. Stafford Offerman, the district's  controller.  </P> <P> PU at graf: If the cost-of-living ...  </P> <P> If the cost-of-living increase is hiked to 4.95%, as indicated by some reports  in Sacramento, Offerman said, the shortfall will be only $7.4 million.  </P> <P> Offerman and other district staff members stressed that their budget figures  are only projections at this point, but the financial picture they presented  for the 1990-91 school year is a disappointing one for teachers and other  employees who have gone without raises all year.  </P> <P> The teachers, who complain that they are among the lowest-paid educators in Los  Angeles County, have been pressing for a comprehensive salary revision that  would give pay hikes as high as 12% to the most experienced teachers. The  district has been offering 6% increases.  </P> <P> District officials said Monday night that they included 6% salary increases  this year and next year for all employees in the new budget projections. This  year's increase would be retroactive to the first of the school year.  </P> <P> Representatives of the four unions that bargain for the teachers and other  employees attended the marathon 5 1/2-hour budget session but said little. It  was the first time the union leaders had a look at the budget projections.  </P> <P> Trustees did not say what cuts they would support when it comes time to vote on  the budget, but some voiced opposition to particular cuts.  </P> <P> Board President Mary Henry said she would not support cuts in art and music  programs. "There must be an alternative somewhere," she said.  </P> <P> "A society perishes when the culture goes, and to assume that these children's  education in the visual and performing arts is not as important as reading and  writing is a travesty," Henry said. "We're missing a great wealth of talent in  these kids and they're just going down the drain."  </P> <P> Some trustees said they would support the suggestion to eliminate the  district's public relations director and other staff members in that office,  but others argued that the office works to promote a good image for the  district.  </P> <P> Trustee John Steward said he would oppose proposed cuts in summer programs and  in the district's Camp Comiche, a mountain camp to which the district sends  children on outings.  </P> <P> "You're either going to pay through the program or you're going to pay through  vandalism (in the schools)," he said.  </P></p>

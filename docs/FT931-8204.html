			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Move to reduce secrecy backed FURTHER proposals for removing unnecessary secrecy about the activities of civil servants and ministers are expected to be announced before the end of July. This was revealed in the Commons yesterday when MPs gave an unopposed second reading to the Right to Know Bill. The move was against the advice of Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for identifying areas of excessive government secrecy. The bill is a private member's measure, introduced with cross-party support by Mr Mark Fisher, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent central. It seeks to advance the cause of open government by providing the public with a general right of access to most official records. The bill, which also requires companies to include in annual reports details of convictions for breaching health and safety regulations, has little chance of becoming law.</p>

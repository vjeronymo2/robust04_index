			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Noranda soars after asset sales Noranda, the Canadian resources group, has reported sharply higher second-quarter earnings, thanks to rising commodity prices, favourable currency movements and a reduced stake in Falconbridge, the nickel producer. Net earnings jumped to CDollars 81m (USDollars 59m), or 35 cents a share, from CDollars 1m, equal to a loss of 7 cents per common share, a year earlier. Revenues climbed to CDollars 1.57bn from CDollars 1.3bn. The latest figures include CDollars 21m in net gains from asset sales, notably as a result of a reduction in Noranda's stake in Falconbridge from 50 per cent to 47.5 per cent. Falconbridge recently completed a public share offering, and Noranda began fully consolidating the nickel producer's results from June 30. Mr David Kerr, chief executive, predicted a further improvement in the second half based on continued buoyancy in demand and prices for most of Noranda's products. Mining and metals contributed second-quarter earnings of CDollars 51m, up from CDollars 22m a year earlier. The increase was due to higher nickel, copper and gold output, and rising precious metal, potash and aluminium prices. Noranda Forest's earnings climbed to CDollars 23m from CDollars 8m, reflecting buoyant lumber, panelboard and pulp markets. Oil and gas earnings rose to CDollars 18m from CDollars 4m. More than half the increase came from the sale of assets. Higher natural gas prices and oil production were partly offset by lower oil prices.</p>

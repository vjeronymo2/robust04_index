			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: FNFC It seems a brazen move on the part of First National Finance Corporation to launch a rights issue after two years of losses which have seen group net assets shrink to Pounds 135m from Pounds 217m. Nor does it look good for the company that its plans were so widely trailed by the press in advance. The rights issue, which takes the form of convertible preference shares, carries unusually seductive terms, a gross yield of 9.3 per cent and a conversion price actually below last night's close. The immediate assumption could thus be that this is a cynical rescue issue in which shareholders will eventually find the promised resumption of dividends is being paid out of their own money. That would be unfair. Although the parent company does need to bolster its balance sheet, the consumer credit division at last has a recovery story to tell - witness the turnround from loss of Pounds 12.8m in the first half of last year to profit of Pounds 8.2m in the second. The risky lending of the late 1980s is being increasingly replaced with new, better quality loans, but - thanks to the absence of competition - margins are holding up. They should increase further in the current year since lower money market rates have reduced the cost of financing fixed rate consumer loans. Quite how far this will benefit 1992-93 results is hard to predict. There remain considerable problems with the commercial loan division which still has a net loan book of Pounds 262m after provisions. About Pounds 5m of the second-half consumer lending profits may not recur. The consumer credit division still relies on its ability to securitise its loan book in order to pay off bank borrowings. At least, in its anxiety to ensure success, the company has offered any shareholders who remain nervous rights which they can sell at a profit in the market.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT PRIVACY;  </P> <P> UTILITIES CREDIT-CHECKING BILL STALLS  </P> <P> A bill by Assemblyman Willard H. Murray (D-Paramount) to let gas and electric  utilities join a centralized credit bureau to track down delinquent customers  stalled this week after Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) assailed the  proposal as "a major invasion of individual privacy."  </P> <P> In response to Garamendi's objections, the Senate Energy and Public Utilities  Committee on Monday delayed action on the measure until the Legislature returns  to the Capitol after its four-week summer recess, which begins Friday.  </P> <P> Murray's bill has two key provisions. One is designed to ensure that a decision  by a public utility to require a security deposit is based only upon the credit  history of the customer and not a relative or roommate.  </P> <P> The second part -- which prompted criticism from Garamendi -- would require the  California Public Utilities Commission to authorize gas and electric utilities  to participate in a centralized credit check system established in 1985 for the  state's seven largest telephone companies.  </P> <P> The goal of Murray's proposal -- according to an analysis of the bill by the  Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee -- is to help utilities locate  customers who have failed to pay bills and moved to another part of the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Edison Co. Supports It  </P> <P> Tommy Ross, a lobbyist for Southern California Edison Co., said his utility  already shares credit information with other electric companies -- a program  that last year resulted in Edison collecting $665,000 in unpaid bills. He said  Murray's measure, which Edison supports, would allow the electric utilities to  swap similar information with telephone companies and other utilities.  </P> <P> Murray said Tuesday that his original aim was to abolish the requirement for  utility security deposits, which sometimes pose a hardship, especially to poor  people. Supporters say some utilities have sought deposits from new residential  customers based upon the belief that a previous tenant, who failed to pay his  bill, may have been a roommate of the new customer.  </P> <P> Murray said that as a trade-off to remove opposition from utilities, the bill  went beyond spelling out conditions for obtaining a security deposit to provide  utilities "with access to central credit information."  </P> <P> But in an interview Tuesday, Garamendi questioned the value of the trade-off  because "on balance, the consumers aren't going to be better off."  </P> <P> During Monday's committee hearing, Garamendi criticized the legislation,  saying: "Mr. Murray, not to pick on you and your bill, but you're doing far  more than just dealing with security deposits . . . and in my view it is a  major invasion of individual privacy."  </P> <P> Garamendi labeled the bill "a bad one, a real bad one" because "we're really  going to hurt people. . . ." He also scolded Murray for "really putting Big  Brother in place in a big, big way, with no consumer protection."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assembly Passed It  </P> <P> Murray said he did not face similar criticism when the bill was in the  Assembly, which approved the measure last month on a 70-1 vote. He brushed  aside the objections, maintaining that the bill includes consumer protections  because it prohibits public utilities from releasing, transferring or selling  credit information or using it for marketing programs.  </P> <P> Murray also said the intent of the bill is not to set up a new credit check  system, but merely to utilize the system used by telephone companies. Phone  companies exchange information to determine whether, for example, a customer  who has skipped out on a bill is seeking telephone service somewhere else in  the state, according to PUC officials.  </P> <P> Ross, the Edison lobbyist, said the measure could help utilities lower costs if  they could more easily locate customers who failed to pay their bills. If the  legislation becomes law, he said, it would assure that "ratepayers don't have  to subsidize people not paying bills."  </P></p>

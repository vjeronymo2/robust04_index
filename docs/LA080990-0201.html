			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STEERING HOME BUYER TO LENDER FOR FEE CRITICIZED;  </P> <P> MORTGAGES: PRUDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AFFILIATES INC. OF COSTA MESA IS ONE BROKER  WHO ACCEPTS REIMBURSEMENT FROM LENDERS FOR REFERRALS. A TRADE GROUP ASSAILS THE  PRACTICE.  </P> <P> Real estate agents who accept fees for linking home buyers with mortgage  lenders are shortchanging the clients they are paid to represent and the  practice should be made illegal, a congressional panel was told Wednesday.  </P> <P> In testimony before the House banking subcommittee on housing and community  development, a trade group representing mortgage bankers criticized Prudential  Real Estate Affiliates Inc. of Costa Mesa and other real estate brokers who  accept reimbursement from lenders for referring home buyers.  </P> <P> "It is fundamentally wrong for a real estate broker, who is receiving a  substantial commission from the seller of a home, to have a financial interest  in where the buyer of the home gets a mortgage," said Ronnie J. Wynn, president  of the Mortgage Bankers Assn.  </P> <P> Prudential and Citicorp Mortgage have created a computerized loan-origination  system that is made available to real estate agents across the country.  </P> <P> Under Prudential's system, agents help home buyers find mortgages offered by  Prudential and a handful of other participating lenders. When a buyer selects a  mortgage, the lender pays Prudential a fee of $425, and Prudential passes along  $100 to the real estate agent. Prudential says the $100 is to defray the cost  of operating the computer system, not a referral fee.  </P> <P> Citicorp Mortgage lists loans offered only by Citicorp but also pays agents who  use the service.  </P> <P> Most mortgage bankers are excluded from the systems and their trade group said  it wants Congress to outlaw the practice through an amendment to the Real  Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA).  </P> <P> In separate testimony, the National Assn. of Realtors told the subcommittee  that the computer systems do not create conflicts of interest or result in  discrimination against mortgage bankers who do not participate.  </P> <P> The group also said the computers do not increase the cost to consumers of  buying a home. It argued that the listings streamline the process of buying a  home because borrowers can conduct more tasks at the broker's office.  </P> <P> But Wynn said the payments raise the cost of housing, encourage steering of  buyers to participating lenders and discourage competitive mortgage pricing.  </P> <P> "MBA strongly believes referral fees do not add value but create an environment  that could undermine the integrity of the mortgage process, while adding  unnecessary costs to the American home buyer," he said.  </P> <P> The Department of Housing and Urban Development approved Citicorp's  MortgagePower service in 1986 and Prudential's Computerized Loan Origination  System in 1988. Although these are the two biggest networks, mortgage bankers  said smaller systems are springing up around the nation.  </P> <P> Leonard N. Druger, vice chairman of Citicorp, said MortgagePower features  faster loan approvals, limited documentation requirements, reduced origination  costs, and superior levels of service for borrowers.  </P> <P> "There have been virtually no consumer complaints about the program," Druger  said. "In addition, no one has ever brought to our attention a single consumer  complaint filed against our program with HUD. The complaints Citicorp has heard  have been from its competitors. It is the competition, not the consumer, that  has stirred the controversy."  </P> <P> RESPA, which is designed to protect home buyers from excessive closing costs,  bans referral fees but says a broker can be given "reasonable value for  services provided." Real estate agents argue that the fees they receive fall  into the latter category.  </P> <P> A proposed rule banning the fees was tentatively approved by HUD in 1988, but  it was not allowed to take effect.  </P> <P> The computerized system "is not magical, is not a cure-all, and is anything but  objective," said E. Robert Levy, executive director and legal counsel for MBA.  "It is too easy to abuse this system. Congress must stop it. It's an  intolerable conflict. It doesn't work."  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (7): Software becomes the key success factor - Telecommunications in transition TECHNOLOGY has provided the building blocks for the telecommunications systems of the 1990s, but the industry will enter the next century shaped as much by political and economic forces which are pushing towards privatisation, liberalisation and globalisation, writes Paul Taylor. Highly protected national post and telecommunications organisations (PTOs) controlled most domestic and international telecommunications traffic until recently and had little incentive to improve efficiency, introduce new services or cut customer charges. But in the the wake of the court-appointed break-up of the Bell system in the US in the early 1980s other countries, led by the UK in Europe and Japan in the Far East, have begun to adopt policies designed to foster competition. The results have been impressive. In those countries which have liberalised their telecom regimes, competition has led to a wider range of higher quality services, lower prices and larger markets. In Europe, however, liberalisation and privatisation have been a largely British phenomenon so far. But this may be about to change. The UK remains the only EC country with two PTOs, although Germany and France have both introduced competition into mobile telephony and satellite links. Most countries, including Germany, also have full or partial privatisation plans for their PTOs. In Germany, for example, talks between the coalition government and the opposition on the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the German state telephone monopoly, re-opened earlier this month. At the regional level, the European Commission is just completing nearly six months of consultations with the industry, consumers, regulators and member states on the future direction of EC telecommunications policy. The Commission has long advocated liberalisation but has only been able to proceed at the pace of its slowest member. So far, it has only required competition in terminal equipment and data services and not in basic voice telephony - which represents the bulk of the Ecu 110bn European telecoms market. Publication of a Commission report on future telecommunications policy was twice delayed last summer, partly because of concern about its impact on the French Maastricht referendum. When it was finally published in October it laid out four options for the next wave of legislation, ranging from doing nothing to full liberalisation. Initially, commissioners favoured a cautious approach, opening cross-border calls within the EC to competition as a first step. However, senior Commission officials now appear to believe the next wave of EC telecoms legislation should go further. They have been encouraged by signs that the mood of the industry is gradually changing towards supporting the opening all telecommunications traffic to competition, albeit with competition phased over a period as long as 10 years. IN its response, BT urged the Commission to open the European telecoms market to free competition by issuing a directive that would force liberalisation on EC members by January 1, 1995. Mercury Communications took a slightly less strident view, emphasising that while it supports moves towards rapid liberalisation of public voice services and underlying infrastructure throughout the Community, it also believes that process should be phased in beginning with measures to allow competition for cross-border voice services and infrastructure, followed by full liberalisation of national and international voice services and infrastructure. Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition policy, argues that in order to foster competition new entrants 'need time to establish their operations.' Thus, Mercury emphasises that regulation plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between monopoly and effective competition in order to ensure that customers are protected from abuse of market power, and that market conditions encourage the introduction of effective and economic competition. A decision on whether to press for a full liberalisation and harmonisation of voice telephony in the EC is due around mid-May and will be taken by the 17 commissioners, advised by Mr Martin Bangemann, EC commissioner for industry and telecommunications, and Mr Karel van Miert, responsible for competition. The outcome is a matter of considerable speculation at present, not least because Mr Bangemann has only recently added responsibility for telecommunications policy to his industry portfolio and Mr van Miert, a Belgian socialist, has recently taken over competition policy from Sir Leon Brittan. In the meantime, the EC faces a more immediate challenge over public procurement policy from the US. The new Clinton administration has threatened to block EC companies from bidding for millions of dollars' worth of US government contracts in retaliation for what the US says is EC discrimination against US sales of telecommunications and power-generating equipment. Trade friction could also delay or derail plans by equipment manufacturers and telecommunications operators on both sides of the Atlantic to compete directly against each other as part of their emerging global strategies. For example, Northern Telecom, the Canadian equipment manufacturer, has established a strong presence in Europe following its acquisition of STC, and Bell Canada's parent BCE has acquired a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications. As part of that deal, Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent, has become a partner in BCE's UK cable TV business. In addition, a number of US-based companies have won mobile telephony licences in Europe. However, particular attention is focused on BT's emerging global strategy. The group already has already established Syncordia, an Atlanta, Georgia-based network management company, and earlier this month applied to the US regulatory authorities for permission to operate domestic and international telephone services in the US. If approval is given, it will clear the way for BT to become the first international telecommunications operator able to provide multinational customers with a broad range of voice, data and video services between the US and the UK. However the application faces stiff opposition from BT's US competitors, AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint, who are likely to argue that US carriers do not enjoy a similar freedom to operate in the UK. The outcome of BT's application will therefore depend on discussions over reciprocal market access between the US Federal Communications Commission and Britain's Department of Trade and Industry. In the UK market itself, BT still has over 90 per cent of the domestic market eight years after privatisation and 10 years after Mercury Communications began opertions. However, the duopoly faces new competition from domestic and foreign-owned competitors in the wake of 1991 review conducted by Oftel, the industry regulator. Last month, Ionica, a Cambridge-based company backed by institutional and corporate shareholders, was licensed to set up a radio-based rival national telephone service. Ionica aims to win five per cent of its target household and small business markets within 10 years. As many as 30 more license applications are being considered by the Department of Trade and Industry. Oftel plans to ease some licence conditions for new entrants to the telecoms marketplace, in particular newcomers are not expected to have any social or universal service obligations. Moves like this are designed to keep up the pressure on BT's dominant market position. As Mr Bill Wigglesworth, deputy director of Oftel said recently: 'When you move to unlimited competition, market dominance is the issue. That means BT should be licensed more tightly.' However, BT has been protesting loudly about what it considers to be excessive regulatory control. More cynical observers have suggested that BT's grumbles have been timed to co-incide with the arrival at the start of next month of Oftel's new director general, Mr Don Cruickshank. Among his first tasks, Mr Cruickshank will have to tackle the contentious issue of imposing accounting separation on BT. This is considered vital in securing fair agreements for other telecom companies which need to connect into BT's network. In the UK, therefore, as elsewhere, it seems that politics and regulations will continue to play a big role in determining the competitive landscape. This is likely to become more - rather than less - true in the future because the telecommunications business is undergoing a fundamental transformation - with the emphasis shifting away from facilities-based carriers with large networks, such as BT and AT&amp;T. As Mercury's Mr Rhodes noted in a recent speech: 'It is software, rather than hardware which is becoming the critical success factor.' This means that ownership of the physical infrastructure will be relatively less important in the future and the development - and deployment - of software-based products will become even more critical. 'Technology per se, particularly in an era of open interfaces and standards, is unlikely to be an enduring source of competitive advantage,' said Mr Rhodes.</p>

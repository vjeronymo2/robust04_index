			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Blithe minus spirit The Birmingham Repertory Theatre has updated Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit (1941) and dragged it into the 1990s. The play looks more like Prohibited Substance as the ectoplasmic ex-wife returns to haunt the living marriage. But the evening still needs to be much more spirited. Charles is a novelist who has called in a Medium, Madame Arcati, for some psychic research; but his dead wife Elvira materialises visible and audible to him alone and intent on having him join her on the other side. Charles's second wife, Ruth, handles the situation well until Elvira kills her in a car accident fixed for Charles. He is then haunted by two ex-wives who are finally exorcised by Madame Arcati and the Maid. The set, a conservatory with TV, stereo, fax and computer promising technological mischief. But Coward's ambiance is lacking. The play is partly about being polite at all times, and partly about ideal, blithe womanhood represented by Elvira. The director Robin Midgley has missed these aspects of the play. Midgley and his designer Ruari Murchison fix Elvira in the 1960s, listening to Sgt. Pepper and materialising to 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.' The idea works intermittently, but cannot be sustained. This is because the play is too flimsy to change. Coward wrote it over a week's holiday. He said: 'I will admit that I knew it was witty, I knew it was well constructed and I also knew it would be a success.' The play ran for 2,000 performances in the West End. Missing from Birmingham are Coward's delicious Dry Martinis which marshal the action like punctuation orders a sentence; gone are tales of fecklessness and irresponsibility in Budleigh Salterton; and absent is the innate sense of the frivolity of it all. The trick of Coward's comedy makes the encounter between two worlds into another cocktail conversation. In come, commendably, an Indian couple Dr Bunti and his wife Sadie who, with seasonal if not devotional correctness, do not drink and drive. Also in are modern furnishings which make people behave in an un-Cowardlike way: just try insoucaint lounging in a leather and chrome Vassily Chair, circa 1922. As Madame Arcati, Patsy Byrne is wonderfully terrestrial. She huffs and puffs around the stage, humming, swinging garlic and consuming strawberry sandwiches. Elvira and Ruth (Eve Matheson and Angela Scoular) in bright latex dresses orbit around a confused but self-satisfied Charles (John Labanowksi). Visitors from the other side have appeared on stage and screen from Hamlet to Ghostbusters. Perhaps Teddington's most famous son (1899-1973) should materialise himself to liven up the proceedings in what he thought was his most successful play.

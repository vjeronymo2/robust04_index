			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 26 May, in the framework of its "Details"  program, carries a 10-minute report by Vera Kuznetsova on the  visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Paris, where  he participated in the international conference on stability in  Europe. She interviews Kozyrev in the lobby of the conference  hall in Paris.    Stating that the visit took place at the time of acute  complications in Russia's relations with Ukraine, the Kuznetsova  points out that Kozyrev did not try to intrigue against Ukraine  in Paris but, on the contrary, reiterated that Russia respects  the territorial integrity of Ukraine.    She adds that Kozyrev was the only foreign minister to be  received by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur after the  conference today. She then asks Kozyrev why he was given such  preferential treatment. Kozyrev replies: "I think one of the  reasons is the intensity of the Russo-French dialogue and, in  fact, our conversation was a direct sequel, as it were, to the  conversation that took place between President Yeltsin and  French Foreign Minister Juppe in the Kremlin a short while ago.  In actual fact, the prime minister asked me the same questions  and requested that we discuss our present position with regard  to the points agreed during the conversation with the president.  So this is not really my own achievement but a continuation of  the dialogue begun by the president in the Kremlin."    Asked to explain what "points" he mentioned, Kozyrev said:  "First and foremost, the agreement between Russia and the  European Union. It is high time we reached the home straight, as  the saying goes. I should say that after the meeting between  the president and Mr. Juppe and our negotiations today, we are  very close to finalizing this agreement; we are literally inches  away from it, so we acknowledged our great progress on this  matter.    "The second point is Balladur's plan itself, which we are  discussing at the conference here. We have certain concerns  about the border issues, among other things. In his speech. M.  Balladur interpreted the question of borders in such a way --  and this is also how this is stated in the text of the document  -- that the point under discussion is how to improve the climate  on the borders by creating transparent borders, facilitating  trade, simplifying travel regulations etc. Of course, there can  be no doubt that we are very interested in these things. But  some politicians in the Baltic countries -- I am just back from  Estonia -- have a different approach to the question of borders."    Kuznetsova then asks Kozyrev if by this statement he means  that Russia recognizes the territorial integrity of Ukraine with  the Crimea as its part and that the Crimean issue should not  reemerge in the future. Kozyrev answers: "We recognize  Ukraine's integrity because it is a member of the United  Nations, the CSCE, and the CIS, and because it has been  recognized within its present borders. And of course we support  the principle of inviolability of borders which means that  countries should not lay territorial claims upon each other and  should not resolve such issues by force. At the same time, this  principle leaves to the population of certain regions the right  to determine their will -- naturally, by peaceful and not  military means -- so that subsequently the border can be changed  through talks. Thus, the will of the population of the region  in question is needed together with a peaceful negotiating  process. That is, this principle does not mean that borders can  never be redrawn but it creates certain civilized procedures for  this."    The interviewer reminds Kozyrev that he described the format  of the Paris conference as "12 plus 9" and asks what status  Russia had at this meeting. Kozyrev replies: "The format of the  conference is as follows: There are the 12 states of the  European Community and 9 candidates who have agreed to discuss  with these members of the European Union questions relating to  ethnic minorities etc, so that the Union should not admit as  members those states that could explode. As a European state  and as a member state of the CSCE, we are ready to participate  in the discussion of these questions because we are all one  family and we are not indifferent to the way in which these  questions will be tackled."    Kuznetsova then says it is almost settled that Russia should  join the European Union, the G7 and the NATO's Partnership for  Peace shortly, and asks Kozyrev whether he considers Russia's  claim to a special role in the partnership justified. Kozyrev  replies: "Yes, certainly. It would simply be unnatural if we  forgot about the special role we have thanks to our being a  nuclear power if for nothing else. No other participant in this  partnership is a nuclear power. This may be a mere trifle, but  a pleasant one, I should say."</p>

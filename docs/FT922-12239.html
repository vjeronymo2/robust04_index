			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (4): Industrial mix broadened - High-technology is reshaping Seattle's profile HIGH-TECHNOLOGY industries are reshaping Seattle's profile, broadening its business mix far beyond its traditional reliance on timber and Boeing, the world's leading manufacturer of civilian aircraft. Microsoft, the world's leading manufacturer of computer software, is located here, as is Aldus, the manufacturer of software for the printing industry which coined the phrase 'desktop publishing'. McCaw Cellular, America's largest cellular telephone operator, is a Seattle company. And the Puget Sound area has become one of the leading US centres of the bio-technology industry, with Immunex probably its best-known representative. That said, Boeing remains the dominant business in the region. It employs more than 100,000 people directly and a further 380,000 people are reckoned to be indirectly dependent on the company, representing almost one out of six jobs in the state of Washington. The company's impact on the local community goes far beyond this. In 1992 Boeing expects to donate Dollars 25m in cash to the community, almost half of it going on education, with a further Dollars 5m of contributions in kind. Boeing employees themselves chip in to a 'good neighbour' fund, and raised Dollars 22m last year. Boeing will continue to underpin the regional economy for decades to come. Its order book totals more than Dollars 90bn, more than three years' work on civilian aircraft, and while there remain doubts about the robustness of that tally over the next couple of years, the company's long-term future looks bright, given expectations of solid growth in the world's demand for aircraft over the next 20 years. The same cannot be said for the timber industry of the Puget Sound region. A furious row over the protection of the Northern Spotted Owl has sharply reduced the cutting of timber from federally-owned land in the region and caused great hardship to many small, independent loggers and mill-owners. Private companies which own their own timber are largely exempt from the restrictions (though they, too, cannot log around trees with spotted owl nests) and in some cases have even benefited from the restrictions, because these have led to rocketing timber prices. Weyerhaeuser, the largest private owner of softwood timber in the world, which has its headquarters at Tacoma, just south of Seattle, stands to benefit in this way - although a lack of supplies from non-company sources has forced it to close a number of plants in the Northwest, including its pulp mill at Everett, just north of Seattle. Seattle's growing importance as a high-technology centre is based partly on serendipity and partly on the region's comparative advantages. Mr William Boeing, the founder of the company that bears his name, was the scion of a lumber industry family who first came to the Northwest, as a drop-out from Yale University, because of its timber resources. It just so happened that he had a passion for flying, and thus Boeing was born in 1916. Boeing, with its civilian and military aircraft products, is one of America's leading high technology companies in its own right, and it has spawned a large number of other aerospace businesses in the Seattle area. However, the location of Microsoft here owed much to the fact that Bill Gates, its founder and chairman, happened to be brought up in the city. Paul Brainerd, who founded Aldus, is also a Seattleite. Serendipity apart, the high-technology industry has been aided by Seattle's attractive location, which helps in wooing high-quality scientific staff, and the area's strong academic credentials. These include the University of Washington, with its important medical and engineering schools, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, an acknowledged world leader. Washington state's bio-technology workforce has been expanding particularly fast - by 14.6 per cent last year to more than 4,200. The state is the joint sixth in the US bio-tech league, alongside Los Angeles/Orange County but still a long way behind the industry leaders, the San Francisco Bay area and New York's tri-state area. State officials have been trying to capitalise on this high-tech nucleus, promoting the so-called 'technology corridor', a series of corporate campuses stretching north of Seattle through Snohomish county and home to more than 200 companies. High-technology is also a crucial plank in the state's efforts to attract foreign investment, which are also focused on the aerospace, environmental engineeering, food processing and wood products industries. It is putting substantially more effort into promoting the state in Europe and has just set up its first full-time European trade office in Paris. Half the foreign investment in Washington state is from Europe, with Britain the largest single foreign investor in terms of dollars committed, followed by Japan. Nintendo, the leading Japanese computer games company, has its North American headquarters in Seattle. Seattle repeatedly comes out at or near the top of surveys of the best places to do business in the US - even though it offers virtually no special financial incentives for companies to locate operations here. Factors in its favour include a favourable tax structure, low electricity prices, a well educated workforce (though recent reports have warned that the state risks a shortage of high-technology personnel), reasonable property costs and extremely attractive surroundings. But Seattle's agonised wrestling between the imperatives of growth and the preservation of its natural beauty is causing considerable difficulties for the industrial community. These were highlighted last autumn in a speech to the local chamber of commerce by Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman of Boeing. He pointed out that the company had benefited from the Northwest's 'pretty strong work ethic' yet faced problems from the 'escalating cost' of building new facilities in the Puget Sound area. Boeing is building a new plant at Everett, north of Seattle, where it will manufacture its new 777 wide-bodied aircraft, but the company is upset that Dollars 50m had been added to the bill by fees to mitigate the effect on the local community. Mr Shrontz said Boeing believed that this, together with other cost elements, meant it was 30 to 40 per cent cheaper to build in Wichita, Kansas or Huntsville, Alabama - without even taking into account the financial incentives offered in those centres or the fact that it now took about as long to obtain permits and build in Puget Sound as it did to design and build a new aircraft. It was a warning shot to the local community and a reminder that Seattle cannot afford to grow complacent and take either Boeing or its present prosperity for granted.</p>

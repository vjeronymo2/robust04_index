			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Rules are 'too kind' to water groups Consumers have not had a fair deal on water prices since the industry was privatised, the National Consumer Council says today, David Lascelles writes. The regulatory system has been too generous to the companies, says the report, which comes two weeks before Mr Ian Byatt, industry regulator, announces new price controls. Consumers have had to pay an unfair amount of the industry's costs, it adds. Operating profits of the 31 regulated companies rose by an annual average of 20 per cent from 1989-90 to 1992-93 and profit margins increased from 28.7 per cent to 35.6 per cent. Yet water bills for domestic customers have increased by an average 67 per cent. Although the water companies have faced huge costs to modernise infrastructure, most of the cost has been passed on to consumers, and companies have made little or no use of borrowings or rights issues.</p>

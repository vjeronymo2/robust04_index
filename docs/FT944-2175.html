			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Bitter dispute over name may end in change: Shareholders attacked as spiteful Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the holding company, now looks set to join most of the world's top marketing services groups, including WPP, Interpublic and Omnicom, in differentiating itself by name from its main advertising network. To outsiders, the fuss over names may seem ludicrously overblown, but in the advertising world there seem to be few issues more important than whose name goes above the door - hence the unpronounceable string of names and initials that adorn the letterheadings of many agencies. The question of names is inextricably linked to egos and status and Mr Maurice Saatchi has long made clear, not least during this week's boardroom battles, that any proposal to change the name was one of the issues on which he was prepared to resign. Before matters came to a head, one rival agency chief said he thought the battle over the name had all been part of the drive to humiliate Mr Saatchi. 'I think they're just being vindictive and trying to put Maurice in his place. It's spiteful. I think it's come to a sorry pass when a group of shareholders can decide what your company is called without offering any reasonable explanation for a change,' he said. But there do also seem to be strong practical arguments for distinguishing the holding company from its operating agencies. As the head of a rival network said: 'In good times it probably doesn't matter. But in bad, the sins of the holding company are visited on the sons of the group.' For clients and staff of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising agency, it can have done nothing for business or morale to have been constantly linked by name to the misfortunes and antics at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi plc. Another argument is that it is difficult for the non-Saatchi networks in the group to build their own 'brand' if they are constantly referred to as Saatchi-owned companies. This is said to have been a particular hindrance to the Bates agencies. Also, where a group stretches beyond pure advertising and into marketing services more generally - as is certainly the case with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - it gives a clearer message to clients if a non-advertising agency name is chosen for the holding company.</p>

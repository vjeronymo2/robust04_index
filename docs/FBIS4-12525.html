			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat] </F>   [Text] AL-HAYAH has learned that water experts have held a  meeting in Muscat. The meeting, which was kept secret by the  Omani authorities, ended yesterday.    Diplomatic sources said that the participation of Israeli  experts in an official meeting in an Arab country in the Gulf  for the first time since the establishment of the Jewish state  was behind the restricted reporting on the meeting.    The same sources added that experts from Oman, the United  Kingdom, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and other  countries attended the two-day meeting which was sponsored by  the Omani Foreign Ministry.    The discussions dealt with the Omani experiment regarding  the  desalination of sea water and a study prepared by the Omanis to  be presented to the meeting of the water committee affiliated  with the Middle East peace conference which will be held in  Muscat on 27 April.    The conferees reviewed the four five-year plans implemented  in Oman in terms of building and developing water desalination  stations, particularly the major water desalination plant in al-  Ghabrah in the area of the capital, in which hundreds of  millions of dollars are invested and which is the main source of  drinking water for residents of the capital.    It appears that the need for further studies, researches,  and  working papers emerged during the meeting to crystallize Omani  and Gulf concern for developing water desalination technology  and reducing high economic costs.</p>

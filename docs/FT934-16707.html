			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Rise in borrowing eases fears of stalled recovery NEW FIGURES on consumer lending and the money supply yesterday helped to dispel fears that the UK recovery is losing momentum. The highest net consumer borrowing for any month since July 1991, and the fastest growth in the narrow measure of money supply for over three years indicated that the pick-up in activity since the middle of 1992 is progressing steadily. Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 225m in August compared with Pounds 204m in July. A strong rise in loans from finance houses - in particular for cars - fuelled the increase. The official figures from the Central Statistical Office indicated that consumers are slowly regaining the confidence to take on debt. They borrowed a net Pounds 298m from finance houses - mainly car loans and hire purchase agreements - and a net Pounds 16m on unsecured loans from building societies. On bank credit cards, however, they repaid Pounds 89m more than they borrowed. Other figures from the Bank of England reinforced the message of the credit statistics. Narrow money - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose a seasonally adjusted 5.4 per cent in the year to September, the highest rate of growth since the summer of 1990. The robustness of M0 coincides with strengthening retail spending. The annual rate of growth of the narrow money supply has been above the government's 0-4 per cent target range for virtually every month since February. But in contrast to the promising economic figures, the Building Employers Federation yesterday forecast more gloom for the construction industry. It said more jobs would be lost in the sector and sustained recovery was not expected until 1995. The federation's autumn state-of-trade inquiry, based on a poll of 600 companies, found that only one-third were confident of an increase in output over the next 12 months.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andreas Khatzikiriakos] </F>   [Text] A reliable source yesterday told O FILELEVTHEROS  that the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council  can only be blocked if Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas gives  clear and positive answers on the issues of the map and  Famagusta's fenced-off area. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, said:  "There are no plans to delay submission of the report further."    With the entire procedure having lost a significant part of  its credibility, however, Nicosia appears to have reservations  about the assurances it has been given. These reservations are  intensifying because Britain and the United States expect  Denktas to give a positive answer by tomorrow and because, in  case of an agreement, it is unclear if the two sides will accept  the same things.    In a statement to O FILELEVTHEROS, Feissel categorically  denied allegations that on Monday [23 May] Robert Lamb, the U.S.  State Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, made  some proposals that concerned the Cypriot Government. Feissel  reiterated that the substantive portion of the UN document  cannot be changed.    Feissel specifically denied that:    a) The creation of two separate customs offices at Nicosia  International Airport was proposed;    b) Access by Greek Cypriots to Famagusta will be controlled  by Turkish Cypriot policemen in civilian clothes;    c) A number of countries will allow Turkish Cypriots to  enter  by using "Turkish Cypriot passports;"    d) He had agreed to Turkish Cypriot control of access to  Famagusta;    e) The aircraft of the "Turkish Cypriot Airlines" will bear  the pseudostate's emblem;    f) Turkish Cypriot troops will use the Dherynia-Famagusta  road.    It is worth noting that an official government statement  that  was issued last Monday referred to two additional proposals,  distinct from the six mentioned above, but Feissel refused to  comment on them. Those were that both sides would make an equal  number of flights from Nicosia International Airport and that  troops would remain in the southern part of the fenced-off area.    A reliable source told O FILELEVTHEROS that the procedure  for  the submission of the UN secretary general's report has been set  in motion, clarifying that "if nothing happens, the report will  be full, complete, and detailed."    The same source said: "The only development that could  prevent the report from being submitted would be an agreement on  the confidence-building measures, something that both sides  agree on." He added that the main issues on which the Turkish  side must give clear answers are the map--a yes or no answer is  required--and the issue of access. He said: "A specific  settlement is proposed regarding access, and we want an answer  on it."    For his part, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis did  not rule out that Denktas might make some maneuver. Asked for a  general evaluation of the situation, Kasoulidhis said: "It is  difficult to make a general evaluation because the Turkish  side's moves are unpredictable."    O FILELEVTHEROS has learned the United States has sent a  message to the Cypriot Government which mentions that Denktas  will accept the confidence-building measures after a meeting of  the so-called "ministerial council" and the pseudoparliament.    U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher yesterday said  "the main point of the entire effort is to find an operational  settlement that will enable both sides to use the basic changes  stemming from the confidence-building measures." He also  appeared to be impatient for the report to circulate, adding  that this would prompt the Security Council to study alternative  ways of action. Boucher also admitted that the obstacles have  not been overcome.</p>

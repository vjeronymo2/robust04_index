			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yao Shihuang [1202 6108 3552] and Oian Weihua </F> [6929 4850 5478]: ```Space Highway Network' Installed at  Shanghai Stock Exchange for Instantaneous Information  Transmission Nationwide'']    [Summary] A 1.5-year-old Shanghai Caohejing New  Technologies Development Zone high-tech firm called Shanghai  Gaozhi [7559 2535] S&amp;T Development Co and its partner firm,  Shanghai Xinhua Computer &amp; Electronic Information Co, have  developed, designed, installed, and put on-line a satellite  digital transmission network--the ``Space Highway Network'' or  ``Information Bridge''--for the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE).  This network provides instantaneous (0.5 s) synchronous  transmission of stock and economic information from the SSE to  over 1000 small satellite earth stations nationwide, many of  them hundreds and thousands of km distant from the SSE. The  network has also been successfully used for newspaper fax  transmission: in only 20 minutes, the network system can provide  errorless transmission of an 8-page issue of WEN HUI BAO to nine  regional printing plants nationwide. This service has been in  operation for 6 months without any errors. The satellite used  to relay these services is located at an altitude of 36,000 km.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Duncan Campbell, crime correspondent] </F>   [Text] A police informer who has helped to jail some of the  major drug smugglers and dealers in Britain over the past five  years claims that he has frequently encouraged people to take  part in drug deals that would never have happened without his  participation.    He claims to have made tens of thousands of pounds from  informants' funds while carrying on selling drugs himself.    His story highlights the grey area between police attempts  to  arrest those already dealing in drugs and the way crimes can  come to be committed which might not otherwise have happened at  all.    The informer is known to police by the code-name of Peter  Poacher and his informer's number is 176. His real name is Nigel  and he has worked under the names of Danny and John. THE  GUARDIAN is not publishing his last name because it is an  uncommon one and he fears reprisals against his parents, who  live in the North of England.    He is being sought by associates of people on whom he has  informed and by lawyers acting for people he has entrapped. His  revelations could lead to the reopening of cases of prisoners  who claimed he was the main participant in drugs deals for which  they were jailed.    Nigel, now aged 26, became an informer after being arrested  on a drugs charge five years ago. Since then he has worked  extensively for the police.    The rewards have been substantial--totalling, he claims,  more  than &pound;35,000. He says he received the highest ever reward  from the Number 3 Regional Crime Squad, based in Wakefield, with  a payment of &pound;11,500 for arrest of an LSD smuggler. He says  he has made tens of thousands of pounds from drug dealing  activities.    Nigel, from Ormskirk, is the adopted son of a policeman and  was introduced to drugs in Amsterdam.    About five years ago, police investigating a stolen car with  which he was involved raided his then home in Lincoln and found  drugs. He offered to become an informer. "I gave them  everything," he says.    He claims he set up a flourishing amphetamine trade in  Newmarket and received money both from drug dealing and in  rewards from the Community Action Trust, the Home Office's  international fund, and the police.    Nigel also claims that he supplied the recipe for an  amphetamines factory. He says that as a result of his activities  more drugs become available on the streets as small-time dealers  build up towards big deals.    Detective Chief Inspector Geoff Cole, of Number 3 RCS, said:  "We never comment on individual informants." He added: "It is  standard practice that officers dealing with informants are  constantly alive to the issue of agents provocateurs. If we had  any reason to suspect that an informant was acting in such a  role, we would terminate the operation and the informant would  be liable to prosecution."    Nigel is now no longer assisting the police and is planning  to move abroad.    Last night, John Wadham, legal officer for Liberty, said  that  agents provocateurs were "part of the problem, not part of the  solution."</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENTATIVE PACT REACHED IN BANK OF AMERICA SUIT  </P> <P> Attorneys for the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency have tentatively  settled a lawsuit seeking to force the Bank of America to move from a  28-year-old branch office on a prime corner near the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw  Plaza.  </P> <P> The agency filed the lawsuit last year after the bank refused to take a  $556,000 cash settlement and an offer to relocate the branch to another section  of the plaza grounds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Win-Win Situation'  </P> <P> Bank of America officials said they opposed the move because it forced them to  trade their high-visibility location for one of several locations offered off  the beaten path.  </P> <P> The agreement will allow the bank to stay at the corner of 39th Street and  Crenshaw Boulevard. However, the branch will have to undergo a major remodeling  to make way for a street-widening project that the agency was seeking.  </P> <P> "It's a win-win situation," said Bill Price, the CRA's assistant project  manager for the plaza. "They wanted to stay there. We had offered them a number  of different locations elsewhere, but they wanted to stay on the corner. Our  position is that we needed to widen 39th Street."  </P> <P> Agency officials say the agreement also saves years of litigation that would  have also delayed the construction of a drug store and supermarket near the  800,000-square-foot indoor mall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pay for Alterations  </P> <P> The fate of the supermarket and drug store has been a major concern in the  Crenshaw community, where residents complain of being inadequately served by  major food and drug retailing chains.  </P> <P> The Alexander Haagen Co., which developed the plaza with the CRA, had hoped to  locate the stores on the present site of the Bank of America branch. Those  plans will have to be changed now that the bank will remain.  </P> <P> The bank will give up the northern 15 feet of its parcel, including a portion  of its 9,500-square-foot branch for the street widening between Marlton Avenue  and Crenshaw Boulevard. In return, the agency will pay Bank of America for the  alterations needed to its branch, up to $400,000.  </P> <P> The bank, which has 17 years remaining on its lease, will also be given a  "reasonable opportunity" to review the plans of a proposed community drug store  and supermarket.  </P> <P> The agency's board is expected to act on the tentative agreement when it takes  up the matter in about two weeks. The agency's staff is recommending approval  of the pact.  </P></p>

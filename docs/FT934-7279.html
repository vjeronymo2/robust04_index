			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Beady eye on their nest egg: Will the UK government risk a pensions crisis by raiding occupational schemes in the Budget? As the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, struggles with the final preparations for his first Budget, there is growing speculation that he will resort to a well-tried soft option on November 30: milking the pension funds. Yet the wider costs of following his predecessors, Lord Lawson and Mr Norman Lamont, down this tempting road are worrying, because Britain's pension funds are heading for a financing crisis. For once, the powerful pensions lobby, bending politicians' ears before the Budget, may have a point. Another raid on the occupational pension schemes' Pounds 350bn nest egg might be the last straw for many companies that are finding final pay-related pension liabilities increasingly onerous. The incipient funding crisis in pensions is not just a British concern but affects public and private sectors in most developed countries. It stems from the demographic strains that arise from an ageing population and the impact of disinflation on government finances and on the value of pension fund assets and liabilities. Smaller working populations are having to meet the cost of sustaining larger retired populations. And in the public sector these costs are harder to meet without the help of high rates of inflation, which until recently provided a prop to government revenues. In Britain the demographic pressure is less than in most of the OECD area. The problems of disinflation, though real in other areas of public spending, have largely been defused in the state pension scheme by a decision in the early 1980s to stop uprating the basic state pension in line with earnings. It is now uprated in line with prices, which rise more slowly. But the private sector has not had the benefit of any comparable change in the rules to off-set the damage to its finances from falling inflation. Rather, the rules have been made tougher. In the 1970s and 1980s, private occupational pension schemes promised to pay pensions worth up to two-thirds of final pay. Yet in practice only a minority - those who stayed with the same employer for most of their career  -received what they thought they had been promised. The system depended on an elaborate web of implicit cross-subsidies. It was easy to give high retirement incomes to long-stayers because occupational schemes were delivering pensions that were falling in real terms, while the deferred pension liabilities of employees who were made redundant, or who left voluntarily, were shrinking fast thanks to inflation. For much of the 1980s the cost of meeting pension liabilities was further reduced by exceptionally high investment returns. Employers took contribution holidays as the surpluses of assets over liabilities mounted. This picture has now changed markedly. In response to widespread disillusionment over inequitable cross-subsidies, the government introduced regulations between 1986 and 1990 that required pension schemes to increase deferred pension rights and pensions being paid in line with inflation, up to a maximum of 5 per cent. With the latest recorded year-on-year increase in retail price inflation at 2.8 per cent, a 25-year low, the cross-subsidies have clearly been wiped out. It follows that companies have to pay more to meet a given pension promise. The government has also made a number of cuts in the tax privileges enjoyed by pension funds. Lord Lawson, who refers disparagingly in his memoirs to 'the middle-class welfare state', tried but failed to remove the anomalous tax relief on lump sum payments on retirement because of pressure from the pensions lobby. He responded to this rebuff by seeking to tax pension funds by the back door, starting, in 1986, by imposing a statutory limit on the size of temporarily bloated pension fund surpluses. This delighted company finance directors by encouraging them to claw back pension fund surpluses into profits through pension fund holidays. But the result is that pension fund finances have been greatly weakened. Actuarial surpluses have been run down, just as dividend income has come under pressure and the inflation subsidy has disappeared. Lawson's move also reduced the incentive for companies to run occupational pension schemes since it made them a less attractive tax shelter. The scope for smoothing profits and tax liabilities has been reduced. And subsequent tax changes, such as the cap imposed in 1989 on the amount of pension that qualifies for tax relief and the reduction of the tax credit on dividends, have increased the distortions in the system for taxing savings. One final problem for companies is that a majority of pension funds are now mature, in the sense that they are paying out most of the income from contributions and dividends in the form of pensions. As Penny Webster, a partner in consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow points out, most actuaries feel obliged to advise pension fund trustees to adopt a lower risk approach to investment, which is heralding a shift from equities towards gilts and thus lower investment returns. This is to ensure greater protection for benefits that no longer enjoy the cushion of a big surplus of cash flow over outgoings. In Britain, actuarial practice does not lead to disinflationary scare stories of the kind that afflict the General Motors pension fund in the US, where each one percentage point fall in bond yields has added Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn to pension liabilities. But some actuaries claim that there is now a shift towards more pessimistic valuation assumptions. And there is controversy over whether the trend would be more pronounced if the government introduces new minimum solvency requirements in response to the Goode committee report on pension law reform. While actuarial assumptions cannot affect the ultimate cost of pensions, they do affect corporate cash flow in the short and medium term. Knowing that a prudent increase in contributions today may be compensated for by lower contributions later is no consolation to employers now emerging from recession. The result is that few, if any, defined benefit (final pay-related) pension schemes are being set up. Company finance directors are, says consulting actuary Mr Bryn Davies, 'addicted' to pension fund holidays and reluctant to contemplate pumping company cash back into pension funds. It is at this point that Mr Clarke makes his Budget debut. It seems unlikely that his chief interest will lie in enhancing the coherence of the pension system or injecting logic into the ramshackle arrangements for the taxation of savings. His priorities will be financial; and there are many who want to help him effect a swift and sizeable transfer of cash from the pension funds to the exchequer. Former economic secretary to the Treasury, Mr John Maples, suggests removing tax relief on pension contributions while making pension payments exempt from tax. This would be worth Pounds 7bn a year to the exchequer on the basis of a 25 per cent tax charge. Alternatively, Mr Clarke could further restrict the tax credit on dividends received by pension funds. Or he could remove the upper rate tax relief on contributions. Or, again, he could remove the lump sum relief on retirement. The Maples proposal is more complex than it appears, because of the inter-relationship between private occupational pension schemes and the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). Changing the tax arrangements for private sector schemes would involve making changes to Serps, part of whose cost is met by the private system via guaranteed minimum pensions. The administrative problems of such a change for the private sector alone would be considerable. Employers would have to run parallel systems for existing and for new employees. Given that some beneficiaries will live into their nineties, this absurdity could last for 70-odd years. Since funds for existing pension scheme members would have to be closed, an actuarial valuation would need to be carried out on a so-called discontinuance basis, which is more cautious than a long-term valuation for an ongoing fund. This would almost certainly lead to a requirement for increased contributions from companies. Other tax changes might also add to the disincentives for employers to continue with final pay-related pension schemes. The disturbing point is that the government is undermining the incentives for private pension provision via companies just when the move to price uprating in the state system is ensuring that the state's pension safety net in the 21st century will be wholly inadequate. The alternative, favoured more by right-wing ministers - personal pensions  - cannot provide an adequate alternative because the cost of personal pensions is prohibitive for the lower paid. If the government continues to run down the state system, while companies become increasingly disillusioned with final pay schemes, the least bad option may be one advocated by the social security select committee chairman, Labour's Mr Frank Field - company-run defined contribution (money purchase) schemes, where the investment risk falls entirely on the pension scheme member. But with tax incentives dwindling, no shortage of labour and constant pressure in capital markets for enhanced profits, employers may not bother.</p>

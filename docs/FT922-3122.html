			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Observer: Exit of kin It is rare to find family companies where the family knows when to quit. But Kalon, which has just made a hostile bid for fellow paint-maker Manders, is one such. Leslie Silver, who founded the company in 1947, packed his bags a few months ago, sold the family's 47 per cent stake and went off to enjoy his retirement chairing the board of Leeds United. His son and various sons-in-law, who might have enjoyed running their inheritance, had already stepped down from the board and handed over to professional managers. The handover is all the more remarkable because, before Silver's exit, the company had no non-executive directors, and had to turn to Sir Adrian Cadbury's quango Proned to find Silver's replacement, Roger Boissier. 'I never wanted to create a dynasty', says Silver who, now 67, started the business with a Pounds 250 gratuity on leaving the Royal Air Force. He remains faithful to his old firm, describing the bid for Manders as 'a sensible and logical marriage'. But then he can afford to be generous now he has sold almost all of his Kalon shares. Despite the obvious loyalty of many Kalon shareholders, the speed with which the new team wants to celebrate the Silver family's departure by issuing huge amounts of paper, may well ring an alarm bell or two.</p>

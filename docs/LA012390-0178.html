			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> RIDDER STABLE TO GO AFTER CONSECUTIVE TITLES ON WED.  </P> <P> Ridder Thoroughbred Stable will be going after consecutive titles in the  California Breeders' Champion Stakes when San Miguel Stakes winner Tarascon  carries his owner's colors in the $125,000-added race Wednesday at Santa Anita  Park.  </P> <P> Ridder's Past Ages captured the seven-furlong event for 3-year-old California  foals last year. Like Past Ages, Tarascon is a homebred son of top California  sire Flying Paster, who won this race in 1978 for the late B. J. Ridder.  </P> <P> In the San Miguel, Tarascon was 2 1/2 lengths the best, while Wednesday rivals  Express It and Shantin O. had to be separated by a photo for the place. In his  only loss since finishing fourth in his career debut in October, Tarascon was a  creditable third in the Grade III Hollywood Prevue behind highly regarded  Individualist and Top Cash.  </P> <P> With a dozen starters, the California Breeders' Champion Stakes will be worth  $141,900 and the winner will bank $85,650.  </P> <P> In post position order, the field includes Shantin O., Russell Baze riding at  119 pounds; Makaleha, Tom Chapman, 114; Due to the King, Laffit Pincay, Jr.,  114; Hawaiian Pass, Sandy Hawley, 114; Wild Too, Robbie Davis, 114; Tarascon,  Chris McCarron, 119; Express It, Gary Stevens, 114; Iam the Iceman, David  Flores, 117; French Seventyfive, Rafael Meza, 122; Solar Launch, Gary  Boulanger, 114; Shapiro's Hero, Alex Solis, 114; and Kleven Up, Corey Nakatani,  114.  </P> <P> Before their photo-finish battle for second in the San Miguel, Shantin O. and  Express It ran first and third, respectively, in the Atherton Stakes at Bay  Meadows.  </P> <P> Due to the King hasn't found the winner's circle since his debut at Del Mar in  August but he tested some of the best youngsters around in the Grade I Norfolk  here in October, running third to division leader Grand Canyon and Single Dawn.  </P> <P> Iam the Iceman missed by a head in his first start in late November, but is  two-for-two since then. He broke his maiden here on opening day of the meeting  and came back to win an allowance test 10 days ago.  </P></p>

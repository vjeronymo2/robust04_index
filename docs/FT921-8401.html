			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lep reduces debt with Pounds 15m sale to managers IN A bid to cut borrowings, Lep Group, the security and freight forwarding concern, has sold a specialist delivery services subsidiary to its managers for Pounds 15m. The buy-out of Swift Transport Services, a delivery company for the automotive and engineering industries, is being supported by institutions led by Prudential Venture Managers. The consideration is made up of Pounds 8m cash and the repayment of Pounds 7m of inter-company debt. Swift's external borrowings of about Pounds 4m are also being taken over. The sale will reduce Lep's net indebtedness by Pounds 22m to about Pounds 450m. Shares in Lep, which have collapsed from about 80p in September following a profits warning and debt refinancing worries, fell by 1p to 10 1/2 p yesterday. Shares in ADT, the security and car auction group which bought a 27 per cent stake in Lep at an average 175p, dropped 3p to 405p. Lep is still considering the disposal of National Guardian Corporation, its US securities business, and remains in discussions with its bankers about refinancing plans. The company is due to announce full-year results for 1991 in April and has already warned of 'very substantial' write-offs and provisions. Swift reported profits before tax of Pounds 2.99m in 1990 with net assets of Pounds 12.9m. Trading since then been has affected by the recession, Lep said.</p>

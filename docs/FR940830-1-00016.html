			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would also eliminate the requirement that a Program Participant not be permitted to receive 8(a) contracts in excess of its approved 8(a) support level. However, this would not affect SBA's authority to impose a limit on the amount of 8(a) contract awards as a part of a remedial action plan where a firm fails to meet its competitive business mix requirements. A concern would still be required to project in its business plan its anticipated level of 8(a) contract support, but such level would be used only as a planning and development tool. Section 124.307 would be amended by redesignating paragraph ``(d)'' as paragraph ``(e)'' and by adding a new paragraph ``(d)'' that would eliminate approved 8(a) support levels as a basis for denying 8(a) contract awards in excess of those levels. SBA believes that Program Participants should be afforded the flexibility to seek out and receive 8(a) contracts so long as they are capable and responsible to perform those contracts and meet their competitive business mix requirements. SBA would still determine whether a Participant was responsible to perform a particular 8(a) procurement requirement, and could determine that the concern did not have the capacity to perform the extra work, but, except as part of an approved remedial action plan, it could not withhold award merely because the concern would exceed (or has exceeded) its approved support level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.307 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph ``(f)'' that would prohibit any party from challenging the eligibility of a Program Participant for a specific sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement at SBA or any other administrative forum. Much of this provision is currently contained in &sect;124.311(g) for competitive 8(a) requirements, but no such specific language was set forth for sole source 8(a) requirements. The regulatory language appearing in &sect;124.311(g) would be moved into this new provision and would be expanded to apply to sole source 8(a) procurements as well. Section 124.311(g) would be removed as unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed rule would specify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD could file a SIC code appeal in connection with either a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement. While this restriction appears in &sect;121.1703, as part of SBA's size and SIC code appeal regulations, it was not similarly contained in the 8(a) regulations. SBA believes that it should appear in both places for clarity and ease of use. It would specifically apply to both sole source and competitive 8(a) requirements. SBA reviews every SIC code to determine its appropriateness, but so long as the code assigned by the procuring agency contracting officer is reasonable, SBA will concur. SBA frequently goes back to a procuring agency to dispute a SIC code when it feels that the statement of work indicates that the assigned SIC code is inappropriate. Discussions between SBA and the procuring agency normally clear up any confusion. As part of this process, any party may submit evidence to SBA to explain why it believes another SIC code should be assigned to the procurement. SBA will consider such information and will seek a SIC code change if it believes that the SIC code assigned by the procuring agency is unreasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.308(c) would be amended to specify where 8(a) offerings should be sent in light of the changes made by this rule eliminating local and national buy requirements. Under the proposed rule, all requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program as competitive procurements and those sole source requirements that are offered to the program without nominating a specific Program Participant (i.e., open requirements) would be offered to SBA's Division of Program Development in SBA's Central Office. Sole source requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific Program Participant would be offered to the appropriate SBA district office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.308(d) would be amended to clarify the distinction between accepting a competitive 8(a) requirement on behalf of the 8(a) program generally and a sole source 8(a) requirement on behalf of a particular 8(a) Program Participant. In addition, the proposed rule would prohibit a procuring agency from conducting a competitive 8(a) requirement prior to obtaining SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program. Any competition so held would not be considered an 8(a) competition. If a procuring agency still wanted to fulfill its requirement through the 8(a) program, the requirement would have to be offered to and accepted by SBA for the 8(a) program, and the procuring agency would have to use applicable 8(a) competitive procedures after the acceptance. The procuring agency would again be required to synopsize the procurement in the Commerce Business Daily. A new solicitation would have to be issued, and new offers would have to be submitted and evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.308 would also be amended, by adding a paragraph (d)(4), to permit all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally to submit offers in connection with 8(a) competitive requirements other than construction requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 124.308(e)(1)(iii), 124.311(f)(4), 124.311(f)(5), 124.312(b), and 124.312(c) would be amended by removing any provisions pertaining to 8(a) support level requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule would add a new &sect;124.308(i) pertaining to Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs). This provision would state that each order to be issued under a BOA, and not the BOA itself, is a contracting action. As such, there must be a separate offer and acceptance for each order. As with any other new offer, SBA would determine eligibility for an order under a BOA at the time of the issuance of the order. This would require a concern to remain a small business at the time the order is to be issued and would prohibit orders from being issued to concerns whose program terms have expired or who have otherwise exited the 8(a) program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.309(c) would be amended to clarify SBA's intent regarding the concept of adverse impact. Under the proposed rule, ``adverse impact'' could be found to exist where several requirements currently being performed by different small business concerns are bundled into one larger requirement which could be considered ``new'' under SBA's regulations due to the magnitude of the bundled requirement. This rule would permit SBA to find adverse impact in such a case where at least one of the small business concerns losing work that is to be bundles meets the presumption of adverse impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporter Li Zhenghong (0632 2973 1347) </F> and correspondent Li Xuewu (2621 1331 2976): "Shanghai Acts  `Against Staggering Profits'"]    [Text] Shanghai, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- On 1 April, the day  that Shanghai's "Interim Provisions Against Price Fraud and  Staggering Profits" became effective, the municipal commodity  price department and industry and commerce administration  inspected a number of major restaurants, cafes, amusement  centers, and emporiums in the commercial district.    In the morning, when inspection personnel visited a garment  store inside an exquisite commercial building, they noticed a  large sign reading "40 perecent discount on all goods at this  counter" on some counters. However, prices marked on the  commodities gave no further explanation. Take, for example, a  suit priced for 800 yuan. People were confused as to whether or  not the price included the 40 percent discount. As a matter of  fact, the discount was given on certain commodities only.    Hence, inspection personnel decided that such a "misguided  price mark" constituted price fraud. In accordance with the  provisions "against fraud and staggering profits," selling  commodities with false bargain, discount, and minimum prices is  price fraud.    At noon, at a Sino-foreign cooperative fast food restaurant,  inspection personnel saw the menu's price for Italian spaghetti  as 40 yuan; black pepper pork chops, 40 yuan; and seafood salad,  30 yuan; and one line of small words at the bottom saying:  served with soup, bread, salad, and coffee or tea. A customer  complained that because of the vague connotation of the prices,  he once spent over 100 yuan in ordering three main courses at  the restaurant. After some inquiry, it was learned that the  prices were those for a complete dinner. In other words, each  main course should be served with soup, drink, and other side  dishes. Therefore, a customer who mistakenly ordered more than  one main course would not be able to finish the dinner. Under  such circumstances, the service personnel would leave the  mistake uncorrected and make the best of it by serving the side  dishes for only one main course. Law enforcement officials  believed that such equivocal practices of pricing by the  management in fact encroached upon consumer interests and, from  a different perspective, was aimed at reaping staggering profits.    At some restaurants and cafes catering to average consumers,  the prices of drinks were generally found to be exorbitant. A  bottle of high-grade Shaoxing rice wine was selling for 30 yuan;  Dynasty white grape wine, for 80 yuan; and Great Wall white  grape wine, for 80 yuan; whereas their prime costs were 4.2, 22,  and 21 yuan, respectively.    There were also pricing irregularities such as "Maotai  [spirit], 400 yuan." Was the 400 yuan the price for a bottle or  glass? How many ounces?    The commodity price department and industry and commerce  administration have already instructed on-the-spot those having  violated the provisions on pricing to correct them or to remedy  them in a specified time limit; and have meted out harsh  punishments depending on circumstnces. In accordance with the  provisions "against price fraud and staggering profits,"  lawbreakers were ordered to refund their illegitimate incomes to  consumers and were given a fine from one to 10 times the  illegitimate income.    Shanghai has implemented these provisions with a view to  standardizing pricing activities following market deregulation.  These detailed and supplementary rules of the relevant state  regulations reflect Shanghai's tough approach to supervise  pricing according to the law and to perfect the legislation of  pricing. Nevertheless, an authoritative source has emphasized  that the implementation of the provisions is by no means  tantamount to returning the previous practice of direct price  controls. He has urged consumers in general to conscientiously  apply the provisions to protect their interests. It is  understood that very few complaints against activities of "price  fraud and staggering profits" in markets were filed yesterday.</p>

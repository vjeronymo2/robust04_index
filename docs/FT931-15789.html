			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Universities failed by mediocre policy Sir, Your leading article, 'University challenge' (January 5), starts down the right path, but goes nowhere near as far as the national interest demands. Major university institutions like Imperial College are indeed a national asset; every one of the six engineering departments in the City and Guilds College (the engineering faculty of Imperial College) was top-rated against international standards in the latest Higher Education Funding Council Research Selectivity Review. As you imply, it is wasteful dissipation of an asset to require such institutions as this, for financial reasons, to focus dominantly on undergraduate teaching. The great power of Imperial College lies in its research strength and its postgraduate teaching; national interest demands that these strengths be utilised to the full. The dominant role of a few universities such as Imperial College is at postgraduate level, and we welcome public recognition of this fact. Yet the accountants are in control, as in so much of Britain today; public funding largely follows undergraduate numbers. Despite ministerial assertions, funding for research, and even more for the research students through whom much research is done, is inadequate to meet the needs of the country's top institutions or the potential national opportunities that they could provide. In the technological interests of the country, this is mediocre policy. But in current circumstances, can the UK - even in its own interests - adequately capitalise upon Imperial College and other such institutions? If the UK cannot, perhaps Europe should? We at Imperial College are able to identify a range of long-term research interests which transcend national frontiers. These seem to us to be of socio-economic significance to Europe as a whole, and offer an ideal and sustained opportunity for high-quality research training of postgraduate students. Now, above all, is the time for vision, for thought on a supranational, European scale. Should Europe now be considering strategic investment in a few special institutions?

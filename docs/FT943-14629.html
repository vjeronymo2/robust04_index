			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation data fails to lift US stocks Wall Street After good news on inflation had failed to lift stock market sentiment during the morning, a rebound in bond prices and a modest rally in the dollar helped share prices end flat-to-firmer yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.33 at 3,702.66, well above its low for the day of 3,672.24. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.11 at 447.95, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished up 0.73 at 425.50 and the Nasdaq composite up 2.76 at 709.59. Trading volume was 252m shares. Stock prices inched higher at the opening, encouraged by early gains in bonds which were sparked by reassuring news on inflation. The Labor department had reported that the producer prices index had remained flat during June, and that 'core' producer prices - the index excluding the volatile food and energy components - had actually fallen by 0.1 per cent. The figures were better than economists had been expecting, and provided an early boost to bond prices. At one stage, the benchmark 30-year bond was up three quarters of a point. Those early gains were wiped out later in the day, as bonds retreated in the wake of another big drop in the dollar, which fell to a new post-1945 low against the yen of Y96.50. At one point, the Dow was more than 20 points lower, as investors feared that the losses in the dollar might push the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates again to support the ailing currency. The sell-off in bonds, however, did not last long. Thanks to a modest rally in the dollar, which moved up to Y97.43 in late trading, and a weaker-than-expected report on retail sales from the Johnson Redbook service, the 30-year bond rebounded more than three quarters of a point from its lows. Stocks quickly followed suit, although blue-chip issues struggled to move into positive territory, primarily because in the past week blue-chips have outperformed other sectors of the market. Among individual stocks, Motorola jumped Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 50 1/4 as investors responded positively to Monday night's news that the company had earned 63 cents a share, up from a comparable 40 cents a share a year ago, and that semiconductor sales rose 23 per cent in the April-to-June period. Goodyear fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 in volume of 1.8m shares after the company's chairman, Mr Stanley Gault, said in a television interview that Goodyear's earnings in the second quarter would come in between Dollars 158m and Dollars 164m. Although that would represent a record quarter for the company, investors were disappointed because industry analysts had been looking for slightly better results. Philip Morris dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 1/8 in heavy trading after the tobacco and foods group announced second quarter earnings of Dollars 1.2bn. Although that was up from Dollars 1.05bn a year earlier, the results from the food operations were disappointing and a large part of the growth in sales volume was due to adjustments in inventory levels. Diagnostek rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/2 after being awarded a contract from the defence department which could generate Dollars 100m in annual revenues. Canada Toronto prices closed with a solid gain in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index gained 27.78 points, or 0.68 per cent, to close at 4,131.72. Winning issues led losers by 377 to 327. Activity continued at a relatively modest pace, with 43.91m shares changing hands valued at CDollars 567m compared with 42.06m worth CDollars 515m on Monday. The industrial products sector led today's advance with a 1.87 per cent index gain. In all, 12 of the 14 sub-groups were higher. Among the other key groups, mining and energy were higher, financial services was up modestly, while consumer products was little changed and golds fell somewhat. Alcan Aluminium was up  1/4 to 33  3/8 in active trading after reporting its first quarterly profit in nearly three years. Second-quarter net was Dollars 7m.</p>

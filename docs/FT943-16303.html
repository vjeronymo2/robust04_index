			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Smiths Industries expands third leg Smiths Industries, best known for aerospace and medical products, has enlarged its industrial group with a third acquisition in that area this year. Smiths has paid Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.7m) cash for Dura-Vent, a privately-owned US ducting business in Indiana which makes fume extraction products for industrial process machinery. The deal brings Smiths' spending on industrial acquisitions this year to Pounds 34m, and to almost Pounds 130m over the past three years. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said: 'This shows the industrial group's growing significance alongside our two other businesses, aerospace electronics and medical systems. 'We have demonstrated our ability both to identify niche businesses, which have an established position in their particular markets and to integrate them quickly with our existing activities. Such acquisitions soon make a positive contribution to the industrial group's strong performance, based on high margins and excellent cashflow.' The downturn in aerospace has caused profits from that division to be overtaken by medical systems, although last year aerospace had sales of Pounds 393m compared with Pounds 181m for medical systems. Last month's Pounds 100m acquisition by Smiths of Deltec, a US medical equipment manufacturer, will increase healthcare sales by more than a third. The industrial group's annual sales are now running at more than Pounds 200m, including recent acquisitions. Dura-Vent will be integrated into Flexible Technologies, Smiths' existing hosing and ducting business in North America. In April, Smiths paid Pounds 21.6m for Totco, the US heating element company, and in May bought Elkay Electrical, based in Newtown, Wales, for Pounds 6m. Since 1991, when it acquired Flexible Technologies, Smiths has invested almost Pounds 130m on acquisitions for the industrial group. The largest was Vent-Axia, the UK-based ventilation business bought from APV for Pounds 55.8m in 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kucherenko under the "Power and Money" </F> rubric: "Warrant for Moscow. A Subjective View of the  Activities of the Capital's Mayor"]    [Text] Yuriy Luzhkov has been a leitmotif of recent days.  He has announced that he will now oppose the course of the  present government. For more than six months now he has been a  fierce opponent of Chubays' privatization. He is said to be  aiming for the post of president of the Russian Federation.  <H5>  Nothing for Nothing? </H5>   Luzhkov's first thesis: It is necessary to sell property at  a realistic price and so replenish the budget in order to carry  out social and housing programs. He propagandizes this thesis  at every opportunity. But how does he fulfill it himself?    First of all, let us note that Chubays has never been able  to  "spread himself" in the capital. Since the middle of 1991  privatization here has been proceeding in a special way:  Yeltsin himself gave Moscow's mayor these powers in two edicts.  The mayor of Moscow has become the virtual ruler of the  destinies of the land, the buildings, the budgetary money, and  the so-called nonbudgetary funds. No organ elected by the  residents of "most democratic" Moscow controls him. Neither the  Mossovet [Moscow City Soviet], which at first was reduced to the  position of an "architectural excess" on the edifice of power in  the capital and was then destroyed, nor the City Duma, which  sits there meek as a lamb, has managed this.    Thus, few people prevented Mr. Luzhkov from obtaining  trillions from the capital's property in both 1992 and 1993.  What happened?    In 1992 the Mossovet raised a scandal: City Hall had planned  that the city's budget would get just 2.24 billion rubles [R]  from privatization! Just approximately $20 million at the then  prevailing rate of exchange, despite the fact that the rent for  one square meter of office space in the city ranged from $600 to  $1,200 a year!    Sergey Pykhtin, former member of the inner soviet, recalls  that literally a few days before Luzhkov announced the figure of  R2.24 billion, the press carried a report that the proceeds from  just four projects sold by City Hall had totaled R6 billion.    There was no scandal over the 1993 budget, since the  Mossovet  had been destroyed. But there was a debate in the summer of  1993. It turned out that City Hall had planned to secure R9  billion -- just approximately $9 million at the rate of exchange  at the time -- by leasing premises to privatized enterprises.  So the mayor's words about trillions of rubles, or billions of  dollars, somehow are not confirmed by the figures.    The mayor undoubtedly sells some things for money -- all  sorts of stores and warehouses. But let us take the fate of the  capital's tastiest property morsels -- hotels, CPSU property,  and plots of land in central districts. Have they brought many  billions to ordinary Muscovites? For all these are such  attractive things to business, on which business would not  grudge forking out huge sums of money. Just put this property  up for auction. But things happened differently.    Let us take an example: The Central Stadium at Luzhniki.    On 22 July 1992 Directive No. 1801-RP of the premier of the  government of Moscow (Luzhkov is both mayor and premier  simultaneously) exempted the stadium from profits tax and ground  rent. On 23 July Directive No. 222-RM "On Privatization of the  V.I. Lenin Central Stadium" set the charter fund of that project  at...R98 million, which at that time was equal to the value of  49 passenger cars or 25-30 apartments. Finally, on 11 September  1992 Document No. 337-RM organized an industrial goods market on  the stadium's territory.    Thus, a narrow group of people ("Luzhniki-Invest") obtained  a  huge piece of territory and finished structures, which they had  not erected, in a prestigious district practically free of  charge. At the same time the city budget would not get a single  kopek, for the mayor had exempted the new venture from taxes and  payments!    I could also cite the by now axiomatic example of the way 60  hectares in the region of Gagarin Square were leased for 99  years to the "KNIT-Kaluzhskaya Zastava" Joint Venture for $10 a  year. The city administration said about this: The low ground  rent will prompt investors to invest money in the construction  of a grandiose complex of buildings. But, in selling  enterprises very cheaply, Chubays' people say of the same thing:  Investors should not give money to the state but invest it in  production.  <H5>  Incidentally, About the "Party's Gold..." </H5>   I would like to ask the mayor what happened to the property  of the Moscow CPSU City Committee [Gorkom] and Oblast Committee,  the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] complex, and  the USSR Council of Ministers Administration of Affairs, which  Moscow City Hall inherited after August 1991. In which  newspapers did it publish the list of these projects and  announce a competition for their sale and privatization?  Finally, how much money was allocated, at the same time, to  social and housing programs?    Moscow CPSU Gorkom had seven buildings right in the center  of  the city, a facilities department with the "Litvinovo" Health  Camp, and a transport section with a garage and 900 employees --  really a readymade top-class cab fleet. (The list is taken from  Luzhkov's Directive No. 238-RVM of 6 September 1991). The CEMA  complex (which became first the residence of City Hall and then  that of the State Duma) included the Mir Hotel and restaurant,  an underground garage, a motor vehicle base, a printing plant, a  kindergarten, and a guest house. In addition to the 29-story  skyscraper itself, luxurious party housing also fell into City  Hall's hands after that August.    File entry: "...Last week's event was the sale by auction of  apartments in a block which belonged to the CPSU Central  Committee through the `Orgkomitet' Joint-Stock Company. It is  an interesting fact...that the right to sell these apartments  was granted to `Orgkomitet' without any competition being held.  Observers are inclined to put this down to a coincidence of  interests between the leaders of the Moscow government and the  joint-stock company...."    "On the day of the auction Mitichkin (president of the  joint-stock company -- V.K.) declared that he still did not know  what percentage his firm would receive from the apartment  sales.... This attests that `Orgkomitet's' leadership is able  to resolve this problem with the Moscow government calmly and  without problems" -- KOMMERSANT 2 March 1992.    It is worth recalling that this joint-stock company was  founded by the Moscow government (20 percent of the shares),  while none other than Luzhkov became its president. At the same  time it is not clear from the charter documents whether this was  as a representative of a legal person or as a private citizen.  It is also noteworthy that by his decision of 19 February 1991  he ordered that a proportion of the city administration's  profits from "Orgkomitet" be channeled not into the city's  budget but into increasing...the charter fund of "Orgkomitet"  itself. But what about social and housing programs for ordinary  Muscovites?    All right, the "Central Committee apartments" were put on  open sale. But what about the rest of the party's legacy? We  can use one example to show what benefit the ordinary Muscovite  derived from this "privatization."    The transport section of Moscow CPSU Gorkom became City  Hall's motor vehicle fleet. Whereas previously the poor Soviet  Union had paid for partyocrats to travel in black Volgas, now  the residents of City Hall rode around in the same vehicles. In  November 1991 Yuriy Mikhaylovich signed a joint decision with  the "ASM-Holding" Joint-Stock Company, under which the latter  pledged to supply City Hall's motor vehicle fleet with 150  passenger cars a year, while City Hall promised "ASM..." "to  give it all possible assistance in allocating premises and  paying for leased buildings...." So much for social and housing  programs.    Privatization of the capital's land and real estate is  something special. City Hall selected in an unknown way five  firms to organize auctions for the sale of plots and buildings.  It is a mystery who selected these firms and on what criteria.  The competitions which they held were not very well publicized  either.    Of course, an ordinary person with labor savings has nothing  to do in such auctions -- these are businessmen's games. But  they were not very pleased about them. At the end of 1992  Borovoy, who was then still at odds with Luzhkov, sorrowfully  said: We lodge applications for such auctions, but we never  succeed. Buildings are sold to goodness knows who for a few  million rubles and a week or two later are resold for a quarter  of a billion.    The second thesis advanced by the mayor, who has now gone  over to the opposition, is that anarchy reigns in Russia, with  the result that the country is being taken apart and sold off on  the cheap. If there is no power, not a single law or sensible  measure will work.    Luzhkov has been in charge of Moscow since 1990. At first de  facto, but then de jure. He has had more than enough time to  instill order. But what do we see? Let us open MOSKOVSKIYE  NOVOSTI for 5 September 1993 and learn that Luzhkov's government  is the founder of 178 joint ventures, to which 61 industrial  projects, 450 hectares of extremely expensive city land, and  buildings with an area of 220,000 square meters have been  transferred. The newspaper provides a detailed report of a  scandalous session of the city's government: "You might think  that Moscow can count on sizable receipts into its treasury from  these firms. But according to the data of the External  Relations Department, the city's revenue from the activities of  joint ventures is less than the funds invested in them. For  some reason just two-thirds were registered at the tax  inspectorate in 1992. Only 37 percent of them paid taxes to the  city in full. The budget has a constant shortfall in profits  from operating city property, including currency profits....  The mayor believes that it is necessary to analyze the work of  all ventures.... But nobody has made such a detailed analysis.  Moscow has no record of the activities of joint ventures. It  is not known today what specifically each firm does, how  successfully it does it, what use it makes of city property....  Back in April of last year (1992 -- V.K.) it (the government --  V.K.) entrusted the Moscow Committee for the Management of State  Property with creating a data bank of joint ventures. Still  nothing has been done (i.e. 18 months later -- V.K.). But it  will be extremely difficult for the government to reclaim its  share from the 'guilty parties.' The mechanism for confiscating  city property from joint ventures has not been worked out even  theoretically."  <H5>  The City as "Milch Cow" </H5>   We can cite another example. The "Perestroyka" Joint  Venture, in which the city had a 40-percent participation  through the "Mosinzhstroy" municipal structure. Yuriy  Mikhaylovich extolled Stroyev, the head of "Perestroyka," as a  real businessman. What next? In the spring of 1993 Stroyev hid  from Russian investigators in the United States, the  "Mosinzhbeton" Combine was left without the $1.5 million owed it  by the joint venture, and "Mosinzhstroy" was seeking its  legitimate share of the profits. It turned out that rich  foreign firms had been transferring the rent for "Perestroyka's"  offices to an account not at a Moscow bank but a Cypriot bank.  At the same time the joint venture easily obtained from Luzhkov  both land in Moscow and buildings. But Cyprus.... This island  is a place of registration for offshore firms and an  international tax haven.  <H5>  Market and Owners Moscow-Style </H5>   Yuriy Mikhaylovich has almost autocratic control over the  city's budget. The tax inspectorate is also subordinate to him.  But, even so, the mayor of Russia's richest city constantly  demands money from the federal budget, as though Moscow were  some loss-making collective farm!    During the life of the Mossovet the city budget served as a  constant subject of scandals. In December 1992 deputies forced  City Hall to admit that there was a shortfall of R40 billion in  the revenue part. In general, fiery passions were raging then  -- this is a subject for a separate article. It is sufficient  just to say that Luzhkov's financial department was unable even  to state definitely how many taxpayers there are in the city or  why there is a discrepancy of tens of times between its  indicators and the Moscow City Statistical Administration's  data. City Hall and the government of Moscow, both headed by  Luzhkov, were mortally offended by the Mossovet's suppositions  that the "missing" billions serve as magnificent soil for  corruption and embezzlement of public funds. They attempted to  end relations with the Mossovet altogether.    By the middle of 1993 another scandal had broken over the  city's budget, and the Mossovet entrusted its chairman with  lodging documents with the Prosecutor's Office. But the bloody  crisis arose, and the mayor once again found himself "in the  saddle."    Here is another recent example. At the end of that year the  Russian Federation Government cut down the budget investment  program prepared by the "economic heads" of the Ministry of  Economics -- Ya. Urinson and S. Vasilyev. It allocated only  approximately R30 billion to science, culture, and education.  But R200 billion for the construction in Moscow of the memorial  on Poklonnaya Hill. If that version had gotten through, Luzhkov  could have loudly proclaimed his thrift and patrioticness: I  have found the money for a sacred cause. The rich budget morsel  wrested from Russian physicians and teachers would have gone to  the capital's construction monopoly headed by Luzhkov's vice  premier -- Vladimir Iosifovich Resin.  <H5>  "Patriotic Market" and "Real Owners" -- the Moscow Version </H5>   Our mayor's third thesis: Chubays' privatization brings  forth not real owners but barren speculators in land and  buildings and foreign rogues who buy up everything on the cheap.  This, incidentally, is quite likely.    But how does the mayor himself put his patriotic principles  into practice? Let us take another example and trace who in  Moscow becomes an owner and how the commissions which determine  the very best are made up. So, the Moskva Hotel is on stage.    Last year the competition for the right to manage the hotel  was won by Germany's Adwanta in conjunction with "Menatep" and  the Moscow Regional Development Fund [MRDF]. It is significant  that the firm of "Oyromill," which lost to them, offered terms  that were far more advantageous to the city. Thus, "Oyromill"  promised to invest here the profits from the Moskva, while  Adwanta and company promised to export them. The loser promised  to recoup the expenditure in six years, and the winner in 15-18  "winters." [pun on Russian word for year -- leto -- which  literally means "summer"] "Oyromill" planned to involve our  specialists in the business and to spend 4 percent of the  profits on management, while Adwanta planned to spend twice as  much, with only foreigners on the management. The "also-ran"  estimated profits at $153 million over 10 years; the competition  winner at $76 million. At the same time Adwanta, "Menatep," and  the MRDF did not make any redemption payment at all into the  city treasury. They became, in fact, virtually the full owners  of a chic hotel 100 meters from the Kremlin, but the project  itself formally remained municipal property. Moreover, they  have made the Moskva into a standard of "anti-Chubaysism."    The secret of the win by Adwanta and company becomes clear  if  we take a look at the composition of the founders of one of the  owners of a very tasty morsel -- the MRDF. It is the Moscow  Construction Committee headed by V. Resin, Luzhkov's deputy, who  also headed the competition commission for the Moskva. Does it  turn out that he awarded victory to his own daughter firm?    Incidentally, the MRDF's founders include the present  External Relations Department of the city government headed by  I. Ordzhonikidze, who, let us note, was deputy chairman of the  jury on the Moskva.    Another member of this commission was the head of the  Municipal Housing Department, and yet another was Saprykin,  Luzhkov's subordinate, whose department is coowner of the  Balchug Hotel along with the firm of Kempinski, which is owned  by the same Adwanta. Do you require any further comment?  Particularly with regard to whether the city received any money  for housing and social programs as a result of that competition.    Today it is possible to state that the mayor has turned the  capital into a holding under his own control, which has  tenaciously monopolized the city's entire wholesale food trade,  transport, and construction -- in short, the city's most  important functions. Is this a market? The mayor maintains  that 3 million square meters of housing are constructed in  Moscow every year, one-third of which goes to indigent people on  the waiting list, with apartments going to those who joined the  line in 1987 (3.4 million meters), which is in keeping with the  1955 indicators. This despite the fact that twice as much is  paid for an apartment in the city as for one in America. Given  such a demand from businessmen, the capital should experience  literally a construction boom, and the municipality could give  investors land for apartment blocks, receiving in exchange 20  percent of the apartments for people on the waiting list. A  simple calculation attests that in this way it is possible to  obtain approximately twice as much free housing.    But construction in Moscow has been monopolized by Vice  Premier Resin, who prefers to construct somewhat less and to  sell it for somewhat more. Private investors themselves are  hardly building at all: City Hall demands too large a  percentage of apartments "in tribute." Therefore housing in the  city long ago became an unaffordable luxury for nonbusinessmen.  Moscow is heading pell-mell for the kingdom of "five families  in one room."  <H5>  Proprietors of Life </H5>   The "Orgkomitet" Joint-Stock Company trades in municipal  housing constructed at the taxpayers' expense and pockets the  profits. The "MIKS" Joint-Stock Company with the participation  of the Moscow Construction Committee's main administration  constructs luxury cottages for nouveaux riches. Businessmen who  conducted the "Moscow Lights" apartment lottery bought  apartments not directly from the Municipal Housing Department  but through some investment center attached to it. At a price,  moreover, four times higher than the auction price at that time  (incidentally, the lottery itself failed). Mr. Resin's  department also participates in the "City" project -- a piece of  New York in Presnya.    Contrary to laws and presidential edicts, Vladimir  Iosifovich  Resin himself went about for almost a year as a private person  -- founder of the firm of "Stroygarant" and owner of 60 percent  of "Mosinzhstroy's" capital. In August 1992 Resin (as vice  premier) transferred to this association (and, thus, also to  himself personally) property, the mere list of which runs to  hundreds of pages. Without any redemption payments, which the  mayor so wants to channel into housing and social programs for  ordinary city folk. Incidentally, in 1992-1993 the enterprises  belonging to "Mosinzhstroy" transferred to "Stroygarant" 1.5  percent, only not of the profits but of the volume of work  fulfilled. Since they had carried it out mainly with official  money, this constitutes a pump for transferring the people's  funds to private pockets. If you consider that "Mosinzhstroy"  has a total monopoly on road, asphalt, and pipelaying work, you  can understand that the source of pumping is practically  inexhaustible.    As the proprietor of "Mosinzhstroy," "Stroygarant" also owns  40 percent of the "Perestroyka" Joint Venture, of which we have  already spoken.  <H5>  Some Results </H5>   When it comes right down to it, the system being created by  Luzhkov -- power and big business in the same pair of hands --  is the economic basis of a totalitarian system resembling the  regimes of the ancient Asian despots, Haiti's "Papa Doc," or the  Mobutu Sese Seko clique in Zaire. The political superstructure  is determined by the basis.    It is already possible to see features of this  superstructure  in Moscow. The more rampant crime becomes, the more  self-confident thugs are seen in the city's streets in a dappled  uniform with handcuffs, sticks, and even firearms. Luzhkov has  gotten control of the Internal Affairs Main Administration and  municipal militia forces and is now also forming "people's  militia detachments" subordinate to his government.    Last year Luzhkov decided on a simple action: Caucasians  out, Special-Purpose Militia Detachment members in almost every  store. All of Moscow's lumpen applauded the mayor, giving no  thought whatever to the consequences. As though others (even  from Solntsevo! [town near Moscow -- hangout of mobsters]) would  not take the place of those driven out and take advantage of the  same anarchy and venality. Buying officials on the pretext of  paying for the services of their "pocket" firms.  <H5>  Politics Is Still a Dirty Business </H5>   Nevertheless, Luzhkov is becoming a formidable force in  politics. He relies on a narrow circle of bankers, allowing  "Most" and several other banks to service the city budget.  Dealers in real estate, which brings in huge profits, are  backing the mayor, who has done them a great favor. He makes  uncontrolled use of the budget and squeezes money out of the  federal government -- and they give luxury cottages to officers  of elite Moscow divisions. There is money for Big Politics and  the Big Press.    In the big game for the presidency Yuriy Mikhaylovich is  starting to speak in the words of those whom he was lambasting  just a few months ago -- Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. This ploy is  called "intercepting revolution." The mayor's experts and  image-makers evidently reckon that the national-state guys are  the best bet now. Luzhkov has already also been caught out in  fashionable "Russophilia." The claim that Gaydar and Chubays  are agents of Russia's enemies is a rhetorical ploy already  employed by him. Speaking about the jubilee of a celebrated  satirist, he cited himself with pleasure in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA:  "There is one Russian Luzhkov, the rest are Zhvanetskiys."    Let us note in this connection that the mayor is pulling the  tails of two dangerous animals, which might turn upon him:  nationalism and armed mercenaries.    As the venerable liberal Karl Popper warned in "The Open  Society and Its Enemies," someone who resorts to the services of  armed people runs a great risk. For people with guns will soon  realize that money is secondary. The primary force is the one  that can be used to secure both power and wealth for yourself.</p>

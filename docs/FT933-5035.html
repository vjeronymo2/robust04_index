			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Management: Changing face of the MBA - As demand for courses falls, business schools are reassessing their role A recent cartoon in the Christian Science Monitor conveys an uncomfortable message for modern managers. It pictures the IBM 'juggernaut' careering off the road and a clearly bemused 'driver' under the caption 'I don't understand . . . we all went to the top business schools'. Management education is going through a rough patch on both sides of the Atlantic. Demand for MBA courses is down 17 per cent in the US and by roughly the same figure in the UK. Companies are sending fewer managers on executive programmes; and contracting higher education budgets mean fewer faculty jobs for academic staff. The more honest and forward-looking business school heads, however, acknowledge that economic recession is not the sole culprit. Current uncertainty, they concede, has as much to do with changing perceptions of the value of an MBA. One such realist is Jim Schmotter, dean of the College of Business and Economics at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, and a former associate dean and director of international studies at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. Addressing human resource directors at a one-day conference at Manchester Business school last Thursday, Schmotter identified the main trends in North American management education with disarming frankness. Reinforcing the cartoon theme - that maybe the emperor has no clothes - Schmotter almost masochistically cited a New York consultant who advises Fortune 100 companies on their MBA recruitment. 'She (recently) observed that companies are now hiring MBAs primarily because of the work experience they had before entering school because they see no value that we on the campus add. And they are hiring far fewer. Further, they do not see business school faculty as qualified to help them solve important business problems.' Whether you agree with this bleak assessment or not - the Lehigh dean and most of his audience would presumably strongly beg to differ - Schmotter's point is that views like this are part of the market reality. How are business schools responding? Schmotter outlined four strategies. Do nothing, or as he put it, 'get down into my tenured bunker and wait for the economy to rebound'. Blaming others - naive students and short-sighted corporations - is part of this approach. Expand courses with features that look attractive, such as outward-bound leadership programmes, overseas trips or 'non-credit' sessions on speaking and etiquette. Schmotter argues that business schools have no comparative advantages in these areas, and none of it affects the curriculum or faculty. Gear up the public relations machine, proclaim commitment to the 21st century and try to get front page news coverage every day. Schmotter's verdict: 'Again, style over substance.' Finally, and most positively, introduce genuine reform. The task is not to be underestimated but he suggests that 'schools such as Michigan, Case Western Reserve, and Babson College are rethinking what they do - and from all we hear Harvard is soon to join this trend'. Schmotter believes that business schools will have to change because global corporate restructuring is resulting in fewer jobs of the kind MBAs have traditionally held. Schools will have to add more value to students' employability and alter their expectations. They will have to develop more real partnerships with companies. Shrinking resources will put a premium in business schools on the sort of concepts normally taught, rather than acted on, by academics: productivity, total quality and continuous improvement to name but three. Business school 'constituents', meanwhile, will increasingly continue to insist on a market-driven, rather than a product-driven mentality. Trends towards tailored, company-specific programmes are appearing in MBA education, too, and rankings are here to stay. MBA schools are also realising they cannot cover the waterfront, and specialisation - practised with success by the Thunderbird School and the University of South Carolina - is according to Schmotter the key to market share. The European model, he concedes, is finding converts in the US and schools there 'face sophisticated competition. . . for the best students, faculty and corporate support'. 'MBA education,' he adds, 'is a global phenomenon.' That in part explains why much of Schmotter's analysis is echoed in Europe: the growing PR awareness is particularly marked, and course reform is exemplified by the growth of distance learning, the sometimes discreet trimming of two-year MBA programmes and the development of intra-European networks. League tables and other forms of independent ranking may become more widespread, not least if the impasse over plans for a common European system of accreditation is not broken. Schmotter's thesis is one of opportunity as well as challenge, and in the UK there is arguably plenty of both. A recent Institute of Management survey reveals almost a third of UK companies admit to spending no time on management training, while other evidence suggests most UK companies are pleased if they devote 2-3 per cent (against the 25-30 per cent cited by many Japanese executives). As with the shoe salesman who returned disconsolate from Africa to say that everybody there went around in bare feet, such statistics can be read in more than one way.</p>

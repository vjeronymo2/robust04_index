			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 CONSUMER GROUPS URGE BOYCOTT OF EXXON GASOLINE  </P> <P> Three national consumer organizations are urging motorists to boycott Exxon  gasoline to protest higher prices and the quality of the company's efforts to  clean up its massive Alaskan oil spill.  </P> <P> The Washington-based Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition and the Chicago-based  Citizen Action have joined forces to launch "Make Exxon Pay," a boycott  campaign designed to protest the March 24 oil spill in Prince William Sound and  the subsequent rise in gasoline prices. The two organizations are asking  holders of Exxon Corp. credit cards to cut their cards into two pieces and send  one half to the Citizen Action office in Washington.  </P> <P> Citizen Action, which has 2 million members and affiliate associations in  California and 24 other states, began to accept credit cards Thursday. The  organizations plan to deliver the card pieces to Exxon at the company's annual  meeting May 18, according to Edwin Rothschild, assistant director of Citizen  Action. Rothschild said Exxon is passing the cost of the spill cleanup to  consumers by raising gasoline prices.  </P> <P> "Our aim is pure and simple," Rothschild said. "We want to send Exxon  management a message by getting as many people as possible to stop buying Exxon  products. . . . Exxon was negligent in Alaska, and then the company asks  consumers to shoulder the costs. We want to hit them where it hurts -- in the  pocket."  </P> <P> Exxon has been charging 6 to 11 cents more per gallon for its gasoline since  the oil spill, but other oil companies have been charging an average of 7 to 12  cents more per gallon during the same period, according to Leo McLean, an Exxon  spokesman. McLean said some of the increase is because of increasing crude oil  prices. Exxon had no immediate comment on claims that part of the price rise is  related to the cleanup, McLean said.  </P> <P> Responding to the boycott calls, Exxon has issued a statement reiterating  regret.  </P> <P> "All of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that our effort in  Alaska will convince them that we continue to be a responsible company," the  statement said.  </P> <P> However, a new group -- Citizens for Environmental Responsibility, Inc. --  contended that Exxon has bungled the cleanup and has also called for a boycott.  The organization, based in Erie, Pa., is asking Exxon customers to split their  Exxon cards and mail them to Exxon headquarters. Stephen Nissen, a Los  Angeles-based spokesman, said his organization is made up of 12 organizers and  100 volunteers. Nissen, a marketing consultant, said the organizers are  professionals and entrepreneurs who want to prompt companies to change their  attitudes about the environment.  </P></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fiat boosts expansion programme  -Haig Simonian on the Italian car maker's investment in Poland By agreeing to take 90 per cent of a new company to be formed with Poland's FSM cars group, Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector company, has moved a decisive step forward in its international expansion. However, the accord also involved a substantial increase in the size of its planned investment. In the memorandum of understanding signed by Italian and Polish negotiators last October, Fiat committed itself to taking just 51 per cent of FSM. That would have given the Turin-based company management control over the Polish group in which it had invested Dollars 800m in a project to create and build in Poland its new Cinquecento mini-car. The new car, introduced to the Italian market in March, has had considerable success. Early orders have already exceeded 40,000, while the 20,000 deliveries so far played a role in helping Fiat appreciably to improve its share of the domestic car market last month. Production of the Cinquecento is to be increased to 240,000 a year. But the deal signed in Warsaw on Wednesday night involves a much bigger commitment by Fiat than originally planned. Its stake in FSM has risen to 90 per cent, while the overall size of its Polish investment will reach around Dollars 2bn over the coming years. Fiat is in the early phases of a huge L47,000bn (Dollars 39bn) 10-year investment plan to revise its entire model range and build a big assembly plant and engine facilities in southern Italy. But last week, the group announced a 30 per cent drop in net profits for 1991, while its net financial position slipped into the red for the first time since 1986. With its finances stretched, what persuaded Fiat to step up its Polish commitment? The group's Polish activities stretch back to 1921, when it set up a subsidiary there. In 1971, FSM started producing Fiat 126 cars under licence, followed five years later by the Polonez, based on Fiat's 125 model. Talks on taking a direct stake began soon after Poland's democratic reform. Wednesday's agreement marks the biggest step so far in Poland's privatisation programme. The new arrangement will allow Fiat to integrate the Polish company, which employs about 23,000, much more closely into its group operations. After selling SEAT in Spain to Volkswagen in the mid-80s, Fiat has been exposed among Europe's leading car producers in not having any significant production capacity outside its home market. With the example of VW's purchase of Skoda in Czechoslovakia still familiar, the Italians may have sought a similar arrangement for themselves. Meanwhile, costs in Italy have been rising fast. In his letter to shareholders earlier this year, Fiat's chairman, Mr Giovanni (Gianni) Agnelli warned of the competitive disadvantages increasingly facing Italian manufacturers. At over 6 per cent, Italian inflation remains stubbornly above France and Germany. The labour market is inflexible, while industry suffers also from less obvious hindrances like poor public services. Despite the disincentives, the company is investing heavily in southern Italy - helped by some sizeable government investment grants. However, it may have felt the time had come to lay down a bigger marker elsewhere. The Polish investment may also reflect difficulties in Fiat's other big east European project - the planned purchase of a stake in VAZ, Russia's biggest car maker. The VAZ deal, which is still under negotiation, was itself a substitute for a much more ambitious venture to build an entirely new car plant at a greenfield site at Yelabuga. After Yelabuga was put on hold, largely as a result of the increasing financial problems facing the then Soviet Union, the VAZ proposal was put forward instead. Now, even that has melted into the background, although company officials say it has not been laid to rest. Fiat's strong interest in east European markets was highlighted last month when Mr Renato Ruggiero, Italy's former foreign trade minister who sits on the company's board and has responsibility for its international affairs, visited Kazakhstan. He met local leaders for exploratory talks on the possibility of setting up a new car plant. Developments in Fiat's model strategy may also have influenced its new Polish strategy. Rather than just build the Cinquecento, the deal with FSM involves the creation of a second model programme, designed to replace the 126 mini-car. Like the Cinquecento, the new model will be devised with both western and eastern European customers in mind. Arrangements for producing the new model are likely to be similar to those for the Cinquecento. To keep costs down and provide an adequate margin on such low-priced models, production for eastern European markets will be concentrated in Poland. Much will rely on the marketing. Like the Cinquecento, the model is likely to be pushed as a 'city car' in countries like Italy, where the compact size and convenience of the model are being stressed. Meanwhile, in economically-stretched eastern Europe, utilitarian qualities and relative cheapness are likely to be the main selling points. Polish venture lifts Milan, Page 41</p>

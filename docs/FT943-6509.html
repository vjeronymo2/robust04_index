			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Global warming The threat of global warming presents policymakers with peculiarly difficult problems. It may take decades to establish whether the scientific hypothesis  -that rising concentrations of 'greenhouse gases' in the atmosphere will cause the planet to warm up - is right. But while the probability of severe climate change seems low, the disruption that could ensue, particularly to food production, is great. At the Rio Earth Summit two years ago, more than 150 governments felt that the risk justified immediate measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Representatives of those governments are now meeting in Geneva to debate how to turn the Rio pledges into a workable plan. The two-week conference lays the ground for the first formal review of the convention next March in Berlin, when signatories will decide whether the agreement is adequate to combat the threat of global warming. That task is not proving easy. The Rio convention, one of the world's most ambitious environmental treaties, requires developed countries to make plans to bring emissions of 'greenhouse gases' back to 1990 levels by 2000. It also asks developing countries to restrain carbon dioxide emissions by promoting energy efficiency. Last week's debate served to highlight the convention's shortcomings. First, many developed countries are likely to overshoot the 2000 target by at least several per cent; the European Union is a prominent example. Governments of industrialised countries appear to have reckoned that recession, together with some easily-achievable improvements in energy efficiency, would curb the growth of emissions. But they have found that the recession deterred investment in energy efficiency, and that growth has now picked up more quickly than they projected. Developing countries Second, the convention largely ducked the question of whether developed countries should pay developing ones to curb their emissions. Although governments from industrialised countries have pledged up to Dollars 4bn over the next three years to the Global Environment Facility, a UN-backed environmental fund for developing countries, this is insufficient. Third, and most obviously, the Rio convention is silent on goals beyond 2000. In developing more effective measures, governments should start with a co-ordinated removal of subsidies to fossil fuels. Such subsidies are largest in countries, such as the US and China, which will contribute much of the world's carbon dioxide emissions in the next few decades. Nuclear power Governments should also consider expanding the role of nuclear power. However the only region now warmly embracing nuclear power is Asia. Development of civil nuclear programmes has virtually halted in the US and Germany, and may in the UK. Another priority is to give support to proposals for 'joint implementation'  -a formula under which developed countries could fulfil the target's requirements by helping developing countries curb their emissions. These plans are controversial. Many developing countries argue that developed countries have created the threat of global warming, through their past emissions, and that they should bear the burden of averting it. The plans have also aroused unease in developed countries, since they imply extensive transfer of technology, through trade and aid. Their attraction is that they would help allocate funds efficiently, and could open the way to more ambitious targets for the next century than would be possible if curbs were applied in developed countries alone. These steps, which are necessary if global warming is to be tackled convincingly, are uncomfortable. That discomfort, however, has one benefit: it will encourage governments to continue to assess the need for the targets in the light of emerging scientific evidence. Environmentalists may see that process as a threat to the hard-won ground of the Rio convention. This attitude is wrong. Policy made against a backdrop of scientific uncertainty needs to be refined repeatedly if it is fully to reflect not only the scale of environmental risks but also the sizeable costs of combatting them.</p>

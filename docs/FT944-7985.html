			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / US needs further rate rise to curb inflation, warns OECD The US will need to raise interest rates further to ease inflationary pressures coming to a head in the economy, warn economists at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD's latest report on the US economy, published yesterday, says most indicators are signalling the danger of a pick-up in inflation over the next year or two, and that the 2 1/2 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates the Federal Reserve has made this year will not be enough to slow the economy to a more sustainable rate of growth over the long term. The OECD, which represents 25 of the world's main industrialised countries, predicts that the federal funds rate, the Fed's principal short-term interest rate, will have to rise to 6 1/4 per cent by the end of next year. The projection was made before the Fed's decision last week to raise rates by  3/4 of a percentage point to 5 1/2 per cent, and had not counted on such a sharp move. Nevertheless, OECD economists still expect further tightening will be needed next year. 'Even though the case is by no means airtight, there is good reason to think that inflation has now reached its trough for this business cycle,' the report says. It forecasts gross domestic product growth slowing from 3.8 per cent this year to 2.9 per cent in 1995, with inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, accelerating from 2.1 per cent to 2.8 per cent in 1995. US Treasury officials attacked the growth forecast as too high. The official forecast is for 2.7 per cent growth. Last week's rate rise was welcomed by most Wall Street economists, but was criticised by some manufacturers who complained that the Fed could kill off the recovery in spite of the absence of clear signs of faster inflation. The OECD, however, finds evidence that the economy is vulnerable to a rise in inflation in 'the job vacancy rate, slower vendor deliveries, spreading capacity constraints and spot shortages in certain sectors and for certain types of high-skilled employees'. Many analysts believe that the economy will probably slow in any case, because of the interest rate increases pushed through. But even if the US economy has more capacity than the OECD estimates, the report says, 'erring on the side of restraint would appear to be the best policy'.

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Germans brace for holiday price war THE German travel industry is braced for a package holiday price war with British and Dutch tour operators next year. It expects hostilities to break out next summer, following the opening of the European single market on January 1. The low-price sector on routes to Spain, Greece and Italy will be the first affected, according to officials of ITS, one of Germany's leading tour operators. There were 'clear signs' the competition was preparing to move in, with packages up to DM120 (Pounds 42.50) cheaper than those now on offer. UK and Dutch prices were lower, the officials said, because their pilots and cabin staff were paid less than German workers, and they made greater use of their transport capacity. 'A German aircraft flies 3,300 hours a year and an English one 4,200. Obviously greater capacity use reduces costs,' ITS said. The company, part of the Kaufhof department store group and fourth biggest travel agent in Germany, expects total industry sales to increase by between 5 and 10 per cent next year. Deutsche Bank estimates Germans will spend about DM56bn on travel during 1992. ITS, which announced on Friday average price increases of 1.5 per cent for the 1993 summer season, expects its domestic sales to rise 23 per cent this year to almost DM1bn.</p>

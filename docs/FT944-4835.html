			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Paris talks tough on breaches of EU law France wants the European Union to harmonise penalties for breaking EU laws, allowing them to be enforced evenly and properly, Mr Alain Lamassoure, French EU affairs minister, said yesterday. France, which takes over presidency of the Union next month, is to ask the European Commission to make an inventory of all infractions of existing EU laws and to attach to all future draft EU legislation clauses specifying the sanctions for breaking it. Mr Lamassoure made clear that the initiative would tackle more than EU budget fraud and, for the first time, would harmonise sanctions currently left for member states to fix when they transpose EU regulations and directives into their national legislation. France's move may pose a dilemma for British Conservative Eurosceptics who recently argued that the UK should pay no extra into a Brussels budget that is so defrauded, but who might bridle at the EU reducing national prerogatives on legislative sanctions. 'Member states may say setting sanctions is our national prerogative,' said Mr Lamassoure. 'This is fine, when all member states apply some sanction, but they don't' As examples of the unevenness of sanctions, he cited the EU's 1991 directive against money-laundering, for whose infraction some states had attached virtually no penalty but Luxembourg had prescribed a 20-year jail sentence, and EU rules on giving hormones to livestock, which carried penalties of fines in some countries but prison in others. A former chairman of the European parliament's budget control committee, Mr Lamassoure said it was his experience of investigations into the same fraud covering several EU states that 'some countries are very strict, while others show great gentleness, even complicity' towards fraudsters. Companies operating in stricter states were placed at a competitive disadvantage. Mr Lamassoure said the French foreign and justice ministries had drafted a memorandum which they would shortly send to Brussels. 'Our preoccupation is about the fight against fraud and also about the respect for EU laws in all fields - agricultural and regional grants, public market openness, environmental norms and so on.' He stressed that the French initiative covered only infractions of EU law, not national criminal law. It therefore meant no softening of French reservations about Europol, the German-backed proposal for a Europe-wide police network that is to be discussed at the Essen summit. 'For the present, there is no European penal law, and therefore no possibility of a European equivalent of America's Federal Bureau of Investigation,' the minister said.</p>

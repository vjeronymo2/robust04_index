			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "Green Light to Use Air Power in </F> Bosnia"]    [Excerpts] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's decision  to give the green light to the use of air power in Bosnia to  support the relief of the Canadian battalion in Srebrenica and  the opening of the airport in Tuzla continues to prompt a  variety of comment from officials, experts, and the press.  [passage omitted]    On Tuesday international mediators T. Stoltenberg and David  Owen (EU) arrive in Moscow for consultatuions. The Russian  leadership's position, which will be set out for them at the  Foreign Ministry, will probably differ from the pronouncements  by LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, who said in Belgrade that the bombing of Serbs in  Bosnia will mean a declaration of war on Russia. Nonetheless,  the mediators will again be advised to think twice before  reaching decisions on Bosnia. Their talks with the Russian  Federation foreign minister will probably center on the new  Russian initiatives and the future of the International  Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.</p>

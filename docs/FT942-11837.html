			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Patten taunted on NUS reversal Mr John Patten, the education secretary, was taunted by Labour MPs yesterday over his 'humiliating climbdown' in agreeing not to renew his attempt to impose stricter controls over the National Union of Students, Ivor Owen writes. Moving the second reading of the education bill in the Commons, he formally confirmed his acceptance of the watered-down provisions on student unions introduced by the government to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the Lords. But Mr Patten was insistent that an amendment requiring closer co-operation with universities by schools involved in training graduate teachers - inserted as a result of a government defeat in the Lords - should be overturned. The bill was given a second reading by a government majority of 55 (299-244).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["adh" report: "Metalgesellschaft Recovering Slowly and </F> Painfully"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- In the view of its board of  directors, Metallgesellschaft AG, Frankfurt, has made "good  progress in many fields" over the past few months. During the  first five months of the 1993-94 (30 September) business year,  the corporation achieved a yield of 55 million German marks [DM]  before taxes; the year before the yield was DM3.4 billion. The  operational result has also improved, Kajo Neukirchen, chairman  of the board of directors, stressed at the shareholders'  meeting. The operational loss declined to DM50 million (the  year before DM80 million). These figures, however, do not  include the losses of DM1.5 billion suffered by the U.S.  subsidiary, MG Corporation, which caused the financial disaster  of Metallgesellschaft AG. During the first months of this year  the turnover was DM7.1 (7.2) billion. The number of employees  in the corporation declined to 41,357 (43,988) employees.    The cleaning-up and restructuring work at MG is also  documented by numerous sales. After the sale of Kolbenschmidt,  Korf, and Methanex, a 65-percent share of Metal Mining  Corporation is obviously to be sold soon. "The necessary  investments in the raw material production far exceed the  financial capacity of the Metallgesellschaft corporation,"  Neukirchen said. Solving the mining problem is also pursued  with "high priority."    Yesterday the shareholders' meeting had to decide on the  second part of the recovery measures, which were adopted at the  extraordinary shareholders' meeting on 24 February. The focal  item was the issuing of convertible participation rights, with  which claims by the banks are converted.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LADY LIBERTY IS DOING FINE ON HER OWN  </P> <P> In China, the massed students carried a replica of the Statue of Liberty,  quoted Thomas Jefferson and demanded democracy.  </P> <P> At the same time, in political salons here, it was being said that America is  losing the public-relations offensive because George Bush is a standpat person  while Mikhail Gorbachev is a wizard in the great media contest of ideas.  </P> <P> Can both of these situations be simultaneously correct?  </P> <P> No. Trust the verdict of the kids with Lady Liberty in the street, not the  pundits who cite polls about how very popular Gorby is in Europe. Gorbachev is  popular precisely because America and the West are winning the contest.  Gorbachev is saying that totalitarianism is a disaster and that democracy is  wonderful. If memory serves, that is the point that the United States has been  making for many decades. If Gorbachev now agrees, he's plenty popular with me,  too.  </P> <P> So much of this is so new and so untested that it makes Bush's cautious  attitude quite wise. Anyone who claims to know what will happen regarding the  democracy wave in the communist countries doesn't understand the situation.  </P> <P> I recently heard a leading East European scholar describe what is taking place  in Hungary as "the purposeful dismantlement of a communist government by a  communist government." Indeed, if the Hungarian government is to be believed,  it is possible that within a year it will hold true multiparty democratic  elections. A few years ago survey research conducted by Radio Free Europe  showed that if a real election were held in Hungary, the Communist Party would  get less than 10% of the vote!  </P> <P> Will such an election be held? Will the Communist Party successfully make  radical changes to gain popular appeal? Would the Soviets live with a  non-communist victory or try to reverse it? If a new free Hungarian government  should choose to secede from the Warsaw Pact, what would the Soviets do then?  </P> <P> We do not know the answers to these questions, or the answers to similar ones  at almost every spot in our adversary's empire. In the Baltics, the Ukraine and  Poland, the cry for democracy is now heard, but we do not know if it will be  heeded. It is easy to demand a bold, new, active policy from President Bush.  But when a potential tidal wave may be transforming the terrain upon which  policy would be made, such a call is naive.  </P> <P> The potency of the democracy movement cannot even be gauged because it may be  more than a tidal wave; it may also be a blessed and long-running journalistic  fad. The heavy artillery pieces in the struggle for global democracy are  television cameras. Since the incredible political events in the Philippines in  1986, it has become clear that the most dramatic and fulfilling story for a  journalist to cover is one about democracy, or even partial democracy, coming  to a place where democracy wasn't before: Chile, South Korea, Poland, even the  Soviet Union, and now China.  </P> <P> The video trendiness of the story makes it yet bigger. Because television is  everywhere, and satellites send pictures everywhere, the pictures of democracy  are everywhere. Democracy is contagious. People who see it and don't have it,  want it. And people who do have it and see it being denied elsewhere, want  their governments to get tough with the governments that are doing the denying.  If that thought isn't troubling Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega as he  contemplates the Nicaraguan elections next February, then Ortega is not only a  communist thug, but also a dope.  </P> <P> As recent events tend to reveal, the world is spinning in our direction,  replete with replicas of the Statue of Liberty in recently totalitarian China.  For the time being, Bush's response is the right one: Let it keep spinning our  way.  </P></p>

Private farmers have already achieved a  significant success in the past few years. Your products are  more and more noticeable on the Russian table," says the  greeting sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the  delegates of the congress of the Association of Peasant Holdings  and Cooperatives of Russia (AKKOR).    I fully realize that had the state rendered more substantial  support to farms, their output would have been much more  substantial too, says the greeting, released today by the  president's press service.    "Farmers are becoming a noticeable and influential force in  Russian society," the document emphasizes. "Remarkably,  thousands of officers and warrant officers in reserve have  received land plots. The time when you have only been posing  problems is coming to an end. The main thing now is to find  most effective solutions, together with the authorities,  together with all those who want to help Russian agriculture."</p>

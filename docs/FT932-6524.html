			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Wise men warn on budget deficit and inflation INDUSTRY and the City were bursting with advice yesterday for the new chancellor to cut spending and keep a lid on inflation. The reaction to Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment came as sterling fell against the D-Mark amid fears that interest rates would be cut. Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasts at London Business School and one of the 'seven wise men' advising the Treasury, said Mr Clarke had got to 'carry further the policy of getting the budget deficit down' and act decisively on the threat of inflation. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, said the new chancellor should 'substantially cut' public spending to pull back the rising government deficit, expected to be about Pounds 50bn this financial year. He said greater openness in policymaking was required, in particular to find out what went wrong last autumn when Britain was forced to leave the European exchange rate mechanism. By contrast, Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the construction company, called for a more expansionary policy. 'Mr Clarke must now deliver the economic strategy for sound and sustainable growth which we were promised by the prime minister,' he said. Fears that Mr Clarke would cut interest rates and further stimulate the economy contributed to sterling's weakness on the foreign exchange markets. Shortly after Mr Clarke's appointment was announced on news agencies, the pound fell 2 3/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark, reaching a low of DM2.4950 before closing in London at DM2.5075. In late New York trading the pound was at DM2.5046. Against the dollar it rose nearly a cent in London to close at Dollars 1.555. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.56185. Gilts and shares ended little changed on the day. Some industrialists lined up with the City economists in urging the chancellor to be tough on spending. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'The priority of the chancellor has to be to keep inflation under control.' Mr Martin Taylor, chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said public finances needed to be brought under control to avoid a sterling crisis. 'If this (Mr Clarke's appointment) is the way of securing party unity behind difficult and painful measures, then it had to be done.' On environment, Mr Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said the key test was whether the incoming Mr John Gummer could win battles with the other ministries, particularly transport and the Department of Trade and Industry. Ms Janet Langson, director of the Water Services Association, representing the water companies, called for 'clear decisions' over relations with Ofwat, the industry watchdog.</p>

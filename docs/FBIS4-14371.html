			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, QUDS PRESS -- Informed Palestinian sources  have said that the PLO leadership recently completed the  formation of the national authority that will manage the  self-government's affairs in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area  in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles.    According to the Palestinian sources, who are close to the  Cairo talks, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will personally  head this authority, which will be announced at a later date.    The sources, who wished to remain anonymous, linked the  announcement on the formation of this authority to the  achievement of fundamental progress that ensures the  Palestinians the beginning of the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles.    The Palestinian sources told QUDS PRESS that "Israel's  procrastination and its non-adherence to dates on which  agreement had been reached forced the Palestinian leadership to  postpone the announcement on the national authority's formation."    The Palestinian sources refused to provide details on the  formation of this body but said that it will comprise 18  members, 11 from the diaspora and seven from the occupied  territories. The distribution of the authority's diaspora  members will be as follows: Seven from the PLO Executive  Committee, two from the Fatah Central Committee, and two  independents.    The Israeli Government had called on the Palestinian  leadership to announce the self-rule authority, but the PLO  rejected this demand as premature. The Palestinian sources  expressed the belief that the announcement on the formation of  the authority might provoke internal conflicts, especially as  there is no Palestinian authority inside the occupied  territories to impose the law.</p>

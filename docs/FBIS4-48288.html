			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Text] A real effort is underway to bring about  reconciliation between General Constand Viljoen and Dr. Ferdi  Hartzenberg's Afrikaner National Front. A joint committee of  the two organizations could, within a few days, repport back on  whether a basis could be found on which supporters of the  volkstaat [homeland] idea can work together outside and inside  Parliament.    The division in right-wing ranks started when Gen. Viljoen  and a group of supporters broke away from the National Front  shortly before the elections and participated in the election  under the banner of the newly-formed Freedom Front. They are  now claiming that the Freedom Front mustered the most right-wing  votes -- a claim which is being strongly rejected by the  National Front.  <H5>  Reconciliation </H5>   While there is strong insistence on reconciliation from  certain quarters, Gen. Viljoen sounded a warning this week: "We  knew from the outset that we had chosen the right strategic path  by participating in the election. We had to endure many insults  as a result of this choice. The Freedom Front cannot at this  stage let its supporters down and this does not mean that we are  reluctant to cooperate. But the Freedom Front will not subject  itself to the authority of the National Front."    According to Dr. Hrtzenberg, the initiative is being taken  to  unite as many Afrikaners as possible, not only the right wing,  but even supporters of the NP National Party are also being  targeted. He believes that the joint objective of a "free,  Christian, Afrikaner republic" presents sufficient basis from  which work on unity can be extended. All right wingers must be  included in this union, Dr. Hartzenberg believes.  <H5>  New Grouping </H5>   But according to Gen. Viljoen, he cannot say at this  juncture  that he is optimistic. "In the election the Freedom Front got  together a brand new grouping of Afrikaners; not only right  wingers, but many from the NP as well. The needs of all have to  be taken into consideration now."    According to his estimate the Freedom Front received 35  percent support from adult Afrikaners with more than 30 percent  among those that abstained. This represents a majority of all  Afrikaners, Gen. Viljoen said. -- In some circles within the  National Front this week there had been little enthusiasm  regarding cooperation with Gen. Viljoen. "There is no basis for  unity because the Freedom Front's policy differs drastically  from that of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]," says AWB  Executive Committee member Fred Rundle. "The Freedom Front is  nearer to the ANC than it is to us," he said.</p>

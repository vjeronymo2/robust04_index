			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: London Electricity lifts interim payout by 32% to 7.4p a share London Electricity yesterday announced an increase in its interim dividend, which at 32 per cent was well ahead of any of the other UK regional electricity companies. London's increase reflects the adoption of a policy which makes it the first regional power company to state an aim to pay a third of the total dividend at the halfway stage. Other electricity distributors tend to aim for 30 per cent. Analysts increased their dividend forecasts for the full year marginally to about 22.2p. The shares rose initially but closed the day unchanged at 644p. In the six months to September 30, London made pre-tax profits of Pounds 69.9m (Dollars 104.5m), against Pounds 52m, restated to take in the effects of the new coal contracts. Turnover on continuing operations was down from Pounds 584.3m to Pounds 581.6m. Earnings per share rose to 24p from 17.7p and the dividend to 7.4p from 5.6p.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Labour can't bank on it If you accept popular mythology, the Conservatives won the election of April 1992 because they peddled two false promises. First, the depression would end the day after Mr John Major had returned to Downing Street. Second, the new Tory government would cut taxes, year after year after year. This bait may have caught some gullible voters, but many deserted the opposition parties, or voted Conservative, for a different reason. They trusted Labour less than they disliked the government. In spite of everything that has happened since that contest, history could repeat itself at the next election, which need not take place until April 1997. Never underestimate the ruthlessness of politicians in trouble. Those of us who watched Mr Christopher Patten, then chairman of the Conservative party, campaign with a disregard for civilised discourse that must have been foreign to his true nature will not easily forget the experience. His counterpart next time - perhaps Lord Archer, or a similar fairground barker  -will not shrink from repeating Mr Patten's unlovely performance. To be sure, the weekend figures indicating that the taxes we will pay from April will exceed those imposed by the then Mr Denis Healey in 1978-79 diminish the force of Conservative protestations that their instincts are to keep taxation low. But everyone knows that Labour's natural inclination is to use taxes as a means of redistributing income, and to tax high. That is why it is not sufficient for the shadow chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, to say that the Tories lied about taxes in April 1992. Of course they did. They always do. They may think they are honest at the time, as Mr Major says he was in 1992, but the effect of putting taxes up after promising to keep them down is to lead people to wonder whether they have been taken for a ride. If memory serves, the Conservatives not only lie, they deceive, bamboozle, hoodwink, mislead, double-cross, trick, cheat, cozen, fiddle, diddle, tell porky-pies and practise extreme economy with the truth. Sir Anthony Eden bought the May 1955 election by knocking 6 old pence (2 1/2 p) in the pound off income tax and reducing the scope of purchase tax, the precursor of VAT. In October he took back in indirect imposts what he had given away in direct tax relief in April. If the subject matter of electoral falsehoods is not tax, it is the chimera of good times around the corner. In 1959 the then Mr Harold Macmillan paid Colman, Prentis &amp; Varley - that season's Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - to promote the Conservatives as the party of prosperity. They won. Within a year the pre-election inflationary 'go' was followed by a post-election deflationary 'stop'. Labour's then Mr Harold Wilson had the wit to use the same ploy in the 1966 election, which was preceded by an outpouring of spending promises and followed by the introduction of special employment tax. The voters never learn. Nor, it seems, does Labour. Since 1979 it appears to have disconnected itself from the politics of victory. If it is to achieve office in the last years of this century it must understand that the disinclination of southern and suburban voters to support the party of the old north is cultural. This phenomenon has yet to be addressed by the leader, Mr John Smith. Labour has made much progress, and got nowhere. It is no longer the purveyor of unilateral disarmament, nationalisation, open-ended subsidies to dying smokestack industries, long queues, shoddy service and loony left councils. The shadow home secretary, Mr Tony Blair, has rescued it from adherence to the closed shop and the public perception that it is soft on crime. After Black Wednesday, the Tories cannot accuse Labour of being the party of devaluation. Yet Mr Smith does not look like a winner. Four times rejected, his party remains unmodernised. The trade unions still finance it, and exert influence at all levels. At question time in the Commons Mr Smith may enjoy taunting the prime minister with the latest figures on taxation, but he has produced no evidence that he is thinking of ways to diminish the social spending that makes them necessary. Labour's Commission on Social Justice, set up for that purpose, may find it difficult to persuade Mr Smith to accept any radical recommendations. What is Labour's economic policy? We only know what it is not - that is, not very different from the Tories'. It aspires to full employment, but how will it achieve this? It eschews taxation 'for its own sake', but what does that mean? Why, apart from seeking office, does Labour exist? Such questions are most felicitously addressed by Mr Blair, whose mind stretches beyond Labour's redoubt in the public sector unions. He considers what touches ordinary voters. That is why he is one of the few British politicians worth taking seriously. He is not a 'one more heave' merchant, and he is too young to be a brainwashed party hack. Mr Smith is hamstrung by the need to put party unity ahead of other considerations. He gives the impression that he is waiting for the elect-orate to come around to the fair-minded, centre-right way of thinking that was infused in him 20 or 30 years ago. It is possible that the Labour leader's policy of doing very little and saying even less may pay off. It generates few hostages to fortune: all the Tories can say is that Labour has no policy. Nothing that Mr Major's government has done since April 1992 generates any confidence that it will find its feet during the coming year or so. Labour's best argument in 1996 (the most likely election year) will presumably be that 17 years is long enough for a Conservative administration, and that it is time to throw the incompetent rascals out. On present form, this should have a powerful appeal. Mr Smith would be unwise to bank on it. An Eden-style tax cut in the November 1995 budget, accompanied by promises of more public spending and followed by a quick election in April 1996 would be dangerous for Labour. However hesitant the recovery, people may be feeling better off by then. Mr Smith might be caught high and dry. Complacency is not an attractive election manifesto. Resting on the unmasking of Tory deceptions of April 1992 will have little effect in April 1996. In short, Labour's present strategy of taking no risks is the highest risk of all.</p>

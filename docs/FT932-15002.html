			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hang Seng surges 5.8% to record close EQUITIES settled lower as institutional investors and dealers took profits in the afternoon amid active trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average retreated 206.91 to 20,533.38 after a high of 20,874.71 and a low of 20,470.33. The broader Topix index of all first section issues shed 15.96 to settle at 1,592,80 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.6 to 1,260.88. Most investors remain bullish, and describe the decline as a temporary break. Volume was estimated at 850m shares, compared with Tuesday's 784.6m. Advances edged declines by 539 to 535, with 121 issues unchanged. The Nikkei average is expected to retain its upward trend until it reaches 21,500, which is seen as a resistance level by some chart analysts. Beyond this level, said Mr Yuichi Matsushita, senior market strategist at Nikko Securities, selling pressure is likely to come from Japanese corporations which invested in tokkin funds, or specified money trusts, which declined in value last year. Companies, including leading trading houses, are also said to be offloading their 'zaiteku' or financial engineering investments. Large capitalisations stocks lost ground with Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, easing Y7 to Y402. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y30,000 to close at an intraday low of Y1.04m. The financial sector suffered broad losses on profit-taking: Sakura Bank shed Y70 to Y1,440, Industrial Bank of Japan slipped Y60 to Y2,640 and the Bank of Tokyo declined Y30 to Y1,310. Profit-taking also pushed the export sector lower with Sony declining Y20 to Y4,980 and TDK settling down Y20 to Y4,100. In spite of the session's losses, the government's plan to strengthen its telecommunications infrastructure gave a boost to Tamura Electric Works, the telecom equipment maker, which gained Y50 to Y794. Suzuki Motor benefited from motorcycle demand in China, finishing Y12 higher at Y986. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 39.72 to close at 22,153.10 in volume of 39.4m shares. Roundup SENIOR Pacific Rim markets turned in record performances. Bombay was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG surged to a record closing high, with investors taking the view that a resumption of Sino-British talks on the colony's future was nothing but good news. The Hang Seng index rose 371.53 or 5.79 per cent to finish at 6,789.74, after an intraday peak of 6,805.66. In subsequent London trading, prices closed at the equivalent of a further 50 point rise in the index. Hong Kong turnover was also at a record, reaching HKDollars 7.7bn, compared with a previous high of HKDollars 6.4bn set last May. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London believes that the market is now poised to breach the 7,000 level on the Hang Seng, and that a successful conclusion to the Beijing talks would take the index up to 7,200. Among blue chips leading the rise, Jardine Matheson rose HKDollars 7, or 15 per cent, to HKDollars 55. The British-controlled trading group has lagged behind the market since Beijing criticised it late last year for supporting the governor's democratic reform drive. HSBC Holdings was the most active stock, adding HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 73.50 while Cheung Kong, the property group, rose HKDollars 1.20 to HKDollars 23.70. AUSTRALIAN stocks finished at a three-year high with the All Ordinaries index adding 15.7 to 1,704.4 in turnover of ADollars 310.1m. Hong Kong's strong showing provided some stimulus while metal stocks came to the fore on hopes that Japan's economic recovery package would improve demand. Among mining stocks, MIM gained 7 cents to ADollars 2.24 and BHP climbed 14 cents to ADollars 15.08. SINGAPORE closed higher in record volume of 431.79m shares. The Straits Times industrial index rose 15.10 to 1,708.61 in brisk trading of Malaysian shares. SEOUL, however, saw aggressive profit-taking across the board after the recent bull run and the composite index fell 15.60 to 704.92 in turnover of Won887bn. The mood was unsettled by the resignation of the president's top aide which triggered concern that discontent in the ruling party might lead to political unrest.</p>

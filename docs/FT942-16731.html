			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hewden-Stuart rises to Pounds 19m - Company confident year will see start of building industry recovery Hewden-Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, said yesterday it was still confident that 1994 would see the start of a national recovery in the building and construction industry. The Glasgow-based group reported a 60 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12m to Pounds 19.1m for the year to January 31, on sales up by 21 per cent to Pounds 200m (Pounds 165m). The group said the improvement reported at the interim stage had continued, and profits in the second half were up 90 per cent on the same period last time. Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said the board had decided last autumn that this year would see an upturn which would benefit the group in due course and had accordingly authorised a major capital investment programme. He said: 'Our very strong cash position, coupled with the enormous cashflow which is now running at over Pounds 1m per week, has enabled the directors to take a long-term view of capital investment.' Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 24m to Pounds 54m, all funded out of cash balances which remained in surplus at the year-end, and the group said spending on new plant was likely to continue at a similar level this year. Last July Hewden paid Pounds 11m for the non-operated plant hire assets of BET Group. The group said these assets had been integrated with existing subsidiaries, but had contributed an estimated profit of Pounds 400,000 on sales of about Pounds 8m. Upturn in demand was clear in the south and south-east of the UK, but less marked in Scotland and the north-east of England, which had been less affected by the recession and so had smaller scope for recovery. Mr Sandy Findlay, chief executive, said higher utilisation levels meant the group was beginning to be able to ask clients to pay higher rates for modern equipment. Earnings per share rose by 85 per cent to 6.77p (3.67p). A final dividend of 2.15p makes a total for the year of 2.9p (2.7p). COMMENT Analysts were full of praise for these results, and Hewden's shares rose 9p to 161p. Even the tower crane division, which fell off a cliff with the end of the last building boom, has been returned to modest profit. Elsewhere, the acquisition from BET and the decision to increase capital expenditure seems perfectly timed to benefit from an upturn in demand. The shares have outperformed the market by more than 50 per cent over the last 12 months, and are currently trading on a prospective multiple of over 19. That substantial premium looks justified, given Hewden's huge operational gearing, and the quality of management singles it out as one of the safest of the recovery plays.</p>

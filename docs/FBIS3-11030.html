Carlos Larreategui, minister secretary general of public  administration, made this announcement and pointed out that the  TSE's decision is "an attack on democracy" stemming from a  "conspiracy" of the electoral interests of two opposition  parties, namely the Social Christian Party (PSC) and the  Democratic Left (ID).    In the first public reaction by a government official after  the TSE decision was revealed, Larreategui said that President  Duran-Ballen, who is touring Japan and China, will address his  compatriots on 16 March from Tokyo on the decision made by the  top electoral tribunal.    Vice President Alberto Dahik, the acting chief of state, is  meeting with several ministers and other officials to discuss  the situation.    The plebiscite requested by Duran-Ballen sought to consult  Ecuadorans on the reelection of the president and other public  officials, which is currently banned by the Constitution, and  also on the term of the mandate and the powers that parliament  members should have, among other issues.</p>

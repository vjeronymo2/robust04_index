			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Venezuela's tensions sharpen: The putsch is past, but the problems mount ONE MONTH after a thwarted military uprising aimed at toppling the elected government of President Carlos Andres Perez, Venezuela has slid into political crisis. Although the country apparently returned to normal almost immediately after the one-day putsch on February 4, the military revolt shocked the political and military establishments, sharpening tensions already existing in the country's 34-year-old democratic system. Several unparalleled - and for Venezuela, shocking  - events have occurred over the last two weeks: Important national figures in one of the two main opposition political parties have called on Mr Perez to resign. The president, whose five-year term is scheduled to expire in February 1994, has refused. In an effort to staunch widespread corruption in the judicial system, the attorney general and other prominent figures have asked the entire supreme court to resign so that they can be replaced with individuals not linked to the country's two main political parties. The chief opposition party, the Christian Democrats (Copei), and other groups are demanding a national referendum on the government and a new constitution. Venezuela's armed forces were placed on alert on Monday after an apparently minor incident where a small group of soldiers stole firearms from the country's principal military installation, Fort Tiuna in Caracas. Differences and mistrust between officers in the armed forces and politicians, especially those in the ruling Democratic Action (AD) party, have become acute. General Fernando Ochoa Antich, minister of defence, recently made a surprising public appeal to Venezuelan politicians to show respect for the military. This type of public statement by a Venezuelan military leader is highly unusual. By law, Venezuela's armed forces are banned from political activity. However, many officers have been angered by harsh attacks aimed at the rebels - and indirectly at all the military  - by the government and some politicians. All this has occurred in a tense atmosphere where much of the population rejects the government's three-year-old economic reform programme, where rumours of another military uprising are common and where Venezuela's normally open media are practising self-censorship. That the problems are deep rooted is suggested by the economic background, which is not one of weakness but of the fastest economic growth in the region. In 1992, the oil-dominated economy is expected to grow strongly again for the third successive year. The main problem, however, is inflation, which continues to offset positive results of Mr Perez's economic reforms, such as greater employment. At the same time, the five lieutenant-colonels who led the uprising are becoming national heroes, something the government wished to prevent at any cost. Though it may never be known what the arrested army officers had in mind, they are being described in the press as bold reformers who planned to kick out corrupt politicians, eliminate painful economic reforms and put the country on the right track. In fact, the putsch has emboldened critics of the government's economic policies; rallied new efforts to reform the political system and, especially, to attack Venezuela's legendary corruption; provided a new forum for Mr Perez's political enemies; and aggravated tensions between the armed forces and the civilian leadership. President Perez has meanwhile shifted a number of army officers, changed his cabinet, promised to intensify the government's already generous social welfare spending. Attention has been focused on a special presidential committee of eight prominent individuals who have been asked to define the country's most critical problems and propose solutions. The eight-member panel, which includes figures who have been critical of the president's policies, are expected to recommend - among other things  - rolling back, or at least softening, the government's free-market economic reforms. Mr Perez has repeatedly asserted that he will not repeal those reforms.</p>

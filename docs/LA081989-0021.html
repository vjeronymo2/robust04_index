			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF RAIDER TORAN STIRS EMOTIONAL GAMUT FROM SADNESS TO ANGER  </P> <P> Professional football players apparently require something special to induce  them to play up to their maximum ability (other than their outrageous  salaries), but the Raider players seem to be misguided in this regard,  dedicating their season to a player who got totally inebriated (during training  season) and killed himself in a traffic accident.  </P> <P> Surely they could find someone more inspiring than this.  </P> <P> STAN GORDON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

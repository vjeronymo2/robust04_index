			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Bileca, June 28 (TANJUG) -- If the international  community wants peace, it will have to respect the Serbs' just  victory because they have remained on their territories, Bosnian  Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday. The Bosnian Serbs  now control 70 percent of the territory of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina while according to land  registration documents they owned 64 percent of the republican  territory before the war.    Under the international plan, the Bosnian Serb Republic is  to  get 49 percent of the Bosnian territory and the Moslem-Croat  Federation 51 percent.    If the international community does not want peace, it will  again, like on earlier occasions, offer unacceptable maps and  humiliating conditions to the Serb victorious army, knowing that  the Serbs will reject such a plan, Karadzic said at a ceremony  in a Bileca army barracks marking the day of the Bosnian Serb  army.    "If the maps are in any way acceptable, we will have them  for  the love of our brothers in Serbia and Montenegro, but only  under the condition that the sanctions be lifted, which will  have to be included in the peace document," Karadzic said in the  eastern Herzegovina town Bileca.    In May 1992, the United Nations imposed tough economic and  political sanctions on Yugoslavia because of alleged involvement  in the civil war in the territory of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    If the international "Contact Group" for Bosnia comes with  unacceptable maps, Serbia and Montenegro will not insist that we  accept them, Karadzic said and added that, like in earlier  occasions, they would stand firmly by the Bosnian Serbs.    The general staff commander of the Bosnian Serb army,  Colonel-General Ratko Mladic said the Serbs "want peace with all  their hearts but not any peace and not at any cost."    The Serbs want "honourable and digified peace respecting the  results of our struggles over the centuries and in this latest  war, our victories and our past and present rights."</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Italian deficit reaches Pounds 70bn Italy's public sector deficit in 1991 overshot original budget projections by 16 per cent and reached L152,000bn (Pounds 70bn), according to Treasury figures released yesterday, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The budget target for the deficit was L131,000bn, but this was revised to L141,000bn in the autumn. The overshoot was widely anticipated, but it makes the 1992 budget aim of a L128,000bn deficit in an election year even more unlikely.</p>

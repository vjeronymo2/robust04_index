			<p>940413 FT  13 APR 94 / Better deal for consumers The Japanese government yesterday endorsed a product liability bill, offering consumers improved protection against defective products. The move follows nearly 20 years of debate. Ms Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, hailed the bill as marking 'a big turning point' for consumers and 'the biggest reform effort for upgrading people's livelihood' under the current cabinet. However, the bill has been criticised by lawyers and consumer groups as inadequate. Under the bill companies are only liable for 10 years after the products are sold. Companies are also exempted if they can show that the defect could not have been foreseen even with up-to-date technology at the time of sale. The bill, which is being introduced in parliament, could be implemented by the middle of 1995.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Csucs, deputy chairman of Hungarian </F> Radio, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given  -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Csucs] I cannot be threatened or frightened.  But there is one thing that I find very difficult to bear: My  family also has to live in this atmosphere of threat. [passage  omitted]    The extent of the media war's deterioration surpasses any  imagination. And why? Purely and exclusively so that Hungarian  Radio can speak to Hungarians and for Hungarians without any  exclusion, by using the voice of decency. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] It is often said in various statements that  there is a certain power behind you. Let me ask you, who is  behind you?    [Csucs] I do not know who you mean, or which party. I have  practically no support whatsoever.    [Correspondent] The [word indistinct] of the extreme right  was mentioned.    [Csucs] I do not know any extreme right and especially  dislike this kind of adjectival locution. [passage omitted] I  start out from what the parliament laid down in the budget law.  And there is no sense in making politics out of it, about  whether the government or the coalition parties or some other  parties dominate or not. As long as the management of the  institution is in my hand, I try to fulfill the professional  requirements of my job to the best of my ability. [passage  omitted]    Even people opposing us did not dispute the fact that the  level of overstaffing, which has reached the proportion of  hydrocephaly, had to be tackled. On the other hand, we have to  grab every opportunity to generate our own revenues. [passage  omitted]    The reorganization is completed, the government approved the  amendment of the operational regulations regarding these  institutions, and parallel with the reduction of managerial  jobs, ordinary jobs were also cut. However, the way the public  was informed, precisely because in essence, almost exclusively  in the hand of a particular circle [words indistinct] it was  linked to a singularly political tone.    [Correspondent] So what was the motive in sacking the team  of  "168 Hours" and Akos Mester, their leader?    [Csucs] We can talk about "168 Hours." The supervisory  committee evaluated its work not long ago but the listeners have  also formed their opinion. Considerable deviation from  objective informing can be unequivocally proven in the program.  These excesses do not favor the government particularly, rather  the opposite. And when I say this as a criticism, I also have  to say that I did not expect any program, especially not "168  Hours," to operate as the mouthpiece of the government, but  neither do I expect, and what is more, I will not tolerate it  operating as the mouthpiece of the opposition. This is a  professional matter. [passage omitted]    I also consider it a professional matter that a Hungarian  radio should speak to the Hungarians and for the Hungarians,  that to profess to be Hungarian and to champion Hungarian  interests should not be considered a shame. Hungarians should  be given proper information in all matters, about the  legislation in order that they should battle through the painful  period of transition. Hungarians should not have to sneak close  to the wall with their heads down but, in possession of  appropriate information, they should walk confortably in their  own country with their heads high.    [Correspondent] How long can this situation of being  threatened be tolerated? How is your family bearing up to it?    [Csucs] Yes, I can still tolerate it but my family is  suffering. The idea was most resolutely formulated that if in  Hungary, not only the head of the family but also members of the  family are persecuted for pledging Hungarian values, then one  has to emmigrate.    From the country's point of view, if these affairs continue  and things perhaps deteriorate, it will cause enormous damage.  Just as ruining the country's reputation and discrediting it  causes enormous damage, and certain radio employees are in the  forefront of this. Earlier on I said that this was the betrayal  of the nation but I can also say that it is the betrayal of the  country. For this I will have to answer to the courts, since I  was sued with the aim of financially ruining me. Well, this is  where we are.</p>

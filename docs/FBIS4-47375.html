			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. I. Maksimov and A. N. Panin; UDC 528.92] </F>   [Abstract] After reviewing the past accomplishments of the  Russian mapping industry, the technical and organizational  deficiencies are critically assessed. The latter include a low  quality of polygraphic reproduction of compilations of maps and  atlases, narrow specialization of cartographic enterprises,  antiquated technology of many processes and a great lag in  automation of time-consuming processes. These and other problems  have been seriously aggravated by the political breakup of the  former USSR because prior to 1992 60% of the map  production  needs of the Russian Federation was met in the former union  republics, with some of the most modern facilities being  constructed there. Only 23.7% of the map production  capabilities remained inside Russia and these facilities lacked  the equipment to produce a wide assortment of cartographic  products. The drawing of new boundaries and the renaming of  hundreds of places is meanwhile imposing an enormous demand for  immediate revision of hundreds of maps. Some of the efforts to  upgrade Russian cartographic enterprises are specifically  mentioned. During the last several years even the existing map  production plants have been underloaded due to the  unavailability of map compilations which have been retained at  enterprises outside Russia, not being returned despite  agreements to do so. The new names of cities, the new boundaries  of countries, all are in many cases not finalized, making for  map production problems. The system by which plants pay for  materials and the plants receive payment for their products has  seriously complicated the process and all these factors have  resulted in a severe drop in map production. Production has also  been impeded by the shortage or low quality of paper, ink,  offset plates and countless other materials. Against this  discouraging background, the need for cartographic products is  increasing rather than diminishing. An ambitious program is  outlined, including production of a third edition of the famed  Atlas of the World. If all goes well, the map production  requirements should be fully met by the year 2000.</p>

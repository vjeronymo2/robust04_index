			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michel De Muelenaere article: "Parliament Fears a Europe </F> of Sixteen"]    [Text] To expand or not to expand? The suspense remains,  pending the 4 May decisive vote by the European Parliament (EP)  on the expansion of the Union to Sweden, Finland, Austria, and  Norway. The penultimate EP session before the elections next  June demonstrated the degree to which the deputies are divided,  not so much on the new memberships as on the material conditions  for expansion. With a touch of exasperation in some cases....  "We have had to swallow so much that we are bordering on  indigestion," French Deputy Yves Galland complained yesterday.    Five times over the past two years, the EP has demanded  institutional changes ensuring the smooth running of a 16-member  Union. After refusing these changes, the Twelve concluded the  negotiations, further complicating the decisionmaking  procedures. For many deputies, the setback will be fatal to the  Union.  <H5>  Opportunity or Threat? </H5>   On Tuesday, the four candidate countries came to Strasbourg  to defend their cause, appropriately expounding on the subjects  of democracy, the parliamentary system, and the European  commitment. Although Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem  Brundtland did not appear in the position of a supplicant, her  colleagues were clearer. "Let us seize this historic  opportunity," Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Salolainen urged.  "A rejection of the agreements would be likely to cast doubt on  the whole process of European building."    "What do you stand to gain from joining a Europe which, from  the start, will demonstrate its complete impotence?" Belgium's  Fernand Herman replied. "The European Union (EU) is heading for  disaster for lack of institutional change," French Christian  Democrat Jean-Louis Bourlanges warned. "And that can only get  worse."    Some deputies want to purely and simply reject the  agreements. Others, like Mr. Bourlanges and Raymonde Dury, are  arguing for the postponement of the vote until the year end. A  period in which to negotiate new institutional progress for the  EU. Should there be a simple six-month delay, or a postponement  of two to three years? Opinions differ. "The effect of a  postponement on public opinion in our countries would be  disastrous," the candidates retorted. "You would be taking a  considerable risk. If you halt the impetus, nobody can predict  the future. The train is starting now," Austrian Vice  Chancellor Erhard Busek emphasized.    The 4 May vote will be very tricky in any case. The  advocates of expansion must obtain 260 votes out of 518. The  latest counts in Strasbourg yesterday gave a majority in favor  of the four treaties. But the majority is a prey to  circumstances, in view of the 90 deputies who deserted  Strasbourg as soon as they were elected five years ago, in view  of those absent because of election campaigns, opponents, and  abstentions. In any case, any shortfall will benefit the "no"  vote.    Between now and then, the EP will be subjected to all kinds  of pressure. The Germans have proved most effective at this  little game. Virtually all German deputies, of all groups, will  vote in favor of membership. "This is a fascination for a  MittelEuropa of which Berlin will be the center," according to a  French Socialist. The Belgians, however, will vote mainly  against the agreements.    For oppositionists, the choice is Cornelian. Should they  approve of the memberships when they threaten the smooth running  or even the EU survival? Or should the expansion be rejected in  order to secure a EU strengthening, at the risk of seeming to  choose isolation? Yesterday, it was a disillusioned Jacques  Delors who called on the deputies to approve the agreements,  remarking that the Maastricht Treaty started a drift by Europe  which must be combated.    The political consequences of 4 May will be great. By  approving texts which run counter to its previous demands,  Parliament will lose a new piece of its credibility. And it is  likely to be regarded as no more than a "rubber stamp" by the  governments.... If it rejects them, it will lay the foundation  for a new crisis.</p>

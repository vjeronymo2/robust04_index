			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wall Street strength prompts rally in London - Market report London's equity market fought back strongly from a dismal opening, shrugging off another bout of intense speculation of an imminent UK base rate rise. It responded immediately to a good opening performance from Wall Street ahead of the first news from the congressional mid-term elections for both houses. The recovery trend in London was boosted by a spate of well received trading reports from some of the UK's leading companies, such as Marks and Spencer, British Airways and Anglian Water. At the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 Index had almost erased an earlier 17.4 fall, ending the session only 2.0 down at 3,063.8. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which again put on a much more resolute performance than its senior index, closed just marginally off, down 0.4 at 3,519.7. Dealers in the second liners said the trading session was 'tedious' and activity remained at minimal levels. Senior traders in London expect a good opening from the London market this morning, following a strong finishing run by international bond markets. UK gilts, down around  1/8 early in the session, gradually improved to close ahead on balance. German bunds were better on the day and the long bond in the US was up around half a point as London closed. At the same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which opened under pressure, rallied strongly to show a gain of more than 22 points. UK equities opened in reasonably good shape with the FT-SE 100 up almost 4 points at the outset, traders reassured by the resolute showing by US bonds and equities in the face of continued nervousness about the US elections. But the market suddenly lurched downwards as the futures market opened and the rumours of a UK interest rate rise swept the market. Although these stories were quickly rejected, confidence remained severely dented until shortly after midday when dealers responded to a trickle of US-sourced buying orders, always a sure sign of a steady opening on Wall Street. The FT-SE 100 clawed back most of its earlier losses and was showing a fall of 5 points as Wall Street opened, gradually improving to end 2 points off. The lack of genuine customer business remained one of the main talking points. Turnover reached 589.8m shares at the close, well up from Monday's 398.8m, but a figure that still prompted widespread dismay among brokers and marketmakers. Monday's total managed to produce just above Pounds 1bn of customer business. Non-Footsie volume accounted for 369.9m, or 63 per cent of yesterday's turnover. A dealer at one of the top UK securities houses was impressed by the market's resilience as it dipped through 3,055 on the FT-SE 100. 'The futures boys had a real go at driving the market below 3,055 but could not keep it there. The fact that we closed well clear of that level augurs well in the short term.' He said a half-point rise in the US Fed Funds rate was already in the market. Lack of movement from the Federal Reserve after next Tuesday's FOMC meeting would be viewed as weakness and would probably trigger a sharp sell-off in international markets. SG Warburg was the FT-SE 100's biggest winner yesterday, the shares responding to the expected sharp decline in interim profits and, late in the session, revived speculation that JP Morgan, the US investment bank, may be taking another hard look at it. There was intense speculation that Cazenove, the stockbroker, had attempted to place 20m Pilkington shares, around 2.5 per cent of the issued capital, at 190p but failed to find buyers for the stock. Marks and Spencer and British Airways attracted strong interest after delivering excellent results and double-digit dividend increases.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (12): New avenues of finance - Banking Bankers seeking emerging markets have reason to show some enthusiasm for Tunisia. The banking sector, which has seen the growth of bond, equity and forex markets and a loosening of the regulatory framework, indicates a dynamic market in embryo. One note of caution, however: a small market with limited investment opportunity will require a long period of gestation. The expansion of Tunisia's financial sector in both quantitative and qualitative terms is, nevertheless, under way. The most notable recent addition to banks' activities has been the establishment of an interbank foreign exchange market in March this year. Until then, the central bank was estimated to be making between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m annually, according to one senior private banker. Although the central bank remains the main trader by setting the reference rate and requiring banks to deal only within 1 per cent of that rate, access to forex trade should add approximately Dollars 30m to the Tunisian banks' income in 1994. Convertibility will, in the long term, also blur the lines between onshore and offshore banks, although the fiscal advantages of banking offshore will remain. The possibility of carrying through foreign trade or investment finance into the Tunisian dinar enables offshore banks to service their foreign customers' daily operations in Tunisia and should encourage the offshores to set up onshore subsidiaries or partnerships with Tunisian banks. Access to foreign currency markets for the first time will allow domestic banks to offer Tunisian customers continued financial services for transactions abroad. Relaxation of credit authorisation and interest rate interference has been another boost to the banks. Private companies can now borrow up to Dollars 3m and banks up to Dollars 10m without prior authorisation from the central bank. The ceiling on rates, which originally stood at 3 per cent above the central bank rate and was then moved to a system of an average 3 per cent differential, has also been eradicated. The introduction of relatively stringent prudential regulation has complemented this liberalisation with new assurances of the banks' security. The World Bank points out that problem portfolios in a number of Tunisia's domestic banks are likely to be exposed, but the adoption of prudential rules is an encouraging indicator to foreign investors of Tunisia's international outlook. It will also comfort one London banker who says that at the moment the banks' 'asset quality is under a bit of pressure'. The banks now abide by the Bank of International Settlement's Basle accord, although they have set their capital ratio, computed as the capital funds over a weighted sum of assets and off-balance sheet items, at a 5 per cent minimum as opposed to the standard 8 per cent. Senior bankers claim this provision is necessary to encourage greater liquidity in the credit market. The scarcity of credit and investment opportunity is the greatest check on bankers' enthusiasm. Bankers look to the bourse, with a market capitalisation today of Dollars 1.6bn and growing, to open up new avenues for finance and investment. Privatisation is their chief hope; government sell-offs will increase the scope of equity investment, encourage private owners to float, and offer private sector banks the chance to provide trade finance services for Tunisian companies which now, as state enterprises, are financed through the central bank. One clear benefit of a slow and steady approach to developing the financial sector has been a good grounding for Tunisia's banking community - when the market emerges, Tunisia's eager dealers will be ready for it. Mr Angus Blair of Barings Securities, the merchant bank, speaks of 'dynamic brokers in the market gearing themselves up . . . we see people of high calibre, a very positive sign.'</p>

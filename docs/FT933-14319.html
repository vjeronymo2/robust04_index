			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Geneva reclaims Gatt talks THE 116 countries involved in the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation yesterday launched two weeks of intensive negotiations in Geneva aimed at laying foundations for a successful agreement by the end of the year. Talks will focus on tariff cuts in manufactures and farm products, and opening markets to trade in services. This is the first time in six months that multilateral negotiation toward the long-delayed agreement has been engaged. For much of the past two years most negotiators have been hapless spectators to bilateral wrangling between the US and the European Community, and more recently between the 'quad' countries, which include Japan and Canada. Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is overseeing the negotiations, called yesterday on participants to table significant market-opening offers. 'We can't allow the process to drift aimlessly. We simply don't have the time,' he said after briefing negotiators on the breakthrough achieved at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo last week. He hailed the tariff-cutting agreement as 'not comprehensive, but a good package which allowed us to say there had been a very positive result'. It was already clear the overall Uruguay Round package should achieve tariff cuts 'well in excess' of its one-third target. Mr Sutherland has called a further meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee - the principal body overseeing the Uruguay Round negotiations - in two weeks. He will then examine progress, and 'point fingers at the poor performers' if necessary. A further TNC meeting will be called late in August to 'set a critical path' for negotiations through autumn. The target is to complete an agreement in principle by December 15, when the US administration's fast-track authority runs out.</p>

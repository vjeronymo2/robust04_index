			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> INCUMBENTS FACE TEST OF VOTER REVOLT;  </P> <P> BALLOTS: ORANGE COUNTY IS TRADITIONALLY A SAFE HAVEN FOR THE STATUS QUO, BUT  SEVERAL OFFICEHOLDERS RISK BEING TOSSED BY THE STORM OF DISSATISFACTION.  </P> <P> Orange County residents are among the happiest, most optimistic in California,  polls show, and when it comes to voting for new policies or candidates they  usually like to keep things just the way they are.  </P> <P> These days, though, the scandals and fiascoes that have rocked Washington and  Sacramento are buffeting the Orange County electorate as they are voters  everywhere else. Orange County residents are mad too, but are they mad enough  to vote for change on Tuesday?  </P> <P> Probably not, some local experts say. They may be unhappy with the performance  of their government, but they don't blame their local representatives.  </P> <P> "There is a strong anti-incumbent feeling here," said Republican consultant  Harvey Englander. "But it's not that my assemblyman or my councilman is bad --  they're all bad."  </P> <P> But Eileen Padberg, also a Republican strategist, said she expects this race to  reveal some signs that Orange County voters are ready to express their  frustration at the polls. There were already indications, she said, in the June  primary when an unknown candidate who never campaigned still managed to score  about 40% of the vote against Supervisor Thomas F. Riley.  </P> <P> "I think we will see the beginning of anti-incumbency feelings," Padberg said.  "I would not want to be a countywide incumbent up this year."  </P> <P> There are a handful of races on Tuesday's ballot that will test voter  sentiment:  </P> <P> * Harriett M. Wieder is the first incumbent Orange County supervisor to be  forced into a runoff election in 10 years. Still, she is the odds-on favorite  against the little-known and under-funded Joy L. Neugebauer, a city  councilwoman in Westminster.  </P> <P> * Mike Capizzi, who was appointed district attorney by the supervisors earlier  this year, is in a close race against his office colleague, James Enright, the  county's chief deputy district attorney. Capizzi is backed by the full force of  Orange County's Republican Establishment, but he was slightly behind Enright in  a recent Times Orange County poll.  </P> <P> * Robert Peterson, Orange County schools superintendent for 24 years, was  outpolled for the first time in his career when Whittier College professor John  F. Dean finished first in the June primary and forced the incumbent into a  runoff. But like the district attorney's race, polls find many voters are still  undecided.  </P> <P> * Curt Pringle, the Republican assemblyman from Garden Grove, is in  California's most hotly contested race for the Legislature as he faces  Democratic challenger Tom Umberg. This race appears to be coming down to the  wire and, with about 50 pieces of mail sent by the two campaigns, much of it  filled with attacks, it has become an ugly brawl.  </P> <P> Orange County voters will also be asked for the third time whether they want a  sales tax increase to help pay for such transportation improvements as road  construction and rail transit. The latest version of Measure M is a half-cent  sales tax almost identical to the one that lost at the polls last November, 53%  to 47%.  </P> <P> In addition to local races, Orange County voters are expected to play a key  role in many statewide contests.  </P> <P> All of the GOP statewide candidates need a strong showing in Republican-rich  Orange County, but gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson's forces have conducted  an especially aggressive campaign in the area. The state and county Republican  parties have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to register voters, and  they have opened several party headquarters throughout the county.  </P> <P> In the search for votes, they have recently hosted President Bush, Vice  President Dan Quayle and former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> The rule of thumb for Republican strategists is that their candidates need to  win in Orange County by a margin of at least 200,000 votes to offset Democratic  majorities in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  </P> <P> A poll last week prepared for The Times found Wilson leading Democrat Dianne  Feinstein 2 to 1 in Orange County, well ahead of the 200,000-vote margin he has  to achieve.  </P> <P> Other Republicans weren't doing as well, however. The poll found Orange  County's own state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) running against  Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, just short of the margin she should have  in Orange County. Compared to earlier polls, though, she had substantially  increased her lead over the incumbent among Orange County voters.  </P> <P> Orange County is home to one other candidate on the statewide campaign trail --  Wes Bannister, the Republican nominee for state insurance commissioner.  Bannister is a city councilman from Huntington Beach who is facing state Sen.  John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove).  </P> <P> On some of the major statewide propositions, Orange County also appeared to be  voting with the rest of the state, according to polls. Proposition 128, called  "Big Green" by supporters and the "Hayden Initiative" by critics, was slightly  ahead but still a close contest.  </P> <P> And the two propositions that would limit terms of state lawmakers were both  supported by about two-thirds of the Orange County electorate, a reflection of  voters' unhappiness with Sacramento.  </P> <P> Seven in 10 voters even favored a two-term limit for county supervisors,  although such a proposal is not on the ballot. The sentiment, however, led  pollster Mark Baldassare to conclude that voters are "not terribly thrilled  with the job that anyone's doing."  </P> <P> Some political observers believe the frustration and negative campaign  advertising will deter voters, leading to predictions of an abnormally low  turnout, possibly around 50% of those registered. County Registrar of Voters  Donald Tanney has predicted a 55% to 60% turnout, just below what it has been  in Orange County in the last two gubernatorial races.  </P> <P> Tanney said there are some key races and issues on the ballot to draw voters  out, but he added: "There are no crystal balls. (Voters) are concerned about  the length of the ballot and the complexity of the issues and that could have a  negative effect on turnout too."  </P> <P> The five Republican congressmen who represent Orange County will appear on  Tuesday's ballot, but none are thought to be in jeopardy.  </P> <P> One Orange County state senator, Ed Royce (R-Anaheim), will also be seeking  reelection against Democrat Evelyn Colon Becktell.  </P> <P> And all eight of Orange County's assembly seats will be on the ballot. One race  of consequence is in the 58th Assembly District, where a new legislator will be  chosen to fill a vacancy left by the resignation of Assemblyman Dennis Brown  (R-Long Beach).  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays, a Republican, won a heated primary in June and  is facing Democrat Luanne W. Pryor of Long Beach. The heavily Republican  district stretches along the county's coast from Huntington Beach into Long  Beach.  </P> <P> In the other Assembly races, the only incumbent who appears in serious jeopardy  is Pringle, whose district includes Stanton and parts of Santa Ana,  Westminster, Garden Grove and Anaheim. In fact, both state parties consider the  race for Pringle's 72nd Assembly District seat to be the most hotly contested  legislative contest in California.  </P> <P> As a result, the race has seen a massive, all-out campaign from both parties,  particularly Republicans. Any registered voter in this district has heard  plenty about this race -- some may say too much.  </P> <P> The campaigns have sent out at least 50 pieces of mail, sometimes giving voters  up to four letters in one day. In addition, independent expenditure committees  campaigning for their candidate have added dozens of more letters, posters and  phone calls.  </P> <P> Pringle, 31, has relied heavily on an appeal that portrays him as a vital  member of the Republican Party who is essential to achieving the GOP's goals.  That message has been delivered by such major Republican personalities as  Quayle, who made two visits for Pringle, Gov. George Deukmejian and Reagan, who  was in Garden Grove on Friday.  </P> <P> Umberg, on the other hand, has attempted to disconnect himself from the  Democratic Party, saying that he would not hesitate to challenge the Sacramento  leadership to get tougher crime laws. Umberg, a 35-year-old former federal  prosecutor, has rarely made any public appearances with party officials or  lawmakers.  </P> <P> The two have also demonstrated some key differences. They are split on  abortion, Pringle opposes abortion rights and Umberg supports them. Pringle has  also endorsed Proposition 140, to limit terms of state lawmakers, while Umberg  opposes it. And Umberg favors the Big Green environmental proposition, while  Pringle opposes it.  </P> <P> Another race with high stakes is Wieder's bid for a fourth term as the county  supervisor from Huntington Beach against Westminster Councilwoman Neugebauer.  </P> <P> Incumbent supervisors in Orange County are usually considered almost unbeatable  because of their access to huge campaign war chests and partly because of the  low profile of their office, especially in urban parts of the county.  </P> <P> Wieder's race will be watched closely for indications that the supervisors are  no longer so insulated. But despite being forced into a runoff, she still  appears to be a favorite for reelection.  </P> <P> Wieder is endorsed by every mayor and most city council members of the cities  within her district: Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Cypress,  Stanton, Garden Grove and Westminster. And she has an enormous advantage in  money, spending more than $300,000 compared to Neugebauer's $25,000.  </P> <P> Neugebauer, who has served on the Westminster City Council for 18 years, is  counting on anti-incumbent votes and leftover bad feelings from Wieder's 1988  bid for Congress when she admitted to lying about receiving a college degree.  </P> <P> Neugebauer has mounted a grass-roots, volunteer-based campaign, much like the  low-budget productions that have won her election to the City Council.  </P> <P> "Anything can happen, and there is an air of anti-incumbency," said political  consultant Englander. "But I think Harriett will pull it off."  </P> <P> The race for district attorney pits two longtime interoffice rivals.  </P> <P> Enright, the office's chief deputy, is trying to unseat Capizzi, the former  chief assistant who was appointed district attorney by the Board of Supervisors  earlier this year when Cecil Hicks, the former officeholder, became a judge.  </P> <P> Capizzi has emphasized his accomplishments and long list of endorsements.  Enright, meanwhile, has tried to paint a sharp contrast between himself as a  courtroom prosecutor and Capizzi as just an administrator.  </P> <P> Enright, 63, sees Capizzi as a young upstart who has done more over the years  to polish his image with politicians than effectively prosecute crimes.  Capizzi, 50, considers Enright a wasted talent, a man who lacks the  administrative abilities to effectively lead the district attorney's office  during the coming decade.  </P> <P> Those sorts of office squabbles have surfaced repeatedly during the campaign,  generating the most intrigue in a race that has otherwise failed to capture the  attention of the public. A recent poll for The Times Orange County Edition  showed that nearly half of the voters in the county were still undecided in  this race. Among the others, the race was nearly even, with Enright leading  Capizzi 29% to 23%.  </P> <P> Capizzi has an advantage in being the incumbent, and he has much more money,  $263,000 compared to Enright's $80,000.  </P> <P> Finally, in one more race where an incumbent is running hard, County School  Supt. Peterson is facing his first serious challenge since he was elected in  1966.  </P> <P> Peterson's opponent is Whittier College professor Dean, 63, who combined with  another candidate in the June primary to capture 60% of the vote. That result,  Dean has said, is a mandate from the electorate for "new leadership" in the  nonpartisan, $98,000-a-year post.  </P> <P> But as Tuesday's election approaches, Dean has not managed to parlay that  mandate into a clear shot at victory. Results of the Times Orange County Poll  last week showed that 50% of the voters have yet to decide whether to return  Peterson to office for an unprecedented seventh term or make Dean the first new  face to occupy the county superintendent's office since 1966.  </P> <P> With campaign funds dwindling in both camps -- the two candidates had only  about $7,000 in their respective war chests at last count -- Peterson and Dean  will have to rely on volunteer precinct walking and word-of-mouth to garner  support.  </P> <P> Dean has the advantage of being endorsed by the 15,000-member California  Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> Among the issues, Dean says he will seek to rein in the county Department of  Education's "skyrocketing" $74.5-million budget and will attempt to reallocate  funds. Dean has also been sharply critical of what he calls Peterson's "games  and contests" mentality.  </P> <P> Peterson has argued that Dean's campaign promises are naive. Budget allocation,  Peterson has said, are strictly controlled by state law and cannot be easily  changed by the superintendent.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Bob Schwertz, Tony Marcano and Eric Bailey contributed to  this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Tuesday's Election Ballot  </P> <P> Voters will face a lengthy ballot featuring numerous issues and candidates at  the state, county, municipal and special district levels when they go to the  polls in Tuesday's General Election.  </P> <P> In the statewide contests, voters will decide races for governor, lieutenant  governor, secretary of state, controller, treasurer, attorney general and  insurance commissioner. In addition, there are 28 ballot initiatives, including  the sweeping and controversial Proposition 128, also known as "Big Green," and  Propositions 131 and 140, which seek to set term limits on state legislators.  </P> <P> Locally, Orange County voters will decide on Measure M, a proposed half-cent  sales-tax increase to fund transportation projects.  </P> <P> They will also decide whether to return to office a county supervisor, the  district attorney and the county superintendent of schools.  </P> <P> Also on local ballots are 24 city council elections, 14 school board elections,  16 special district elections and 14 legislative and congressional elections.  </P> <P> Polls will open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> For voter information, call the registrar of voters office at (714) 567-7600.  </P></p>

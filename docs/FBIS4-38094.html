			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Minister, Hope You Are Not </F> Feeling Weary!"--punctuation as published]    [Text] Citing our embassy's diplomats in Bonn after Foreign  Minister Velayati's meeting with German officials, IRNA reports  that German national Helmut Szimkus, who spied for Iraq during  the imposed war and was arrested and sentenced to death, will be  released soon.    It is regrettable to hear this news, which has not been  refuted. It is also surprising.    While German officials are announcing their success in the  imminent release of their citizen, there is no news or  information citing an Iranian official on the release of  innocent Iranian citizen Kazem Darabi, who has been through 60  contrived sessions of the German court and is in an extremely  dire physical and psychological condition.    Looking at the foreign minister's successful diplomacy in  Germany in parallel with the outcome of the deputy foreign  minister's visit to Paris, we can glean everything apart from  the fate of the innocent, the ordinary Iranian Foreign Ministry  employee who has been in France's dreadful prisons. The Iranian  official heard everything and said everything but did not  express concern over the fate of his oppressed employee.    Zeyn ol-'Abedin Sarhaddi, an employee of the Iranian Embassy  in Switzerland, was arrested in 1991. It is now June 1994! We  still have no information on the charges brought against him and  have not seen the documents the French authorities claim to  have. It is precisely because of the absence of such documents  and, more importantly, because of the absence of any motivation  by the relative Iranian authorities that the French authorities  are keeping Sarhaddi in prison under the worst psychological and  physical conditions. We hope Iran will throw a morsel of bread  their way so that they will show some clemency toward Sarhaddi.    What have the families and friends of Darabi and Sarhaddi  done to deserve seeing the release of everyone except their dear  ones, who continue to be held captive without any hope of  release? Are these two people suffering for want of friends and  action?    Minister, if you see the Arabs completely ignoring the  vindication of the rights of Iranian citizens [taken hostage in  Lebanon], you should at least do your duty toward your own  ministry's employees.    In a recent interview with an afternoon newspaper after  returning from Cairo, the foreign minister discussed the duties  of the Foreign Ministry, saying:    "... the people definitely do not want the Foreign Ministry  to just sit around and issue statements." Elsewhere the  minister asked: "Do we want to betray these people? Do the  people want the foreign minister and his associates to sit  around and only make statements about every incident that takes  place in the world without going to the scene and doing  something there? The people are not satisfied with such a  Foreign Ministry. The people want the Foreign Ministry to take  risks!! and go and work within the framework that has been laid  down by the system. They want the Foreign Ministry and its  employees not to be idle ... and, even if our interests are in  the mouth of the dragon, for us to put our hand in and pull out  our interests."    You can keep the risk and the dragon! Much has been said  about the people's rights. We expect nothing from Mitterrand,  who is now very busy with human rights issues in Bosnia and in  Rwanda. But be assured that your forgotten employees are not at  rest. At least issue a statement about them. This is the least  the people expect!    Was it not recently that two Iranian citizens were arrested  in Paris--again on false accusations--and Paris was preparing  the price of a transaction when public opinion and the press  were sensitized and criticized this well-known method of  policing by France, thus forcing them to respect our country's  public opinion and to release these two innocent people? Was it  not recently that the Germans demanded that Iran use its  influence with the Hammadi family so that the two hostages they  were keeping would be released? And did Iran not do so? Was a  promise not given to Iran and the Hammadi family that he would  be released immediately? Why did this not happen? Did the  esteemed president not complain about the Western press during  his recent news conference and say that for the release of the  American hostages in Lebanon, the Iranian hostages being kept by  the Zionist regime in Lebanon have been cast into oblivion? How  many times must we experience the saying "Once bitten twice shy?"    If, as claimed, public opinion on both sides is necessary to  consolidate bilateral relations, the just rights of the citizens  of the two sides concerned should also be considered. There  should be mutual understanding between the people on both sides,  who should definitely be regarded as equal! Why is this not  happening?    Why is it that everyone else always supports their citizens  rights--even if these rights are illegitimate and unfair--while  we do not? Some even believe that our citizens' rights disturb  the success of our domestic and foreign diplomacy and yet we  must listen to their babblings about human rights all the time.    Here is the ball and the field. Here is the risk and the  dragon. But concluding, and for the foreign minister's  information as well as to remind him, we would like to recall  the everlasting words of the imam, may his soul be sanctified:  "Defending Islam and Hizballah is an indisputable principle of  the Islamic Republic of Iran."</p>

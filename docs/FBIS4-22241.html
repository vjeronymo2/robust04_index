			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Moshes, Institute of Europe of the </F> Russian Academy of Sciences: "Does Russia Need the  Disintegration of Ukraine? It Is Unnecessary, Useless, and  Dangerous"]    [Text]  <H5>  Carte Blanche </H5>   The parliamentary elections in Ukraine stimulated an  international discussion on the fate of this state and on the  future of Russian-Ukrainian relations. The general initial  premises for analysis are sufficiently clear. In Ukraine, on the  one hand, the economy is falling apart to the accompaniment of  inflation that sometimes reaches 100 percent a month; social  tension is increasing, which is only slightly eased by such  phenomena as shuttle trade with Russia and the emergence of a  stratum of Ukrainian migrant workers in Russia; and Crimea is  threatening to become a Ukrainian Ulster.    On the other hand, there is a noticeable desire of the Kiev  politicians to maintain the status quo: to reject economic  reforms, to suppress the trend toward state federalism as much  as possible, and to preserve the old majority electoral system,  under which the western oblasts were without many of their own  potential representatives in the new parliament.    But in Russia, despite the fact that public opinion got over  the shock that resulted from the separation of Ukraine in 1991,  the positions of many political forces changed only slightly.  Those who in 1992 resentfully said to Ukrainians, "You will be  sorry," are maliciously grinning, and they are saying, "The eyes  saw what they were buying...." Others who have still not  resigned themselves to the breakup of the USSR await with hope  the appeals of the new "Pereyaslavites" concerning the support  of Moscow, thinking that all Russia has to do is to open its  arms and in no time Ukraine can be integrated into Russia anew.  Neither one side nor the other goes further in its analysis,  which would show that nothing is that simple.    Theoretically, four variants in the political development of  Ukraine are possible at the present time.    The first variant--the most optimistic, and therefore the  least likely--is that market reforms, nevertheless, will  gradually take place in Ukraine, that Ukraine will rid itself of  the aspiration to maintain a large army in Europe, and that it  will very cautiously conduct a policy directed at the  decentralization of the country. However, even if all of this  becomes a reality, the process of "recovery" will be too long,  considering the unenviable starting positions and the absence of  a national consensus regarding the need for market reforms; and  without the necessary care, including on the part of the invited  doctors, the possibility of a lethal outcome is present.    The second variant--this is a continuation of "limping on  both legs." No kind of fall can continue endlessly, but  development in this direction is entirely probable in the  medium-term outlook.    The third variant assumes a controlled dissolution of  Ukraine  in the east (plus the south) and the west, with still  unpredictable borders. It should be noted immediately that  Western Ukraine can fully provide a viable statehood (high  national ideological motivation with respect to the need for the  existence of an independent Ukrainian state, the presence of  energy sources, and massive assistance on the part of the  diaspora), but externally and internally a statehood that,  nonetheless, is unstable (the presence of a considerable  Hungarian minority, Transcarpathian Ruthenians, and Russians;  religious tensions of the Serb-Croat type between  Catholic-Uniate Galicia and the Orthodox Volyn; territorial  claims on the part of certain forces of Romania to Bukovina, and  problems with Poland.) The viability of this state is the higher  the more exactly its borders coincide with the borders of the  potential nucleus--Lvov, Ternopol, and Khmelnitskiy Oblasts.    The east Ukrainian state will strive for integration not  with  Russia, but into Russia, inasmuch as the power capacity of  eastern Ukraine production does not allow it to hope for an  independent restoration of the economy, and help cannot be  expected from anywhere. Friction with Lvov serves as an  additional factor.    The fourth variant is the uncontrollable dissolution of  Ukraine with a possible civil war of all against all on a  territory crammed with AES's [nuclear power stations], GES's  [hydroelectric power stations], and nuclear and conventional  weapons, which will mean millions of refugees and epidemics  spreading from one place to another, and the possibility of an  ecological disaster on a continental scale.    Which of the variants is most advantageous for Russia? The  first is not viewed as a real choice--under conditions of the  dissolution of Ukraine, which is starting before our eyes, the  probability of its implementation is infinitesimally small. The  importance of not permitting the fourth variant is too obvious.  Apparently, the best solution will be the second, because, while  it is not a gain, it is not a loss. The Kiev government is  controlling the situation in the country by simultaneously  assuming the social pressure and not permitting the development  of an open conflict. And, indeed, it is much easier for Moscow  to do business with politicians of the Leonid Kravchuk type than  with leaders of the Ukrainian Republican Party and the  Donetsk-Dnepropetrovsk lobbyists.    A unified Ukraine, which has moved into a cycle of  preserving  territorial unity, will not become a source of challenge to  Russian security. This rather weak state will be interested in  the invisible political presence of such a guarantor of  stability, like Russia, that will promote the establishment of  good neighbor relations. This factor, in its turn, will make it  possible objectively to examine the territory of Ukraine as a  kind of "strategic forward defensive position" in the  development of plans for the defense of Russia.    In the event of the division of Ukraine into two states,  Russia will have to save the economy of eastern Ukraine with  trillions of infusions, which will destroy all of the results of  reform in Russia itself, but in Ukraine, in the best case, it  will preserve the situation, but it will not lead to real  integration, inasmuch as the economic systems of the two  countries are already fundamentally incompatible on a macro  scale.    Recognizing that such a luxury is beyond Russia's  capabilities, it will be impossible, nonetheless, to avoid the  problem. A massive migration will begin--and not of old women  from Kievskiy Railroad Station, but of strikebreakers who will  aggravate the unemployment problem; the influx of narcotics will  intensify. Economically, the justified refusal of Russia to  accept eastern Ukraine into its system, given a continuation of  present trends in the condition of Russian society, will  increase the influence of nationalist forces in Russia itself.    Thus, the disintegration of Ukraine does not bring any  benefits at all to Russia. Therefore, it is necessary to strive  as much as possible to promote the stabilization of the  situation in the present Ukrainian state. Russia, naturally,  also does not have any surplus money now; however, it is  possible to follow an already established precedent on the  transfer of part of Ukrainian property to Russia in exchange for  energy sources, or a possible redemption by Russia as such. To  facilitate the conduct of negotiations, it is necessary for  Moscow to display good political will, in order that it be  understood in Kiev that Russia is not conducting "subversive  activity," and that it does not want to wreck a unified Ukraine.    It is important to start a dialogue in this context with the  opposition forces of Ukraine, if at least in order not to repeat  the error of the USSR with respect to the countries of Eastern  Europe, when a change of government began to denote a complete  break. It is necessary to organize cooperation with regional  leaders of Ukraine, whose influence in 1993 was strengthened  significantly, together with a desire to develop cooperation.    It also must not be forgotten, however, that there is the  possibility of a worse outcome. For a feasible neutralization of  the challenge (disintegration), what seems especially important  is the completion of the task of transforming Ukraine into a  nuclear-free state, rendering assistance to Ukraine in the  destruction of stockpiles of conventional weapons jointly with  the world community, and preventing the Ukrainian Army from  getting out of Kiev's control and its switching over to the  influence of potential "uncles."    The specific measures can be argued. But in the development  of a general line of Russian policy with respect to Ukraine, the  keystone should be an understanding that the existence of a  stable Russia is hardly possible without a unified and stable  Ukraine, albeit not a fraternal one.</p>

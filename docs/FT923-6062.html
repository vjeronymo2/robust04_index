			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Owen likely to head EC peace drive LORD OWEN, the former British foreign secretary, looked certain yesterday to succeed Lord Carrington as the European Community's chief peace negotiator for Yugoslavia, after France tacitly waived earlier reservations, writes Ivo Dawnay. Barring last-minute hitches his endorsement could be formally announced today, although it is believed France is insisting he revoke publicly his controversial comments last month when he argued for direct military action against Serbs. Once appointed, Lord Owen - until last April Dr David Owen, one-time leader of the UK's now-defunct Social Democratic party - would work alongside Mr Cyrus Vance, UN negotiator, as co-chairman of the peace machinery being set up at UN headquarters in Geneva. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers on Tuesday night a French representative voiced reservations over the substitution of Lord Owen for Lord Carrington, citing the former's hardline stance on Serbian aggression in Bosnia. However, there was little support for the alternative candidate, Mr Thierry de Beauce, Lord Carrington's deputy. Mr de Beauce is expected to continue in the deputy's job. Lord Owen's succession to the high-profile post will represent a remarkable coup for a politician widely regarded in the UK as charismatic and intelligent, but also as arrogant and abrasive. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs and a key player in negotiations, has strongly objected to Lord Owen's proposed appoint-ment. It has also been criticised by Britain's Labour party, for whom he served as foreign secretary under the Callaghan administration in the 1970s, and the smaller Liberal Democrat opposition party with whom he had numerous disputes when leader of the Social Democrats, their political allies.</p>

Upon arrival at Mehrabad airport, Qichen told reporters that  the objective of his trip was to expand bilateral relations and  to exchange views on international issues.    Referring to the Islamic Republic of Iran as an important  bridge between the European And asian continents, he noted that  the two countries have common viewpoints on fmany international  and regional issues.    Pointing to significant roles of Iran and China in the  region, the Chinese official termed Tehran-Beijing relations as  friendly and traditional.    He then strongly condemned the recent massacre of  Palestinian  worshippers by the Zionist regime at al-Khalil mosque last  Friday, adding that the killings have had a negative impression  on the so- called peace process in the region.

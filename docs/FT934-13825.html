			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Tighter fiscal policy urged MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, was advised yesterday to tighten fiscal policy by about Pounds 6bn to reduce the government's medium-term borrowing needs, but add only Pounds 1bn to taxes in the forthcoming November Budget. In their latest 'Green Budget', the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs, the US-owned securities house, warned that substantial fiscal tightening on top of the measures announced in the March Budget would risk damaging the UK recovery. The report said there was a strong case for Mr Clarke combining any tightening of fiscal policy with a further loosening of monetary policy to strengthen the economy and encourage a rebalancing of demand away from consumption and into exports and investment. The Green Budget, so named because it is meant to fulfil the role of a government consultative document, said it would be very hard for the government to meet tight public spending plans set for the remainder of this parliament. As a result, action to correct the budget deficit would have to come through tax increases. It said the public sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94 was unlikely to differ significantly from the Pounds 50bn forecast in March. Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist of Goldman Sachs, warned that without fiscal tightening the PSBR would total Pounds 30bn or 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1997-98 on a 'central' assumption of average annual economic growth of 2.8 per cent. Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the IFS, suggested that the chancellor could announce a budget package that would phase in sharply reduced income tax allowances. He advocated a Budget that would: Restrict personal allowances to the lowest 20 per cent income tax rate and cut the basic rate to 24 per cent to raise Pounds 3bn. Freeze tax allowances and thresholds at current levels to raise Pounds 1bn. Raise a further Pounds 1bn from changes to national insurance contributions, profit related pay rules and through the imposition of landfill charges. Impose value added tax on newspapers and increase excise duties on cigarettes to raise Pounds 500m. Save the government Pounds 500m through tightening benefit rules. Options for 1994: the Green Budget, Pounds 7.50 from IFS, 7 Ridgmount Street, London WC1E 7AE.</p>

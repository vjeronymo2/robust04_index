			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 21 Jan--Speaking on Friday at the Sejm,  Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski stated, among other things,  that, in the short- and medium-term prospects, there are no  threats to the territorial integrity of the Polish Republic. No  country, no significant political power, no noteworthy  politician has any claims against us.    The minister pointed out that treaty obligations on the  inviolability of borders, the renouncement of claims, and the  protection of minorities (the exception here is Lithuania, with  whom we will sign a similar undertaking soon) are linking Poland  to all of our neighbors. As of February, an agreement on the  association with the European Union [EU] will come into force.  Structures of the regional cooperation are developing, albeit  slowly: the Visegrad Group, the Council of the Baltic States,  the Central European Initiative [CEI]. The CSCE, where we  distinguish ourselves with activity, has already borne fruit,  with a significant collection of pan-European military and  political obligations. "Poland is not alone; Poland has good  relations with its neighbors; Poland is not threatened with  war," Olechowski stated.    As far as the threats are concerned, in the minister's view,  "There can be attempts to exert political and economic pressure,  to weaken the feeling of security, threats to economic and  civilization development as well as to the international  position of Poland. We can find ourselves in the direct  proximity of a reborn empire, which may make efforts to extend  its sphere of influence also to Central Europe. The situation on  the post-Soviet territory can rapidly be destabilized.  Conditions for the trade exchange and economic cooperation may  become worse. Nationalities' problems and rivalry may increase  in this region. Our ecological security may, as a result of the  course of events, be threatened."    While referring to the Brussels summit of NATO states and  the  meeting of presidents in Prague, the minister said that, as a  result of both of these events, "Poland is more secure today  than it was yesterday."    Olechowski underscored that the statement on opening NATO to  new members from East Europe was the decision to which we  attached the greatest importance. "This fundamental decision on  opening the alliance, closed so far to new members, has been  clearly favorable to Poland. It makes our future membership  possible and increases the sense of purpose for actions in that  direction.    "However, the decision is imperfect in two aspects: It  defines neither a date for accepting new members nor the  criteria they will have to meet; it conditions the acceptance of  a new member not only to the degree of its readiness to join,  but also to the assessment of European security as a whole. This  gives rise to suspicions as to the significance of the possible  opposition by Russia, although the statements clearly point out  that `no (third) country is to have a right to veto NATO's  decisions on the issue.'"    According to Olechowski, the Partnership for Peace  initiative  has established a new form of cooperation with NATO. It also has  a "significant political dimension as it is linked to the  acceptance by participating states of important obligations to  protect democracy in internal relations and to observe  international law in external relations. It gives particular  emphasis to the commitment to restrain from a threat of the use  of force against territorial integrity and political  independence of states and to respect existing borders and solve  disputes by peaceful means.    "The states participating in the initiative will also  confirm  their commitment to observe CSCE principles and adopt  obligations concerning disarmament and arms control.  Furthermore, in the military sphere, the initiative obligates,  among other things, the clarification of military planning and  budget and the ensuring of civilian control over the Armed  Forces. The countries that will not observe the above-mentioned  principles will be subject to negative reactions by NATO."    According to the minister, this important political  dimension  of the initiative, for which Polish diplomacy was striving  vigorously, "will improve the state of security on our  continent, and, for that reason alone, it is favorable to us.  However, the main benefits from the Partnership for Peace  initiative are: First, it will ensure our closer cooperation  with NATO than to date; second, it will bring us closer to  membership in this institution (in accordance with the summit  decisions, active participation in the program will be one of  the criteria for new members); and third, it will improve the  level of our security.    Referring to other decisions taken at the Brussels summit to  which we attach significance, the minister said that Poland  "consistently believes that the U.S. presence in Europe is  necessary for the security of our continent. We recognize  statements like `nothing is more important for our (American)  security than the relations with Europe,' as well as decisions  to maintain the presence of 100,000 U.S. soldiers as  unequivocally beneficial for us," he stated.    Olechowski pointed out that "Poland is interested in seeing  the Western European Union [WEU], which is an institution for  the military cooperation of the members of the EU, becoming more  significant and effective. Achieving the status of an associated  member, we have the right to make efforts to obtain the same  status in all institutions created by the union. Then, with the  progress of integration with the EU, we will be tightening our  cooperation with the WEU until our full membership, which is  linked to NATO membership. The WEU security guarantees are much  more categorical than the NATO guarantees."    Pointing once again to the "clearly positive balance for  Poland" of decisions made by NATO, the minister recalled that  the Council of Ministers expressed on the 10th of this month "a  will and a readiness for active participation in the  implementation of programs linked to the Partnership for Peace  scheme and to obligate the ministers of foreign affairs and  national defense to prepare proposals for appropriate actions,  including legal acts connected with Polish participation in its  implementation. These actions should ensure that full advantage  will be taken from the opportunities created by the scheme (...)  to tighten the links between Poland and NATO and to increase the  level of external security of the Polish state."    According to Olechowski, the Council of Ministers confirmed  "that our strategic objective (...) was and has been Polish  membership in the North Atlantic Alliance." He added that it  seemed important that the Sejm also expressed a similar view.  "If today we can say that, albeit to an insufficient degree,  Poland after all managed to exert influence on the final shape  of the NATO summit, then it all happened to a large extent  thanks to the wide political support the president and our  diplomacy enjoyed in the world. Such a consensus, this  impressive support, are still needed in the difficult efforts to  join NATO and the WEU. A lack of consensus makes these efforts  worthless."    In the final part of his speech, the minister said: "An  active policy of developing friendly relations with all of our  neighbors, patient and consistent promotion of regional  cooperation, a policy toward ethnic minorities that is in  keeping with European standards, active participation in  European initiatives, and economic initiatives such as the  partnership for development scheme that was formulated by the  prime minister are examples of other significant actions.  Although the world around us is changing and proceeds in an  unknown direction, and although we have only limited influence  on the course of events, all of these actions result in the fact  that we do not have enemies around us."</p>

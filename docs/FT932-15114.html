			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Profession opts for primacy of public interest - Andrew Colquhoun explains moves to define a regulatory body's future role in a fast-changing world THE recent publication of the first ever mission statement from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales highlights our primary commitment to the public interest above narrower members' interests. Production of the statement, together with core objectives and policy priorities for the next 3-5 years, was the culmination of an 18-month debate about the institute's future role. This debate has obliged the institute's council and the membership to remind themselves of the reasons why the Empress of India gave Royal Charters to private bodies like the institute: as the best available means for serving the public interest in areas where government expertise was limited, rather than primarily to further the narrow self-interests of their members. In the intervening period, and particularly in the last 20 years, the accountancy profession has grown dramatically in size and complexity. As a consequence, it is totally legitimate for observers to ask whether the institute (and its fellow professional bodies) has the ability and the resources effectively to regulate multinational firms with global revenues in billions of dollars. There is nothing predetermined which says the structures that served a social purpose in the regulation of accountancy in an earlier age are necessarily going to be relevant and effective in the last years of the twentieth century. If members of professional bodies like the institute are to retain their rights and privileges (not least to benefit from the market premium associated with being a chartered accountant), then they must ensure that the social radar of their body is tuned to pick up changes in public expectations and that effective policies follow promptly. That is why in its planning framework document, the institute's council has given primacy to the public interest. The council has explicitly restated a fundamental and enduring tenet: that it will not adopt or support policies that run counter to the public interest. But it also made an equally fundamental judgment: that there is a natural convergence over the longer term between the public interest and the interests of the institute's membership as a whole. The key phrases here are 'over the longer term' and the 'membership as a whole'. In the short term, it is quite possible that the professional bodies should, and will, take decisions which have an adverse short-term impact on the commercial activities of some members. For example, the immediate effect of the tough ethical guidance on specialist valuations from the Chartered Accountants Joint Ethics Committee (Cajec) will be to reduce the fee income of some firms. But Cajec had analysed the issue critically, had consulted widely inside and outside the profession, and formulated its view accordingly. The three member bodies believed that this was a necessary step to take in order to strengthen the independence of the auditor, and thereby enhance the long-term reputation of the profession as a whole. Some institute members, particularly from small firms, have asked a different, but equally legitimate, question: 'If the institute is primarily motivated by long-term, public interest issues, how are the more immediate private interests of the members to be furthered?' Or to put the question more simply: 'Can the regulator also represent and serve the members?' In answer to this question, the council would argue that policies which serve the public also serve the members over the longer term. It would also distinguish between the locus for decisions. In certain areas, the institute and its committees are the ultimate decision-makers. This applies to individual disciplinary and regulatory cases and at a corporate level to the formulation of disciplinary policy, ethical guidance and audit regulation. In taking these decisions, it would be fundamentally wrong for the institute to take anything other than an enlightened approach to the public interest. More to the point, it would be dangerous and unsustainable, because the government or the courts would either force self-interested decisions to be overturned or, ultimately, would strip the institute of its decision-making powers. In other areas, the institute and the other professional bodies are not the final decision-makers, but have the ability to make representations to those who are. Here, for example, the decision-makers are the Department of Trade and Industry, the Accounting Standards Board, the tax authorities, or the Securities and Investments Board. It is an entirely proper role for professional bodies to bring the direct experience of their members to bear in the representations which it makes to those external decision-makers. Indeed, it would be strange, if not undesirable, if the views of the professions, as the greatest repositories of expertise in certain areas, were not expressed effectively. In a pluralist society, those decision-makers will be exposed to a whole range of other views and will weigh them up accordingly. But the fact that the institute has regulatory functions in certain areas does not mean it need pull its punches in representing its views on related issues. Some members of the profession would then pose a further question: 'If my institute is also my regulator, how can I get help from it with an ethical or regulatory problem without the institutes' Joint Monitoring Unit finding out and knocking on my door to inspect what I am doing?' One could argue that these fears are exaggerated, that the unit does not work in that way, and that thousands of members are getting help of this sort from the institute every year. Nevertheless, the concerns are real, and are being addressed. For example, we are setting up a small firm support service around the country to assist individual members who want to raise their professional standards or who face ethical dilemmas. We are also reviewing the application of a new bye-law which placed an obligation on members to report professional misconduct. The principle of this requirement is sound, but needs to be applied with sensitivity if it is not to deter members facing ethical dilemmas from seeking the proper help. Underlying these examples is the judgment that it must be fully consistent with the institute's mission to assist individual members who want to raise their professional standards or who face ethical dilemmas. The institute's planning framework has provided it with a powerful tool. It will assist in deciding how to allocate resources and in communicating with members. More important, it will help to provide an enduring discipline by which the institute can ensure that all its important decisions have given the proper weight to the public interest, and thereby to the long-term reputation of the profession. This will not be enough on its own. The process of greater openness which the council recently adopted for meetings should also help to convince observers that professional regulation is being effectively discharged by the institute. A more sensitive set of early warning radar for changes in public expectations will also need to be spinning, for example for disciplinary policy. Taken together with the reform agenda for audit, financial reporting and associated issues, these changes will help to ensure that the accountancy profession keeps pace with the changing needs, both of the broader community and of chartered accountants themselves, to the benefit of all. Andrew Colquhoun is secretary and chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</p>

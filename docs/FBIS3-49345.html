			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ladislav Pilz, chief producer of the Slovak </F> Television Production Center for News and Current Affairs, by  Eva Zelenayova; place and date not given: "No One Trusts the  Television Screen; Ladislav Pilz: Professionalism Has  Disappeared From Television"]    [Text] Slovak Television has had a new chief producer of  the Production Center for News and Current Affairs since the  beginning of this year. It is Ladislav Pilz, whom we asked for  an interview.    [Zelenayova] In spite of the many objections to television  being raised, the change at the post of the chief of news  programs has come rather unexpectedly. How was your appointment  to this post explained to you?    [Pilz] Very simply. The previous chief, Mrs. Martina  Kyselova, gave notice with effect from 31 December 1993. The  Slovak Television management was looking for an adequate  replacement. The fact that they chose me may have to do with the  fact that I have been working in television for 21 years. First,  for about two years, as a speaker, later as director of  television news, and the past two years as deputy chief producer  in the editorial office for sports. I know television inside  out, and that was probably the main reason.    [Zelenayova] How do you assess news programs, and what would  you like to change?    [Pilz] I assess them very critically. I think, first and  foremost, that responsibility, decency, verification of  information, the basic attributes of work in any genre--that is,  not just when covering news--have disappeared from news  programs. Although I do not like the term ethical  self-regulation, the fact is that many people are lacking it.    [Zelenayova] Do you think that you will be able to put  things  right?    [Pilz] I have inherited a very young team of reporters. This  team is very inexperienced but, on the other hand, also very  adaptable. Slovak Television is short of the generation of  middle-aged reporters. Even if they were tied to the former  regime in any way, they were professionals who passed their  experience on to the younger reporters, something we would need  very badly now. Today's young reporters lack feedback and a  certain control. Lack of concept is the prevailing feature. If  you add to this indecent conduct, irresponsibility, and  indifference, this cannot but find its reflection in television  programs.    [Zelenayova] The most frequently heard objections concern a  lack of balance, particularly regarding the representation of  political parties in broadcasts, but also the Slovak Television  reporters' one-sided view of domestic political developments.  What is your view of this problem?    [Pilz] The shortcomings that I mentioned are, in fact, also  the cause of the lack of balance to which you referred. There  exist indications that some young reporters allow themselves to  be carried away by some vision of a party or a movement, and  that detachment or plurality are alien to them. I would like to  create such an atmosphere that people will trust us. Today the  situation is such that we are not trusted by politicians, fellow  journalists, or viewers.... Not even teachers of Slovak trust us  because 90 percent of the television staff speaks nonliterary  Slovak. What will be the first step? If they want and are  willing to raise their professionalism [as published]. But not  tendentiously, opportunistically, and mendaciously. That is the  only way to achieve that viewers will, perhaps, trust us. And  that is work for several years.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Forces joined off Piccadilly: Christie's plan to rival New York It is rare enough to see art and antique dealers working together for the common good - a collaboration between dealers and an auction-house is unheard of. On Tuesday, the 60 or so dealers, framers, specialist art bookshops and shippers housed in the square mile of St James's, London, join forces with Christie's to promote the area as one of the great art centres of the world and launch 'On View in St James's'. Rather like the old Cork Street party - but no doubt far more dignified - the St James's initiative offers 'open house' between 10am and 10pm, and hospitality after 5pm, to the clients of every participating firm. Discretion is maintained - no one is asked to divulge a client list - and costs are minimal. It is seen as a mutually beneficial exercise. Anyone alarmed by the rarefied atmosphere of dealers' galleries - and who is not - is encouraged to feel they can go in and browse as they do in the saleroom. Christie's, in turn, is keen to generate in St James's something of the bustle and buzz of its New York premises, for at evenings and weekends St James's is deserted. Having Christie's down the road is good for the dealers - and dealers are good for Christie's, too. Given the auction house's substantial property investment in the area, it is in its interests to preserve and enhance London's leading community for pre-20th century art and antiques. Anyone venturing north of Piccadilly will find more frocks than picture frames in Bond Street these days. We may see further 'On Views' in the spring and summer. Tuesday's event launches a high-profile week in St James's. Christie's auctions outstanding works of art from Houghton Hall on Thursday evening, the most spectacular offering of its kind for decades. At 13 Duke Street, Johnny Van Haeften unveils an exceptional winter exhibition of Dutch and Flemish Old Masters. Three of the show's best pictures were acquired at auction from Sotheby's in the summer, and have returned from visits to the restorers after a light clean. Aelbert Cuyp's 'Orpheus Charming the Animals' was the sensation of the season, and its most beguiling picture. Orpheus, as Ovid relates, was such a marvel with his lyre that he could charm trees to move to shade him from the sun and draw wild beasts to his side. Cuyp's ambitious canvas shows Orpheus gallantly shaded by an outcrop of uprooted trees and surrounded by a menagerie of domestic and exotic animals. Part of the charm of the painting is the awkwardness of the handling of the latter, from the jaguars, silhouetted against the bright middle ground, and the spiny pangolin, to the thoughtful dromedary who listens intently. With the picture priced at Pounds 6.5m, a live menagerie would no doubt be far less costly. The Rachel Ruysch is a tour de force of flower painting, and is generally regarded as her masterpiece. Anyone fortunate enough to hang Osias Beert the Elder's still life in their dining room would never need to serve real food again. One can almost taste the salty tang of the plump oysters resting on a pewter plate, and the sweet flesh of the roasted chestnuts. Ornate sweetmeats and sugared almonds are piled into Wanli Kraak porcelain dishes, and boxes of quince jelly await the spoon. To leave us in no doubt of his virtuosity, Beert adds a couple of shells and glass goblets to gleam in the candlelight. The view also coincides with a sumptuous exhibition of Chinese textiles at the newly refurbished premises of Spink, a wide-ranging show of modern paintings and drawings at Finarte in Mason's Yard, and Chris Beetles' annual festive jolly featuring British illustrators and cartoonists. While few of the dealers have mounted special exhibitions or published catalogues, most have re-hung their galleries. Peter Nahum at the Leicester Galleries in Ryder Street, for instance, is showing Pre-Raphaelites and Symbolists plus enjoyable decorative works for under Pounds 1,000. Unable to resist presenting one great picture (six noughts this time), he hangs Burne-Jones's 'Pilgrim at the Gate of Idleness', a picture which, until 1980, rather implausibly belonged to the Maharajah of Jamnegar. The canvas, dated 1884, along with its companion, 'The Heart of the Rose', and the larger 'Love Leading the Pilgrim', now in the Tate, form a poignantly autobiographical trilogy on the theme of the quest for perfect love inspired by Chaucer's Romaunt of the Rose. Here the pilgrim meets Idleness personified as a beautiful maiden and shies away. Any trail, any time, around St James's will reveal a remarkable range and quality of works of art on offer - from antiquities to silver, sculpture, furniture, ceramics and clocks - and some of the best free shows in town.</p>

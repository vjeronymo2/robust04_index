			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expamet just in the black with Pounds 17,000 Expamet International, the building, industrial and security components group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 17,000 for 1993, compared with a 1992 loss of Pounds 20.6m, restated for FRS 3. The company has completed an aggressive restructuring programme, and the 1993 figures included a Pounds 2.1m write-off for redundancy costs, and Pounds 1.5m losses from the sale or closure of businesses. Expamet said the redundancy programme would achieve overall cost savings of Pounds 3m in 1994. Despite the impact of provisions on shareholders' funds, gearing fell from 125 per cent to 89 per cent, with borrowings cut from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 11.2m. The share price reacted favourably to the announcement, rising 8p to 77p. Turnover fell to Pounds 126.9m, compared with Pounds 139m, but there was a marginal increase in sales from continuing businesses in all three of its main sectors. The building and industrial businesses suffered from the performance of subsidiaries in continental Europe, because of the effects of deepening recession last year. Both sectors showed marginal declines in operating profit. The security sector, however, achieved a 47 per cent increase in profit to Pounds 2.5m, helped by increasing export sales and a stronger domestic market. Mr John Roberts, chairman, said the first two months of 1994 had been encouraging. He added that the cost base of the group has been cut so that all the operating businesses can be profitable, 'irrespective of market conditions', he said. The company announced a final dividend of 1.25p, making a total of 2.5p, down from 3.25p. The company said it planned to return to consistently higher levels of dividends. Losses per share were much lower at 0.75p (32.48p).</p>

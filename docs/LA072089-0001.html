			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DOOR-TO-DOOR SHUTTLE SERVICE MAY EASE AIRPORT CONGESTION  </P> <P> The number of door-to-door shuttles serving Lindbergh Field is expected to  double next month when the state Public Utilities Commission approves an  application by a new company to provide airport transport service to most of  San Diego County.  </P> <P> Port District officials, who administer the airport, said they hope the  increased shuttle service will encourage more air travelers to use public  transportation. Only 5% of the estimated 11 million travelers who pass through  Lindbergh Field each year use public transportation, according to airport  statistics.  </P> <P> That percentage is on the "low side for an airport this size in the Western  United States," according to Jerry Reas, transportation specialist for the San  Diego Unified Port District.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shuttle Express Application  </P> <P> The latest company to seek entry into the San Diego market is Shuttle Express  International, which filed an application with the State Public Utilities  Commission in January but still must provide the state with "proof of insurance  and other documents" before final approval is given, according to Dianne  Dienstein, a PUC spokeswoman in San Francisco.  </P> <P> But Reas said approval is all but certain, and airport officials expect the  shuttle service to begin by the middle of August.  </P> <P> Jim Zabrowski, who operates Shuttle Express, said he expects to win a franchise  from Los Angeles-based Super Shuttle to operate the new service. Super Shuttle  now provides door-to-door shuttle service to and from most major airports in  California and airports in Miami, Dallas and Phoenix.  </P> <P> Zabrowski said he expects to use 35 new vans when his company begins operations  next month and plans to provide service to all areas in San Diego County.  Zabrowski declined to comment on the fares his company will charge and on other  aspects of the service until he receives PUC approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 13 Carriers Working Now  </P> <P> Shuttle service to and from the airport is now provided by 13 companies, Reas  said. Three of the companies provide jitney service, which is limited to a  prescribed route, much the same as buses are, and is regulated by the  Metropolitan Transportation Development Board. The 10 other companies provide  door-to-door airport shuttle service within specific zones and are regulated by  the PUC. The shuttle and jitney companies combined operate 40 vehicles to and  from the airport, Reas said.  </P> <P> Airporter Express, which has provided airport shuttle service for the past  seven years, is the oldest company providing door-to-door service in San Diego.  Each company is required to pay an annual $200-per-vehicle fee to the port for  the privilege of loading and unloading passengers at the airport.  </P> <P> Reas said airport officials welcome Zabrowski's entry into the airport  transport business because the new service could alleviate congestion at  Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> "The airport would like to get people out of their cars. We would like people  to use shuttle vans, taxis, San Diego Transit . . . because we are already  crowded with traffic. The more people we can get to use these efficient means  of transportation, the better off we'll be," said Reas.  </P> <P> Coleen Stroup, owner of Aero Express, began an airport shuttle service earlier  this year. Although the company carried about 1,750 passengers in its first  month, Stroup said the figure could have been higher. She said few people use  the service because "they don't understand why the vans are there."  </P> <P> "They understand courtesy vans, like the ones that service the car rental  companies and hotels, but not public vans," Stroup said. "They're unaware of  this service unless they've used it in other areas like Los Angeles or San  Francisco. Our best bet is word-of-mouth advertising. We get a lot of referrals  this way."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shuttle Critics  </P> <P> But the shuttle services have their detractors, largely members of the taxi  industry who complain that shuttles do not really favor the consumer and that  airport rules are biased in favor of the shuttle companies.  </P> <P> "A taxicab is cheaper because several people can ride for the price of one.  Shuttle fares are paid per person," said Alfredo Hueso, whose family owns USA  Cab Ltd.  </P> <P> Shuttle fares are usually set by ZIP code area. The farther a ZIP code is from  the airport, the more expensive the ride.  </P> <P> Aero Express' fares range from $4 per person for a downtown trip to $30 for a  trip to Escondido, Stroup said. Actually, Escondido warrants three rates, with  $30 as the highest, because it has three ZIP codes.  </P> <P> Aero Express charges $2 for each additional person in a party and provides  on-call service. It also services the Amtrak station, Sea World and the San  Diego Zoo, said Stroup. The company utilizes six vans and operates along the  coast and in North County.  </P> <P> Cal Pac Transport, which has offered door-to-door airport service for the past  three years, runs an hourly scheduled service to and from the airport, said  operating owner Jake Keegan. Cal Pac's fares are $15 for the first passenger  and $10 for each additional passenger in the party going to the same location.  </P> <P> Keegan's zone of operation is the lucrative Interstate 15 corridor, from Rancho  Penasquitos to Lawrence Welk Village. However, if two or more passengers want  to ride to or from a less-traveled zone, the company will take them there or  pick them up for a minimum charge of $10 a person.  </P> <P> "We'll take you there or pick you up only if it's on our way to or from the  airport, as long as two or more people are involved," said Keegan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cabbies Complain  </P> <P> Cal Pac also has PUC authority to operate in East County, said Keegan, but  usually leaves that area to other carriers. He said that Cal Pac transports  about 1,600 passengers a month.  </P> <P> Cabdrivers complain that shuttle drivers solicit customers at the airport,  which is illegal. Hueso charged that shuttle drivers frequently go inside the  terminals "with signs that say, 'La Jolla, $20.' "  </P> <P> Under airport rules, taxi and shuttle drivers are supposed to wait for  passengers to approach them at designated islands outside the terminals. Signs  outside the east and west terminals direct passengers to the islands.  </P> <P> "The problem is that the airport doesn't have the manpower to enforce the rules  and regulations. Most of the time there is no enforcement when the shuttle  drivers go inside the airport and solicit. . . . We don't mind the competition  from the shuttles, but let's have the rules applied equally," Hueso said.  </P> <P> Bruce Hollingsworth, director of administrative services for the Port District,  acknowledged that soliciting by shuttle drivers has been a problem. But he said  most of the problems are a result of drivers who work on commission.  </P> <P> "That seems to be our biggest problem . . . but it's a manageable problem. . .  . The taxis' complaint is not unwarranted, but we have also found taxi drivers  soliciting as well," Hollingsworth said.  </P> <P> He added that airport officials hope to manage the problem with the hiring of  seven new traffic officers, who are expected to begin working Aug. 1. Officials  also hope to be able to better manage the shuttles and cabs by assigning them  to a new island being constructed at the airport. Both groups will share  opposite sides of the island and will be separated by landscaping, said  Hollingsworth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restricted to Island  </P> <P> Under the current system, shuttles are restricted to the center island outside  the terminal, while cabs are required to wait at the island farthest away from  the terminal. Hollingsworth said that airport officials decided to initiate a  new system where both groups share the same island because "the taxis  complained that their competitors were getting first shot at passengers."  </P> <P> Another frequent complaint from cabdrivers is that, although individual cabs  can only work out of the airport every three days, shuttle drivers are  authorized to transport passengers to and from the airport every day. But, Reas  said, cab companies still have the advantage because there are 150 cabs working  the airport on any given day, competing with 40 shuttles and jitneys.  </P> <P> Airport rules allow only two shuttle vans from the same company at each  terminal at the same time.  </P></p>

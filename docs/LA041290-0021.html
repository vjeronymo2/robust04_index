			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: DRESS CODE WOULD BAN GANG SYMBOLS  </P> <P> The Oxnard Elementary School District took the first step Wednesday toward  adopting a dress code that would prohibit children in kindergarten through  eighth grade from wearing clothing or accessories that symbolize gang  membership or affiliation.  </P> <P> There have been no recent incidents of gang activity in the schools, said  Richard Duarte, director of pupil services for the district.  </P> <P> But because of Oxnard's proximity to Los Angeles, the district wants the code  in place in case it is needed, he said.  </P> <P> A similar dress code is in effect in Oxnard high schools.  </P> <P> The school board Wednesday gave preliminary approval to the dress code. The  proposal is scheduled for final adoption April 25.  </P> <P> If approved, the dress code would bar the district's 12,000 pupils from wearing  such items as bandannas or sashes bearing gang colors, T-shirts displaying gang  slogans or any other items that are perceived to represent affiliation.  </P> <P> Under the code, articles of clothing advocating drug or alcohol use would also  be banned. These would include T-shirts with slogans referring to substance  use, jewelry in the shape of marijuana leaves or cocaine spoons.  </P> <P> "If any article of clothing is disruptive to the orderly process of a  classroom, then the student will be sent to a site administrator," Duarte said.  Items such as halter tops, bare midriffs, "skirts or attire which expose any  portion of the student's undergarments or body areas normally covered" would be  prohibited. Clothing with slogans such as "Question Authority" may also be  prohibited, depending on the site administrator's decision, Duarte said. MAJA  RADEVICH  </P></p>

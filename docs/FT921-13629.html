			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Western airliner deaths rise to 624 in 1991 THE airline insurance industry described last year as one of the worst ever with hull losses suffered by western-built aircraft totalling Dollars 481m (Pounds 269m) and the number of passenger deaths up sharply on the previous year. Although the value of hull losses was lower than in the previous two years (Dollars 680m in 1990) it was still 50 per cent higher than the annual average of Dollars 323m during the 1980s. The annual statistics compiled by Airclaims, a London-based organisation controlled by insurance companies, showed that 23 western-built jets became total losses last year compared with 22 the year before. Eight of last year's accidents resulted in passenger fatalities totalling 624 people. This was almost twice as many as died in 1990 when there were 329 passenger fatalities, but below the annual average of 707 passenger fatalities during the 1980s. About three-quarters of fatalities last year resulted from two accidents: the Lauda Air Boeing, which crashed last May in Thailand, and a DC-8 crash in Saudi Arabia last July. The number of hull losses has followed a relatively flat trend during the past 20 years, but the cost to insurers has been increasing significantly because of higher value aircraft and higher repair costs.</p>

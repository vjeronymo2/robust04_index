			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lehman Bros co-president quits MR TOMILSON Hill resigned yesterday as co-president of Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment bank, after Mr Richard Fuld was appointed sole president of the firm by Mr Harvey Golub, chairman of American Express, Lehman's parent group The departure of Mr Hill from Lehman was unexpected. He had run the investment banking and trading operation in tandem with Mr Fuld since 1990. Both were veterans of the firm, which was part of the Shearson Lehman integrated securities house until earlier this month when the Shearson brokerage unit was sold to Primerica. Before the sale, Mr Hill had been co-chief operating officer of Shearson Lehman with Mr Fuld. Mr Harvey Golub, in a letter to Lehman staff, said yesterday that he had decided that a single leader of Lehman's management would 'reduce the potential for confusion about responsibility and authority' within the firm. The ascension of Mr Fuld, a former bond trader, to the pole position at Lehman represents another victory for bond traders on Wall Street. In recent years, the huge profits generated by fixed income sales and trading have lifted bond specialists to the tops of their firms, while colleagues from more traditional investment banking businesses have been passed over. At Lehman, the departing Mr Hill was known as a mergers and acquisitions specialist. Earlier this year, Mr John Mack was promoted from head of Morgan Stanley's bond operations to president of the entire firm, leaving Mr Robert Greenhill, the previous president, mergers and acquisitions veteran out in the cold. American Express yesterday announced that it would realise a first-quarter after-tax gain of some Dollars 433m from the successful public offering of a large part of its stake in First Data Corporation, which provides information processing to the credit card industry. The offering of 35.2m shares - 34.6m of them owned by American Express and 600,000 by the American Express Foundation - at a price of Dollars 32 a share was announced at the start of this month.</p>

The total cost required is  about $900 million (approximately &yen;93 billion). Nihon Seishi  will provide technical guidance in the construction of a pulp  mill with an annual production capacity of 450,000 tons pulp for  exportation to Europe and China. On May 8, 1994, Nihon Seishi  signed a basic contract with an Indonesian Zaibatu company,  Barito Pacific, covering the areas of technical aid and  operational guidance. The target date for plant operation is  1997. Unlike the Japanese market currently suffering from excess  supply, the Chinese market has a tremendous growth potential.  Because of its expanding demand for paper, the companies also  are considering the use of the venture company as a supply base  for raw materials to be exported to China. Also under  consideration for the future is paper manufacturing technology  transfer to China and Indonesia.    This is the first time that Japanese companies have  participated in a joint venture for pulp manufacturing in  Indonesia. Shortly, Barito will form a joint venture company,  [Tanjun Enimu Resta], with Nihon Seishi and Marubeni. The total  cost of this undertaking is $900 million, of which the amount of  capital is estimated at around $250 million, with Barito Corp.  providing approximately $200 million and the Japanese companies  approximately $50 million. Of the $50 million, approximately $8  million will be provided by Nihon Seishi, approximately $20  million by Marubeni, and the remainder to be picked up by  government organizations. They plan to secure remaining amount  through financing by Japan Export Bank and financial and  institutions in Northern Europe and England.    The factory will be constructed at the [beribin] District of  the southern part of the Sumatra Island. The companies are  planning to bring the latest state-of-the-art equipment made in  Northern Europe into the factory. The pulp factory with the  annual production of 450,000 tons represents the largest-scale  plant thus far participated by Japanese companies. Construction  is scheduled to begin this year. Nihon Seishi plans to send  approximately 50 engineers to provide technical guidance during  a peak demand period. In the vicinity, Barito Corp. holds a  300,000-hectare plantation of fast-growing acacia. These trees  are cut every 7 years for use.    The amount of pulp produced by Indonesia for 1992 was  approximately 1.2 million tons, slightly over one-tenth that of  Japan's output. In the future, however, its pulp industry is  expected to gain strength, its competitive power equaling to  that of Brazil in the pulp exports field. Moreover, it is  located close to China, a country ranking third in the world in  the amount of paper consumed and currently facing the shortage  of wood pulp. For the present, however, a greater part of  manufactured pulp will be exported to Europe. What Nihon Seishi  is aiming for, however, is to secure a market which can replace  the present Japanese market suffering from oversupply; the  company, therefore, has decided to establish a beachhead, as it  were, in Indonesia so that when time comes it will be ready to  take on a paper manufacturing joint venture in China. As for  Marubeni, which handles approximately 1.2 million tons of pulp a  year, its aim is the expansion of its business.

The participation in pulp manufacturing in Indonesia is the  first large-scale overseas venture undertaken by Nihon Seishi, a  company established by the merger of Jujo Paper Co. and  Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp Co. in April 1993. Shin Oji Paper Co., which  was formed in October of the same year, also is providing  Thailand with [sashi] technology. Under the present condition in  Japan, because of surplus facilities and stagnant demand,  neither company is able to gain full benefit from the merger.  Asia, on the other hand, is an attractive market where companies  can expect rapid growth in consumer demand. They are driven by  necessity to move forward with the building of the Asian market  which includes China while restructuring the Japanese market.    The aim of Indonesia, on the other hand, is to turn its  abundant forest resource into high-value-added export items.  Especially Barito-Pacific Corporation, which has achieved a  rapid growth in the plywood export business, was eager to import  pulp manufacturing technology to their country, thereby  providing a perfect setup for Japanese companies to enter a  joint venture with them. Marubeni is considering the transfer of  its paper-making technology to Barito.    Pulp manufacturing by Japanese paper manufacturers abroad  has  been flourishing since the 1970's. Daishowa Paper Mfg. and  Marubeni jointly entered the Canadian market while Oji Paper Co.  (present Shin Oji Paper Co.) and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp (present  Nihon Seishi) jointly went to New Zealand. However, their  objective at that time was to secure a supply of raw materials  for Japan as its forest resource just about then began to  decline and was unable to meet Japan's needs.    For Nihon Seishi, emphasis will be on exports to Europe.  What  is vastly different about the present strategy from the past  overseas strategy is that, this time, the company appears to be  targeting the Chinese market. Japan's annual production capacity  for Japanese paper and plywood is 33 million tons, whereas the  annual hovers around 28 million-tons. There is even a suggestion  floated--that Japan should export surplus facilities to China.  Although the Japanese pulp market has begun to recover, the  present situation, still calling for companies like Nihon Seishi  and Mitsubishi Corp. to reduce the rate of facility operation,  by means needs exportation of pulp.    The total volume of paper consumed in China and ASEAN  countries, on the other hand, continues to grow by 10%  annually  since 1985, reaching approximately 25 million tons in 1992,  90%  of what Japanese consumes. Surely it is the wish of every paper  company to be able to tie Indonesia's pulp manufacturing  capability with a China's demand for paper, a country with the  population of 1.2 billion people. China, ranking third in the  world in terms of paper consumed, viz., over 19 million tons,  has lumber pulp shortage, and it is almost certain that its  import will rise. From the standpoint of future joint venture in  paper manufacturing in China, Indonesia is a country which  cannot be ignored.    In addition to Rengo embarking on a manufacturing joint  venture in China, Hokuetsu Paper Mills Co. is providing a local  company with technical assistance in paper manufacturing  technology. However, many companies have been more cautious,  refraining from rushing into joint ventures with local firms.  Their excuses were that local firms lacking solid industrial  foundations are not ready for such undertakings. It is possible,  however, that Nihon Seishi's latest joint venture may persuade  others to follow its suit.</p>

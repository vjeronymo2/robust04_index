			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba to members of the </F> National Assembly in Libreville on 2 February--live]    [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker of the National Assembly, members of  the National Assembly, ministers, Your Excellencies, ladies and  gentlemen: First, I would like to express my sincere thanks to  the National Assembly which has given me the opportunity today  to speak at this extraordinary session about a burning current  issue that concerns the future of our country. [passage omitted]    It is, indeed, at the request of government that we have met  here today to report on the devaluation of the CFA franc. In a  democratic regime, when there is an exceptional national or  international event with very important financial, economic,  social, and, of course, economic repercussions, it is normal for  the head of government to come and discuss it directly with the  National Assembly in order to take its viewpoint into account.  [passage omitted]    Mr. Speaker, members of the National Assembly, I will not  hide the fact--it was widely reported in the media--that  officially, Gabon was not in favor of this measure. However, we  were forced to consider the fact that our partners were  faced--like us, and perhaps more than us--with enormous economic  and financial difficulties. It is also in place to say that in  this affair the pressure exerted by the IMF and the World Bank,  with the support of France was so strong that our country was  finally obliged to fall in line with the other partners to avoid  the dislocation of the franc zone. Making a different decision  would have led us into an adventure with incalculable  consequences on the development of our country. I therefore  feel more at ease to say at this juncture that there was really  no other choice for our country. [passage omitted]    It is perhaps useful now to trace the causes of the  devaluation. Why was this decision made? This measure that we  are obliged to accept collectively is the consequence of the  financial and economic imbalances that have been facing all  member countries of the franc zone for about six years now.  Indeed, the zone has been plunged into an unprecedented  recession which has resulted since 1986 in a nominal growth rate  of not higher than 1 percent for all these countries as against  a growth rate of over 3 percent for the other West and Central  African countries which are not members of the franc zone. Such  a situation could not continue without very serious damage to  the economic and social progress of our countries, especially as  we know that the economic takeoff of countries in the franc zone  supposes a growth rate of about 5 to 6 percent per annum.    Still referring to 1986, it is estimated that for these  member countries, the real income per capita fell by an average  of 5 percent per annum. In the same period, investments  declined to a record level of 6.5 percent per annum. All these  indicators clearly show the worsening deterioration in the  competitiveness of our countries which have been facing  increasing recession for 10 years now. We can even say that  some of them are now practically bankrupt.    To prove how I have reached this conclusion, it is enough to  observe that even in some oil producing countries like ours,  civil servants are no longer paid regularly. Fortunately, that  is not the case in our country. At the same time, there is a  massive flight of capital and the collapse of the banking system  in these countries, while the enterprises are faced with  increasingly inextricable treasury problems. In such a context,  the governments are reduced to only preoccupying themselves with  financial imbalances, that is everyday treasury problems, to the  detriment of the social sectors and the medium- and long-term  development objectives. Furthermore, most of these countries  can no longer honor their external bilateral and multilateral  commitments.    If we must admit that the worsening situation of our  economic and social environment was caused by the inappropriate  nature of certain macroeconomic policies that resulted in levels  of consumption and investment that far exceeded available  resources, it is also very valid to note that the unfavorable  international context demonstrated by the continuing fall in the  prices of raw materials has had a decisive impact on the  economies of these countries which is particularly aggravating.  May I remind you that the devaluation of the CFA franc happened  within the context of acute and general deterioration of the  terms of trade and the clear preference of the French franc to  the dollar, the currency in which our exports are invoiced. If  there was any need to show the importance of external factors on  the economy of Gabon, I would simply give some parameters that  influence the development of activities in our country. They  are startling.    From 1986 to 1992, oil prices steadily fell by 61 percent.  Last year, Gabon produced about 14.5 million tonnes of oil.  With this production level, we earned about half what we earned  in 1985-86, when oil production in our country was about 6 to 7  million tonnes. Therefore, 14.5 tonnes of oil today fetches  about half what 6 to 7 million tonnes of oil brought us in  1985-86. From 1986 to 1991, the global deterioration of the  terms of trade for Gabon was about 50 percent. The same goes  for practically all African countries that belong to the franc  zone. The figures I have just given also apply to countries  like Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon for cocoa and coffee production.    In addition to this economically and financially unfavorable  context for our country, the overevaluation rate of our CFA  franc made it one of the weakest in the area. It was lower than  20 percent for our country, while, for other member countries,  it crossed the threshold of 50 percent. It became clear that  the cost incurred by maintaining the status quo, namely the  former exchange rate, was no longer bearable. Many authorized  or less authorized voices made this known in various ways.  [passage omitted]    Mr. Speaker, honorable legislators, it is no secret for  anyone that the Gabonese authorities were against the  devaluation. The president of the Republic and I had said this  clearly and publicly because we knew that contrary to countries  like Cameroon or Cote d'Ivoire, the economic structure of Gabon  presents less room for adaptability. However, the devaluation  is now a fact and we must live with it. With our partners in  particular, we must examine the compensatory measures that were  announced and promised in Dakar regarding the amounts of  canceled debts. We must also examine the measures for increased  mobilization of influx of concessional financing. On this very  point, it is legitimate to recall that, thanks to President  Bongo's strong action, our country has already been able to  obtain some significant measures from France concerning the  reduction of the debt burden. We hope more will be done. It  appears that some of the doubts can only be cleared after  negotiations with the IMF which, as you know, is currently  present in Libreville.    If we examine the short-term trade prospects, it seems  probable that our CFA franc income will increase as a result of  the conversion of our export earnings in foreign exchange. It  will have a temporary impact on export activities and budget  income that are mainly based on the influx of external trade.  However, everyone can well notice that the structure of our  production apparatus remains particularly dependent on imports  that are practically impossible to do away with. It is also  established that regarding our export earnings, Gabon, even if  it so desired, cannot fully benefit from the volume of  production, that is the medium- or long-term increase in  quantity of exports that is usually expected after a devaluation  for the following reasons: Oil, whose production is controlled  by petroleum exporting countries, is, according to the  information currently in our possession, at its maximum  production capacity. Uranium and manganese are sold in deeply  depressed markets that are severely affected by recession in our  buyers' countries.    To a lesser extent, timber needs huge equipment investment  at  the both the forest and industrial transformation levels and  ecological constraints have now been toughened since the Rio  conference. It is therefore for reasons of solidarity that we  were forced to fall in line with a high rate of devaluation, too  high, perhaps, for the internal data of our economy. We expect  this economy to be interpreted by businessmen as being credible  and lasting enough in order not to embark on any speculation.  [passage omitted]    As an immediate step, I have asked that relief measures be  taken, as much as possible, to protect economic sectors where  the prices of imported goods have increased as a result of the  devaluation. New and courageous measures have therefore been  taken to significantly reduce the customs duties applied to  businesses. To alleviate the effects of the new parity, customs  duties on imports will be as follows: 5 percent for essential  commodities; 10 percent instead of 15 percent for capital goods;  20 percent instead of 35 percent for intermediate goods; 30  percent instead of 50 percent for consumer goods. With regard  to this specific measure, it should be pointed out that the  state is sacrificing a lot -- it is forgoing budget revenues  amounting to about 45 billion CFA francs. It is doing this to  relieve the most vulnerable consumers and to enable businesses  to continue buying from outside and therefore to invest under  the best conditions. [passage omitted]    An interministerial committee has been set up to monitor and  complete the relief measures. The ministries concerned have  accordingly started extensive consultations with businessmen to  jointly assess the trend of prices, profit margins, and  salaries. With respect to salaries, I would like to state here  that we are faced with certain constraints from the IMF, and our  negotiations with them are continuing. It will also be  necessary to fix general authorized profit margins for traders.  Such margins must incorporate the new parity into the cost  price of goods. A decree was drafted and signed to this effect  on 31 January. A set of relief measures should be completed  very soon, that is, at the end of the ongoing consultations.    Despite the added constraints resulting from the  depreciation  of our currency, I reiterate, on behalf of the government, that  every effort will be made, as much as is possible, to reduce the  indisputable constraints that the devaluation of the CFA franc  will incur for our country. This situation is even more  delicate to manage considering that the price of oil is now  about $13 per barrel, which roughly takes us back to 1986 rates.  Remember that $1 more or less on the price per barrel of oil  results in a positive or negative variation of 50 billion CFA  francs on our budget revenue. If the price per barrel -- which  is now $13 -- goes up to $14, we earn an additional 50 billion  CFA francs in revenue. And if the price goes down from $13 to  $12, we lose 50 billion CFA francs on our revenue. We can  therefore judge for ourselves the considerable impact the price  of oil per barrel has on our public finances and hence, on our  entire economy. [passage omitted]    The devaluation should indirectly -- if it is properly  monitored -- lead us to remodel our production machinery by  promoting activities that until now could not be undertaken. We  can no longer and must no longer continue to be consumers of  goods produced abroad. In the food sector, for example, a  minimum self-sufficiency is necessary or indispensable, I would  say. We and our neighbors finally need to seriously organize  gradually but resolutely a true common economic zone that goes  beyond our national borders. Instead of us all trying to  manufacture the same goods at unavoidably high prices on limited  markets, we should perhaps think of some kind of division of  labor that is based on the primary natural resources of each  country. It is also no longer possible to continue exporting  mostly raw materials, especially in the timber sector. I hope  timber sector operators are listening to me. Logging permits  and other benefits in this sector must first be given to those  who process or who wish to invest in the processing of timber.  In this regard, the banking system, as well as tax, trading,  and monetary policies, must be combined to promote  industrialization--instead of being limited to the financing of  relatively easy import-export operations. We also have assets  in the services sector, but I would rather not go into details  about this. In short, the state must do all it can to promote  the development of the nation's resources, with the support of  the Gabonese people. [passage omitted]    I am indeed convinced that the only way that we can overcome  the numerous obstacles I have described to you and meet the  economic challenges facing us at the dawn of the third  millennium is hard work, resourcefulness, the education of our  youth, and investments. I am sure that we will all assume our  responsibilities, be courageous and patient, and make those  necessary sacrifices which will give us a fresh impetus on the  path to economic and social progress. It is to meet these  challenges together that the nation trusts that it can count on  the widest support of the patriots that you are. Thank you.  [applause]</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OPEN ENROLLMENT WINS FAVORABLE RATING: 'IT'S NICE TO HAVE A CHOICE'  </P> <P> Orange County residents overwhelmingly favor a controversial proposal to allow  children to attend any public school their parents choose rather than being  restricted to a particular neighborhood school or school district.  </P> <P> The concept, known as "open enrollment," is being considered in Sacramento and  endorsed nationally by President Bush and others who argue that if schools had  to compete for students, they would all be forced to improve. Opponents say it  would never work.  </P> <P> In a poll conducted Aug. 6-8 for the Times Orange County Edition, 62% said they  favored "open enrollment" and 31% opposed it.  </P> <P> "Sometimes parents want to have open enrollment because of dissatisfaction with  a particular school, or because they want their kid to have a fresh start,"  said Chris Forehan, a parent whose children attend schools in the Los Alamitos  Unified School District. "That's neat for a kid to have a fresh start. It's  nice to have a choice."  </P> <P> Forehan is also the principal of the Walnut Elementary School in the Norwalk-La  Mirada Unified School District, which has open enrollment, and there is a  waiting list of students who want to transfer to his school.  </P> <P> "It keeps us on our toes too, as educators, to provide the very best program  possible," he said. Sometimes parents transfer their children because of  problems at one school that can be corrected through a change in environment,  he said. Other times parents are attracted to a school because perhaps it has  gained a reputation for its strengths in areas such as art, literature or  writing, he said.  </P> <P> Open enrollment was favored by a higher margin by residents of central Orange  County compared to South County respondents. While 69% of respondents living in  the central county area favored open enrollment, only 55% of South County  respondents agreed.  </P> <P> Jerome Thornsley, superintendent of Capistrano Unified School District, said  the findings in the poll conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of  Irvine may indicate that more people in the South County are satisfied with  their schools. But even if open enrollment were allowed anywhere in Orange  County, Thornsley said, "probably 90% would still go to the school in their own  neighborhoods."  </P> <P> Open enrollment is being used in several school districts throughout the state  and in most Orange County school districts. Irvine Unified and Santa Ana  Unified are two districts that allow inter-district transfers, when space at  each school permits.  </P> <P> A state law that expires next June allows parents to enroll their children in a  school near their place of work even if it is in another school district.  </P> <P> While parents overwhelmingly favor open enrollment, many Orange County school  administrators said they oppose it.  </P> <P> "I think people always like to have choices," said Cynthia Grennan,  superintendent of the Anaheim Union High School District. "I don't think  parents and legislators are as realistic about the problems that can come up."  </P> <P> She and other educators cite as one potential problem the competition among  schools for the best athletes. Critics also say open enrollment could upset  racial balance at schools and that the choice will really only belong to  wealthy families, because the parents of poor children do not have the means to  send their children across their town or county to a better school.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, they don't know what they're talking about," Garden Grove  Unified Supt. Ed Dundon said of parents who favor open enrollment. "All that's  going to do is to make schools even more segregated. Those who can afford to do  whatever they perceive is the best thing can, and will, do it.  </P> <P> "The idea of attendance boundaries and district boundaries has a meaningful  organizational basis," he said. "If people can cross this district line, I  don't see how you can have any order, or any racial balance or any athletic  eligibility rules.  </P> <P> "We can have one gigantic race to prove that one school is better than another,  but to my mind, it will make any inequity that exists among the schools  tremendously greater."  </P> <P> Two state legislative bills proposing open enrollment have languished in  committees. But state Supt. of Schools Bill Honig vowed to renew the push for  open enrollment.  </P> <P> "I think it will improve education," Honig said. "It's the same as businesses  competing for customers. What better way to improve schools than to give  parents a choice?"  </P> <P> And Honig said there are ways to resolve the educators' concerns over equity  and segregation through what he called "limited choice." His plan would allow  only 1% of the school population to be from outside its attendance boundaries,  and "we wouldn't mess around with racial integration or academic and athletic  stars."  </P> <P> He said in school districts that have open enrollment, only about 5% of the  enrollment is from another attendance area.  </P> <P> "Even if a lot of people aren't going to take advantage of it, then why not  give them choice anyway?" he said. "The secret is, if we give it to them, and  they don't utilize it, they feel good that they have it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> OPEN ENROLLMENT  </P> <P> "Do you favor or oppose legislation that would allow parents to send their  children to any California public school they choose?"  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:1.67IN:1.78IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>

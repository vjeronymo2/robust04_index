			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / AEEU to vote on TUC affiliation THE executive committee of the AEEU engineering and electricians union agreed yesterday to hold a postal ballot of members over affiliating to the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The executive will urge members to vote in favour of the move, which comes 4 1/2 years after the EETPU electricians' union was expelled from the TUC. The EETPU merged with the AEU engineering workers' union last year to form the AEEU.</p>

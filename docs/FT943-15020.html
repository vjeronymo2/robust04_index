			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Technology: All change at Lloyd's - The insurance market is about to embrace electronic processing The high-tech appearance of the glass and steel building in London occupied by the Lloyd's insurance market has rarely been matched by the state of the technology used within it. Until 1990, for instance, Lloyd's was one of the world's largest users of punched cards, a near-obsolete form of data processing. The punched cards, which it used to carry details of insurance risks, have now been dispensed with. But several other aspects of Lloyd's business systems still look old-fashioned. For example, nearly all risks at Lloyd's are placed in the traditional fashion by brokers clutching heavy leather folders of documents and walking from underwriter to underwriter. The need to improve Lloyd's use of technology has been given a high priority as it attempts to pull itself back from the record-breaking losses of recent years. The importance placed on the new systems last month prompted Peter Middleton, chief executive, to ask each of the broking and underwriting firms to appoint a main board director to take responsibility for the changes. Lloyd's plans to cut Pounds 20m of operating costs each year by a move to electronic processing and the streamlining of its business processes were announced in Lloyd's business plan last year. One of the most fundamental changes proposed by Lloyd's is the introduction of electronic placing support, which means that all contracts will have to be put on screen by January 1996. The significance of the electronic contract is that it should create cost savings down the processing chain. These should flow from reduced paper handling, from the elimination of the need to re-key data and the associated cost of validating data and correcting errors. At the same time, full electronic processing will also improve the centrally-held information for syndicates and managing agents. For instance, Lloyd's believes that more timely information on signed premium income will allow it to manage its capacity more effectively. On the face of it, this move towards a paperless market has taken an inordinately long time. When the use of the electronic placing system becomes mandatory in 1996, it will be nearly 10 years after Big Bang swept away the need for face-to-face dealings on the stock exchange. The slow pace of progress is blamed partly on the complexity of the business handled at Lloyd's and partly on the highly fragmented nature of the market, which means there are few big players with sufficient clout to force through changes. The need for consultation and consensus has restricted the pace of change. Nonetheless, Lloyd's and the other players in the London insurance market have made some strides towards electronic processing. In the summer of 1987, underwriters and brokers from all sectors of the London market joined together to develop a market network - called the London Insurance Market Network (Limnet) which embraced electronic data exchange, interactive terminal switching, electronic mail, and various information services from Lloyd's and outside suppliers. Limnet is now the largest commercial insurance network in the world, handling some 25m transactions every year. The most recent development in Lloyd's efforts to press ahead with new systems was the Lloyd's Outwards Reinsurance Scheme (Lors). Since the beginning of December 1993, this has processed all outward reinsurance debit and credit notes electronically, thus scrapping the need for processing 1m pieces of paper a year and cutting the average cost of each transaction from Pounds 1.21 to 60p. But the introduction of Lors did not go entirely smoothly. 'The problem was that the staff needed training which was done in a haphazard way,' says Janine Bailey of Lloyd's Business Applications Support. Instead of building up gradually to the deadline of December 1 1993 when the use of Lors became compulsory, too many firms had a last-minute rush to get familiar with the system. Lloyd's wants to learn from its experience with Lors by gradually increasing the volume of business placed electronically until it becomes compulsory in January 1996. But progress so far has been halting. Since electronic placing was introduced in March 1992, there have been 3,000 risks placed on the system, equivalent to just 0.05 per cent of the total volume. Lloyd's is adamant that the impending arrival of electronic processing should be taken seriously by the senior executives of the broking and underwriting firms, and not just by their IT specialists. The reason is that the impact of the new systems will go far beyond the IT department to affect the working lives of everyone in the business. 'It is not a technological problem. It is a cultural problem about change in business practice,' says Andy Coppell, Lloyd's systems and operations director. It is not yet clear how radical the changes to business practice will be. It still remains to be seen how far the arrival of electronic processing will erode the practice of 'face-to-face' negotiations and the personal relationships on which the market has been built. So far, the consensus is that simple types of insurance such as personal accident policies will be placed electronically. But face-to-face negotiations will still be needed in the insurance of more complex risks, which involve copious amounts of information. 'For anything with the slightest complication, there will still be a need for face to face,' says Martin Hall, a broker. But even if the new technology does not sweep away existing business practices completely, some of the consequences of introducing new technology may be painful. The ironing out of inefficiencies will save costs, at the expense of jobs. It is no wonder that electronic processing is not viewed with enthusiasm by everyone. Coppell acknowledges the problem. 'You are asking people to embrace this technology knowing it will put them out of a job. It is a psychological barrier.' However, he believes that Lloyd's has no choice but to embrace the new technology. 'If you don't modernise and become more cost effective, your volumes will come down. There is a bigger history of job reduction in industry by inefficiency rather than by successful application of technology.'</p>

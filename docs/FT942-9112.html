			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (5): Slow boat to China that got there first - Profile, Tom Gibson of the Gibson Group Tom Gibson likes to keep his Chinese customers and official contacts happy on their frequent visits to his company's headquarters in Glasgow. He puts them up in a company guesthouse with a Chinese cook. Doing business in China is all about building long-term relationships and establishing trust, says Mr Gibson, chairman of Gibson Group. For the small but fast-growing power plant contractor, these relationships are vital - all its business is in China. Mr Gibson worked for Babcock before setting up an engineering contracting business, Gibson Wells, in 1978. Four years later, the company was sold to Foster Wheeler, but not before it had won a contract to build the power station for the Daqing oilfield in Heilongjiang province. In 1990, Mr Gibson bought the company back from Foster Wheeler for a nominal sum. He had been working in the late 1980s for GEC selling power stations in China, and saw a 'massive niche' building smaller power stations there that would not interest the big boys of the industry. Having completed one contract already, albeit some years previously, Mr Gibson had a head start in winning further business in China. Since 1990, his company has picked up three more power contracts, all for coal-fired chp plants: two 30MW stations, Wa Fang Dian and Che Re Gou at Dalian, and a Pounds 35m contract for a plant at Fushun. Much to Mr Gibson's surprise, he also won a contract last year from the Dalian Municipal Engineering Department to supply a traffic light system for the southern Chinese city. Gibson Group has no expertise in traffic lights, but Dalian wanted to work with the company, and Gibson Group is now working with GEC to fulfil the contract. Already, the company has won some Pounds 70m of business from China and turnover is running at Pounds 35m a year. Signing of a contract worth about Pounds 65m for a 120MW coalfired CHP station at Dadong, Guangxi province, is near. All this for a company with fewer than 50 employees and only six permanent staff in China, in two offices in Beijing. Mr Gibson has often considered increasing the Chinese representation, but says the Chinese want to work with a British company and have the opportunity to visit the UK. Mr Gibson, meanwhile, has made around 40 trips to China building the long-term relationships that have brought success. 'They trust us,' he says. Patience, he makes clear, is a virtue when negotiating contracts - 'nobody can make a decision, but everybody has a veto,' says Mr Gibson. The process can take years, and it is always necessary to have some talks continuing while other contracts are being carried out, to maintain momentum. The company has already spent three years - and Pounds 600,000 - bidding for the Dadong contract. But Mr Gibson quotes a saying that often proves to be the case when it seems that negotiations have become bogged down intractably: 'In China, everything is impossible, but anything is possible.' In other words, somehow, a way will be found round a problem. Mr Gibson has also benefited from good contacts at home. Former Prime Minister Edward Heath has helped the company, and Mr Gibson will be accompanying Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, on a visit to China in the autumn. He has also struck up a good relationship with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). While some exporters moan about the help they receive, Mr Gibson says he has received strong support. The four recent Chinese contracts were financed with aid from the UK, while the forthcoming job will be paid for with a 'super-subsidised loan'. Mr Gibson is now positioning the company to participate in much larger power station contracts in China, up to about 350MW. The company is working very closely with Rolls-Royce on one contract for which Gibson Group is contributing its relationships with the prospective Chinese clients. But it needs to work with Rolls-Royce and similar companies to handle contracts of such a size, says Mr Gibson. For the future, a number of smaller Chinese contracts are being discussed, along with three much larger build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes involving Mission Energy of the US and Rolls-Royce. Each scheme would be worth about Pounds 300m, says Mr Gibson, but it will take another two years to get contracts signed. Mr Gibson has been looking very seriously at Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, but has plenty to do in China even if he has all his eggs in one basket. He is not worried by the political problems between the UK and China over the future of Hong Kong, although he says the row is 'bloody annoying'. Echoing a view typical of UK businessmen eyeing the Chinese market, he asks why democracy is suddenly so important now in Hong Kong when it wasn't 10, 50 or 100 years ago.</p>

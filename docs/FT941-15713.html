			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Asarco sells Australian unit stake Asarco, the New York-based integrated copper producer, has sold its remaining 45.3 per cent interest in Asarco Australia, for Dollars 79.5m, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. After taxes, the company expects to realise Dollars 31.9m from the sale. The company sold a 9.9 per cent interest in the Australian venture in the third quarter for an after-tax gain of Dollars 5.4m. Asarco Australia operates the Wiluna and Jundee gold mines in Western Australia, which in 1992 produced 110,000 troy ounces of gold. Asarco intends to use the proceeds of the latest sale to reduce corporate debt. It has recorded losses in recent quarters, pressed by the costs related to US copper mine and processing expansions and by depressed prices for copper and other minerals.</p>

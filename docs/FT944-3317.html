			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Regulator says auditors should have more freedom Auditors should use their judgment in checking financial links between a company and related parties, and not rely on following a set procedure, the audit regulator said yesterday. Draft proposals from the Auditing Practices Board mark a significant shift away from rigid procedures designed to monitor companies, towards an approach based on an auditor's experience and skills. The regulator's recommendation follows strict proposals put forward in March by the Accounting Standards Board to combat fraud. Several corporate failures have been found to stem from undisclosed links with related parties. The standards board has proposed far-reaching requirements for directors to disclose related-party transactions which go beyond those listed in companies legislation. Related parties would include individuals or companies connected with, influenced by, or controlled by the company, its pension funds, its directors, and managers, and their immediate families. Mr David Lindsell, chairman of the practices board's working party, said that checking disclosures on related party links in a large company would lead to a 'huge' increase in audit costs. He added that the thrust of the proposals did not concern the detection of fraud, as most companies entered into only legitimate transactions with related parties. Auditors had to use their judgment in checking the disclosures and identifying inherent internal risks. 'However,' said Mr Lindsell, 'if the auditor assesses the risk of undisclosed transactions as high, the proposal provides guidance as to the procedures that could be followed.' The practices board hopes that its draft proposal will become a standard, with the force of law.</p>

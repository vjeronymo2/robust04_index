			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SALE OF NEW ZEALAND STEEL DOUBTFUL  </P> <P> Prime Minister David Lange said today that he doubts the sale of New Zealand's  biggest steelmaker to a Chinese state enterprise will go ahead.  </P> <P> In one of China's biggest overseas investments, the China National Metals and  Minerals Import and Export Corp., said in April that it would buy troubled New  Zealand Steel.  </P> <P> The price is a closely kept secret but analysts put it at between $170 million  and $230 million.  </P> <P> "If I were . . . punting (betting on) the outcome of that deal, I would say  unhappily it's not going to proceed," Lange told Radio New Zealand.  </P> <P> The Chinese firm beat several other bidders in a double deal to buy 80% of N.Z.  Steel, which was held by collapsed investment company Equiticorp International,  and the rest from Fisher and Paykel Industries, which makes home appliances.  </P></p>

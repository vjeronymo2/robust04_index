			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Kondaurov video report; from the "Utro" program] </F>   [Text] Last night many people in Donetsk were awakened by  a powerful explosion. It occurred near Ilicha Avenue, one of  the city's central thoroughfares. The Donetsk Internal Affairs  Administration later disarmed an installation made of five  antitank grenade launchers assembled on a truck and prepared for  launching. The previous evening in an alley near the Donetsk  wine plant, some boys came across an old abandoned GAZ-51 with a  cover over its bed. The network of wires on it looked  suspicious, so they called the militia. The militia arrived  immediately and established that the grenade launchers were  aimed at a residential building located 300 meters away. The  installation was rigged with imported automatic instruments and  remote-controlled devices permitting it to be operated from a  distance of 150 meters. [video shows broken windows, militia  officers inspecting launch tubes and truck, then shows interview  with V.N. Varaka, chief of the Donetsk Internal Affairs  Administration]    [Begin Varaka recording] Yes, one can now positively say a  terrorist act was being prepared in Donetsk. [end recording]</p>

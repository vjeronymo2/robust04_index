			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dinu C. Giurescu commentary: "Romanian-Russian Military </F> Accord"]    [Text] On 28 March the Russian minister of national  defense, Army General Pavel Grachev, arrived in Romania. During  his visit he signed a military accord between the two countries.  The accord includes several domains of cooperation: technical  cooperation, the training of expert cadres, operational  cooperation, cooperation in the medical and military history  domains, and so on.    Romanian officials noted that the recently signed document  is  similar to the ones concluded by Romania with other states.    At his 30 March news conference Army General Pavel Grachev  made a number of statements that should be noted:    a) "Russia," he said, "recognizes the sovereign right of  every state to choose its own way, but it reserves the right to  influence in a civilized way those evolutions that concern its  own security."    Romanian public opinion can remember very well that in the  name of its own security the Soviet Government imposed communist  regimes in all central-eastern and southeastern European  countries. Those regimes were born in 1944-1945 and ended in  1989.    Also perfectly well known are the armed involvement in  November 1956 in Hungary and in August 1968 in Czechoslovakia,  and currently the 14th Army's presence and action on the  territory of the Republic of Moldova, merely 100 km from its  border with Romania.    The concept of "influencing in a civilized way those  evolutions that concern its own security" can lead any time to  most comprehensive and direct involvements in the affairs of the  neighboring countries.    b) At the same news conference Army General Pavel Grachev  also stated: "Throughout its history Russia has never attacked  anyone, never conquered anyone, but rather merely defended  itself, as it was always the attacked party."    That assertion baffles all people having some knowledge of  history. It makes Romanian citizens and those of the  neighboring countries even more fearful and suspicious, as they  recall their not-so-long-ago history.    However, the importance of the visit of Minister Pavel  Grachev lies in the fact that it highlighted one of Romania's  essential issues: its relations with Russia.    To have good and stable relations with Russia is a sine qua  non condition. However, Romania's renewed dependence -- even if  it is a "civilized" one -- upon that Eastern superpower cannot  be accepted, nor repeated any more. Be it "civilized" or not,  dependence still means submission.    The Romanian delegation conducting the talks with Army  General Pavel Grachev reminded him, and did so rightly, that  Romania opposes all theories intended to divide Europe into  spheres of influence.    However, that is not the end of the story.    In Romania there are groups that politically incline toward  the East. They directly manifested themselves when the  friendship and cooperation treaty with the USSR was elaborated  and initialed in April 1991.    Those groups are also supported [by parties]. The left-wing  and the nationalist-communist parties attract, according to  recent IRSOP [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion] polling and  IMAS [Applied Media Research Institute] polls, about 20-21  percent of the electorate.    The domestic groups pursuing Romania's alignment to the East  are acting within the somewhat confused situation in which the  central-eastern and southeastern European countries find  themselves with respect to their political and military security.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Public access to Bar urged A barristers' think-tank set up to find ways of ensuring the survival of an independent Bar in the face of increased competition from solicitors for advocacy work has recommended that the public should have direct access to barristers, Robert Rice writes. At present only solicitors, a limited number of professional clients, such as accountants, and overseas clients have direct access to the Bar. A consultation document issued by the Bar's policy unit, chaired by Mr James Munby QC, says existing restrictions should be abolished. These prevent lay clients from consulting barristers directly for legal advice unconnected with a court case. Clients should also be able to approach a barrister directly in connection with a court action, but barristers should be under a duty to refer them to a solicitor as soon as practicable. The reason for not recommending that the public should be able to instruct barristers directly in court actions is said to be to allow barristers 'to continue to concentrate on specialist consultancy and advocacy leaving the bulk of the work of preparing a case for trial to the solicitor'.</p>

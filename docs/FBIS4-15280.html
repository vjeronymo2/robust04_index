			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin by Katja </F> Gloger, Matthias Schepp, and Rolf Schmidt-Holtz; place and date  not given: "Yeltsin Is the Master of the Situation"]    [Text] [STERN] Mr. Prime Minister, it is once again being  said that your boss is fatally ill. It is said that Boris  Yeltsin suffers from cirrhosis of the liver. How is he really?    [Chernomyrdin] Anyone who wants to test Yeltsin's state of  health should play tennis with him. This talk about his  illnesses is simply insulting. The president was on vacation,  during which he relaxed and also went hunting.    [STERN] Meanwhile, rumors of a putsch circulated in Moscow.    [Chernomyrdin] This is nonsense. Someone wants to  destabilize the situation. I do not react to such rumors at  all. Yeltsin is the master of the situation. He will complete  his term of office -- until 1996. Then we will have new  elections.    [STERN] During public appearances, however, Yeltsin looks  sick. And he had to accept the amnesty of his opponents  Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov without being able to  do anything against it. They wanted to overthrow him last  October.    [Chernomyrdin] Once again: Yeltsin is well. Concerning the  amnesty, one can be of different opinions. As quickly as it was  done, it got out of control. Here, too, Yeltsin was supposed to  be presented as someone who no longer holds the reins. This is  not true.    [STERN] The Russians elected communists and right-wing  extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy into parliament in December.  Does Russia actually want democracy?    [Chernomyrdin] The Russians do not want to go back to the  past, but a good life does not fall from heaven. One has to  work hard for it. It is the task of my government to establish  the conditions for it. We must find a feasible path in this  labyrinth of reforms. Above all, we need a rule-of-law state  and private property.    [STERN] How dangerous is Zhirinovskiy?    [Chernomyrdin] The people voted for him because their  standard of living is going down. They did not vote for  Zhirinovskiy as a person but against us and our mistakes.    [STERN] Could Zhirinovskiy become president?    [Chernomyrdin] The worse our economy is the greater are  Zhirinovskiy's prospects for success. Regardless of how  Zhirinovskiy is assessed, fascism in Russia does not have a  chance. It is not Zhirinovskiy who is dangerous but the decline  of industrial production. The reforms are making too little  progress.    [STERN] And this is said by the man who is criticized as a  braker of reforms and as an apparachik.    [Chernomyrdin] This is claimed by those who do not know  anything. My task is to make as few mistakes as possible and to  push the reforms ahead quickly.    [STERN] In the West, it is your former Deputy Prime Minister  Yegor Gaydar who is praised as a reformer and not you.    [Chernomyrdin] Gaydar and Boris Fedorov....    [STERN] ...the finance minister who has also resigned...    [Chernomyrdin] ...are not the fathers of the reform. These  guys just like to see themselves in this role. It was and is  Boris Yeltsin who stands for economic reforms. As finance  minister, Fedorov could not decide anything without me and  Yeltsin. Yegor Gaydar was in my cabinet for just three months  last year.    [STERN] As prime minister, you are responsible for the fact  that today, almost one out of three Russians live in poverty.  How do you plan to bring Russia to its feet again?    [Chernomyrdin] I would feel better if there were a simple  answer to that. I pity Russia from the bottom of my heart.  However, there is no standard solution. We cannot simply copy  Germany or the United States or take over something from a  textbook. This is the mistake that many so-called reformers  make. They do not know Russia.    [STERN] But under your leadership, industrial production  declined by 16 percent in 1993.    [Chernomyrdin] Yes, at the moment many companies are idle.  However, things will get even worse: Companies will go  bankrupt. We need that so that our economy can recover. It  takes time to convert the powerful military-industrial complex.  One cannot simply change from tanks to tractors.    [STERN] Russian politicians have already been calling for an  economic state of emergency.    [Chernomyrdin] For me, there is only one way -- market  economy. But we also need industrial policy by the state ---  not a planned economy. As a former head of a corporation, I  know very well what the latter did. Centralism was such that I  felt regularly sick. Going back to that? I do not even dare to  think of that. I cannot decide in Moscow today how a road  should be built in Vladivostok on the Pacific coast. Let the  people think themselves.    [STERN] But the call for a strong hand is getting louder and  louder.    [Chernomyrdin] I, too, am against chaos. By the way, market  economy does not mean chaos. The people in our country have  always been ruled by a strong hand. First Father Tsar, then the  communists. For many people that was easy: There was no need  to think. It is impossible to change people overnight in such a  way that they are suddenly suitable for the market economy.    [STERN] The legacy of the command economy....    [Chernomyrdin] Let us take the example of Germany. It is  not enough that the east German changes from a Trabant car to a  Mercedes. He is still different from a west German. He works  differently. When work is over at six in the evening, some of  them drop what they are doing and go to a bar.    [STERN] Germany is facing Bundestag elections. What would a  change in government from Kohl to a Social Democrat mean for you?    [Chernomyrdin] The German people, whom I value very highly,  will make the right choice. I respect Mr. Kohl very much.  Personally, I would welcome it if he remained chancellor."    [STERN] Does your reform policy meet with sufficient support  in the West?    [Chernomyrdin] We were promised $24 billion....    [STERN] ...at the international economic summit in Munich in  1992....    [Chernomyrdin] ...and if we had received this money, we  would not have suffered such a slump. Then reforms would have  been easier. All these Western promises of the past years were  not fulfilled. The Russian people know that. But we are no  beggars. We are equal partners because our country has enormous  resources.    [STERN] Should Germany help with even more than 80 billion  marks.    [Chernomyrdin] Germany is the key country for us. The  Germans understand us best. But they are not investing enough.  I appeal to German entrepreneurs: Do not be afraid of  investing in Russia. We have gotten through the worst. One can  earn good money in our country....    [STERN] ...and lose it. Anyone who invests here must bribe  the corrupt bureaucracy and pay protection money to the Mafia.    [Chernomyrdin] This is a big problem. We need extremely  tough measures against crime. There must finally be order, just  as in Germany.    [STERN] Do you actually still have hope for Russia?    [Chernomyrdin] Certainly. Nevertheless, I do not understand  at all why so many people want to become prime minister.  Sometimes my life seems to be an absolute nightmare. My  biggest worry is that time is running out. I am confident, I do  not sway.</p>

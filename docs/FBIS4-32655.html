			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Permanent State Assets"] </F>   [Text] Regardless of how hard the government tried to  privatize them, the state farms have failed to attract  investors. New nameplates have been installed. Behind the  appealing corporate names, however, the state remains the owner.  While the fertile Hungarian soil failed to impress the  anticipated investors, the state farms have been losing their  assets continually and at a fast rate.    Years ago, 121 state farms were being considered for  privatization. The government decided at the time that 26 of the  state farms would remain permanently state-owned. (Primarily the  preservation and development of biological stocks were the  justification for this decision.) The rest of the state farms  were to be privatized. State-farm managers, many of whom have  been replaced in the meantime, prepared plans for transforming  the state farms into corporations, and the State Property Agency  [AVU] decided that their transformation was to be completed by  December 1992. That in itself would not have meant  privatization, but even the simple changing of nameplates failed  to take place.    Experts were not surprised by the delay. For, according to  the government's decision, the state farms were to be sold off  in the course of so-called decentralized privatization. Simply  stated, it meant that the state farms were to be split up into  viable units, which would then be offered for sale. But there  was no rush of prospective buyers. The primary reason for their  lack of interest was that agriculture had been a declining  branch of the economy for years, and therefore the new owners  could not even hope to make a profit. Those who were the least  bit confident of success were deterred by uncertainties  regarding title to the land, and by the protracted settlement of  compensation claims.    The government quickly corrected the situation. The deadline  for transforming state farms into corporations was extended  until 30 June 1993. In a legal sense, this program has been a  success in that the management of every state farm was obliged  to prepare, by the end of December 1993, all the documents  necessary for retroactive incorporation.    The letterheads on the farms' stationery and the nameplates  on the facades of the farms' office buildings attest to the  state farms' transformation into corporations. But economic  reality reveals something entirely different. Under  decentralized privatization, 30 billion forints' [Ft] worth of  assets were offered for sale, but only Ft15 billion worth have  actually been transferred to new owners. Before the state farms'  transformation into corporations, the book value of their assets  totaled Ft93 billion, but only 47 percent of that amount is  so-called subscribed capital.    According to a report reflecting the situation at the end of  March, 98 of the 121 state farms have been transformed into  corporations, 16 are in liquidation, and seven are in the  distribution-of-assets stage. Among the state farms that have  been transformed into corporations, seven are owned by domestic  entrepreneurs and two are owned by German investors. The state  farms' combined total capital stock is Ft76 billion, of which  about Ft5 billion is privately owned. Thus the state continues  to hold most of the capital stock.    The government has attempted once again to stimulate the  farms' lagging privatization. The shares left in the AVU's  portfolio are being put out to public tender; they can now be  bought also for compensation notes; and enterprising  agricultural workers also are able to buy shares.    There are several reason why no rush to buy shares can be  expected. The farmland's future remains uncertain because of the  slow processing of compensation claims, and it would be very  amateurish to start raising livestock without any land.  Agricultural workers are being deterred from buying shares  presumably because they know very well that they cannot expect  any dividend payments in the near future, and their small  percentage of equity is not enough even to guarantee them their  jobs. To add to the contradictions, it is common knowledge that  agriculture in our country is not a sector in which tycoons  invest, and that the rate of return on invested capital is slow  even under favorable economic conditions. The paucity of capital  could be bridged with loans, but then only the investors'  grandchildren could hope to realize the profit.    The most spectacular contradiction in the privatization of  state farms is that the decisionmakers were guided by political  slogans, and they failed to take into consideration that  investors count their forints.</p>

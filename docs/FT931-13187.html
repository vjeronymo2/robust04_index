			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: ENI venture in Venezuela ENI, the Italian industrial group, and Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan state oil group, have agreed to build a Dollars 360m methanol plant in Venezuela, with Chemical Bank of the US and Banca Commerciale Italiana of Italy providing part of the equity for the project. The industrial partners and the participating banks yesterday signed a total of Dollars 206m of debt financing facilities for the project. Under the agreement, a total equity component of Dollars 142m for Supermetanol will be provided, with Ecofuel and Pequiven each subscribing Dollars 49m, while Chemical Bank and BCI will each subscribe Dollars 22m. BCI and Chemical said the Dollars 22m equity component represents a conversion of Venezuelan state debt which the banks had acquired through the 1989 restructuring of Venezuelan state debt. The debt finance facilities also include a L145bn (Dollars 99m) export credit facility, a Dollars 68.4m Euroloan facility, and a Dollars 47m term financing provided by Corporacion Andina de Fomento. The Supermetanol project has been set up by Ecofuel, a subsidiary of the ENI group which manufactures MTBE (a high octane product), and Pequiven, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Venezuelan state oil group. The Supermetanol plant is expected to have an annual capacity of 670,000 tonnes of methanol, a component of MTBE.</p>

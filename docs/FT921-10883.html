			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Granada TV head quits after split with board MR DAVID PLOWRIGHT, executive chairman of Granada Television, was yesterday forced to resign less than four months after leading the company's successful bid for a new franchise. His departure, after more than 30 years at Granada, is being seen by many in British commercial television as a symbolic turning point, reflecting the pressures in the industry after the competitive tenders for new franchises. Mr Plowright, who had been associated with programmes as diverse as Coronation Street, Disappearing World, Brideshead Revisited and Jewel in the Crown, made no attempt to disguise the split within the board of the parent Granada Group. 'There is a fundamental disagreement between myself and the board of Granada about how to manage the change into the new broadcasting environment of the next decade. In these circumstances, the group board has asked for my resignation as executive chairman of Granada Television,' he said. Staff and department heads at Granada TV in Manchester voiced their opposition to the forced resignation. One staff petition said: 'His going is not simply a tragedy for Granada but is a blow to the entire future of British television.' A Granada executive said: 'It's a clash between public service television and accountancy television.' Even The Rover's Return was mourning him. Actress Julie Goodyear, who plays barmaid Bet Gilroy on Coronation Street, said: 'David Plowright has Granada stamped through him like a stick of Blackpool rock. He won us our franchise, and if there is any way that this could be reversed, I'd be very happy.' Mr Andrew Quinn, Granada TV managing director, becomes chief executive and Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of the parent group, is expected to become non-executive chairman. Mr Robinson was hired in October from Compass, the catering and private hospitals group, to replace Mr Derek Lewis, who was forced to resign as chief executive last May. Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'I really am genuinely sorry that it didn't work out between me and David but it didn't' Two contradictory accusations were being levelled at Mr Plowright at Granada group level yesterday. One was that he was autocratic and would not begin the dialogue on the urgent need for change which the board felt was necessary. The second was that he was inconsistent - appearing to agree that speculative film ventures would have to stop and then changing his mind. Executives said the real issue was that, in the middle of a recession, Mr Plowright was faced with demands for month-on-month profit increases which he believed threatened the integrity of Granada's licence application. Staff fear his departure presages plans to make Granada more of a publisher broadcaster - commissioning rather than making programmes, a charge the group denies.

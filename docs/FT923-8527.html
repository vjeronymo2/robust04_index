			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Philippines lifts foreign exchange controls to attract investment THE Philippine government yesterday announced the dismantling of foreign exchange controls on current transactions, in an effort to attract more foreign investment that could support future economic growth. The liberalisation, announced jointly yesterday by President Fidel Ramos and Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the Central Bank, was approved by the policy-making Monetary Board on Friday. The move will allow the free flow of foreign exchange and gold into and out of the Philippines by both residents and overseas investors. It will also remove the requirement that foreign exchange earned abroad by Philippine-based commodity and service exporters should be sold to Manila banks. Foreign exchange earners will also be allowed to spend their dollars 'freely', once implementing guidelines are put in place by the Central Bank, without having to secure prior approval from the bank. Since January, dollar-earners have been allowed to use freely up to 40 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings, from only 2 per cent previously. In addition, Philippine residents investing abroad will now be allowed to buy Dollars 1m (Pounds 525,000) a year from local banks. Mr Ramos said the liberalisation, which continued measures initiated last year by former President Corazon Aquino, 'gives meaning and substance to what I said: that deregulation is one of the key reforms to revive our economy.' The liberalisation, Mr Cuisia said, was 'encouraged' by an easing in the pressure on the peso rate against the US dollar and by a notable increase in foreign exchange inflows, mainly from remittances of Filipinos working abroad and income from tourism. At the end of July, gross international reserves of the Central Bank amounted to approximately Dollars 4.2bn, representing nearly three months' worth of imports. The reserves hit a peak in April of Dollars 5.5bn, which enabled the Philippines to buy back Dollars 1.26bn of its foreign debt at a discount of 48 per cent. The overall balance of payments position for January-April showed a surplus of Dollars 356m, up by some 26 per cent over the year before. Also providing a boost was the elimination of a big source of Central Bank losses. It recently unwound Dollars 800m worth of swap contracts that it entered into in the 1980s to assume foreign exchange risks on loans secured by local companies. All these, according to Mr Cuisia, had made the bank confident of staving off any speculative attack on the peso and paved the way for the liberalisation efforts. Since the start of this month, the peso value has been determined through off-floor interbank trading. Instead of declining, as earlier feared, the peso rate against the dollar had since risen, and the easing of the foreign exchange controls could, according to some bankers, even push it up further.</p>

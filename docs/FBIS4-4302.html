			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the fact that the South Korean  authorities' obstruction maneuvers have blocked [chadan] former  presidents and premiers and high-ranking politicians of various  countries of the world from visiting Pyongyang through  Panmunjom, a spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of  the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly [SPA], on 30 March, issued  the following press statement [tamhwa]:    Press statement by a spokesman for the Reunification Policy  Committee of the DPRK SPA:    At a time when numerous envoys of friendship from the five  continents of the world are continuously visiting our country  with the festive day of April [Kim Il-song birthday] on the  horizon, former presidents and premiers and high-ranking  politicians of various countries of the world who had attended  the Second World Peace Conference expressed their hope to us a  while ago that they would visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom.  They were approximately 100 distinguished political activists  from various continents of the world: They include  approximately 30 former heads of state or government of various  countries, including former Costa Rican Presidents Rodrigo  Carazo and Mario Echandi, former Sudanese President Abdel Rahman  Sowar el Dahab, former Sudanese Premier El Katim el Kalifa,  former Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda, former Guyanese  President Desmond Hoyte, and former Canadian Governor General  Edward Schreyer. They also include current and former  high-ranking politicians from India, Bangladesh, Nepal,  Thailand, and other Asian countries; Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and  other Middle East countries; France, Spain, Norway, and other  European countries; and Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Latin  American countries. They also include high-ranking politicians  from the United States.    This large high-level foreign peace delegation expressed its  intention to visit Pyongyang, know better the reality of our  country, and extend their support to and solidarity with our  people's efforts for peace in the country and its reunification.  We made preparations to receive them as envoys of peace and  friendship and had our side's area of Panmunjom opened. We did  so because we treasure peace on the Korean peninsula and its  peaceful reunification and welcome the intention of the former  presidents and premiers and renowned high-ranking politicians  from various countries and their activities for peace in the  world.    However, the foreign delegation's visit to Pyongyang through  Panmunjom could not take place because of the South Korean  authorities' obstruction.    At the 28 March Panmunjom contact of joint duty officers  [jigilgwan] of the Military Armistice Commission, the opposing  side [taebang] said that the foreign delegation's plan to visit  Pyongyang through Panmunjom had been canceled.    At a news conference that was held in Seoul prior to this,  the foreign delegation announced that they could not visit  Pyongyang because the South side did not approve of the visit  and expressed its dismay and regret for this. They also told us  that they were very thankful for the DPRK for inviting them to  visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom and extending kind hospitality  to them and that there would surely come an opportunity for them  to pay such visits.    We cannot but think that it is regrettable that the large  high-level foreign delegation for peace in the world could not  visit Pyongyang.    The South Korean authorities prevented the foreign  delegation  from visiting Pyongyang by blocking [pongswae] the South side's  area of Panmunjom. This is an uncourteous act lacking  international courtesy or morality [kukchejok yeuido todokto  morunun muryehan haengwi].    The South Korean authorities prevented the approximately 100  former presidents and premiers and renowned high-ranking  politicians from visiting Pyongyang. This cannot be construed  otherwise than an act of restraining the intention of the  foreign delegation and its activities for peace in the world.    The just activities for independence, peace, and friendship  by the dignitaries of the world must be respected as a matter of  course.    They blocked the world peace delegation, not the dissidents  [pancheje insa] who are restricted [kyujedoen] under South  Korea's National Security Law, from even passing through  Panmunjom under an unjustifiable pretext. This shows the  National Security Law is fully applied [kudaero chogyongdoego]  to foreign envoys, as well.    What cannot be overlooked with regard to the South Korean  authorities' recent act is an act of wrongfully misusing  [kuruttoege agyong] the visit to Pyongyang by the foreign  delegation in North-South confrontation. As has already been  known, the South Korean authorities unilaterally broke up  [kyollyol] the contact of working-level delegates for the  exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South,  froze all North-South dialogue, and are bringing the situation  to the brink of war.    The South Korean authorities had kicked up large-scale  commotions with regard to southward aggression [namchimsodongul  taedaejoguro irukyo], thus making people uneasy; made public a  plan on a war of northward aggression called New Operation Plan  5027; and openly cried for achieving reunification after  prevailing over communism. They more loudly babbled [ttodurotta]  about this [achieving reunification after prevailing over  communism] when foreign delegations' visits to Pyongyang resumed.    As was shown, they created an extreme crisis in the  situation  [kuktanhan chongsejok wigi] in the face of the foreign envoys  and asked them to cancel their plans to pass through Panmunjom  and visit Pyongyang under the pretext of such a crisis. This is  a disgusting, mean act [hyomogamul chaanaenun].    With regard to this, voices of denunciation are raised  among media at home and abroad, including an English-language  paper, THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL. Reporting that the South  Korean authorities are at a loss because the issue of the large  foreign peace delegation's visit to Pyongyang was raised  [namchoson tanggukchaduli taekyumoui oeguk pyonghwa sajoltanui  pyongyang pangmun munjega chegidoende taehayo maeu tanghokhae  hagoittago hamyonso]. The papers wrote that South Korea's  national unification minister hastily canceled its permission  for the international delegations' visit to Pyongyang, changing  its former stance.    The papers exposed that the national unification minister's  negative stance created an obstacle to the plan by the  delegation--which is made up of former heads of state,  politicians, and policymakers--to visit Pyongyang by crossing  the Military Demarcation Line.    It is a matter of course that the world's fair media will  protest the South Korean authorities' rude acts of blocking the  foreign peace delegation's visit to Pyongyang as disregarding  basic international manners.    The South Korean authorities blocked the foreign peace  delegation's visit to Pyongyang for another reason: They were  afraid that the quite different realities of the North and the  South would be known to the world public.    If the delegation had visited Pyongyang, it would have  clearly seen that, under Korean-style socialism centered on the  popular masses where the leader, the party, and the masses are  single-heartedly united, all the people are leading an  independent and creative happy life with no worries about food,  clothing, and housing; are stepping up peaceful economic  construction not preparations for a war; and are aspiring for a  reunified Korea, contrary to what the South Korean rulers  advertise.    Contrary to this, South Korea's various kinds of rotten,  ailing social evils that prevail under the present civilian  rule, which stakes its fate on outside forces, will be  strikingly revealed in contrast to the North.    If one sees the true faces of South Korea, where a  powder-reeking war fever is all the more instigated, and our  republic, where peaceful construction is pushed ahead  everywhere, he will clearly know who truly wants peace and  reunification, and who pursues war and national division. This  is what the South Korean authorities are afraid of.    The third party will clearly see that South Korea is the one  that is a secluded society, which the South Korean authorities  babble about, and that the South Korean authorities are the ones  who attempt to perpetuate the national division by erecting an  immense concrete wall across the entire area of the Military  Demarcation Line that extends approximately 240 km.    Truth and lies are bound to be revealed. As one cannot hide  sunshine with hands, the South Korean authorities can never  cover our republic's external status, which is winning victory  after victory, by blocking the international delegation's visit  to the North.    The South Korean authorities should no longer commit rude  acts of damaging the nation's prestige, which is known as a  country of courteous people in the East, running against the  aspiration of the fellow countrymen and the world's peace-loving  people.    We will always keep the door open for the foreign delegation  who, with a good intention, wish to visit Pyongyang to do good  things for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.    [Signed] Spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of  the DPRK SPA    [Dated] 30 March, Pyongyang</p>

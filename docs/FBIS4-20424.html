			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Two-part article by Tai Dewen and Gao Lu: "Speaking of the </F> Reverse Flow in Season of Rising `Tide'--Dialogue on Reverse  Flow Phenomenon in `Tide of Rural Labor'(Part Two)" -- Part One  published in China JPRS Report CAR 94-025]    [Text] Don't Ask Him Why He Returned    Tai: Fairly many of the factors for "regressing"  and starting an undertaking are connected with the traditional  idea of bringing honor to one's ancestors. "A gale has risen and  is sweeping the clouds across the sky; with more force  throughout the country it sweeps people back to their native  places." In the Han Dynasty, after Liu Bang had achieved success  and gained fame, the first thing he did was return to his native  place and show off. The traditional idea of bringing honor to  one's ancestors is deeply ingrained in people's consciousness,  and it influences their behavior. In the period of his work  outside his native place, a peasant of Fuyang City learned the  skill of making pickled vegetables. When he returned to his  native place he took the lead in setting up the Huatuo Pickled  Vegetable Plant. Its annual output value is now over 10 million  yuan and its profit more than 10 million yuan. He has been  selected to be a special representative of the city's CPPCC and  NPC.    Gao: Objectively, the existing household  registration system and land system, I'm afraid, are also  important factors in the return to their native places by those  who have engaged in trade or work outside their native places.  The dual social structure, in which city and county are  separated and which has been extant in China for a long time,  although in recent years being made somewhat more flexible and  being somewhat weakened, has fundamentally not changed. The  peasants who went to cities to work do not enjoy the social  welfare and insurance benefits that the city's staff and workers  do; at present, one cannot obtain a permanent right to reside in  a city soley by economic means.    Tai: Even if this precedent were to be set, one  would have to pay the city's land-use fee, basic facilities fee,  employment placement fee, and other economic costs; and they are  very high and also constantly increasing. Our investigation of  typical cases showed that, faced with the choice of paying a  large sum of money to obtain the right of permanent residence in  a city or using this money to return to one's native place and  set up an enterprise, more than 90 percent of the people chose  the latter. At the same time, in accordance with the existing  land contract system, those who go outside their native places  to work must pay taxes and fees in line with the contract. The  idea that the peasants' land cannot be put out of cultivation at  the same time also influences their desire to return.    Gao: Speaking of certain peasants who have  returned to the "Yellow Earth" to continue to engage in  agriculture, the state's support policies, e.g., raising the  grain purchasing price, I'm afraid, is also an inducement that  cannot be overlooked.    Tai: That's natural. If they could gain wealth by  tilling the land, why would the peasants leave their villages  and crowd into cities? In the process of the return by peasants  who went outside their native places, market mechanisms and  policy levers have played an important role.    Gao: Specifically, for certain returnees the  exciting cause could be the joint effect of the above factors,  and also could be the result of the effect of certain factors  among them. It is not necessary to get to the bottom of this  question. The value of the investigation and analysis of the  exciting cause for their return lies in understanding and  grasping this phenomenon and correctly guiding it.    Tai: This viewpoint is very important, and we are  pursuing this train of thought. The reason for investigating and  analyzing why the peasants return is to make the formulated  policies and measures more scientific. In doing policy and  management work, I advocate that we not examinue minutely why  other people return. We must look at objective results, and use  the three "is it favorable or not" questions as the criteria for  judging whether people's behavior is right or wrong,  advantageous or disadvantageous.  <H5>  New Growing Points </H5>   Gao: What those who engaged in trade or worked  outside their native places obtained was not only a sizable  economic income, skills, and business insight, but also they  unconsciously absorbed the new ideas of modern life in the  developed areas. Those who return bring back the culture and  civilization on the outside; through their various ways of  behaving they influence peasants around them, thereby pounding  at the old, backward concepts and producing an exemplary effect  on people's lifestyle.    Tai: The depth and the breadth of this effect far  exceed those of radio, television, the press, and other mass  media. A young woman from Jidong Village, Quanyang Town, Jieshou  City went to Beijing, where she became a nurse. She was  gradually influenced by the modern lifestyle. At the Spring  Festival she returned home. Her ideas, concepts, and ways of  behaving produced a big effect on the other young women in her  village. When the Spring Festival had just ended, about a dozen  young women requested that she take them to Beijing to become  nurses. At the beginning of the 1990 Spring Festival, she set  up in her native village a labor export organization and  conveyance center. Over the past several years she has organized  and conveyed to Beijing more than 1,200 person-times of young  women. These women are now spurring on and influencing changes  in the thoughts and concepts of even more women.    Tai: The pioneering activities of those who have  returned home have mitigated the social problems brought by the  transregional flow of labor forces and their crowding into  cities. After World War II, in some independent developing  countries, during the process of industrialization there  appeared, to different degrees, the "urbanization transition  syndrome." Brazil, the national condition of which approximates  that of China, is a typical example. In the period 1940-1983,  the proportion of Brazil's urban population in its total  population rose from 31.9 percent at the beginning to 70.7  percent at the end. The rural people who flowed into the cities,  unable to find employment, roamed the streets. And the labor  force that we originally exported but that returned to their  native places and set up enterprises absorb the surplus labor,  thereby causing the on-the-spot transfer of the rural surplus  labor and really advancing this situation in a realistic way.    Gao: In solving the problem of the transfer of  rural surplus labor, the government and academic circles have  explored many ways in various places, e.g., through adjustment  of the internal structure of agriculture, achieving the  split-flow way of "not leaving the land and not leaving the  native place" through guiding peasants on the spot to shift to  secondary and tertiary industries; thus, the ways of "leaving  the land but not leaving the native ploace" and "leaving the  native place but not leaving the land" have been incorporated  into the rural industrial structure, while some peasants have  been organized and guided to take the way of "leaving both land  and native place" by being labor exports to cities outside their  native places. The idea of on-the-spot transfer was put forward  long ago, and the abrupt rise in transfers provides a realistic  way for doing it. Undeveloped areas are basically places where  township-town enterprises have not yet been developed. Those who  return and start an undertaking may be called a contingent of  "fresh troops." In this sense they constitute not only a new  economic growing point for the development of township-town  enterprises in undeveloped areas, but also a new growing point  for the development of rural society; they may even be said to  be a new growing point for the social and economic development  of China, a country in which 90 percent of the population lives  in the rural areas. If we observe the now surging "tide of rural  labor" with this kind of eye, we get another impression.    Tai: Being mobile is not their objective; what,  in the end, they pursue is returning and starting an  undertaking. Speaking of the local governments, those in this  transregional flow of rural surplus labor do not, in reality,  require a school education, a factory in which investment has  been made, and a credit bank.  <H5>  New Theme </H5>   Gao: The contingent of those who return and start  an undertaking will, following the increase in the number of  people flowing out, expand proportionally. Compared with the  "tide of rural labor," the phenomenon of "regression" is of a  more constructive nature, and thus constitutes a more important  theme.    Tai: We already understand this point. The Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee formally used  the term "labor market," and for labor as a commodity with the  market as the intermediary, to have both a flow and a reverse  flow is natural. For local governments the most realistic theme  is: how, in policy, public opinion, and other aspects, to create  an environment and conditions for taking effective measures that  guide more people to return and start an undertaking. I feel  that we should treat this theme from the height of attracting,  discovering, developing, and using talented persons.    Gao: This is very far-sighted. There are bright  prospects for local governments in this aspect. What measures  have you taken or are preparing to take?    Tai: First of all, all our types of labor-export  organizations are doing everything possible to make widespread  contacts with economically developed areas and with some  enterprises with good economic returns, and they are conveying  to them in an organized manner high-quality rural surplus labor  and purposefully, through export, training the various types of  talented people urgently needed for our economic development.  Second, through finding out the real situation by frequent  investigations, particularly grasping the opportune time of the  Spring Festival period when they return home to visit relatives  to make use of symposiums and other ways to investigate and get  a detailed understanding of the situation with regard to the  exported labor's quality, direction of going, service life, and  occupation in order to discover talented people. Third, with  regard to the difficulties in funds encountered when returning  and starting an undertaking, we require that financial  departments, on the basis of conscientious inspection, give  support in the form of loans; with regard to tax revenue, we  require the tax departments, within the scope permitted by  policy, as much as possible grant reductions or exemptions.  Fourth, we are considering giving a double award to those who  return, start an undertaking, and obtain outstanding results --  good economic returns and good social benefits -- and put them  in leading posts at the village level, and let them lead more of  the measses to make money and become well-off. Finally, we hope  you news and propaganda departments will adopt many forms to  publicize them in the mass media, forming in all of society a  good atmosphere conducive to guiding those who return to make  great contributions and accomplish great tasks.    Gao: We have thought of this point. The press has  the responsibility for publicizing typical examples of those who  have returned and started an undertaking, and for forming in  society a general mood of admiring and valuing this activity.</p>

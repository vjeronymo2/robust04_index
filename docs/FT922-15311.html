			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: S Korean construction companies see orders double OVERSEAS orders won by South Korean construction companies more than doubled during the first three months of this year compared with the corresponding period last year. The companies were aided by a very large contract in Singapore. Construction investment is rising sharply throughout Asia as countries take advantage of their growing economic strength to improve infrastructure particularly in transport and water. As a result the region is one of the fastest growing construction markets in the world. South Korean construction companies along with the Japanese provide some of the largest construction companies in Asia. Figures published yesterday by the Overseas Construction Association of Korea revealed that South Korean contractors won 16 major international contracts worth more than Dollars 870m (Pounds 500m) during the first three months of this year. The value of the work was more than double that won during the corresponding period last year. Almost 90 per cent of the work by value was won in Asia. The largest single contract worth Dollars 622m was for an urban development project in Singapore won by Hyundai and Ssangyong construction companies, said the association. Daelim Engineering also won a hydro electric project in Pakistan worth Dollars 98m. The association said that South Korean companies expected shortly to win other large overseas contracts in Asia. South Korean construction companies which have been strong international competitors, notably in the Middle East, have traditionally earned much of their sales overseas. More recently companies have been concentrating efforts on the domestic market where construction output, as in other Asian countries, has risen sharply in recent years. Cement sales, a good indicator of construction activity, rose by 20 per cent in South Korea last year to 44m tonnes, equivalent to 1.02m tonnes for each of the country's 43m population - the highest cement sales per capita in the world, according to the Korea Cement Industrial Association.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, 26 Feb (TANJUG) -- Bnanko Vojnica, speaker of  the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], has sent,  via the diplomatic and consular offices in Belgrade, a letter to  representatives of all parliaments in the world calling on them  to establish working contacts with Krajina's parliament.    Since your government does not recognize the RSK government  and does not want to exchange information and engage in  arguments with it, I suggest that our two parliaments establish  working contacts and thus contribute to ending the war and the  suffering of innocent people and to solving all disputes in the  territory of the former Yugoslavia by peaceful means, the letter  says.    Vojnica informs the parliaments about the history of the  Serb  people in the territory of former Croatia and stresses that the  Serbs do not want to live in the same state with Croats.    The letter also quotes the results of the multiparty  elections held in the RSK last December, and says that through  the elections the people of the RSK confirmed their right to  self-determination.</p>

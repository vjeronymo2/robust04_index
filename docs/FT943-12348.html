			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / High hurdles are the norm for investment: Gillian Tett on the rates of return being used to assess new projects As Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, presses on with his campaign to persuade UK companies to lower target rates of return from investments, a company such as Whitbread might give him cause to wince. In spite of Mr George's warnings that high targets could stifle investment and undermine the economic recovery, the company has little intention of lowering its targets. Mr David Reed, director of corporate communications at Whitbread, said: 'If anything our rates of return will rise this year.' The most likely shift would be from a five-year pay-back to four years. Comments such as these may not surprise the City, in light of the Confederation of British Industry's survey earlier this week which showed most companies keeping high investment hurdles - minimum targets for rates of return - and inflation assumptions above government targets. What may give economists more food for thought is that many companies reject warnings that high hurdles might be hampering investment - not least because inflation expectations matter less than uncertainty about demand. Mr Reed pointed out that Whitbread's move to higher hurdles went hand in hand with a new investment programme. He said: 'High hurdles are not a bar to investment. We will raise our rate of capital investment by 50 per cent this year.' The example reflects a message about investment complexity that is being echoed by most companies, as the Confederation of British Industry prepares to publish its latest quarterly survey indicating manufacturing investment intentions today. Sir David Lees, chairman of the industrial group GKN, said it operated a hurdle rate of about 20 per cent - a benchmark that had been maintained through recent years, although it rose slightly in the late 1980s. He insisted, however, that this varied from project to project, and said that hurdle rates remained only one factor in his assessment of business decisions. He said: 'We have not formally changed our benchmark, although we would be more easily persuaded in marginal cases by the somewhat better outlook for inflation.' It was likely to take two more years of low inflation to convince most businesses to change their inflation expectations. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of the Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson, is a little more upbeat. Mr Bonham said that last year Hanson lowered its target rate of return 'in light of a changed inflation and interest-rate environment. We use a mixture of methods but in the broadest sense you could say we moved it from a four-year pay-back period to a a five-year one'. Mr David Newlands, finance director of the defence and electronics group GEC, has indicated that he expects little change to his company's hurdle rates. However, he said: 'The rate of return that we look for depends on the risk involved in the project. For some high-technology areas you would expect a high rate of return - it's much more complex than surveys might suggest.'</p>

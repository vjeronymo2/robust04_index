Rao, said  on Thursday that Russia had expressed its inability to go ahead  with the transfer of technology on the controversial cryogenic  rocket engines.    Talking to newsmen at the inauguration of a private company  set up for manufacturing hybrid micro devices which could find  application in the realm of space, Prof Rao said discussions  were on between the Russian Space Agency, Glavkosmos, and the  ISRO on the cryogenic engines deal, and that something had to be  evolved to the satisfaction of all. Asked if he was satisfied  with the discussions, Prof Rao said if he was happy, he would  have said so.    The ISRO chief said efforts were on to build the cryogenic  engines indigenously and added that he was confident that the  Indian engines would be ready by 1998.    ISRO had already built a one tonne sub-scale cryogenic  engine  at its Mahendragiri facility.    Facilities for testing the cryogenic engines were being  readied, he added.    Prof. Rao said ISRO would not pay a rupee more than Rs 235  crore to Glavkosmos for the cryogenic engine deal, whatever may  be the outcome of discussions now underway. Nothing will stop us  from building our own facilities, he asserted.    Prof Rao said ISRO had not approached the General Dynamics  Inc. (of the United States), the Arianespace or the Glavkosmos  for the knowhow on cryogenic engines. These organisations had  contacted the ISRO and the Russian offer was accepted when the  Arianespace bid was about to be placed before the Union Cabinet.    He said the technology embargo slapped by the United States  on the ISRO (for alleged violation of the Missile Technology  Control Regime) was nothing new, for such "unpronounced  embargos" existed much before the cryo-deal was struck with  Russia.</p>

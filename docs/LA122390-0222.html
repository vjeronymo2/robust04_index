			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT'S 'CHOICE FOR GREED'  </P> <P> Our future depends upon the education and nurturing of our children. The  Alhambra Board of Education chooses to put administrators' and teachers'  economic interests before the creative, developmental and educational needs of  our youth.  </P> <P> In so doing, they are making a choice for greed rather than for nurturing and  uplifting our society.  </P> <P> Nov. 20, approximately 500 parents, teachers, and community members, along with  a hired consultant, presented the board with proposals and appeals (Times, Nov.  22). Parker Williams, the board president, stated that the board would work  together to find a mutual solution with a task force composed of parents,  teachers, administrators, and board members. The board has since denied that  they agreed to do this. They say that they need to discuss the matter. During  the Dec. 4 board meeting, the board stated that they have not made a decision  in this regard. Why do you suppose that this is the case? Could it be that they  are afraid to talk to concerned individuals, or are they embarrassed because  they have no intention of even considering seeking an alternative solution? It  would appear that the board is unresponsive to the community voice and to the  needs of our children.  </P> <P> We applaud the efforts of Dora Padilla, board member, who has proposed that  music and art be electives in the seventh- and eighth-grade curriculum.  </P> <P> We implore teachers to defer pay raises until this budget crunch has passed.  When funds are available, teachers will receive their raises, but the music and  art programs will be gone, not only in the elementary level, but high school as  well.  </P> <P> Let's give kids a chance; greed has seen its day.  </P> <P> RENEE HAI  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

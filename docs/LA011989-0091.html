			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A drug intended to stop the spread of the AIDS virus by mimicking the blood  cells it usually infects has proven to be highly effective in experimental use  on monkeys, experts report in today's issue of the British journal Nature. The  animal research provides the first clear evidence outside the test tube that  this strategy has a chance of slowing and perhaps arresting the disease in  people. Even if the treatment works as well in people as it does in monkeys, it  will not cure AIDS. But it might make life better for victims of the virus.  </P></p>

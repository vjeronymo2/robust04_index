The co-operative training project, jointly funded by the  Chinese Ministry of Forestry and the Japan International  Co-Operation Agency, started from 1990.    As a main contractor of the project, the Beijing Forestry  University built ten computer and soil analysis laboratories in  the training center, equipped with advanced instruments costing  over 250 million yen provided by Japan.    The center has, ever since its founding, made great  achievements in research fields, including forestry hydrology,  remote sensing, soil science, water and soil conservation, and  natural disaster prediction.    Also included is research into soil erosion control and  afforestation on north China's Loess Plateau,    Experimental forests have been planted in north China's  Shanxi province over the past few years.    Many of the specialists have now been promoted to leading  posts in county-level water and soil conservation departments.</p>

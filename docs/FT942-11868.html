			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Paraguay suffers its first general strike in 35 years Paraguay's first general strike in 35 years has claimed one life and clashes with security forces have caused 20 injuries. Police shot a peasant in the interior of the country participating in Monday's general strike, in which protesters blocked roads throughout the country and demonstrated in the capital Asuncion. They demanded 40 per cent wage rises, a halt to the country's privatisation programme and the suspension of economic integration with neighbouring countries. The army deployed tanks to keep the roads open, but transport workers paralysed the bus service, forcing shops and offices in Asuncion to close. The one-day strike followed months of growing tension in the interior, where peasants are demanding land reform and government financial support to compensate for falling cotton prices. Growing trade links with Paraguay's large neighbours, Brazil and Argentina, through the Mercosur customs union is also threatening smaller Paraguayan companies. This was the most serious challenge yet to President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who was elected last year. Mr Wasmosy's Colorado party backed General Alfredo Stroessner during his 1954-89 military rule, but is now committed to democracy and market reforms.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou Free  Trade Zone is prospering since it went into operation last May,  according to officials in charge of the zone's management.    By the end of March this year 263 projects set up by  domestic  and foreign businessmen had settled down in the zone, involving  a total investment of 430 million U.S. dollars, 122 million  U.S. dollars of which came from foreign investors.    The 1.4-sq-km zone near this capital of south China's  Guangdong Province is one of the 13 free trade zones approved by  the State Council to be set up across the country.    So far, almost all the land in the zone for financial and  trade activities, warehouses and processing of export products  has been sold.    The officials said that the zone is the first in the country  to permit solely foreign-funded enterprises to take overall  charge of land development and introducing projects.    By the end of last year the zone had put large sums of money  into improving the zone's basic facilities, and this year, ten  infrastructure projects will be completed or start construction  with regard to commodity show places, quays, goods examination  sites, electric power projects and office buildings.</p>

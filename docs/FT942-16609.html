			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Intrigues that toppled five prime ministers in five years Japan has lost five prime ministers in five years. One resigned over a stocks-for-favours episode, another fell after having his image tarnished by a 'geisha scandal', and one lost office for having pushed too hard for the reform of a corrupt political system, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. For optimistic analysts, the high turnover of leaders is a healthy sign of the gradual collapse of the 'money politics' perfected by the Liberal Democratic party in its 38 years of rule, which ended last summer. But pessimists believe the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa merely shows that Japanese politics remains corrupt. With his relative good looks, designer clothes and suave manner, Mr Hosokawa personified the new type of politician the Japanese voters apparently wanted  -a lawmaker untainted by scandal and with the ability to change the corrupt political system. But in spite of yesterday's denials that his resignation was tied directly to his dealings with Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking company involved in recent bribery scandals, or to his family's stock transactions, Mr Hosokawa finds himself joining the rogues' gallery of his predecessors. MR NOBORU TAKESHITA, who once controlled the most powerful faction in the LDP, is still regarded as a symbol of old style politics, which involved close ties between politicians and companies favoured with public contracts. Mr Takeshita was forced to step down in 1989 after opposition parties blocked the budget bill until he clarified his links to the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal. Even after his resignation, the unearthing of his alleged links to gangsters and a mysterious affair involving the sale of an ornate but controversial gold-leaf screen have further hurt his reputation. MR SOSUKE UNO was brought in as 'Mr Clean' after Mr Takeshita's resignation in disgrace. However, he managed to stay at the helm for only two months, in a term of office marred by revelations about his alleged affair with a geisha. Mr Uno, seen by most Japanese as a bungling leader and an embarrassment to his party, was held responsible for a sharp drop in the LDP's popularity. He has since returned to obscurity. After his departure the party was then forced to search among its ranks for an MP untouched by scandal. After Mr Uno's resignation, the Liberal Democratic party was forced to dip into the younger pool of Diet members. MR TOSHIKI KAIFU was clean - so clean that he annoyed party elders by refusing to appoint any party member linked to a scandal to his cabinet. In spite of his eagerness to impress the Japanese electorate, Mr Kaifu lost the premiership after the party's faction leaders decided that he was taking the cause of political reform too seriously in late 1991, when the LDP was not yet ready to contemplate a serious change to the political system. After Mr Kaifu, the LDP gave up trying to place politicians untouched by scandals at the helm. MR KIICHI MIYAZAWA had been implicated in the Recruit scandal, but was an ideal candidate for the leading factions due to his previous ministerial experience, his image as an intellectual and international statesman, and most important, his weak party power base. But his lack of political power worked against him in the end as he was unable to persuade party elders to adopt the political reform bill. This prompted his downfall as he had publicly pledged to clean up politics.</p>

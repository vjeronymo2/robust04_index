			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 26 (AFP) -- The Khmer Rouge [KR]  on Tuesday launched a heavy attack on the border town of Poipet,  in the northwestern Cambodian province of Banteay Meanchay,  co-premier Hun Sen said.    "Today the Khmer Rouge attacked Poipet, I don't know what is  happening there but our general staff are following the  situation," Hun Sen told reporters in Phnom Penh. The  ultra-left guerrillas started to shell Poipet, a normally busy  market town on the Thai-Cambodian border, early Tuesday and Thai  military officials reported heavy fighting throughout the day.    More than a hundred civilians fled to the safety of  Sisophon,  48 kilometers (30 miles) to the east, fearing the guerrillas  would overrun the town.    Thai military officials told reporters in the Thai town of  Aranyaprathet, which is opposite Poipet, that the Khmer Rouge  attacked in a pincer movement with the guerrillas's 450 Division  moving in from the south while the 519 Division pushed from the  north. No figures were available on the number of men involved  in the attack or on casualties.    Hun Sen said he was surprised by the size of the guerrilla  attack.    "I just wonder how the Khmer Rouge could have such strength  to attack Poipet," he said, adding: "I don't say that I accuse  Thailand."    Hun Sen last week accused Thailand of assisting the Khmer  Rouge in the guerrillas' April 19 recapture of their  headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia.    Thailand denied the accusation and said that Phnom Penh's  repeated allegations of Thai support for the Khmer Rouge risked  jeopardising relations between the two neighbouring states.    Thai military officer also said that Cambodia's National  Route 5 which runs from the border to the country's second city  of Battambang was closed due to the clashes.</p>

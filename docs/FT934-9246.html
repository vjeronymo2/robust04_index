			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Badgerline float price set at 115p BADGERLINE Group, the Avon-based bus company which is coming to the market this month, yesterday fixed its flotation price at 115p a share - valuing the group at Pounds 99.3m. The group is forecasting earnings of 8.4p per share for the year to December 31, giving a prospective multiple of 13.7. The board is also indicating a notional dividend of 4.1p, for a gross yield of 4.5 per cent. A total of Pounds 47m is being raised, including Pounds 9m for the benefit of certain existing shareholders, of which Pounds 31m is being placed with institutions and Pounds 16m being offered to the public. Badgerline has grown into one of the biggest providers of local bus services. The company began as a Pounds 3m buy-out from the National Bus Company in 1986, and now operates 2,300 buses and coaches in the Midlands, South Wales and the south of England. The flotation is sponsored by Lazard Brothers, with Cazenove as brokers. The offer will close on November 19 and dealings are expected to begin on November 26. COMMENT This pricing offers a yield premium to the market and is pitched at a discount to Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus operator which came to the market in April. Badgerline has taken over seven other former NBC operations and will look to further acquisitions to maintain earnings growth. The group is well organised and there remains considerable scope for consolidation of the many remaining privately-owned and municipal bus companies. To analysts who question whether Badgerline can continue to defy the long-term decline in bus usage, the group points both to its increasing efficiency and the future of environmentally friendly park-and-ride schemes, such as it has organised in Bristol. In the short term, the price seems to have been set at a level which should ensure a comfortable, but not excessive, premium.</p>

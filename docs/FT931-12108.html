			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Write-off or profit? IF A BANK agrees to accept less than the total amount of an overdraft or loan due to it by a partnership, must the amount written off by the bank be added to the partnership profits for income tax purposes? Only to the extent that the amount written off represents bank charges, interest etc for which tax relief has been allowed already. Such items are caught by section 94 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 under the heading of 'Debts deducted and subsequently released.' It states: 'Where in computing for tax purposes the profits or gains of a trade, profession or vocation, a deduction has been allowed for any debt incurred for the purposes of the trade, profession or vocation, then, if the whole or any part of the debt is thereafter released, the amount released shall be treated as a receipt of the trade, profession or vocation arising in the period in which the release is effected.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market deals boost equity business SEVERAL large trading programmes in blue chip equities helped the London stock market yesterday and, after tracing an erratic pattern, the FT-SE Index managed to close above the 2,550 mark again. The index benefited from gains in a handful of constituent stocks, including Rank Organisation, which rebounded strongly after the trading report dispelled last week's bearish fantasies. London turned firmer towards the close when Wall Street came in with a 9.6 Dow improvement in early deals, but the generally unconvincing response to President George Bush's State of the Union Message continued to hang over investors. The firmer trend in the dollar appeared to have only a marginal effect on the international stocks. On the domestic side, retail shares weakened as Marks and Spencer, one of Britain's best-known high street names, was taken off the recommended buy list of County NatWest, the London based investment bank. UK equities opened sharply lower in the wake of Wall Street's fall of 47 points overnight but quickly rallied, helped by the first of at least four trading programmes. The initial programme, relatively modest and limited to non-Footsie stocks, was quickly followed by another, much larger, trading operation by a leading brokerage house. Traders believed that the second programme, which ranged through the Footsie list, was worth more than Pounds 360m. However, the market failed at its first attempt to rescale the Footsie 2,550 level and lost a net six points as turnover faded for a time. Two further trading programmes, said to be from UK securities houses, together with the early improvement on Wall Street, provided renewed encouragement for London in the final couple of hours of the trading session. The best gains were not held and the final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,550.8 left a rise of 4.3 on the day, compared with a 9.5 gain only 20 minutes earlier. Dealers sounded relatively unenthusiastic at the close, in spite of the brighter showing by share prices. Outside of the trading programmes, investment interest was highly stock selective and often for very visible reasons. Seaq volume, boosted by the trading programmes, increased to 680.3m shares from the 549.7m of the previous session; on Wednesday, retail business remained just short of the Pounds 1bn mark, continuing the disappointingly low level of genuine investment activity which has developed over the past week. Heavy trade in shares of BT followed a somewhat cautious trading statement from the UK telephone and telecommunications group, which coincided with new pricing proposals from Oftel, the industry regulator. The shares closed firmly with at least one London broker regarding them as cheap. The rise in Rank Organisation, which represented nearly one point of yesterday's gain in the Footsie, implied a successful outcome to what can now be identified as a bear raid on the stock during last week. Among the pharmaceuticals, interest continued to turn away from Glaxo and to focus on Fisons, where the market is convinced that a stakebuilder is at work. ICI continued to drift lower as the stock market assessed the outlook for the share price now that Hanson has ruled itself out as a bidder.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AFTER WINNING TITLE, EIGHT IS NOT ENOUGH;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: ANTELOPE VALLEY CHRISTIAN WILL STEP UP TO 11-MAN VERSION ON THE HEELS  OF A 13-0 CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON.  </P> <P> In 1990, his football team scored 658 points and allowed only 88. The average  margin of victory was 43 points, the team posted five shutouts and of its 13  games -- all victories -- only four were completed; the others were ended  because of the "mercy rule."  </P> <P> And still Ted Knapp, the first-year coach of Antelope Valley Christian, feels  obliged to make excuses for his players' individual statistics.  </P> <P> "When it's over at halftime, it's hard to build up your stats," Knapp said. "My  first teamers (were) frustrated about getting yanked."  </P> <P> To keep the players happy, Knapp has found a new challenge for a team that went  13-0 and won the Southern Section Eight-Man Small Schools Division title: The  school will move up to play 11-man football next season.  </P> <P> Valley-area schools such as Montclair Prep and Camp Kilpatrick have made the  jump from eight-man to 11-man and enjoyed great success. There is reason to  believe that Antelope Valley Christian, located in Lancaster, might follow in  their cleat-steps.  </P> <P> "I think they can make the move," said Viewpoint Coach Steve Sherman, whose  team lost to the Eagles, 50-0, in midseason. "They have more athletes than  other small schools, and that is the first thing they need. They have the  talent and you can see that when they play.  </P> <P> "Most eight-man teams don't pass well, (but) they do it with regularity. They  also have the facilities, the equipment and the support. Those things should  make it easier for Coach Knapp. Really, from a coaching standpoint, there isn't  much of a difference."  </P> <P> Besides being able to impress those on the field, Knapp has won backing from  key administrators in the Southern Section.  </P> <P> "Everything we have heard about playing 11-man is positive," Knapp said.  "(Southern Section Commissioner) Stan Thomas is supporting our move and several  football people have said we are ready."  </P> <P> When Antelope Valley Christian begins practice next August, the team will be  trying to develop some much-needed depth. The current roster numbers 27. The  Eagles do have a junior varsity (4-0-1 last season) and additional players will  come from that group. Still, Antelope Valley Christian, with an enrollment of  95, will be one of the smallest schools in Division X.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley Christian, a co-educational private school, has been in  existence for only three years. In its first two years, the team won only three  games. A school that is still somewhat unproven and certainly small, Antelope  Valley Christian has not convinced everyone it is ready to play 11-man  football.  </P> <P> "I think the next step should be to the (eight-man) large division," said  retiring Central Valley Christian Coach Keith Houtsma, whose team lost to the  Eagles, 54-26, in this year's small schools final played Dec. 1. "They are  going to have a tough time competing anywhere in the Southern Section. I don't  think they can play with the Division 10 schools, and if they think they can  they are going to have another think coming."  </P> <P> Antelope Valley Christian already has scheduled Trona, Montclair Prep and  Christian High in El Cajon for next season. The Eagles will play as a Division  10 independent team in 1991 and move into the Desert-Inyo League in 1992.  </P> <P> The players are confident after the success of this season. "I think we've  proved we can play with anyone," sophomore quarterback Kris Kershaw said.  "We've shown that we have what it takes to succeed. With some more success,  some dads are going to start taking notice and may send their kids here instead  of Quartz Hill and some other schools."  </P> <P> Some of the top performances of this past season came from young players.  Kershaw threw for 33 touchdowns, completed 65% of his passes and threw but one  interception. Another sophomore, fullback Vinny Galis, averaged 9.6 yards a  carry and scored 16 touchdowns. A linebacker on defense, Galis had 138 tackles  and 13 sacks.  </P> <P> Yet maybe the most important returnee is Knapp, 34, a proven coach who has  compiled an 11-year record of 100-26-1, including six division or state titles  in Georgia, Maryland, Alabama and California. All but two have been at the  11-man level.  </P> <P> "I want to move fast and I want to be dynamic," Knapp said. "I want to attract  quality kids and I think the way to do that is to constantly build on your  program. This is not a five-year program, this is a fast-as-you-can program."  </P></p>

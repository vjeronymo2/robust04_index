			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> POLICE GROUP REJECTS ANOTHER REDONDO OFFER;  </P> <P> 6% RAISE TOO LITTLE BECAUSE OF DANGERS, OFFICERS ARGUE AFTER COLLEAGUE IS SHOT  IN LINE OF DUTY  </P> <P> Citing the shooting of fellow officer Leonard Knott as an example of the  dangers inherent in police work, the president of the Redondo Beach Police  Officers Assn. told the City Council on Tuesday that the group had rejected the  city's latest proposal in ongoing efforts to reach a contract agreement.  </P> <P> Paul Wrightsman said the city has offered police officers the same salary  increases as maintenance workers and other city employees. Such comparisons are  off-base, he said, because of the greater risks from police work.  </P> <P> Other city employees "do not face the dangers we face from day to day, from  hour to hour, or even from call to call," Wrightsman said.  </P> <P> Backed by at least two dozen off-duty officers who joined him in the audience  in the Council Chambers, Wrightsman said many had just returned from donating  blood for Knott, who was injured Tuesday in a shoot-out about a block from City  Hall. Knott was in serious condition Wednesday at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.  </P> <P> "We are praying hourly for his recovery," Wrightsman told the council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Shooting This Year  </P> <P> Tuesday's shooting was the second this year involving a Redondo Beach officer.  On Aug. 31, Officer Michael Clifton was grazed during an exchange of gunfire  after he and another officer approached a suspect apparently trying to break  into a car on the Esplanade.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach police say that, despite their high level of service, they are  among the lowest paid in the South Bay.  </P> <P> The average Redondo Beach police officer's salary is about $3,100 a month,  Wrightsman told the council. On average, according to the association, police  salaries are 22% higher in Hawthorne, 11% higher in El Segundo and 6% higher in  Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Negotiations with the city began when the police contract expired June 30.  </P> <P> About 30 police officers and their families set up tents Monday morning and  camped out on the front lawn of City Hall in a two-day demonstration protesting  the stalled contract talks. The camp was dismantled Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Wrightsman said police officers and the city were at odds over issues that  include pay rates, emergency family sick leave and other benefits. The city has  been offering police a 6% increase, and the association is seeking a 7% annual  raise, according to Wrightsman.  </P> <P> The 85-member association unanimously rejected the city's most recent formal  offer last week, Wrightsman said. Tuesday's informal proposal was not submitted  to a vote, he said.  </P> <P> City Manager Tim Casey has declined to comment on details of the ongoing  negotiations. He said in an interview that the city has reached agreements with  the Fire Department and a group of clerical and other employees, whose  contracts also expired June 30. Those groups signed two-year contracts with pay  increases of 6% each year, he said.  </P> <P> Under the expired police contract, in addition to regular sick leave, officers  received up to six additional sick days for emergencies, including a death or  birth in the family or surgery or other serious illness of a family member,  according to both sides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elimination or Liberalization  </P> <P> The police association says the city is attempting to eliminate that benefit.  </P> <P> Casey said the city's proposal includes broadening the definition of emergency  sick days and consolidating four different sick-leave plans into one program.  </P> <P> Wrightsman told the council Tuesday that the city's proposal was unacceptable.  </P> <P> "We have nothing more to say, and you can have this proposal back," Wrightsman  told the council, tossing a sheaf of papers onto the speaker's podium and  leaving the Council Chambers, followed by the officers in the audience. The  papers were the city's proposal, which had been hand-delivered to the  association Tuesday.  </P> <P> In an interview Wednesday, Casey said he was "not completely sure that the  proposal was read seriously by the association. . . . We did attempt to make  movement toward two considerations that were keeping us apart. (We were)  attempting to meet them halfway on a couple of issues."  </P> <P> Casey said city and police negotiators met again Wednesday. The city was  expecting a written response to its Tuesday proposal by the end of the week, he  said.  </P></p>

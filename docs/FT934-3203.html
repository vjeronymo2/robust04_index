			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Bonn makes spending compromise The German government yesterday abandoned a key measure to curb the rise in social spending, by agreeing not to set a strict time-limit on earnings-related unemployment benefits. The plan, which had aroused widespread anger in the trade union movement, was dropped as part of a last-minute compromise to enable the overall government savings package, cutting some DM20bn (Pounds 7.9bn) from next year's federal budget, to become law. The deal was possible thanks to what amounts to a 'grand coalition' between the government and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), who had blocked the savings package with their majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament. However, the Free Democrats (FDP) in the ruling coalition warned that now a further DM2.5bn would have to be cut from government spending, if the federal deficit was to be kept under DM70bn next year. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, had sought to impose a maximum four-years limit on earnings-related unemployment benefits, while at the same time cutting the benefits by some three percentage points as a proportion of income. The compromise was thrashed out in the early hours of yesterday morning in the conciliation committee of the two houses of the federal parliament, the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The lower levels of unemployment benefit will still come into effect next year. The deal also means that social assistance, the lowest level of social security for those who do not qualify for unemployment benefit, will be increased by 2 per cent per year for the next three years, instead of being frozen from mid-1994. Another concession is that so-called 'bad weather money' for building workers laid off in the winter will be reinstated, but limited to just two months in mid-winter. The planned cancellation had caused massive demonstrations by building workers. Mr Waigel said that the 16 states, a majority of which are ruled by SPD-led governments, had succeeded in protecting their own spending plans at the expense of the federal government.</p>

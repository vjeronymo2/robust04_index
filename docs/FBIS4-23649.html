			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban June 11 SAPA -- Home Affairs Minister and  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi says  he's vexed by alleged African National Congress attempts to  drive a wedge between himself and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.  Addressing thousands of IFP supporters at a "peace and victory"  rally in Durban's Umlazi Township on Saturday [11 June], Mr  Buthelezi said in spite of this there was no rift between  himself and the monarch. But, he said, referring to recent ANC  attempts to court the king, members of the Zulu royal family had  succeeded in "step by step making the king beholden to the ANC".  And he warned opponents and elements in the royal household  that the IFP controlled the king's purse strings.    Mr Buthelezi said since the IFP election victory in  KwaZulu/Natal, the ANC was determined to break Inkatha in its  strongholds, and had tried to "ingratiate itself with his  majesty". "One of the ways in which they are attempting to do so  is to worm their way into the confidence of his majesty the king  and the royal house."    The IFP leader claimed that wherever he went he heard  rumblings from Zulu people about the extent to which members of  the royal family had succeeded in assisting ANC attempts to woo  the king, including "clandestine meetings" between the monarch  and KwaZulu/Natal ANC leaders. "There are members of the royal  family who are working hard to give the ANC what it wants -- an  entry to the royal family and access to his majesty."    Among the "successes" of certain members of royalty, was to  have King Zwelithini's bodyguards replaced by SA [South African]  National Defence Force members, including perceived ANC  soldiers. "No Zulu could ever have predicted, even a year ago,  that it would be people perceived as MK (Umkhonto We Sizwe)  [Spear of the Nation; ANC armed wing] who guard his majesty's  safety in Nongoma."    Mr Buthelezi also said the ANC had "bandied about" promises  to the king, but didn't specify them.    He said he had spent his political life committed to the  Zulu  king, and was responsible for "fighting the battles for his  majesty to gain the elevated position that history has  bequeathed to Zulu kings". Recently, he added, close to R7  million [rand] had been spent on royal palaces, over R2 million  on labourers, and R500,000 given to the king in farming  assistance. "To date we have actually spent over R4 million on  securing his majesty's personal position and on supplementary  requirements around his person," he said. Mr Buthelezi said  this was "the people's money...gladly spent", in favour of  funding for schools, hospitals and health, because "Zulu people  live for their king". But, he warned: "In future the very large  budgets that his majesty will need for the maintenance of his  courts and his kingly way of life, can only come from the  KwaZulu/Natal Provincial Legislature, which the IFP controls".    The IFP leader emphasised there was no rift between himself  and the king, but added that "from the looks of things, there  are some mischief makers who are trying to brew something".    "I find it very vexing," Mr Buthelezi said, "and difficult  to  accept the fact that Natal leaders of the ANC are engaged in a  game of creating a rift between me and his majesty. It is  difficult for me to understand exactly what these ANC leaders in  Natal are up to."    ANC leaders in KwaZulu/Natal could not immediately be  reached  to comment on the allegations.    It is understood that King Zwelithini recently missed an IFP  election victory celebration in favour of a meeting with  provincial ANC leaders.    Informed sources say that despite Mr Buthelezi's veiled  threats, the king's budget is apparently controlled by President  Nelson Mandela's office until provincial powers have been worked  out, and even afterwards, the budget may still come from the  national government.    Earlier on Saturday Mr Buthelezi congratulated about 4,000  IFP supporters, gathered at Umlazi's King Zwelithini Stadium,  for their election victory. But, he urged them to immediately  press ahead and strengthen the IFP. He said the party should be  prepared to fight an election before the government's five-year  tenure was up. He predicted the ANC wouldn't be able to deliver  its election promises and would "resort to calling a new  election before the rot sets in too deeply to discredit them and  to prejudice their chances of winning another election".</p>

And anyway, where was he  from, this homeless man of Moscow by the name of Shabunov, an  older man, 40 years of age according to his passport? When no  pulse could be determined, pressure dropped and convulsions  increases, he was immediately subjected to resuscitation.  Cholera means--forgive me for the coarse but necessary  details--endless diarrhea, which dehydrates the body so much  that end come in just a few hours. It looks like the doctors  were able to bring Shabunov back. But in Kaspiysk (Dagestan),  they weren't able to save the patient. And in the republic  hospital in Makhachkala, they are not caring for a 4-month  infant with the same diagnosis. Just in July and August of this  year 17 patients and vibrio carriers were registered; these  cases are associated with cholera imported from India, Pakistan  and Turkey. We'll talk about imports a little later. In the  meantime persons returning from shopping tours with their  ``acquisition'' have homes in very many places--Nizhniy  Novgorod, Krasnodar, Makhachkala, Naberezhnyye Chelny.    And besides cholera, typhoid fever, which we haven't seen in  our country for a long time, has made its appearance.  Eighty-seven persons were hospitalized for it in Volgodonsk,  Rostov Oblast. Specialists from the State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight limited their information to  the indicated cases. But the geography of the infection and the  list of patients are more extensive. We possess data indicating  that local medical workers in Astrakhan and Barnaul discovered  anthrax agents in food products. Some people have already  contracted the disease. The situation with this infection  recalls especially clearly the ``Solovyev effect'' with which we  began our discussion--a doctor's behavior in extreme  circumstances. A peasant family in the Astrakhan town of  Dianovka was forced to slaughter a sick calf. The local  veterinarian could be diagnosed with a lack of knowledge or  conscience, but he deemed the meet to be fit for consumption. A  few days later those who slaughtered the animal and sold its  meat heard of their unconditional diagnosis--anthrax. A  quarantine was announced in Dianovka. And in another town as  well--Tundrikha, Altay Kray. Here also they slaughtered a sick  animal and sold the meat uninspected. Efforts are being made to  save the sick. Cattle, sheep and horses are undergoing mass  vaccination. The financially strapped sanitary-epidemiological  oversight agency contained the epidemic of the terrible disease.  But in this case millions of rubles were spent on medicines,  vaccinations of animals, and disinfection.    The term ``negligence'' is often applied to trading in  uninspected infected meat. But does that tell the whole story?  Do we say anything about the social causes that encourage some  to sell and others to buy meat that is now as precious as gold?  It's probably a little cheaper when it doesn't bear a seal of  inspection. Why not risk your health if you didn't have to buy  it, and you got it free?    When misfortune comes to our door, contrary to popular  wisdom  we lock it, and rather tightly. But aren't we acting a little  too late? After all many things can and must be foreseen. The  same goes for imported infections. Given the present openness of  borders, and the scale of goods traffic, we should have adopted  the corresponding law protecting Russian Federation territory  from importation of diseases by people, animals and plants long  ago (most other countries have such laws). But in our country  this law just now being written in response to a government  decree, which was itself adopted in May, just before lightning  struck.    Nor is it any news that migration and refugees represent a  potential source of all kinds of diseases. And of course, we are  well aware of the general ecological situation, particularly  when it comes to water, about which even our recently initiated  ``Retsept'' subsection has written on several occasions. We've  already cited a figure: Half (!) of Russia's inhabitants drink  water that does not meet hygienic requirement, water that is  simply unfit to drink. And this after all is the primary source  of intestinal infection, cholera in particular. As it became  known, the person that died in Kaspiysk fell ill because he  drank untreated water. Accidents with water supply lines have  grown more frequent, and water treatment has worsened due to the  absence of reagents and disinfectants. The epidemiological  service is still managing to somehow keep the situation under  control through constant laboratory monitoring and continual  inspections. But it no longer as the money for reagents, or to  pay for electric power.    All of these are the misfortunes of civilized cities. But  throughout Russia there are thousands of towns without water  purification facilities or sewage systems. In the meantime  cholera vibrio was detected in open-air water basins last year,  and is being detected currently as well. Such that the  biblically simple and so ancient a truth has real meaning to the  Russian Federation today: Never drink untreated water! And wash  fruits, vegetables and your hands thoroughly. The drowning must  save themselves, as the saying goes.    The danger of infection is becoming especially acute under  the conditions of our uncontrolled trade. In our impassable mud.  We've written about this in ``Retsept'' in the past. Let me add  that sometimes it seems that sanitary oversight doesn't see what  we see. But at our request they gave the figures for fines  imposed for dirt and other violations: Last year--39,000 rubles,  and in one quarter of this year, R128,000. And this is  throughout all of Russia, even with the current rate of  inflation. Sanitary oversight is of course trying, but violators  are hardly frightened by its only weapon--fines.    I am certain that the situation requires new forces, other  approaches. It's strange that in our democratic times we have  lost the truly democratic institutions that operated and did  good things in times past. Public citizen's movements occur in  many countries. Were our active common citizens to come together  under public health physicians locally, they could clean up our  streets and stores under their leadership. And with the support  of a local peace officer (at least one, for insurance!). It  would be a sin for the public health physician to earn bruises  for defending our health. But things like this have happened.    And one other thing. We have justly condemned the method of  struggle that had been so fashionable in years past: A call to  heroism is usually made when there is no order or system. Still,  the actions of doctors today are in fact heroic, they are  restraining the epidemiological situation at the same time that  in Moscow there are only just a few kilograms of special soda  for intravenous infusions, and when there are not enough salt  solutions and other--let me emphasize that!--of the simplest,  most elementary resources.    You can't reduce the number of persons without permanent  residence (it's increasing) or eliminate migration of refugees  overnight. But all of these people simply have to undergo  disinfection procedures. The older generation can remember the  medical checkpoints that were present in all Moscow terminals.  But today transport workers sadly admit that they can't, there's  no money. A couple were recently added to the only other one in  the city. Not much. And anyway, how are you going to force all  of the homeless to undergo personal cleansing?    Cholera and mushrooms don't seem to be related. But  mushrooms  are another misfortune hanging over our heads. Once again, like  last summer, people are dying from mushroom poisoning. In Tambov  Oblast there were 46 victims and 8 fatalities. In Voronezh  Oblast there were 52 poisonings and 1 fatality. In Lipetsk--23  victims, 4 fatalities. A dubious theory about radionuclides,  pesticides and heavy metals trapped by mushrooms, obviously  having its origins in the widely read writing of Veronika  Mavrikiyevna, is still circulating among the people since last  year. All last winter scientists conducted research on the  subject, but science has been unable to confirm Mavrikiyevna's  theory. Everything is simpler and more frightening: People died  and are now dying from toxin produced by the death cup. And  there's more. A selective inspection revealed those same death  cups in the one out of every 8-10 baskets brought home this  summer mushroom gatherers. Specialists are sounding the alarm. A  guide for mushroom gatherers drawn up by the Scientific Research  Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy of Medical  Sciences is published below at their request.    And in conclusion I would like to address readers who may be  shocked by the expression ``infection [zaraza]'' I have been  using. We have forgotten this ancient, age-old term, and  substituted it by the foppish euphemism ``infection  [infektsiya].'' However, I think that the harsher word  ``zaraza'' fits the alarming situation in Russia better today.  [passage omitted: Safety precautions for mushroom gatherers]</p>

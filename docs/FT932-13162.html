			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Sulzer, Ebara seek pumps deal SULZER, the Swiss engin-eering group, is continuing discussions with Ebara of Japan on a potentially important joint venture in pumps - more than a year after the two began co-operation talks. Sulzer is one of Europe's largest producer of pumps, and Ebara is the dominant Japanese producer. A deal would represent a further step in the rationalisation and globalisation of the world pump industry. Other big players include Weir of the UK, KSB of Germany and the Ingersoll-Dresser Pump joint venture in the US. Dr Fritz Fahrni, Sulzer president and chief executive, said in London that he hoped a deal could have been concluded by the end of last year. He would not say why the talks were dragging on, or what form any co-operation would take. It appears that a global combination of the two pump businesses has not been ruled out. Sulzer has pump factories at Leeds in England, Portland in Oregon, and in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Mexico and South Africa. Profits for the pump division, part of the Sulzer Escher Wyss group of businesses, are not disclosed, but improved significantly last year. One reason has been a strong turnround to profitability at the Leeds plant, which employs 450 people and lost Pounds 1.3m (Dollars 2m) in 1990. Dr Fahrni believes there is still room for further improvement in the pump division's profits, which could be aided by a tie-up with Ebara. He disclosed that Sulzer was to retain and develop its Thermtec valves and control systems division for at least two years, following the collapse in February of its sale to IMI, the British industrial group. The business was non-core, he said, but could be damaged by any immediate attempt to find a new purchaser.</p>

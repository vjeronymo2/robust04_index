Such  a political move complies with the requirements of the Council  of Europe and NATO regarding the control that should be exerted  by civilian society over the armed forces; however, the move was  made in the context of a domestic political situation marked by  the issue of replacing certain persons in the government team.  What were the foreign and domestic factors that led to the  appointment of the "civilian" Gheorghe Tinca as head of the  National Defense Ministry?    [Tinca] In other countries it is not unusual to have  civilians lead their defense ministries. However, in our  country, according to our traditions -- and history confirms it  is a tradition -- we have always had a military person run our  defense. But why did they appoint a civilian as head of the  Ministry of National Defense now? Of course, we should not  overlook the need for our country to adjust to international  standards; however, that adjustment is not done automatically  and in an unconditioned way, but rather by observing our  national characteristics and interests. Besides the need to  adjust to international standards, the appointment of a civilian  as minister of national defense is even more important for the  evolution, in a broader sense, of Romanian society. This  evolution presupposes a different kind of harmonization of  Romania's state institutions, among which the armed forces, as a  fundamental pillar, play an important role. Constitutional  states presuppose the existence of open societies; of course,  the opening of society does not mean leaving the state to be  blown away by the wind, or doing away with the borders, state  institutions, and so on. That opening means -- in contrast to  our former state ideology, which was active but stiff, and this  finally led to its blocking -- that a new framework ought to be  set up, in accordance with certain criteria elaborated on the  basis of pluralism, to support that evolution. In a word, I am  talking about the efforts made to modernize Romania, the  Romanian state, and this is the context within which the  appointment of a civilian as head of the armed forces should be  viewed.    Our integration within the Euro-Atlantic structures is not  taking place because the wind is now blowing from a difference  direction, but rather because it offers real chances to  modernize our country and return to normality in our economic,  social, and political life. Despite the difficulties caused by  transition, the Ministry of National Defense has achieved  important things on the road of reform and those efforts will be  continued within the framework of the Partnership for Peace  concluded with NATO. Personally, I intend to continue the  process of modernizing our armed forces and harmonizing them  with our other institutions, and, if I can, to contribute to the  furthering of that process.    As a matter of fact I believe that under the current  circumstances it serves the interests of the army to have a  civilian as defense minister. Being a fundamental institution  of the Romanian state -- a law-governed country, in which the  separation of powers is precisely established by our  Constitution -- the ministry of defense has to participate in  the dialogue that is specific for pluralistic states. At the  same time the armed forces ought to concentrate on their  specific mission. The presence of a civilian at the leadership  of the ministry makes it possible for the military to  concentrate on their profession and relieves them from having to  deal with a number of things, in which the army -- as it turned  out -- should not be involved. In this way civilian ministers  can better defend and maintain the prestige of the army in the  eyes of public opinion.    [Petrean] You have taken over the leadership of the National  Defense Ministry in a dynamic, but also difficult international  context, and that also goes for our national security. What are  your "tactical" priorities?    [Tinca] When talking about national security, many people  think solely of the army. There are times, when the army really  plays the leading role; however, there are other times, when  diplomacy does. In my opinion, the decisive role is always  belongs to economy. In the current context, besides the  importance of the economy, I think we are witnessing times when  diplomacy and defense policy should merge in a singular effort  to ensure the security of the country; both the armed forces and  diplomacy ought to be in a vigilant state.    [Petrean] How do you assess the process of Romania's Euro-  Atlantic integration? What trump cards do you think we are  holding in view of the implementation of the ideas of our  partnership with NATO, which presupposes a certain degree of  compatibility both in the structure and the equipment of the  armed forces?    [Tinca] Our trump cards are numerous and important. The  first is our country's geographic position, which is a  fundamental asset; that position is not merely important for us  and this region, but also for the whole of Europe, and in a  broader approach, even for the non-European areas neighboring  the continent.    Our second trump is economic, and I am referring especially  to Romania's industry. It is true, our industry was conceived  in a way that later proved to be mistaken; it also needs to be  re-equipped. But the existence of our industry is a fact. Well  before 1969 Romania was already covering the largest part of its  needs in defense equipment from its own sources and -- from this  point of view -- it was greatly independent.    There is yet another trump card, about which we talk a lot,  although we do not seem to be much convinced about its value:  the human factor. There are 23 million Romanians -- not to  mention the ones living outside our borders -- who can read and  write; there are 23 million Romanians who were involved in  immense efforts, even if some of those efforts were made to  achieve projects that later proved to be lacking viability. Let  us not forget that all those projects were completed by experts  and those experts still exist.    [Petrean] Our Euro-Atlantic integration is one of the very  few issues regarding which there is almost complete consensus  among our political forces. How do you assess your future  cooperation with the political parties?    [Tinca] I believe that the phase we have already gone  through was more simple than the one that follows, because both  the country's integration within the European Union, and the one  within Euro-Atlantic structures will now enter the phase of  deeds. Declarations, manifestations of political will are very  important and serious things, and quite often it is not very  easy to adopt them. However, in the coming stage we will have  to take a great number of practical measures which may demand  certain sacrifice on behalf of one part of society in order to  achieve progress in another. There will be political interests  that probably will not always coincide.    That is why in the future stage, on the basis of the  existing  consensus regarding our country's Euro-Atlantic integration, it  is very important that the bearers of various political  interests -- the parties -- should continue their dialogue and  cooperation. It will be a process of permanent negotiations, in  which all will have to set out from one principle, namely that  when all is said and done we all desire the same thing: the  modernization of Romania. I dare assume that the needs of the  armed forces will be given special attention, as this is an  issue of national interest.    [Petrean] You are a career diplomat, directly experienced in  issues such as relations with various international bodies,  problems of international security, arms control, and  disarmament. What are the advantages and, if any, the  disadvantages of your experience as a diplomat who has now  become minister of defense?    [Tinca] My 28-year experience in diplomacy means a plus in  certain domains: First, diplomacy is the science of knowing how  to conduct negotiations, and that is a "school" that we  politicians should all have graduated from. Diplomacy teaches  one how to be flexible, but not in a gratuitous way, but rather  as a method to achieve a general goal, such as, in my case now,  the security of our country. Besides this, diplomacy is an  experience that also lends one the ability to really "feel"  one's partners, and a profession that furthers one's ability to  behave calmly, tactfully, and wisely. Common sense, honesty, and  loyalty are other such positive traits that may be added the  ones I mentioned before.    On the other hand, I believe that it is also a handicap for  me. The nature of my diplomatic experience (in security and  disarmament issues) makes me able to perceive the entire volume  of the things I ought to achieve, and, considering the  dimensions of those tasks, I feel overwhelmed to a certain  extent. On top of that, I am the sort of person who always  tries to achieve perfection.    I am certain that I will be well understood -- even if not  right away, but very soon, I hope -- by our officers' and  command corps. I am also convinced that my good intentions, good  faith, and sense of responsibility for the fundamental interests  of our country will be fully perceived, and that our work  relations will be based on my respect for the armed forces, on  perfect sincerity, and honesty. It is to my real satisfaction  and it makes me optimistic that -- having to deal with the army  -- these relations will be definitely manly ones, which I have  always liked.</p>

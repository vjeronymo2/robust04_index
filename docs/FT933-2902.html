			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook board to take big pay cut DIRECTORS of Tiphook, the lossmaking container rental company, yesterday told a highly critical annual meeting that they intended to take pay cuts of between 25 and 30 per cent this year. The statement came in response to persistent questions over directors' pay and contracts, accounting policies and the performance of the heavily-indebted company's shares, which have fallen from 380p at the beginning of April to last night's 249p. One private shareholder asked why, when 'most shareholders have lost a substantial amount of money on their shares, the directors felt it appropriate for them to take a large increase in salary?' His question was greeted with an enthusiastic 'hear, hear' from the 45-strong gathering in London's Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall. A second shareholder drew attention to the difference in remuneration of Pounds 4m, including pension payments, for the five executive directors and less than Pounds 100,000 for the four non-executives. Tiphook has come under fire recently following revelations that directors received pay increases in a year when it plunged into net losses of Pounds 66.5m, against a retained profit of Pounds 31.7m in 1992. Mr Robert Montague, chairman, received a pay rise from Pounds 842,000 to Pounds 851,000. Mr Montague said the pay issue was being dealt with. 'We do not want to put ourselves in the position where shareholders were dissatisfied with the company,' he said. Mr Rupert Hambro, head of the remuneration committee and recently appointed deputy chairman, said salaries would be between 25 and 30 per cent lower in the current year. It is also believed the committee is proposing directors' contracts of just one year. Mr Montague was clearly exasperated with shareholders' persistence on the subject, however, and abruptly asked them to 'leave it and get on' with the meeting. Shareholders were also concerned over accounting changes. Tiphook has previously blamed factors associated with the move to dollar reporting for the exceptional charges of Pounds 77.3m, resulting in pre-tax losses of Pounds 21.8m. Mr Montague said the change was due to the strong increase in US shareholders. About 60 per cent of the group is held in the US. The critical atmosphere eased somewhat when the chairman, asked to offer his vision for Tiphook's future, visibly relaxed for the first time in the 90 minute meeting. Tiphook, the world's number two in container rental, was well placed to grow in a market estimated to double by the end of the century, he said.</p>

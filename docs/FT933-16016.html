			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / S&amp;N hit by Pounds 14m charge for shake-up THE Pounds 13.9m cost of a shake-up in its beer division reduced annual profits at Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the UK brewing and leisure group. The division's reorganisation, already announced, will entail the loss of 600 jobs, 10 per cent of its workforce. Group pre-tax profits fell 13 per cent to Pounds 192.5m. The company made Pounds 6.2m less on property disposals. Although trading conditions continued to be difficult, turnover rose marginally from Pounds 1.49bn to Pounds 1.51bn in the year to May 2. Excluding exceptional items, profits were down 4 per cent. Sir Alick Rankin, chairman, said: 'It is too early in our current year to point to any real change in demand levels or willingness by customers to spend more freely, but we are convinced that some momentum is building up.' Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive, said that while the UK beer market had declined by 2 per cent, S&amp;N's focus on strong brands had enabled the group to hold sales and increase market share. Bad debts of Pounds 13.9m, compared with Pounds 12.6m, contributed to a fall in the beer division's operating profits from Pounds 99m to Pounds 92m. Mr Stewart said beer sales to trade outlets were down 3 per cent, but take-home sales rose by 8 per cent, with brands such as McEwan's Export and Beck's performing strongly. Good results by Center Parcs helped the leisure division increase operating profits by 4.6 per cent to Pounds 78m, although the decline of the UK holiday centre market last summer meant that Pontins 'experienced very difficult trading conditions'. Center Parcs, after a difficult period last July and August, finished the year with occupancy rates of more than 90 per cent. Most of the Pounds 100m invested in the leisure division was spent on the new Center Parcs development at Chaumont in the Loire Valley, which will open this month. The retail division saw operating profits fall 5.1 per cent to Pounds 54.1m. A property revaluation had reduced retail's book values by Pounds 45m, but this was more than offset by a surplus on the group's leisure properties of Pounds 81m. Cash outflow before financing was Pounds 35m, mainly because of the Chaumont spending. Gearing increased from 23 to 29 per cent, largely due to exchange rates. Diluted earnings per share, including exceptionals, fell from 33.9p to 30.8p. A final dividend of 11.07p (from 10.59p) gives a total for the year of 16.83p (from 16.1p), an increase of 4.5 per cent.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  brought flying corps of scores of Pacific-based warplanes  including F-15s, FA-18s and AV-8s and staged air war exercises  against the North in the sky above South Korea on May 29 and 30,  making long-distance flights from the overseas bases to the U.S.  Air Force bases in South Korea and vice versa, according to  military sources.    On May 30 formations of Japan-based pursuit-assault planes  and vtol assault planes held a surprise strike exercise against  the North in the sky above Yongwol, Pyongchang and Asan Bay,  South Korea, in coordination with fighter-bombers, assault  planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes of the U.S.  Air Force in South Korea.    The continued reckless war gambles show well how desperately  the U.S. imperialists are working to increase their combat  capacity in a war against the North.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Acorn Computer falls 38% to Pounds 1.58m Correction (published 27th April 1991) appended to this article. CONFUSION OVER new legislation concerning school management and uncertainty over the effects of the community charge have combined to take the shine off 1990 results at Acorn Computer. Turnover at Pounds 45.5m was marginally up on the Pounds 44.9m recorded the previous year, while pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.53m in 1989 to Pounds 1.58m in 1990, a fall of 38 per cent. Earnings per ordinary share declined to 2.4p (3.8p). Acorn, based in Cambridge and in which Olivetti of Italy has a majority shareholding, is a main supplier of school computers, reckoning to have at least one of its machines in 85 per cent of junior and secondary schools. Purchasing patterns in schools have changed as a result of the introduction of local management, and uncertainties over the level of funds available because of the introduction of the community charge have slowed spending in what is usually an unspectacular but reliable sector. Acorn's operating profits last year rose to Pounds 2m compared with Pounds 1.3m in 1989. However, the company sold intellectual property rights in its advanced reduced instruction set processor chips for Pounds 1.5m to a new company established between Acorn, Apple Computer and LSI Logic of the US. In 1990 the company also made provision of Pounds 900,000 against bad debts due from a customer, resulting in a net exceptional profit of Pounds 561,000. For the 1989 year the company recorded an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.2m through selling an option on sales and marketing rights to a particular product to Olivetti. Interest charges accounted for Pounds 995,000 in 1990 compared with previous income of Pounds 9,000 reflecting increases in working capital as the recession in the latter part of the year began to have an effect. The directors said that 53 per cent of all computers delivered to UK schools in 1990 were Acorn, with the new BBC A3000 and Archimedes machines outselling the earlier technology Master series by two to one. Correction (published 27th April 1991). VLSI, US-based semiconductor supplier, is the third partner in a new company set up with microcomputer companies Acorn and Apple and not LSI Logic as reported yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA)--The final round of  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations began here today to put the  final touches on the general agreement on th e implementation of  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    The Palestinian delegation is led by Major General  'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, because Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President  'Arafat's political adviser, is currently in Tunis. The Israeli  delegation is led by Amnon Shahaq, the assistant chief of staff,  who arrived in Cairo earlier today.    Palestinian delegation member Khalid al-Qidrah stated that  the two delegations will complete drafting the general  agreement. He said: We are about to finish. I think that we  will finish everything in time.    Sources close to the negotiations said that over the past  two  days the Palestinian and Israeli delegations have narrowed the  differences on all points a great deal. The sources said that  the two delegations will draft some paragraphs in the agreement  but they are still under discussion.    They said that with regard to the entry of the Palestinian  police into Gaza and Jericho, the Israeli delegation thinks that  an initial group of 25 policemen can enter on the day of the  signing. They added that 1,000 to 1,500 policemen will enter  the territories within one week of the signing. The remainder  will follow. The sources explained that the number of  Palestinian policemen agreed upon is 9,000.    The sources said that the Palestinian delegation thinks  there  is no sense in the entry of an initial small group, and that the  whole Palestinian police force should enter the autonomous areas  during the first week after the signing and after the Israeli  withdrawal, which will begin the day after Palestinian president  Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin sign the  Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement.    The source said that on Tuesday 'Arafat and Rabin will  discuss two points, namely the size of Jericho's area and the  presence of a Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge.    One opinion is that the area of Jericho should be 57 square  kilometers, the sources said, adding that Israel will also agree  to the presence of an Israeli policeman at the crossing point  when the Palestinians enter and an inconspicuous Israeli  observer to intervene whenever there is suspicion regarding  those who cross into the autonomous areas.</p>

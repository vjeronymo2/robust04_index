			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The New Israeli Maneuver,"  TISHRIN writes: The secrets behind the Israeli proposal, which  carries the fingerprints of Yitzhaq Rabin, to hold a plebiscite  on the future of the Golan Heights are gradually coming to  light. The proposal aims at allowing Israel to usurp part of  the Golan Heights. This is totally rejected by Syria.    The paper explains that Syria though President al-Asad  before  and during the [Geneva] summit stressed that the Golan Heights  will never be a subject of bargaining and that peace hinges on  the return of the entire Syrian territory.    The paper stresses that Syria is not at all interested in  the  plebiscite and that the Israelis have no right to hold a  plebiscite in an occupied Syrian territory. Such a measure  marks a flagrant encroachment on international law and the  charters and resolutions of the United Nations. Israel also has  no right to use the law of the jungle to annul the facts of  history and geography and the principles of international law.  Regardless of how long it lasts, occupation will never annul  Syria's sovereignty over its territory and the identity of the  Golan Heights.    The paper explains that Israel is resorting to further  intransigence and maneuvering by proposing the plebiscite. The  paper notes that the Golan Heights belong to the Syrian people  and not to the Zionist settlers. They are an inseparable part  of Syria and, in all cases, the Golan Heights are not  negotiable, and not a single Syrian will accept to relinquish an  inch of them.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: The world welcomed the outcome  of the Geneva summit and agreed on the positive, constructive  Syrian role and Syria's complete response to the requirements of  peace. Israel, in the meantime, is working on sabotaging what  was achieved and at hindering the efforts in order to return the  region to despair and bitterness. Only Israel should be blamed  for this.</p>

Reheating  Produces Maximum Efficiency"; first paragraph isan introduction]    [Text] 23 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT-TL)--So-called  combined-cycle powerplants presently offer the most efficient  technology for the considerate-of-the-environment "conversion to  energy" of fossil fuels. Plants presently in service are today  achieving efficiency of about 53 percent. An international team  of ABB engineers has now succeeded, by means of a new kind of  gas turbine design, in around two years ofdevelopment work, in  markedly pushing up the previous optimum value forcombined-cycle  plants. The thermal efficiency of the new gas turbines (the  ratio of the input fuel energy to the effective output) is 38  percent in solo operation and reaches over 58 percent in the  combined-cycle process. This means anaround 10 percent lowering  of specific fuel costs. Carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to  the same extent. The most powerful version of Th)0*0*0*00T the  new turbine generation (type GT26) attains 240 MW and  accordinglyhas to be the most powerful gas turbine in the world  at present. A 165-MW version is being offered for the 60-Hz  market. The gas turbine is the key component of a combined-cycle  power plant: In the gas-steam process, an approximately  1200-degree-Celsius hot compressed fuel-air mixture leaves the  combustion chamber and sets the gas turbine rotating, which  generates electrical energy in a coupled generator. Steam is  generated by the over 600-degree-Celsius hot exhaust gases in a  downstream waste-heat boiler, and this steam in turn impels the  steam turbine. While the steam turbine process has largely been  exhausted technicallytoday, gas turbines still offer potential  for development. While the efficiency of a gas turbine--of the  then BBC installed in 1939 in Neuchatel in Switzerland--was  around 15 percent, the most powerful of the turbines in service  today reaches around 35 percent. The reason: Thanks to new kinds  of materials and optimized blade and vane cooling, in the  decades that have gone by, turbine inlet temperatures have been  able to be raised from around 800 degrees to over 1200 degrees  Celsius. Improvements are possible, even yet, by raising the  inlet temperature further. However, substantial outlays have to  be made for this that would result in only fractions of a  percentage point. Therefore, the engineers at ABB banked  alternatively on higher compression and two-stage combustion  instead of on higher temperatures. The principal component of  the new design is a multistage combustion chamber--the term  sequential combustion is also used--in which the more highly  compressed air is utilized twice in two turbine stages. Two  combustion chambers are connected in series for this "reheating  technology." The air drawn in leaves the compressor at about 30  bars (double the norm thus far in power plant turbines) and is  swirled intensively with the fuel and ignited in the combustion  chamber of the high-pressure stage, and drives the single-stage  high-pressure-component turbine. So-called low-NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  burners get to be used here. The cooled, expanded, but still  oxygen-rich mixture is led into the low-pressure combustion  chamber, which operates with similar burner equipment. There  fuel is again supplied and swirled and the mixture is ignited  automatically and drives the low-pressure turbine stages. The  pressure ratios are in keeping with those of conventional gas  turbines (15 bars). An especially lean fuel-air mixture having a  very high percentage of oxygen is burned in the first annular  combustion chamber. The first turbine stage consumes  approximately 60 percent of the total fuel required. The air for  combustion is compressed beforehand in a 30-to-1 ratio in the  compressor by the 22 flow-optimized compressor stages and  arrives at the low-NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  burners through airflow  ducts. There the compressed air is mixed with precisely measured  quantities of fuel into an intensively swirling stream before  the fuel-air mixture ignitesin the combustion chamber.The  especially intensive swirling of the fuel-air mixture is  achieved by means of the offset conical half-shells of the  burners. The special geometry ensures steady independently  "standing" flames in front of the burner members. A total of 30  of these low-NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  burners are distributed uniformly  over the annular combustion chamber's circumference. Their  simple design, in combination with the uniform distribution of  the flames, reduces thermal stresses both in the combustion  chamber and in the turbine. After ignition, the combustion gases  flow through the single-stage high-pressure turbine and release  part of their energy here before they are led further into the  low-pressure combustion chamber. Advanced blade and vane cooling  and the especially uniform temperature distribution--resulting  from this annular combustion chamber's geometry--ensure the long  life of the high-pressure turbine stage. In the second  combustion chamber stage too, the still oxygen-rich combustion  gases are led into premix gas burners that operate according to  the same principle as the burners in the high-pressure section.  The air is mixed intensively with the remaining fuel (about 40  percent). Here too no small flame retention baffles or similar  components are required that are subject to heavy wear. This  contributes to the machines' high availability and lowers  maintenance costs. The cooling air is used in the combustion  chambers almost totally as preheated air for combustion, so that  cooling and efficiency are optimized equally. The long design of  the second combustion chamber aids chemicalNO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  reduction: A great part of the nitrogen oxides transported by  the combustion gases is eliminated in the second  stage.Advanced-design gas turbines and combined-cycle power  plants have to demonstrate both excellent full-load values and  good partial-load behavior. The advantages of multistage  combustion chambers, relating to their design, have their full  effect here. For one thing, only the first turbine [as written]  stage is ignited at start-up. When quarterload is reached, the  combustion gases from the high-pressure section have the  temperature at which the second combustion chamber can be  ignited and slowly flared up. The low-pressure-section turbine  is consequently slowly heated when the machines start. The  maximum turbine inlet temperature is reached not until full load  here, but at quarter load in the high-pressure turbine.  Controllable compressor stages aid steady partial-load behavior.  No switching process or control action whatsoever are required  during start-up. Besides, this technology involves the  capability of using oil as fuel if gas is not available, with  comparable output data.The design offers additional advantages  besides a substantial achievement leap in efficiency: Because  the turbine inlet temperature was raised only slightly  considering the turbine, the engineers were able to fall back on  known materials and proven processes. The substantial  improvements in the matters of energy conversion and emission  characteristics were realized by intelligently combining already  proven techniques. The higher compression in the first turbine  stage enables high specific output with a compact design. Thus,  with this design one achieves power density not previously  considered possible, and the mechanical loading of rotating  parts is also relatively low. And the environment benefits too:  Compared with a conventional gas turbine (efficiency of around  34.5 percent), gas consumption is reducedby 33,000 tons per year  in 6000 hours of operation, and 90,000 tons of the greenhouse  gas carbon dioxide do not form at all. The lower fuel costs  contrast with comparable investment costs per megawatt. There is  still development potential remaining because of the  disassociation of turbine inlet temperature and efficiency. An  order has already come in from the United States: The Jersey  CentralPower &amp; Light Company ordered the sister model the GT  24,  designed for the 60-Hz market. This turbine, which has an output  of 165 MW, is to go into service in July 1996. The researchers  in their work were able to build on know-how in multistage  combustion chambers and two-stage gas turbines gained by the  engineers of the former BBC: Engineers at the Beznau power  station in Switzerland implemented as early as 1948 a  similar--though technologically very extravagant--two-shaft  design. A total of 25 such units were installed, having outputs  of between 20 and 25 MW. And a single-shaft two-stage unit  having two silo-type [large diameter] combustion chambers  connected in series was implemented in 1978 at the 290-MW  Huntorf air storage gas turbine power plant northwest of Bremen.  The Huntorf power plant is still in service today, just as are  nine two-shaft units.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Management: Revving up for an east German drive - Ambitious plans by Volkswagen and Opel Volkswagen and Opel have a clear aim in building their new car assembly plants in east Germany - they are trying to beat the Japanese at their own game. Japanese methods of lean production, cutting out wasted time and materials and trying to keep costs as low as possible, have swept the motor world. Other car companies have been forced to adopt the Japanese practices as best they can or risk being pushed aside by the competition. Germany's unification has provided what VW and Opel - owned by General Motors of the US - both see as a golden opportunity. VW is spending nearly DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) on its new plant and Opel DM1bn, with around a third of the money coming from investment grants and subsidies. When finished, the plants will be among the world's most modern. Both are being erected near former east German car production sites. But while the old Wartburg plant in Eisenach turned out 70,000 cars a year with 9,000 workers, Opel will produce around 150,000 of its new Astra family cars with just over 2,000 people at its new site on the edge of the historic town. The approach will be new for east Germany, where the old state-owned companies made most of their own components and equipment. In modern car plants, the aim is to keep the level of vertical integration - the work actually done in the plant - as low as possible, with most components being provided by suppliers. At the VW plant at Mosel in Saxony, which will turn out 250,000 Golf family cars a year, only 25 per cent of the components will be made in house. The plant, employing 6,000 people, will comprise mainly a press shop (which Opel Eisenach will not have initially), body shop, paint shop, and assembly of components made elsewhere (including other parts of the VW group) like engines, axles, and gearboxes. In west Germany, VW's level of vertical integration is 40 per cent. Just-in-time delivery is vital to the process. Both the VW and Opel plants will have a minimum of storage space. Opel plans to have enough parts next to the Eisenach assembly line for two hours of operation, with components for several more hours stored elsewhere on site. Because suppliers of seats and bumpers will be nearby, these will not have to be stored at all. Opel has learned much from GM's experience in its joint ventures with Japanese motor concerns in the US and Canada. Tom LaSorda, the confident young Canadian who heads Opel Eisenach, says it takes most European car plants nearly 36 hours to turn out a new car. US companies need around 25 hours. He wants to reduce this to 20 hours or less in Eisenach. 'There's a plant in Japan that's at 13 hours, while Japanese plants in North America are at 18 or 19 hours or even lower, as are some in Europe,' says LaSorda. Opel and VW aim to be flexible enough to respond to changes in customer demands, by producing a wide variety of specifications and options, while lessening vulnerability to falling sales by employing as few people as possible. This, of course, increases the strain on suppliers to produce parts cheaply and deliver quickly. In times of industrial strife, it also makes plants vulnerable since they have minimal reserves of components. Eventually, Opel Eisenach hopes to reduce the time needed to complete an order from the parent company to around two weeks. These days, up to 10 weeks is common in Europe, but the pressure for change is increasing. LaSorda foresees more competition from the Japanese in Europe, where they are increasing their UK manufacturing presence. 'We have to conclude that they will be successful in Europe. If they are, we've got to be better than they are.'</p>

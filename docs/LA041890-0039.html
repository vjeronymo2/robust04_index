			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DAMEWORTH, NAJAR, CHUTE PICK COLLEGES  </P> <P> A high school distance runner, a power-hitting high school baseball player and  a junior college first baseman have made commitments to four-year schools.  </P> <P> Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High, one of the nation's most highly recruited  distance runners, signed a national letter of intent with the University of  Wisconsin on Sunday night.  </P> <P> San Fernando High's John Najar signed a letter of intent to play at Fresno  State and Glendale College first baseman Art Chute made an oral commitment to  attend Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Dameworth, the 1989 Kinney national cross-country champion, chose the Big Ten  Conference school over Oregon and Arizona of the Pacific 10.  </P> <P> "I was a little bit skeptical about going there because of the cold winters,"  said Dameworth, who won three consecutive state Division I cross-country  titles. "But when I went to visit, everything just clicked. The coaches and  athletes seemed to be really close. They all seem to be working toward the same  goal."  </P> <P> Wisconsin's cross-country tradition didn't hurt. The Badgers won three NCAA  titles (1982, '85 and '88) during the 1980s and finished in the top four seven  times.  </P> <P> Najar has slugged seven home runs and driven in 25 runs to lead the area's City  Section players, and, as a right-handed pitcher, he is 3-1 with a 2.52  earned-run average. He said that he was recruited as both a position player and  a pitcher.  </P> <P> Najar, who also received a scholarship offer from Cal State Northridge, is the  third area player to sign with Fresno State. Garret Anderson of Kennedy, an  outfielder, and Bob Kazmirski, a pitcher-shortstop from Agoura, also have  signed.  </P> <P> Chute, a sophomore from Temple City High, is batting .409 with 41 runs batted  in and a school-record 10 home runs at Glendale. He chose Fullerton over UC  Riverside.  </P></p>

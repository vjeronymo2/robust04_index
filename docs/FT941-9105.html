			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: St Modwen at Pounds 3.5m and expects growth Pre-tax profits at St Modwen Properties doubled to Pounds 3.5m in the year to November 30, compared with Pounds 1.71m. Mr Stanley Clarke, chairman, said that in the present year demand was buoyant for attractive properties and development profits were already ahead of the Pounds 890,000 (Pounds 1.45m) for the whole of 1992-93. He added that despite general sluggishness in tenant demand investment income surplus continued to grow. However, the shares slipped 3p yesterday, ending the day at 57p. The result was achieved in line with the company's policy of increasing investment income, which at Pounds 7.82m (Pounds 6.75m) now exceeds overheads, dividends and related tax. The annual rent roll rose 29 per cent to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 7.5m) following the purchase of two substantial retail properties in west and south-east London and progress in letting empty properties. Turnover fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 17m as a result of a fall in property development to Pounds 8.48m (Pounds 10.7m). Rental income, however, was higher at Pounds 8.33m (Pounds 7.11m). The pre-tax figure was helped by Pounds 758,000 (Pounds 415,000) profit on sale of investment properties. There was also a fall of Pounds 1.07m in the interest charge to Pounds 3.82m. Net assets per share improved from 35p to 39p over the year. There was an increase of Pounds 3.44m in the investment property portfolio following a valuation. Earnings per share doubled to 2.2p (1.1p). A final dividend of 0.7p is recommended for an increased total of 1p (0.6p).</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Observer: Unsheathed Bit of a puzzle. The one area of Britain's defence budget which seems to have escaped unscathed from the recent defence cuts is the provision of ceremonial swords. According to a written parliamentary answer from Nicholas Soames, the armed forces minister, Pounds 365,700 has been spent on buying 560 new swords over the past five years, which works out at roughly two new swords a week. A further Pounds 156,700 has been spent on refurbishing another 576 weapons. The MoD estimates that there are now 2,500 swords in official use, plus many more owned privately. The rapid rise in the sword count contrasts with an equally rapid rundown in the number of field marshals, admirals and generals in recent years. So much for that corny idea about turning swords into ploughshares.</p>

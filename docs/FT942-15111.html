			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Gardening: Give dahlias a chance One of the main purposes of a gardening column is to jog your memory and remind you of old truths. The old truth now is that you have about 10 days left to plant bulbs for success in the summer. Merchants send out spring catalogues from which some of us order lilies (too late) and others, presumably, order gladioli. Many of the spring ideas in these catalogues are not hardy although things like watsonia could be wonderful in those pots which everyone now wants to display on their balconies and round the house. But while other things are excellent for years, fashion now seems against them. Dahlias are not bulbs although, whenever I recommend them, most people look ready to impale me on a semi-cactus. Certainly, those ball-shaped mauves and oranges are truly awful, and the newer miniatures with names like Topmix or Lilliput are no better. The trouble is that these bad varieties put us all off. In five months, I will again be admiring the pale yellows, whites and soft pinks on the marvellous show stand mounted by Ayletts of Hertfordshire at the Royal Horticultural Society's autumn show. We have illustrated it here, and many of you have written to ask for a reminder when the buying season comes round. It has arrived. If you have planted new beds and are impatient about them, do please take dahlias seriously. Groups of three or five will thicken up the back row of your border and are really no bother if you start them now in boxes of light soil and transplant them late in May. In half-shade or in groups of 10 for the middle row, I like to match tall dahlias with the old summer hyacinth. Galtonia candicans has bulbs like tennis balls which should be planted about 4in deep on a layer of pleasant compost. In August, they send up stems to a height of 3ft, set with widely-spaced white flowers that resemble teeth with a winning gap. The leaves sprawl around and are rather ugly, but you can lose them in a surrounding border or imitate me and cut them in half without harm. Since 1982, I have learned to lift galtonias late in autumn and store them like dahlias, replanting them this weekend. They will then last for years. For much quicker results, try a tall relation of the Star of Bethlehem called Ornithogalum arabicum. It is often recommended for autumn planting and it will try to flower in June, having spikes of white flowers with an enchanting black eye. I learned two years ago that you could also plant them as late as April 20 and still enjoy flowers about two months later. Above all, remember nerines, the shocking pink Guernsey lilies which will bring us to our senses late in September and last until the first serious frost. Some people plant them in autumn but spring has always been my preference. Nowadays, I choose the catalogues' ordinary bowdenii. There are a few important tips to remember. Plant them so that the soil comes up to the neck of each bulb, leaving a small tip showing. Choose a sunny place where the soil is as sandy or sharply-drained as possible, and be patient for the first two years: nerines take off in their third season and should never be pre-judged. Sometimes, people complain that old clumps are not flowering well. The best advice is to give them a strong potash feed, using sulphate of potash from early summer on. Often, nerines are planted under walls, although they do not need extreme protection. Here, they tend to be starved, something which they hate as much as clay. If you dose them on potash, they remember to be miraculous once more. I have one last tip which is important. We all envy those wonderful carpets of yellow achonites up the drives of genuinely old vicarages or in woods which once led to a big Victorian house. Why do we fail to recreate them when we plant the necessary tubers by the hundred during the autumn? The answer is that the achonite, or eranthis, hates to be dried out and moved round the market. The right time to plant them is during the next two weeks when you can still buy them in green leaf from specialists. The right tactic is to plant a few in clumps of three or four and leave them to multiply (if they like you. If they do not, there is no point in wasting money on hundreds in the autumn). You might be in two minds about dahlias but, if an eventual carpet of yellow early in spring is your desire, now is the moment to set about it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  has met Chairman of the Tajik parliament Emomali Rakhmonov in  the Kremlin. The meeting is being held behind closed doors.  However, it was reported that the talks are focused on economic  issues, and primarily, Tajikistan's admission into the rouble  zone. Although Russian roubles are in circulation in  Tajikistan, this is considered to be a temporary measure yet.    During the talks the two leaders are expected to discuss the  internal political situation in Tajikistan and the situation on  the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

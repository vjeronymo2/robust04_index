			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Arts: Elektra - Opera Welsh National Opera last mounted Strauss's opera more than a decade ago. The production, by Harry Kupfer, was set in a slaughterhouse, steeped in blood, and resonant - hysterically shrill, some felt - with 'political' overtones. It caused a stir. Now, the company have turned to David Alden (of, inter alia, Scottish Opera Wozzeck and ENO Mazeppa, Boccanegra and Masked Ball fame) for the new Elektra that launches their '92-93 season. Will it do the same? The approach is neo-expressionist. The opera is, according to an Alden interview in the WNO programme, 'actually an expressionistic reduction of realistic situations into a dreamscape of one person's psychology'. To create that dreamscape he and his regular design-partner (formerly known as David Fielding and now, mysteriously, as Paul Bond) have rushed to their trunk of modern opera-production cliches and tipped its contents all over the Cardiff New Theatre stage. It's all there: the angled stage, the dangling light-bulb (growing bright at significant moments) on a long cord, the shiny surfaces in black, gunmetal and white, the hard planes of light (by Wolfgang Gobbel), the chairs, the disconnected recourse to unusual props - at one point Electra hauls a mattress on to the stage, at another a standard-lamp with a large lampshade  -the writhing on the floor, the weirdo postures and face-pulling. In addition, the team have shown no hesitation about drawing on the stock of modern Elektra-production cliches of other provenance where they have felt in danger of running out themselves. Poor old Chrysothemis is once again a Marilyn Monroe-epigone in a slinky white petticoat, Clytemnestra a svelte matron in a glam off-the-shoulder number, with a troupe of sadistic-chic attendants who at one point bring on the syringe for her regulation shoot-up. What's wrong, it seems to me, can be briefly summed up: a terrible shortage of fresh, stimulating, surprising dramatic imagination at work in the production. The idea that the opera is a psychodrama in the head of its titular character, or that the three types of feminine response to its central crisis are part of a larger, psychologically-linked family pattern, is itself not contemptible; one could have many a lively discussion about it (possibly, indeed, with one's own psychiatrist). But as evidenced here there is a depressing staleness about the execution. This is in stark contrast to, say, the Alden-Fielding Masked Ball; and the effect, far from bouncing illuminating new reflections off the score, is to reduce its range of Affekt to a series of predictable bugaboo gestures. This is Elektra presented as the opera's and the composer's most persistent detractors might see and hear it. On Saturday, though, the performance was saved from complete ignominy by the tireless devotion, musical authority and sheer guts of its three leading females (in comparison, the men are even more overshadowed than usual). Janet Hardy, an American Electra already well-known across Europe, sings with cleanly cutting strength and absolute confidence - there may not be much beauty in her tone, much variety or depth in her musicianship, but she delivers the goods with a refreshing avoidance of calculation or physical cranking-up. Eva Maria Bundschuh, a German soprano of old-fashioned (in the best sense) vocal warmth and honesty, makes a far more robust case for the validity of Chrysothemis's line of argument than Alden deserves. Best of all, there is a simply tremendous Clytemnestra from Felicity Palmer, every note and word socked into place with an attack that is fiercely dazzling - one looks forward to encountering her in a production more fully worthy of her. Among the maids the sweet, full soprano of Alwyn Mellor (the fifth) stands out. Carlo Rizzi, new WNO chief conductor, undertakes his first Strauss opera. There is much shapely playing, much concern for verbal clarity, much tingling vitality in the orchestration. What is so far missing is any directorial knack of joining musical sentences into dramatic paragraphs. Rizzi's is a stop-start reading - and, in view of the staging deficiencies, doubly unfortunate. In WNO repertory until December 5</p>

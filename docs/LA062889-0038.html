			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. OKS SAN FERNANDO FIRE SERVICE PACT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Fire Department will continue to provide fire service to the  city of San Fernando for the next five years under a new contract approved  Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> Terms of the new contract had stirred debate for months in San Fernando after  Los Angeles city officials issued an ultimatum to the small city to stop  selling Fourth of July fireworks or forfeit fire service after Friday, when the  present contract expires.  </P> <P> The San Fernando City Council banned the sale of fireworks last winter after  months of studying what council members concluded were inadequate alternatives,  such as starting a San Fernando fire department or contracting with Los Angeles  County. Fireworks had been sold in the city for 40 years.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, San Fernando will pay $1.5 million this year -- an  increase of about $52,000 -- for fire and paramedic service. Future fees will  be calculated annually by Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The San Fernando City Council approved the contract agreement June 19. One term  of the new agreement sets up a liaison between the city and the Los Angeles  Fire Department so that San Fernando is aware of fire prevention and other  public programs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Precision Missile -- </F> Aerospatiale Lagging Behind Matra"]    [Text] Mention of its name already brings a smile to the  lips in defense circles. Called APTGD, the French acronym for  "long-distance precision weapon," this missile -- for so it is  -- is, according to Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the only  major new program in the 1995-2000 military planning law. Its  estimated development cost is 1.65 billion French francs [Fr],  of which Fr1.4 billion has been set aside for the period covered  by the law. The total cost of the whole program should be at  least Fr2 billion. Some 200 missiles will be required.    The aim of this APTGD -- with a range of 400 km and accurate  to within one meter -- is to strike an enemy and destroy his  headquarters, military bases and energy sources without having  recourse to nuclear weapons and without harming the civilian  population. In short, a kind of French cruise missile, but more  modern than the American Tomahawk which had its moment of glory  during the Gulf War.    The problem is choosing a company to manufacture the  missile.  While France has one manufacturer of combat aircraft, one tank  producer, and one helicopter-maker, it has two missile  companies, Aerospatiale and Matra. Each company has very  different ideas for the APTGD: Aerospatiale is proposing a  conventional (C) version of its ASMP medium-range air-to-ground  nuclear missile. The development cost would be around Fr1  billion, and Aerospatiale Missiles boss Jean-Louis Fache is  proposing lowering this cost if his company is also given the  contract for the ANNG new-generation antiship missile which  would also use elements of the ASMP. In his view, the operation  would make it possible to lower ASMP-C and ANNG development  costs by a global 25 percent. The icing on the cake is that the  ASMP missile is equipped with technology currently mastered only  by France and Russia -- although U.S. and UK scientists are on  the case -- namely the statoreactor. This superturbine means  the missile can travel at supersonic speeds. Aerospatiale's  reasoning is that even if the missile is detected it will then  be too late to try and counter it.    Across the board from Aerospatiale is Matra, with its  Super-Apache missile. Matra is the current favorite to win the  contract and has the backing of current Chief of Staff Admiral  Lanxade, Air Force Commander General Lanata, and the influential  head of the General Arms Delegation, Henri Conze. The  Super-Apache is derived from the original Apache antitrack  missile and is a partial offshoot, since the planning law  devotes Fr2.6 billion for the purchase of 137 Apaches, just 75  of which are antitrack, the other 62 being the new  anti-infrastructure missiles. As a result, the total order  remains the same. Lengthened and equipped with a new warhead,  the Super-Apache will cost a little more than Fr1 billion to  develop, but the unit price of each missile will be lower than  that for the ASMP-C. The special feature of the Super-Apache is  its stealthiness (specially designed by Matra in a huge  "anechoic" chamber), although it flies at subsonic speeds. This  low speed must therefore be compensated by radar invisibility.  Moreover, according to the defense minister, it will be "more  flexible to use and even more precise since it will be  adjustable" in flight, unlike its competitor.    Even Aerospatiale chiefs realize that they have only a one  in  three chance of wresting the contract away from Matra. As a  result, Aerospatiale managing director Louis Gallois made the  sibylline statement: "It is likely that Aerospatiale and Matra  will both have a stake in this missile. The distribution  already exists for the Apache. If the choice revolves around a  supersonic statoreactor program, Matra will doubtless want to  participate. Then the question of a redistribution will be  raised." Thus, his company seems to be sending a clear message  to Matra, perhaps offering a share of the precious ASMP  statoreactor technology. Noel Forgeard, head of Matra Defense  Espace, could be tempted by this offer. He has no such worries,  however. If the Super-Apache wins the day, the industrial  distribution of tasks that exist for the Apache will guide the  program: Matra will be prime contractor with 12 percent of the  contract, while the other 88 percent will go to industrial  subcontractors, split 50-50 between Aerospatiale and Matra --  the final share-out will thus be 44 percent and 56 percent  respectively.    However, the ASNP-C cannot be counted out yet. First, its  detractors could be called on to fill new positions. Second,  the Americans and the British, with their Casom missile, are  starting to reflect on the future of their cruise missiles and  are wondering whether it might be time to make the switch to  supersonic missiles.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Markets: The logic behind the euphoria - London IT HAS been a week of euphoria in the stock market. The Footsie passed the 3,000 mark with a 34.5 point surge on Wednesday, and managed to keep above that level for the rest of the week. On four days out of five the index closed at a new high. The gilt run has also continued. A wobble on Friday, taking the index below 3,000 again, was reversed before the close with the Footsie eventually rising 1 point on the day to close at 3010.1. This suggests a firm underpinning for the market, even at these dizzy heights. The motivation for the market has been the prospect of yet lower UK interest rates, and a hastened recovery in the economies of continental Europe following the near break down of the ERM, to which over 60 per cent of UK exports are sent. That has underpinned corporate earnings forecasts, and for the first time in some years brokers are expecting to use the next results reporting season as a time to raise rather than lower their estimates for the following year. The most bullish of the leading houses, Nomura Research Institute, which has a forecast of 3,500 for the Footsie by the year end, argues that this represents a 1994 p/e of 'only' 15.3, which it regards as reasonable at this stage of the economic cycle. There is nothing magic about 1,000 steps in the market. But as the chart shows, each time the Footsie has gone past such a milestone it has been at a higher and higher p/e, showing that earnings are not running up with the index. The break through 2,000 came towards the end of an economic cycle, when earnings growth was slowing. The yield on the market, however, is higher now than it was at the 2,000 level, as dividends have risen as a proportion of earnings. Economic news has been somewhat mixed this week. While consumer borrowing has continued to rise - suggesting growing degree of confidence - other indicators have been less good. Unemployment rose in July, for the first time since January. After months when people could not understand why it was falling, a seasonally-adjusted rise of just 200 should not be too much of a worry, and especially as it is a difficult month to adjust for school and college leavers. Manufacturing output fell quite sharply in June, down 2.1 per cent, more than reversing May's rise of 1.8 per cent. However, in the three months to June output rose 1.4 per cent on the previous three months, and 3.1 per cent over the same three months last year, so the trend is still in the right direction. What is a touch worrying is the regional survey from the CBI this week, which suggested recovery was faltering in a number of regions, generally those which represent the country's manufacturing heartland. This has been borne out by some UK companies. Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the Manchester-based engineers, warned on Wednesday that its profits would fall from its first half to the second because order books were actually lower than they were a few months ago. J&amp;FB had been expecting orders to revive. Meanwhile, BOC Group, the gases company, warned on Tuesday, that the economic recovery in the rest of the world was not coming through as hoped. BOC's news that its profits would be down in the year to September, on Tuesday, may have single-handedly delayed the Footsie's rise through 3,000 for a day. BOC said that recovery in the US had slowed, in Australia had stalled, and that in the UK was having little effect on its business. Since around half the profits of Footsie companies are made abroad, this is a serious concern. It also explains why second line stocks have been outperforming the top ones lately. These smaller companies generally have a much lower exposure to the international economy. News from the inflation front was generally good, though, and this is one of the main supports for the gilt market, and to equities too. The Bank of England's quarterly report on inflation suggested that it could remain below the 4 per cent target for the next two years, which is about the furthest horizon the markets can see. Given that the Bank has to fund a Pounds 50bn budget deficit this year, it may just be talking its own book. But it is a story that foreign buyers are willing to believe, and the funding programme is so well advanced - 60 per cent done in 4 1/2 months - that the Bank has been able to take a summer holiday, announcing yesterday that there would not be another gilt auction until the latter half of September. Other corporate news has been cheering this week. British Airways shares rose on its first quarter profits which showed a jump at the operating level from Pounds 96m to Pounds 108m, although this was more than reversed on pre-tax profits thanks to a higher interest charge. Passenger numbers suggested a pick up in travel. The benefits of sterling's devaluation to profits of UK based international companies were demonstrated by Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare and consumer group, where interim profits rose 27 per cent to Pounds 82.3m pre-tax. But the underlying growth rate was a lesser 8 per cent when currency gains and a one-off profit on a disposal were excluded. Unilever obligingly makes the underlying growth calculation easier by reporting quarterly figures in constant exchange rates. On this basis second quarter net profits were 8 per cent higher and would be 21 per cent up if the currency benefit is taken into account. Unilever, like BOC, said trading was patchy, in its case seeing a weaker performance in the US and Europe. But it was confident enough to say the first half performance would be maintained for the rest of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article contributed by Lu Hsiu-lian, Taiwan Democratic </F> Progressive Party Legislative Branch member, to the "Forum"  column: "Expose and Analyze the Hangzhou Court's Hoax; An Urgent  Appeal Arising From the Qiandao Lake Incident"]    [Excerpts] History Seems To Be Repeating Itself, With  the Only Difference Being That Time and Space Have Changed    The time was changed from March 1980 to June 1994, and the  place was moved from Taipei's Chingmei Military Tribunal to the  Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court, the difference being that  the Kuomintang ordered its court to indict eight Taiwan  democratic fighters on sedition charges and that the CPC ordered  the Hangzhou court to sentence three young Chinese men to die on  charges of robbery and murder. Two different cases; hence,  different meanings. But the method which the Chinese Communists  used to try the culprits who were involved in the Qiandao Lake  incident was almost identical to the one adopted by the  Kuomintang 14 years ago when it put on trial those involved in  the Kaohsiung incident. Because, however, of the valiant  defense put up by those who were charged in the Kaohsiung  incident and their lawyers, the Kuomintang's prepared script  went awry. Following a successive retraction of confessions  extracted during interrogations and the launching of a  counterattack, the eight "most wanted persons of the Kuomintang"  survived their courtroom ordeal. Woe betide the three young men  in Hangzhou who will be made the scapegoats and who will pay  with their lives within days for the vicious killings on Qiandao  Lake, thus adding three more wronged ghosts to the netherworld.    I was the first one who openly retracted a forced confession  during the great trial in the military court many years ago.  Because I have been working on behalf of the families of the  Qiandao Lake incident's victims, I know instantly the hypocrisy  and the illegality of the trial by the Hangzhou intermediate  court of the three persons who were charged with robbery and  murder. The Hangzhou intermediate court has violated the "human  rights" safeguard standard as set forth in modern international  law -- that is, all have the right to an open and free trial.  <H5>  Seriously Violate the "Due Process of Law" </H5>   I had intended to go with the families of the victims to  Hangzhou for the court hearing. Being unable to make the trip,  I became resigned to reading newspaper reports about the case.  I found that in handling this case, China has at least  seriously violated the "due process of law."    1. The contents of the indictment document have not been  made known to the public. The families of the victims and their  lawyers also have not received copies of the indictment. Even  the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] said that it has no idea  about the contents of the indictment.    2. Although claiming an open trial, the court did not allow  the lawyers of the victims' families or Taiwan legislators to  attend the court proceedings. The SEF was notified, just 24  hours before the opening of the trial, that it would be allowed  to send a person "in his capacity as an individual" to attend  the court hearing. This was too late, because there were  neither flights nor enough time to reach Hangzhou. It was  reported that most of the people who attended the court hearing  dressed well. Men were reported wearing Western suits and women  wearing traditional Chinese-style dresses. They were apparently  senior Communist officials. At the center of the courtroom  there hung a red cloth banner with the words "The Qiandao Lake  incident trial court" written on it. It looked rather like the  holding of a wedding reception or the staging of a theatrical  play. It was completely out of place for a court which was  supposed to be holding a great trial of robbers and murderers  who had committed the heinous crime of killing 32 people.    3. Reporters were prohibited from attending the court  hearing. They were only allowed to watch the court hearing on a  television at a building across the court. Photos and  videotaping were also forbidden. Many plainclothesmen  surreptitiously took photos of or videotaped reporters who were  at the scene to cover the event. The Communists even brazenly  offered to sell reporters a 20-minute censored and edited  videotape of the trial for $100.    4. The trial was conducted on 10-11 June. The three persons  who were accused of the crime each were given two death  sentences on the morning of 12 June. But, 12 June was a Sunday.  There is no country in the world which holds trials on Sundays.  It was also strange and uncommon that the Hangzhou court  hastily handed down death sentences on Sunday, just one day  before the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on 13 June and  which is one of China's three major festivals and a day for  family reunions. It was a great feat indeed that they managed  to finish drafting, typing, and proof-reading a long-winded  court verdict just a few hours after the trial. All this points  to the fact that the Communist authorities wanted to speedily  conclude the case and that the court verdict had already been  prepared before the trial opened. The court trial was nothing  but a political farce.  <H5>  Flatly Reject the Legitimacy and Authenticity of the Trial </H5>   The above are the serious procedural flaws that I found in  the course of the Qiandao Lake trial. People who did not the  trial also can discern these criticisms, but if one were present  at the trial, one surely would have found even more instances of  absurdity and hypocrisy. Because of these obvious and serious  procedural flaws, we of course question whether the three who  were charged with the crime were the real culprits. Therefore,  we should categorically reject the legitimacy and authenticity  of the verdict.    As a matter of fact, we can detect a great deal of  whitewashing even from the limited images contained in the  doctored videotape. When arriving at the court to stand trial,  the three persons who were accused of the crime wore smiles and  were at ease. They did not look like vicious robbers who had  committed such a heinous crime. When recounting the commission  of the crime, they readily answered questions while cooperating  perfectly with the judge. They even consulted prepared notes  when replying to the judge's questions. They seemed to be  memorizing the script. They did not give a slightest impression  that an imminent disaster would soon befall them. They also did  not betray a trace of fear that their heads would soon be  chopped off.    That scene reminded me of the Wu Tai-an communist spy case,  which occurred one year before the Kaohsiung incident. [passage  omitted]    Are Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun the real culprits who  were involved in the Qiandao Lake incident and who cruelly  killed 32 people? Were they capable of committing such a  heinous crime? With what sort of weapons did they commit the  crime? We've got to know the answers to these questions,  because these have to do with the real truth of the tragedy and  with the criminal responsibility of the three accused persons.  However, the accounts given in the court by the three accused  persons were evasive, farfetched, and tended to avoid the  important and dwell on the trivial when it came to the important  points. The judge did not have the slightest intention of  energetically pursuing the case by asking more penetrating  questions, and he left major suspicious points unclarified. For  instance, were there more than three persons who committed the  crime? What kinds of guns were used in the crime? What was the  actual situation of the setting of the boat on fire? What were  the real causes of death? Were the victims killed by gunshots?  Were they burned to death? Or, were they just asphyxiated?  These issues were all left unprobed. One can see clearly that  the truth of the case had not been brought to light with the  conclusion of the two-day trial. Instead, the truth may never  be known because of the hurried sentencing and execution of the  three accused persons.  <H5>  We Should Never Allow Ourselves To Be Treated as Idiots and </H5> as the Meat on the Chopping Block    Following the handing down of the verdict, presiding Judge  Yang Gang immediately called a news conference at which he  insisted that there were only three culprits and that "there  were absolutely no other people involved in this case." The  chairman of Zhejiang's Taiwan affairs office also called on  Taiwan compatriots to believe in the sincerity of the Chinese  Communists and not to let the Qiandao Lake incident affect the  feelings between the people living on both sides of the strait  and hamper the "virtuous development" of the cross-strait  relationship.    Well, if this is their wish, then why didn't they let  lawyers  representing the families of the victims attend the court  hearing? Why didn't they allow reporters to visit the scene of  the crime? Why did they go to such unusual lengths in covering  up the case following its occurrence? These all point to the  fact that there must have been a cover-up of the Qiandao Lake  incident. There must be other real culprits.    Even when things have reached such a state, the Communist  authorities still treat the "Taiwan compatriots" like idiots;  they still want to treat Taiwan as the meat on the chopping  block.    My dear Taiwan compatriots, do you still want to be treated  like idiots by the Communists?    Here is a warning to those incompetent officials at the SEF  and Mainland Affairs Council: If you still continue to treat  Taiwan as meat on the chopping block for others to chop, we will  surely force you to step down.</p>

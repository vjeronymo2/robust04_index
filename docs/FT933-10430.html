			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / NatWest gains on relief of bad debt in south NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday disclosed a sharp fall in provisions against bad and doubtful debts in the first half of the year as the recovery in the economy started to relieve bad debt in the south of England. NatWest's bad debt provisions of Pounds 641m were 23 per cent down on the Pounds 828m charged in the same period last year, and 36 per cent down on the Pounds 995m provision in the second half. New provisions fell by the largest percentage in the south. The bank's pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 421m, against Pounds 211m, despite making an exceptional Pounds 159m provision against its decision to pull out of retail banking in France and Australia. It expects to recover little of a Pounds 135m investment in France. The most profitable sector was NatWest's corporate banking and securities arm, NatWest Markets. It made pre-tax profits of Pounds 253m, up from Pounds 141m, helped by dealing profits of Pounds 246m. These were boosted by currency trading in volatile conditions. The UK retail branch business returned to a profit of Pounds 69m, compared with a Pounds 74m loss, as provisions fell from Pounds 609m to Pounds 442m. But branch banking profit before provisions slipped to Pounds 511m, against Pounds 535m, because of what the bank described as weak demand for loans due to lack of confidence. Lord Alexander, chairman, said the recession had dominated results for three years, but the economic background was now 'improving, albeit modestly and patchily'. The provisions fall was welcome, but bad debts remained unacceptably high. The bank raised its interim dividend by 4.5 per cent to 6.4p after earnings per share went up from 8p to 12p. Lord Alexander said it was strongly capitalised and had 'no current plans' for a rights issue. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive, said there had been a lack of demand for all forms of lending except mortgages. Lending in the branch network fell by Pounds 2.1bn, although UK mortgages rose by Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 10.2bn. Mr Wanless said the bank would be 'disappointed' if provisions did not fall further by the end of the year, but it could not be confident about the size of the fall. The bank believed that the recovery was established but it remained fragile. The bank's net interest margin on loans fell from 3.2 to 2.8 per cent because it took on lower margin assets in treasury operations. The fall in base rates narrowed the gap between variable rate lending and retail savings. Non-interest income rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn, taking it to 46 per cent of total operating income of Pounds 3.45bn, against Pounds 3.17bn. However, costs including exchange rate movements rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 2.23bn. The bank's new life insurance subsidiary, NatWest Life, contributed Pounds 21m to profits, while the mortgage operation, National Westminster Home Loans, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 20m to Pounds 59m helped by asset growth and wider margins. The bank's ratio of core tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets stayed at 5.5 per cent, although it rose from 5.2 per cent at the end of 1992, helped by a Dollars 250m preference share issue and a Pounds 1.4bn fall in risk-weighted assets. The shares gained 13p to 510p. Lex, Page 14; Details, Page 16</p>

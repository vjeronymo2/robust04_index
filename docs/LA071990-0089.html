			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TESTS URGED BEFORE FIRM IS AWARDED FINAL OK;  </P> <P> HAZARDOUS MATERIALS: MARQUARDT CO., OPERATING FOR YEARS UNDER A TEMPORARY  PERMIT, MAKES CHEMICAL BOMB PARTS AND ROCKET ENGINES.  </P> <P> Environmental activists and local residents urged state health officials  Wednesday to conduct health risk and other studies before granting a permanent  operating permit to a Van Nuys defense and aerospace firm that makes chemical  bomb parts, rocket engines and other products.  </P> <P> Marquardt Co. has applied to the state Department of Health Services for a  permit that would allow it to continue using hazardous materials such as  explosive rocket fuel and toxic solvents at its plant at 16555 Saticoy St.  </P> <P> Health officials are reviewing manufacturing processes, hazardous-waste  handling procedures and emergency response plans at Marquardt, which has  operated under a temporary permit since 1981. Wednesday's meeting was called to  solicit public comment on the firm's application for a permanent permit, which  state officials won't decide on for another year.  </P> <P> Marquardt uses a variety of toxic and flammable chemicals to produce metal  parts used in steering rockets for the space shuttle and jet engines for the  National Aerospace Plane project, whose purpose is to develop an experimental  commercial jet designed to fly 10 times faster and three times higher than  existing aircraft.  </P> <P> The firm also makes parts for binary chemical bombs and cluster bombs, which  scatter up to 250 smaller bombs when dropped. Human rights and peace activists  have condemned cluster bombs as particularly inhumane.  </P> <P> The company became embroiled in controversy two years ago after it won a state  grant to test a process for incinerating toxic materials at its plant. Although  engineers said no harmful materials would be released into the air, intense  community opposition forced the firm to cancel the project.  </P> <P> Penny Newmark, a spokeswoman for the Marquardt Coalition, a group of homeowners  and environmentalists, urged state officials to conduct a health risk  assessment and commission an independent environmental impact review before  granting the company a permanent operating permit.  </P> <P> A health risk assessment would attempt to quantify the risks to nearby  residents of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere.  </P> <P> State officials said that health risk assessments and environmental impact  reviews are conducted for about 25% to 30% of the hazardous waste facilities  whose permits they review. But they added that it is too early in the review  process to say if such studies will be required for Marquardt.  </P> <P> Newmark also said the homeowners group recently received an anonymous letter  from the wife of a Marquardt worker claiming the firm failed to report  "explosions and fires and chemical leaks" to city fire officials.  </P> <P> She said the letter writer also claimed Marquardt was building and loading  chemical weapons at the plant.  </P> <P> Laura Zinkan, another spokeswoman for the Marquardt Coalition, said in an  interview before the meeting that the firm shouldn't be allowed to store rocket  fuel and other toxic and flammable materials in a populated area such as Van  Nuys.  </P> <P> "Don't do this in the middle of suburbia," she said. "Do this in some place  that's safer or don't do it at all."  </P> <P> Marquardt spokesman Joe Pospichal said the firm stores and uses only about one  gallon of rocket fuel a week for its engine tests. He said the material poses  very little threat to local residents.  </P> <P> Pospichal denied that there have been explosions, fires or chemical leaks at  the plant.  </P> <P> "We have a very close relationship with the Fire Department, and we value the  safety of our employees," he said.  </P> <P> Pospichal said Marquardt manufactures metal parts for a binary chemical bomb  known as "Big Eye" under a contract with the Navy. But he said the firm does  not make or load any chemicals in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> "It's so easy to make accusations," he said. "If they really were sincere, it  wouldn't have been an anonymous letter."  </P> <P> Pospichal also said that the United States and Soviet Union reached agreement  in June to slash their stockpiles of chemical weapons. He declined, however, to  say when his firm's contract to produce Big Eye components runs out or when it  will cease producing them.  </P></p>

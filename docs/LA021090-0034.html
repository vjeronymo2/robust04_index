			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BEALE ST. PORTRAIT WITHOUT THE MUSIC IN 'ALL NIGHT'  </P> <P> "All Day and All Night," airing Sunday at 11 p.m. on KCET Channel 28, is just  about half the show it should be -- literally. Presented under the auspices of  the Center for Southern Folklore, this 30-minute cross-section of Beale Street  in Memphis could have made an absorbing one-hour program, with more music to  flesh out the already ample and richly anecdotal talk.  </P> <P> The central point of interest is the life style of musicians who lived in  Memphis in the first half of this century. According to the interlocutors who  reminisce about Beale Street, this was the throbbing counterpart of Basin  Street in New Orleans.  </P> <P> B. B. King, who from 1950 to 1953 had his own series on the pioneer  black-oriented radio station WDIA in Memphis, sings a couple of numbers but is  presented primarily as the main speaker, recalling with wry humor the days  when, unemployed and broke, he would win a $1 prize in a local amateur night  show.  </P> <P> The Rev. Dwight (Gatemouth) Moore recalls affectionately his youthful  blues-singing days. Rufus Thomas, a few years Moore's junior and one of his  most ardent disciples, speaks eloquently: "If you were black for one Saturday  night and went to Beale Street, you'd never want to be white again."  </P> <P> The camaraderie and creative spirit that pervaded Beale Street in those days is  no doubt colored by the warming flow of nostalgia, yet much of it seems real  and convincing. If only there had been more than those brief minutes of actual  performance, the value of "All Day and All Night" would have been as compelling  as the impact of the conversation.

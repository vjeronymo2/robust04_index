			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Russia knocks on west's doors: Moscow wants to enter three clubs, but on its own terms In the next three weeks, Russia will - barring last-minute surprises - step at least halfway across the threshold of three prestigious western clubs: Nato, the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial powers. Although an end to the self-isolation of the Soviet regime is a long-standing aim of the Yeltsin administration, diplomats expect Moscow to haggle until the last moment over the size of its fee for appearing in the three-act drama. Nato said yesterday that Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, would sign up to Partnership For Peace, the western-inspired military co-operation programme, in Brussels on Wednesday. The following day, President Boris Yeltsin will travel to the Greek island of Corfu where - with ships of the disputed Black Sea Fleet at anchor nearby  -he will dine with the leaders of the European Union. He will also sign a partnership agreement under negotiation for two years, and intended to open the EU market for many Russian products. Two weeks later, Mr Yeltsin and his western counterparts will converge on Naples, for the G7 summit. For the first time, a Russian leader is expected to play a full part in the group's political consultations. The precise terms on which Russia joins the Partnership For Peace will be the subject of vigorous negotiations over the next four days. Mr Vitaly Churkin, the senior Russian diplomat who speaks for Moscow in former Yugoslavia, arrived in Brussels yesterday to thrash out the content of a broad Russian-Nato agreement that will be sealed at the same time as Mr Kozyrev signs up to PFP. Mr Churkin and Nato diplomats will be haggling about both the content of the accord, and its presentation. Nato has tried to play down the extent to which Russia is being treated differently from the 20 countries, mostly ex-communist, already signed up to PFP. Mindful of their sensitivities, the alliance has vowed not to conclude with Moscow any legally binding instruments, treaties or protocols over and above the standard entry form for PFP. Nato wants any such deals to be agreed on as informally as possible. In the words of a British diplomat, 'PFP must be the main dish, though there can be a nourishing side-salad.' However a binding protocol on the broader Russia-Nato link - which is expected to include a dialogue on nuclear and non-proliferation issues - is precisely what Mr Churkin will be demanding. The Russians have already proposed one formula that would save the face of both sides: the document would be described as a protocol in Russian, but it would be stressed that the word does not have such a robust legal sense in Russian as it does in most western languages. As to the content of the extra-PFP agreement, the Russians wants it to endorse their idea of subordinating Nato to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. One Russian draft reads in part: 'The paramount aim of the partnership would be. . . co-operation over settling crises, averting conflict, conducting peace support operations, and forming an effective system of security and stability in Europe that takes into account the leading role of the CSCE. . .' Other aims would include: 'Co-operation in the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; the prevention of possible new nuclear missile threats; the conversion of military industries to civilian purposes; co-ordination of plans to produce new types of weapons - including jointly produced weapons; (co-operation over) arms control and disarmament, and the fight against nuclear and any other form of terrorism.' Most of these ideas are broadly acceptable to Nato, as long as the west can choose when it wants to discuss these issues with Russia and when it wants to keep the discussion private. But Russia wants the opposite: a right, as formal as possible, to participate in western deliberations on broad security issues. The Russian proposal's inclusion of non-proliferation and nuclear terrorism is a reminder that on these issues, its interests coincide to a broad extent with those of the west. Moscow has no wish to see rogue regimes or, even worse, rogue individuals in control of nuclear weapons. However Russia is keenly aware of how badly the US needs its vote on the UN Security Council for any moves to put pressure on North Korea. Mr Kozyrev will discuss this with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, before signing up to PFP. Conceding to Russian aspirations on the form - and even the content - of its relations with Nato may turn out to be the price that the US and other western countries are obliged to pay for securing Moscow's co-operation in dealing with nuclear miscreants.</p>

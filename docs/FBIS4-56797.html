			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edner Jean -- live] </F>   [Text] There is a state of uncertainty in the parliament.  This session of the National Assembly is submerged in confusion  and uncertainty. This session, which should close the seventh  session of the 45th Legislature, has not yet begun. On the  contrary, consultations are being held by the political blocs in  the Chamber of Deputies, the president of which, Frantz Robert  Monde, is meeting right now with the president of the regular  Senate, Firmin Jean-Louis. [Jean] The meeting between the  president of the regular Senate, Firmin Jean-Louis, and the  president of the Chamber of Deputies has just ended. It is still  not known what they discussed or what decisions were made on  holding of this National Assembly. Frantz Robert Monde has just  come out of this meeting and invited the deputies to meet with  him immediately in the Diplomatic Room for an important  communication. Right now, consultations continue within the  political blocs. The socialist bloc is consulting with its  members in camera. The Parliamentary Bloc-National Front for  Change and Democracy deputies and senators are dispersed. They  are not being consulted. The senators led by Bernard Sansaricq,  however, are also consulting with one another.    Preparations continue for this National Assembly, and the  question remains: Will this seventh session be closed because of  the insignificant number of deputies -- about 30 at the moment.  Thus, there is no quorum; the roll has not been called.  Meanwhile, reporters are there, waiting for the show to begin.</p>

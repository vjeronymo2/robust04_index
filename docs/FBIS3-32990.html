			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Feb (PL) -- Cuba today announced its  decision to work toward a normalization of ties with immigrants  without waiting for changes in its tense relations with the U.S.  Government.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina addressed numerous  local and foreign journalists after officially announcing "The  Nation and the Immigrants" conference, scheduled for April in  this capital, and he outlined the characteristics of this  meeting.    The foreign minister recalled that contacts between Cubans  who live abroad and their country of origin have been  systematically undermined following the victory of the  revolution by Washington's hostile policy toward the Caribbean  island.    Cuba cannot continue to wait until relations with the United  States improve before attending to immigrant problems in a  civilized, coherent, and correct manner, because they do not  depend on current differences with the White House, he said.    Robaina said the event, scheduled for 22, 23, and 24 April,  will gather in Havana approximately 200 representatives of  Cubans who live in numerous countries throughout the world.    Although the largest delegation will come from the United  States, where the largest number of immigrants have settled, the  foreign minister said delegations will also arrive from Spain,  Venezuela, Mexico, Panama, Slovakia, Mozambique, Namibia,  Trinidad and Tobago, and the Czech Republic, among others.    Four Cuban Government officials will be in charge of  outlining essential issues during the meeting, and this will  serve as the basis for debates.    Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the  People's Government, will discuss the immigration issue in a  general context; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of  Ministers, will deal with conditions within the current economic  period, as well as the country's possibilities in the future.    Moreover, Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of  Cuban Writers and Artists, will talk about Cuban culture and  immigrant intellectuals' contributions; and Robaina will  personally talk about the tasks which correspond to Cubans  living inside the country and abroad to sponsor relations with  other countries.    Robaina emphasized: Even though all pending issues will not  be solved within three days, the goal is to start a discussion  on topics of interest, including procedures to be carried out  for trips, immigration permits, ways to help relatives, cultural  exchange, and nationality problems.    A gap must be filled, a hand must be offered to many  immigrants who seek to maintain a normal relationship with their  country, and the number of people who want to do this tends to  increase, he said.    He said: The conference will be held with absolute respect  for everyone's opinion and without provisions, which is how Cuba  would be willing to talk with Washington concerning any  improvement of relations.    The foreign minister recalled that, as far as immigration  affairs are concerned, the U.S. Government has always failed to  implement the agreements reached with Cuba. In reply to another  question, he said those who endorse an anti-Cuban hysteria would  not be allowed to attend the conference.    In reply to another question, he said the announcement of  this conference does not represent a concession, or a sign of  weakness, because everyone knows Cuba would never choose that  option.</p>

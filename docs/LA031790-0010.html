			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AND BABY MAKES 3 FOR PROLIFIC ANIMAL PARK CONDOR  </P> <P> A California condor laid her third egg of the breeding season Friday, the first  captive "triple clutch" on record, the San Diego Wild Animal Park said.  </P> <P> The condor, named AC 8, whose first egg of the season hatched baby Chuhlna  earlier this week, laid egg No. 3 at 12:58 p.m., park spokesman Tom Hanscom  said.  </P> <P> He said this is only the second time a condor is known to have laid three eggs  in one season. The first recorded triple clutch, he said, also involved AC 8,  in 1983 when she was still in the wild. He said keepers are optimistic that  this egg will be fertile, as the other two have been.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, 4-day-old Chuhlna, the first condor hatchling of the season, is  eating voraciously, Hanscom said, and "seems to be out of the woods."  </P></p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Bonn curbs on foreign workers GERMANY'S Federal Labour Office yesterday called on local authorities to apply existing rules more strictly when granting work permits to foreigners to ensure jobs are not taken away from German nationals and residents in the country. A decree sent to state labour offices said the authorities must prove to their satisfaction that no German nationals or residents are available to fill the jobs before granting work permits to foreigners. The decision came as unemployment figures for February showed that 3.5m people were now out of work in the country, bringing the unemployment rate to 7.5 per cent in the west and 14.5 per cent in the east. At the same time, however, the number of visas given to non-EC nationals climbed by 50 per cent in 1992 to a total of 1.35m. 'Such a development is no longer acceptable in light of the steady worsening of the labour market,' Mr Norbert Blum, the federal labour minister, said. The decree said work permits should not be extended for more than a year, to allow for an annual re-examination of domestic labour market conditions. While the majority of working permits expire after a year, some are issued for up to three years. In addition, local labour offices must contact job applicants in regions with higher unemployment rates before permits for seasonal work are granted to foreigners. The rising number of asylum applicants has contributed to the sharp increase in permits granted to foreigners, federal officials admitted. For the past two years, asylum seekers have been allowed to seek work while waiting for their case to be processed. Other work permits have been given to foreign workers hired by enterprises operating in Germany. Many of these come from eastern Europe.</p>

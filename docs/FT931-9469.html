			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BETTER than anticipated figures on UK inflation enlivened the stock index futures sector, writes Joel Kibazo. Early fears of a high inflation figure led to a poor opening in the March contract on the FT-SE at 2,821, a 14-point discount to the underlying cash market. Such was the initial impact of the poor opening in March that dealers in the cash market quickly moved to mark prices lower, sending the equity index into retreat. However, by mid-morning, traders felt the earlier falls had been overdone and bargain hunting was seen. This gained momentum after the release of the inflation figures, climbing to the day's high of 2,866 at around 1.15pm. The early falls on Wall Street saw March come off and it finished at 2,853, up 19 on the previous close and at an 8-point premium to cash with turnover reaching around 12,521 contracts. In traded options, total volume was 31,593 with the FT-SE 100 option trading 11,069 lots. BTR was the busiest stock option at 2,315 lots.</p>

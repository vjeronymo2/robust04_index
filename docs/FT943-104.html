			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hong Kong enforces disclosure standards Companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange will be forced to meet more stringent disclosure requirements from tomorrow with the introduction of sweeping reforms aimed at increasing transparency and internationalising standards in the colony. The changes, which embrace China companies listed in Hong Kong, will require directors to disclose their fees, perks, pension scheme contributions, bonuses and any golden handshakes or pay-offs, and force directors and senior managers to detail their relationships with one another. Mr Herbert Hui, executive director and head of listing, said: 'The changes will increase the transparency of listed companies and will bring accounts disclosures to a level compatible with Hong Kong's position as a major international financial centre.' Companies will be obliged to provide details of the principal pension schemes, including the charge to the profit and loss account for contributions, and to furnish shareholders with revaluations of properties and other tangible assets. Investment properties and certain properties held by property companies may be exempted from the latter requirement. Major customers and suppliers will also have to be listed, and the exchange is making an attempt to increase companies' low levels of analysis. A discussion of the results for the year is to be included in the annual accounts and a new guidance note is being brought in for comment on liquidity, financial resources, investments, potential acquisitions and disposals, and elaboration of segment information given in the directors' report. Mr Hui has also written to all listed companies urging them to circulate their results to as many newspapers as early as possible 'to ensure a wider press coverage for the listed companies' financial information which the public should know'.</p>

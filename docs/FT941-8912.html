			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Observer: Political correction Smythson, the Queen's Bond Street stationers, has taken Observer to task for suggesting that dropping the 'man' from its Businessman's Organiser was done for reasons of political correctness. To prove that the firm has not completely bowed to the PC lobby, managing director Sarah Elton has sent round a copy of Smythson's wafer address book entitled Blondes, Brunettes and Redheads. It would make an ideal thank you present for a man-about-town like Alan Clark, the ex-defence minister.</p>

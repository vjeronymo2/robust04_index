			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Sobolev, DELOVOY MIR correspondent: </F> "Press Button for Launching!"]    [Text] "... 4, 3, 2, 1... launch!" -- such were the  approximate words of German Titov, cosmonaut No 2, president of  the Kosmos-Zemlya joint-stock company (AO) on the morning of 12  April -- "lifting into the air" the Buran orbital ship with 48  passengers aboard. It goes without saying that the space shuttle  chassis does not rise a millimeter above its site on the Pushkin  Embankment in the Gorkiy Central Park of Culture and Rest. The  unique attraction is being opened on Cosmonautics Day. By means  of monitors and computers it creates the total illusion of  spaceflight.    A complex operation preceded the appearance of the  supersecret space technology at the center of Moscow. In fact it  was transported on a special barge along the Moscow River from  the NPO Molniya and the Tushino Machine Building plant; it was  even necessary to lower the water level in the river by 20 cm  for this purpose in order for the multiton monster to be able to  pass under all the bridge spans.    This Buran has not been in space. It is one of the more than  10 ships constructed by Molniya and intended for surface tests.  It had successfully passed these tests. Specialists say that if  engines were mounted on it and it underwent certain  modifications it would be able to make a spaceflight. But, as is  well known, the highly touted project was put on the shelf. And  our Buran would not live on if it were not from dreamers at the  AO Kosmos-Zemlya.    They found a place for attractions and leased from the  Central Park of Culture and Rest a half-hectare of land for a  term of 20 years and outfitted a site for the ship. Then it was  delivered to the site and now "preflight" work is at its height.    "The tourist `space voyage' is to last for two hours," says  Semen Lvov, general director of the AO. "The participants on the  journey will occupy seats in the comfortable passenger cabin of  the orbital ship. Then they will be familiarized with the  structure of the Buran and the conditions under which it  performs flight, learn about safety rules, will be able to  participate in flight control and assist the crew in warding off  a meteor attack. For some time they will experience a state of  weightlessness and then the illusion of flight will be  absolutely complete."    The ship has "entered" a circumterrestrial orbit. Now it is  time for a snack. Everyone is offered a dinner of real space  food. The menu consists of more than 100 dishes prepared at the  Institute of Nutrition for Space Technology for real cosmonauts.  All the foods are tasty, nutritious and ecologically pure.    "We will require 300 servings per day," continues Semen  Lvov.  "This is virtually a year's production for the institute.  Accordingly our attraction, it might be said, will save it from  bankruptcy and will prevent unemployment.    "Circus actors have been invited to fill the `jobs' of crew  members and in the course of the `play' their role will change.  They even will be extraterrestrial beings. The stewards and  stewardesses are now being recruited and trained. Incidentally,  the company is inviting young people and girls to participate in  the competition. Attractive and high-paying work in `space'  awaits the winners."    "The Buran passengers will receive personal tickets the same  as plane passengers. In addition, they will receive special  certificates as spaceflight participants. It goes without saying  that this is nothing more than a pleasing souvenir, but  nevertheless..."    "The `flight' will cost an average of 29.50 dollars (in  current rubles). The relatively high price for the most part is  attributable to the expensiveness of the food products. The cost  of the tickets varies, depending on the time of the flight  (evening flights are more costly), on the makeup of the  passengers (any sum may be charged for rich tourist groups).  Plans call for complementary `flights' -- for orphaned children,  for veterans of the Afghan war, etc."    "Advertisements of different Russian and foreign firms are  being placed on the Buran fuselage, on the chassis panels, on  the lighting towers and showcase displays. Even now the  director's office has received more than a few applications for  the placement of advertisements. The site of the attraction is  clearly visible from the Moscow River embankments and from the  Crimean Bridge, along which passes one of the heavily travelled  city routes -- the Sadovoye Ring. Between May and October  recreational ships pass up and down the river; one of the  wharves is situated on the grounds of the attraction. By  agreement with the leading tourist agencies the attraction will  be included in all tourist excursions. Incidentally, it is  planned that tickets for the `space flight' will be sold at all  airports in the world from which flights to Moscow are made."    "The cost of 1 square meter of advertisement on the fuselage  for six months is 3500 dollars or their equivalent in current  rubles. The cost is less for the chassis panels, lighting towers  and display showcases."    "We do not intend to transform the Buran into a messy  billboard," declared Yuriy Klebanov, the AO senior manager. "The  advertisement will be moderate, of excellent quality and taste.  If the number of applications exceeds the possibility for  placement of advertisements we will hold a competition for  advertisers. We wish that the spaceship -- one of the highest  attainments in world space technology -- will become a favorite  attraction for thousands of people."</p>

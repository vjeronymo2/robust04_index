			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Royal Trust down CDollars 243m ROYAL TRUST, the Canadian financial services group, hopes to shake off financial problems which have dogged it in recent years with a package of measures which include a deep dividend cut, an equity issue and a special loan-loss reserve. The Toronto-based company said all its operations, with the exception of those in the UK, were profitable. But write-downs on discontinued operations and the new bad-debt provision pushed the company to a third-quarter loss of CDollars 243m (USDollars 195m), or CDollars 1.68 a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 33m, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Royal Trust's share price closed down more than 15 per cent to CDollars 3.60 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. Its problems stem mainly from a disastrous expansion outside Canada in the late 1980s, including the acquisition of Dow Chemical's financial services arm and the purchase of a string of US west coast savings and loan institutions. The Seattle-based S&amp;Ls, brought together under Pacific First Bank, were sold last week for CDollars 663m. Third-quarter earnings include a write-down of CDollars 73m on the investment in Pacific First. However, Royal said the sale would strengthen its capital base by CDollars 195m, lifting its capital-to-assets ratio from 9.4 per cent to 12 per cent. The quarterly dividend has been halved to 5 cents a share and the board has approved a CDollars 200m equity issue. Terms will be announced later, but Royal said its controlling shareholder, Trilon Financial, had agreed to take up its share.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Poised for the big leap forward - The campaign for 'green labels' on wood products Confusion over the environmental acceptability of timber and wood products could soon be resolved as producers and consumers near an agreement on the need for a system to label wood from countries which take their ecological responsibilities seriously. The evidence of the last two months promises a remarkable advance on the weak code of practice for the conservation, management and use of forests, produced at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The International Tropical Timber Organisation - which has representatives from producer and consumer nations, as well as the timber trade - agreed at its annual meeting in Malaysia in May to research the possibilities of using labels to control the trade. 'I'm amazed that this is happening,' says Francis Sullivan, forest conservation officer of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the UK. 'People have gone from arguing about whether labelling should happen to how it should be organised.' The complex politics of the timber trade thwarted United Nations attempts at the Rio summit to create a treaty on how forests should be managed. Timber importers are caught in the middle of a passionate debate between the consumer nations, especially the US and EC states, and the producer nations, mainly in the tropics. The developed nations want developing countries, such as Malaysia and Brazil, to stop wholesale logging. They argue that the world needs the forests to help in climate control, provide habitats for indigenous people and maintain plant and animal diversity. Groups such as Friends of the Earth are threatening producer countries with trade boycotts unless they conform to management principles which will lead to the preservation of natural forests. The Netherlands is the first EC state to embody these sentiments in national policy. Developing nations, however, are angry at what they see as an intrusion into their sovereignty and right to exploit natural resources. Malaysia, using exports of its vast timber resources to build its economy, is the most eloquent and uncompromising voice in defence of producer nations. It asks why it should not be able to exploit its forests when western countries have all but destroyed their natural timber resources and are doing little to curb industrial pollution. The arguments are blurred by complexities such as the rights of indigenous forest peoples and accusations of human rights transgressions in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil. But the reality for timber importers is that their market in the west is under increasing pressure to get its products from sustainable sources. Conservation groups have called for a boycott of timber from unsustainable sources, mainly the tropics. Governments, notably in Germany and the Netherlands, have begun to specify alternatives to tropical hardwoods in building contracts. B&amp;Q, the UK's biggest DIY retailer, says that by 1995 it will only sell timber and wood from sustainable sources. Some countries and organisations are in the process of developing labelling systems so consumers can identify ecologically sound timber. The US-based Rainforest Alliance has developed the Smart Wood programme which grants a label to those producers that it has checked. Projekt Tropenwald is a voluntary initiative to provide information and certification of tropical timber sold in Germany. The Forest Stewardship Council, a predominantly WWF initiative backed by businesses such as B&amp;Q, wants to become an international council which will accredit companies that issue certificates to the timber trade. The African Timber Organisation, representing African producers, plans to start a labelling scheme to certify the origins of its products. While there appears to be plenty of agreement on the need for a single, universally recognised label, there is much disagreement about how to set up and police such a scheme. A big problem is for all sides to agree on a definition of sustainable forest management, including such issues as selective logging, maintenance of habitat, replanting and sharply reducing road building. Sceptics say it is impossible to manage natural forests in this way and all logging should stop. This is clearly not an option for many developing countries with few natural resources. But even if an acceptable definition of sustainable management can be agreed, verifying the source of timber and policing the verifiers poses immense problems. Verifiers will have to trace timber as it travels across continents. Developing nations do not like the idea of a western-based timber surveillance force operating on their soil. Nevertheless, many optimists, not least the existing international verifiers, such as Societe Generale de Surveillance, think a workable labelling system can be set up. How fast it can be developed, however, depends on how well producer and consumer nations co-operate. 'Ironically, setting up a labelling scheme is not the difficult part,' says Jean-Pierre Kiekens, a lecturer in development economics at the University of Brussels and a consultant on timber policy. 'The real problem is to bring tropical forests under proper management, which is a prerequisite to making sustainably produced timber available in big enough quantities.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin, branch director of the </F> Department for Information and the Press of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under "Smolenskaya  Square" rubric: "Legal Status of Russian Military Presence:  Moscow Is Filling the Vacuum of Power and Is Protecting  Russians"]    [Text] Under the conditions of the collective security  system that is being established in the framework of the CIS, of  particular urgency is the question of the presence of Russian  forces in the states that arose after the collapse of the former  USSR. As a result of the disintegration of the common military  area, a considerable share of the forces along with their  military equipment and gear ended up beyond the borders of  Russia. Today they exist in the form of groupings of forces or  individual military installations throughout practically the  entire territory of the former USSR. It is not difficult to  imagine the consequences, for example, of the withdrawal of  Russian forces from Tajikistan and of the failure of Russia to  fulfill its peacemaking functions in Abkhazia, South Ossetia,  Karabakh, and Moldova. In such an event, the fate of millions of  our compatriots and the local population living in the "hot  spots" of the CIS will be threatened. Nor should one fail to  take into account the essential lack of a dependable defense and  protection of the former external border of the USSR. This  concern, by the way, is also shared by many national leaders.    In addition, the vacuum would inevitably complicate Russia's  strategic military position and unavoidably would be filled by  forces unfriendly to Russia. Without doubt this would also  change the military-political landscape for other states. The  military presence of Russia in those and other regions is  essential for the purpose of protecting the economic interests  of Russia.    It is quite natural, considering the entire complex of  problems, that Russia cannot so easily leave the zone of its  traditional and direct influence at once. The risk would be too  great. But it cannot remain as an uninvited guest. The minister  of defense of the Russian Federation declared that by the end of  this year Russian military contingents will be withdrawn from  the territory of other states whatever the cost may be. But this  certainly does not mean that Russia is renouncing a military  presence in regions of its primary attention. From now on this  problem will be resolved through civilized methods with the  consent of those countries that request this; that is, it is a  matter of generally recognized forms of deploying forces in  foreign territory on a legal basis.    One of the forms of such a presence is the establishment of  Russian military bases in the territory of the countries of the  CIS on the basis of mutually acceptable agreements. Overall,  they may constitute elements of the general defensive area of  the Commonwealth and help to preserve unified systems in the  military infrastructure. An example is the protocal signed in  the course of B. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi that provides for  the establishment of military bases of the Russian Federation in  Vaziani, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. In the near future, a working  group of both sides will define questions in the support of the  military bases, the number of personnel, and the amount of  military equipment there. Their task is to guarantee the  security of Russia and the states of the Transcaucasian region  included in the Collective Security Treaty. The Georgian  leadership is making no secret of its interest in the presence  of Russian forces in Transcaucasia. It seems that they are also  inclined in this direction in Yerevan and Baku. It appears that  Armenia will sign an analogous document on the establishment of  a military base. There has already been preliminary consultation  on this question.    There has been some movement on military questions with  Kazakhstan. Experts have been assigned the task of working out a  treaty on military cooperation in the very near future, which  will reflect problems having to do with the withdrawal of  nuclear weapons to Russia. Negotitations are under way on the  future of Baykonur and other facilities and test ranges located  in the territory of Kazakhstan.    It appears that in the deployment of Russian forces in the  near abroad it is necessary above all to define their status.  They must guarantee the security interests of Russia without  intervening in the internal life of other states. At the same  time, with the agreement of the sides, it is possible to utilize  Russian forces as peacemaking forces in the settlement of  conflicts. There is nothing unnatural in this either, because  today only they are capable of ensuring a reduction of armed  actions and putting an end to bloodshed in the "hot spots."  Examples of this are the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, and  Tajikistan. Because of the specific nature of our relations in  the scope of the former Union and our knowledge of local  problems, it is much easier for Russia to carry out peacemaking  actions in these regions than for other states to do so. In  addition, it is not in the interests of Russia to allow the  presence of military contingents of third countries in the  territory of the states of the former USSR. It is a pity that  until now no UN mandate has been received, which, in addition to  everything else, would reduce the burden of our material outlays  for the performance of peacemaking operations.    The military presence of Russia in the near abroad will  require substantial subsidies from the state treasury for the  support of military and civilian personnel, the payment of rent  for the territories and premises, the housing and support of the  troops, the establishment of the infrastructure, the repair of  bases, etc. The total expenditures will depend to a considerable  extent upon the conditions of the deployment of the forces. In  the event that some state or other of the CIS is interested in  basing Russian forces in its territory, it is necessary to  strive for an equivalent distribution of expenditures for their  support on a parity basis.    A standard draft agreement worked out by the group could  serve as the basis for subsequent agreements on the basing of  Russian forces in the states of the Commonwealth. But it must  not be perceived as dogma. It is absolutely essential to take  into account the peculiarities of each country. In any  agreement, however, it is expedient to provide for articles  involving the financing of the troops and the interaction and  interrelationships of the Russian units with local authorities  and their army structures, including in the carrying out of  joint exercises and maneuvers, and about the Russian military  respecting the laws of the country where they are stationed and  the uninterrupted supplying of Russian military units and  installations.    It is also important to set forth positions on social and  material guarantees for the service personnel and the members of  their families taking into account the specific nature of the  places where they are deployed. For it is no secret that with  the introduction of national currencies the living standard of  our military people in service in the armed forces of former  Soviet republics declined dramatically, although there are  corresponding bilateral agreements in this respect. It is  therefore expedient to work out a mechanism for their  realization and to provide for sanctions in the event that the  agreements are not fulfilled.    In the preparation of documents of this kind, it is  desirable  to appeal to the experience of foreign armies. Nor should one  ignore the experience in the negotiations on the conditions for  the stay and withdrawal of Soviet forces from the countries of  Eastern Europe, putting into effect formulas that have already  been developed.    In foreign circles, the motives for the preservation of our  military presence in the states of the CIS are perceived in  different ways. Apparently, the politicians and analysts there  do not have a clear notion of the special role of the Russian  Army, whereas some are simply suspicious of Moscow's noble  intentions to establish conditions of stability along the entire  perimeter of the Russian borders. It is important to realize  that these bases do not threaten anyone. They are called upon to  protect the interests of the contracting states and peacemaking  actions. There is therefore scarcely any need to attribute  nonexisting "imperial ambitions" to Russia in the geopolitical  territory of the former USSR.    The establishment of Russian military bases fits very well  into the framework of the Collective Security Treaty of the CIS  as well as other bilateral agreements. Today it is merely a  matter of the implementation of the corresponding positions. The  legal basis for the deployment of Russian forces abroad is the  Law of the Russian Federation "On Defense," which permits the  stationing of troops and naval forces beyond its borders with  the consent of parliament. In addition, a fundamental principle  of their basing is the mutual interest of the sides, which does  not contradict Article 51 of the UN Charter providing for the  right of a state to individual or collective self-defense. The  experience of postwar Europe shows that this can have a  stabilizing influence on the situation in some country or other  and in the region.</p>

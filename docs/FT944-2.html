			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Reform of quango recruitment urged The government should surrender its powers of appointment to public bodies to an independent commission or parliamentary select committee, the British Medical Association said yesterday. There has been considerable criticism of appointments to bodies which run the National Health Service at local level. The government has been accused of favouring Tory party members, supporters of free-market economics and people with business rather than health backgrounds. There have also been complaints that the 1991 NHS reforms have made health authorities less accountable to the public by removing local authority representatives, the BMA said in a discussion paper.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Natural life in Deccieland - Lucia van der Post surveys the latest trends in interior design Domestic interior design, like all the unspoken languages that are part of our social fabric, is subject to the whims of fashion, but the time-scale is happily much slower than in the world of frocks. Few of us have the time, the energy or the money to change our houses or our interiors as frequently as we do our clothes and anyway it usually takes many years to put a home together. Nevertheless, it is clear that a fresher, cleaner, lighter approach to the domestic interior is emerging. Last week at Decorex, Deccieland's equivalent of the Paris catwalk shows and the event that no interior designer worth her chintz dare miss, all the new trends were on view. The show itself grows better and better - displays and room settings are beautifully organised and full of inspiration for those looking for fresh ideas - so it is a great pity that last year's attempt to allow the public in has not been followed up this year. Instead, the ideas will have to be filtered through the trade representatives who alone were allowed into the hallowed halls. For those who are nervous of speaking to interior designers, fearful that they are going to be persuaded to spend large sums of money on bizarre obelisks and peculiar tassels, the Interior and Decorators and Designers Association is there to help. The IDDA offers lots of advice on how to get the best from interior designers, what they can and should not be expected to do and how to look after the costs. Its free leaflet is called Why You Should Use an Interior Designer (write to IDDA, Crest House, 102-104 Church Road, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 8PY or tel. 081-977 1105). If you have an empty room and cannot wait to know what to do with it, I asked two interior designers, Jennifer Sisson of JPS Design, Brundish, Suffolk and Lavinia Dargie of Dargie Lewis Designs, London SW6 for their views. They spoke almost as one: natural is in. Jute, linen, cotton, silk are the 'in' fabrics. Jute and sisal come in floor coverings (nothing new) but also in fringes and tie-backs. Out go frou-frou window treatments and an over-abundance of paint effects. In come shutters, simple blinds and a more tailored look for curtains. Traditional paint colours are very in. Those with little to spend can cool down and simplify the interior by re-covering cushions in pale neutral colours, and using throws to change the mood of sofas and chairs instead of going to the expense of reupholstery. Above all, if in doubt, keep it simple.</p>

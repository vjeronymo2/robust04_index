			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Negotiations for the Sake of Negotiations"] </F>   [Text] As expected, the 12th round of Arab-Israeli  negotiations ended in Washington yesterday without achieving any  progress on any of the tracks. This is due to the fact that the  Israeli side is continuing its intransigent stands and policies,  which lack a real desire to submit to the principles of  international legitimacy.    It is well known that the 12th round was held after a  four-month hiatus in the Arab-Israeli negotiations during which  time many diplomatic efforts and contacts were exerted on the  highest official levels in order to get the parties together  again at the negotiating table in Washington. Hence, it was  logical to believe that the results of this round should come as  the crowning achievement of all these efforts and contacts.    However, certain things took place during the past two weeks  -- the timeframe for this round -- as if the negotiations in  Washington were a means in themselves. This was especially the  case for the U.S. cosponsor, which exerted intensive diplomatic  efforts to hold this round, even if was on the level of chief  delegates, in order to keep the peace process alive in spite of  Israeli signals that a step down the desired road would not be  taken.    Moreover, although there is already talk about holding a new  round of these negotiations in the middle of this month, we  question the usefulness of continuing such rounds, which waste  time and effort and whose lengthy sessions will not result in  cracking open even a small hole in the wall of Israel's  intransigent stand. We also question the purpose of continuing  such rounds without any signs that their continuation will serve  the interest of peace in the Middle East.    As we are already aware that the U.S. stand will continue to  be that of an observer rather than an effective mediator, we  doubt the use of continuing such a formula of negotiations, even  if it takes place behind closed doors and away from the press  and the media. This calls for a real review of the current  policy of negotiations and an examination of more practical  alternatives. Perhaps this would place the Middle East on the  track of desired peace rather than the track of negotiations for  the sake of negotiations.</p>

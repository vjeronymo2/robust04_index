			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Belgium visits the top of the table Two of last week's global equity leaders, Finland and Malaysia, lead the World Index performance tables this year but the third - Belgium - is a more occasional visitor. The Brussels equity market started this year well, notes Mr Thierry Quincerot at Williams de Broe in London but, in April and May, it was punished for its earlier speculation; fears were provoked by a domestic political crisis which came to a head in March. Last week, however, and in spite of denials from the top, stories circulated that the government was about to let the Belgian franc float; there were good results from Electrabel and Tractebel, two of the country's heavily weighted utility groups; and even an initially bearish reaction to losses from the Luxembourg-based steelmaker, Arbed, was more than recovered by Friday. In the east, the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange's composite index hit yet another high last Friday, supported by expectations of an expansionary budget at the end of this month. Mr David Bates, of Asia Equity, says that last week's cut in the Malaysia's monthly inflation rate has domestic investors believing that the corporation tax rate could be cut from 34 to 32 per cent. Mr Bates adds that November's ruling party elections are expected to indicate continuity in present government policies, and that the market has a lot of liqudity with which to chase prices up. However, he reckons, it has to be the dearest in the region on a 1994 p/e ratio of 21, and on estimated 10 per cent earnings per share growth - the slowest in Asia at the moment. Finland tops the world rankings in local currency terms although, measured by the dollar, it is outpaced by Malaysia which has a harder currency, and which accelerated in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs still likes the Helsinki market for its prospects of profit recovery, lower interest rates, and on technical grounds.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change   % change in               % change in local currency**     sterling**  US Dollars**            1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                         1993      1993         1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +1.80    -5.00    +20.31   +22.11    +21.17      +20.49 Belgium      +3.38    -2.08    +20.54   +17.98    +11.76      +11.12 Denmark      +1.30    -1.65    +31.40   +29.85    +24.15      +23.46 Finland      +3.28    +3.46   +141.70   +76.51    +58.97      +58.08 France       +0.96    -1.18    +25.00   +17.60    +14.89      +14.24 Germany      +1.20    -0.67    +27.70   +23.16    +22.99      +22.29 Ireland      +2.25    -2.64    +49.29   +40.35    +24.66      +23.96 Italy        +1.21    -5.89    +82.63   +43.67    +33.80      +33.06 Netherlands  +2.02    +0.57    +25.84   +23.54    +23.39      +22.69 Norway       +0.57    -3.62    +40.32   +27.18    +24.00      +23.30 Spain        +2.32    -2.24    +58.49   +34.79    +17.91      +17.25 Sweden       +1.54    +2.09    +75.27   +31.31    +15.45      +14.80 Switzerland  +1.14    +1.18    +31.94   +20.57    +24.74      +24.03 UK           +0.98    -0.70    +21.49    +8.63     +8.63       +8.02 EUROPE       +1.26    -0.82    +29.36   +17.77    +15.90      +15.26  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +1.13    +1.03    +29.01   +22.30    +15.79      +15.13 Hong Kong    +1.93    +2.70    +33.54   +37.57    +38.45      +37.67 Japan        +0.05    -3.87    +24.53   +23.69    +46.52      +45.69 Malaysia     +3.90    +3.38    +72.70   +56.49    +61.54      +60.64 New Zealand  +0.12    -2.84    +45.76   +29.90    +40.02      +39.24 Singapore    +3.01    +1.51    +57.32   +34.98    +40.75      +39.97  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       +0.24    -3.70    +12.12   +10.49     +5.63       +5.03 USA          +0.76    +0.00    +11.08    +5.88     +6.48       +5.88 Mexico       +0.15    -4.98    +33.89    +1.35     +1.99       +1.41 South Africa +1.38    -4.24    +19.52   +19.05    +38.89      +38.10  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  +0.72    -1.45    +20.38   +14.69    +20.27      +19.60  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on October 1st 1993.

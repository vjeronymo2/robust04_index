			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Lone Dane in Maastricht campaign AT 6.55am today, at the fish auction in Skagen, Danish foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen was due to begin a six-day campaign to persuade Danes to say Yes to the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. His 33-meeting campaign, by far the most energetic by any politician, may have a crucial influence on the vote in a referendum on June 2. Opinion polls indicate that the result could go either way. Mr Ellemann-Jensen begins his campaign after a week in which he forced Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, to deny a rumour that he and his staff were considering a plan to limit the influence of the EC's smaller nations. Denmark will be the first of the EC countries to approve or reject Maastricht, and only one other country, Ireland, will be holding a referendum. 'It is not Europe's future which is at stake. If Denmark says No, we shall see a new Maastricht Treaty with 11 signatures, and in practice a new Rome Treaty with 11 signatures,' he predicted. Among other things, Denmark, one of the Community's largest agricultural exporters, would risk losing the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy, he said. If the vote is No, the Danish government will ask the other governments for a renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty, but Mr Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister since 1982, regards renegotiation as a non-starter. 'The treaty is a Pandora's box which no one wants to open. So we shall have to see what we can save from the wreckage.' Pro-Maastricht politicians in the opposition Social Democratic party say the foreign minister's enthusiasm for Europe and his plain-speaking about the consequences of rejection amount to scaremongering and may help to ensure that the treaty is voted down. But their party, which favours the treaty, seems to have given up. Its recently elected leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has only four public appearance meetings on his calender for the coming two weeks, and two of those have nothing directly to do with Maastricht. 'It is not surprising if I am beginning to feel somewhat lonely on the barricades,' says the foreign minister European opinion polls consistently show the Danes to be among the most sceptical about the European Community, but Mr Ellemann-Jensen regards this as misleading. It is connected with the fact that the Danes take themselves seriously. 'We have more thorough debates than anyone, amounting almost to self-torture. There is no other country where the Maastricht Treaty has been examined in every detail, as it has in Denmark, both before and after it was signed. 'But I might discreetly remind you that we are the nation that tops the list of those who live up to their obligations. We are the country which has gone furthest in introducing the rules for the internal market and which has the fewest cases brought against it in the European Court.' Danish doubts about European union he ascribes partly to past failures to draw attention to the political aspects of European co-operation. In 1972, when there was a referendum on joining the EC, the issue was pork prices, and in 1986, when there was a referendum to approve the Single European Act, the issue was competitiveness. 'So it is something new when we now come clean and explain that it is primarily a political question. It has caused a good deal of confusion.' In both 1972 and 1986 opinion polls also showed the voters to be sceptical, but when it came to the point there were large majorities in favour. And in 1992, 'I am convinced we shall see a Yes,' says Mr Ellemann-Jensen.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Italy scraps its last post-war price curbs THE final vestiges of the system of price controls imposed by Italy's early post-war governments have been removed. As of yesterday the price of bread and milk, as well as cement and fertilisers, was liberalised. The inter-ministerial prices committee, Cip, will however continue to monitor the behaviour of the price of these items, reserving the right to intervene if prices are raised unnecessarily. The decision, in line with EC demands, was welcomed by traders' associations and manufacturers. However, consumers' associations warned that both producers and traders would seek to take advantage of the liberalisation to raise prices. Inflation is running at 4.5 per cent a year. Exports from five Italian regions of Parma ham, Gorgonzola cheese, salami and other meats and dairy produce came under an EC ban yesterday to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease, Reuter reports from Brussels. EC officials said the ban, until the end of March, would apply to meats processed since February 1 and dairy products. Some 4,000 head of cattle, pigs, sheep and goats have been slaughtered in Italy since foot-and-mouth was detected on February 28 following imports of diseased cattle from Croatia.</p>

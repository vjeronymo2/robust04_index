			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk valued at Pounds 79m in 150p share offer INVERESK, the Scotland-based speciality paper maker, is valued at Pounds 78.8m in a placing and intermediaries offer launched yesterday, with shares being issued at 150p. The company, which was bought out by its management from Georgia-Pacific in 1990, is going public in order to expand and, over time, to make acquisitions. It operates four mills, three in eastern Scotland and one in Somerset, making speciality types of paper. The offer will raise Pounds 32.1m. Of this Pounds 7.8m will be used to pay off preference shares and outstanding borrowing, leaving about Pounds 2m to help finance future expansion. After the issue Inveresk will be without debt and will have unutilised borrowing facilities of Pounds 20m. On the basis of historic earnings per share of 11.5p for the year to November 28 1992, the offer values the company at 13 time earnings. Notional net dividend per share last year was 5p, producing a yield of 4.2 per cent. Of the 22.6m shares being issued, some 14.7m are being placed with institutions and 7.9m are offered to directors, employees and intermediaries. Directors are retaining 85 per cent of their holdings and, with employees, will own 26 per cent of the company after the issue. Existing institutional shareholders will own 23 per cent. COMMENT Inveresk is floating without a profits forecast and with an operating profits line that does not soar upwards. But that is good by the standards of the paper industry over the last three years. As an MBO company it paid off its debt rapidly and invested in plant improvements. Having recently extricated itself from high volume, commodity sectors of the paper market, it is purely a niche operator with a broad spread of products and customers. Pulp represents only 30 per cent of total costs. It now has a low cost base and enjoys operational gearing in spare capacity to take advantage of the economic upturn in the UK. Management is experienced, though not necessarily in making acquisitions, which it intends to do. Opinion is divided on whether Inveresk will itself be taken over, but that is not its intention. The placing has proved popular with institutions looking for a stock which will benefit from this stage of the cycle and allocations have been much smaller than those asked for. The issue is fairly priced at a modest discount to the market on a historic p/e ratio of 13, which could easily go to 15 when trading begins.</p>

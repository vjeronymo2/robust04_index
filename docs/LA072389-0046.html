			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA PROPAGANDA?  </P> <P> The blood hasn't dried on Tian An Men Square and you already beat the drum for  renewed tourist trade for China ("In Wake of Turmoil, China Still Holds  Surprises," July 16). Elizabeth Mehren's thinly disguised propaganda is not far  from disgusting. I know Guangzhou, which is, to put it mildly, an unremarkable  city. What's the hurry to invite Americans and their dollars back to visit that  or any other part of China?  </P> <P> FRANK DESSAYER  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

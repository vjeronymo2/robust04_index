			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 1 -- The government economic committee  and the government socio-political committee Friday supported a  legislative draft which, if adopted by the government and passed  by parliament, will significantly change labour law and labour  relations in Poland.    The draft is the most extensive and weighty amendment ever  introduced to the labour code enacted in 1974. The new  proposals have been tailored to the realities of a market  economy and designed to make the labour law compatible with  international standards.    The general idea behind the draft amendments is to restrict  state intervention into labour relations and give greater  freedom of negotiating labour terms and conditions to the  parties concerned, that is trade unions and employers as well as  individual employees.    The provisions of the draft define only minimal obligations  and duties of both parties to a labour contract, leaving the  rest to direct negotiations.    According to Labour Minister Leszek Miller, the amendments  enhance the position of employees in some respects. For  instance, the draft guarantees the right to severance pay to  retiring workers and sets a minimum extra pay for night work.  Both proposals are a novelty in the Polish labour legislation.    The amendments also make labour law more flexible than it  has  been to date, particularly with regard to work schedules and  hours.    The draft tries to secure a better symmetry of the rights  and  obligations of employers and employees.    Under the draft provisions, the shortest paid vacation leave  would be 18 days instead of the present 14 days. One other  change consists in extending the status of employers to  individuals who are not legal persons. This would be of  particular importance to family businesses.    During their Friday session both government committees  examined the most important criticisms addressed to the draft  amendments by trade union federations.</p>

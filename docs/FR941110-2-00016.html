			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSK argues that assessment of antidumping duties must be imposed on an entry-by-entry basis only on unliquidated entries. NSK asserts that the Department has no statutory authority to assess total antidumping duties (covering liquidated and unliquidated entries) over unliquidated entries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As outlined in the Department's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 63696 (December 5, 1991)), with respect to exporter's sale price (ESP) assessment, the Department has experienced significant difficulties in issuing liquidation instructions to Customs in cases involving large volumes of ESP entries. Several factors contribute to this difficulty: (1) the lag between entry date and sale date in ESP transactions, (2) the fungibility of the product, (3) the volume of transactions reviewed, and (4) the parties' own inability to link entries to sales or to provide the Department with the documentation to do so. Given these difficulties, as noted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Department has explored various alternative methods of issuing ESP assessment instructions. Such alternatives, and variations, include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When entry data are available, the Department can derive a per-unit margin by dividing the calculated dumping duties due (based on sales) by the number of units entered and then instruct Customs to apply the per-unit margin against all units entered during the review period. Similarly, the Department can derive a percentage margin by dividing the calculated dumping duties due (based on sales) by the entered value of the merchandise entered during the POR and then instruct Customs to apply this percentage margin against the entered Customs value of merchandise entered during the POR. This proposed methodology simplifies and streamlines assessment and liquidation dramatically, yet still enables Customs to collect the exact amount of dumping duties due on ESP sales that occurred during the review periods (although the lag between entry and sale dates in an ESP situation will still make assessment problematic). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When entry data are not available, we can derive a percentage margin by dividing the calculated dumping duties due (based on sales) by the net USP (which is our best calculation of the entered value of the merchandise entered during the POR), and then instruct Customs to apply that percentage margin against the Customs value of suspended entries of merchandise entered during the POR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Department can derive a per-unit dumping margin by dividing the calculated dumping duties on ESP sales that occurred during the POR by the number of units sold and then apply the per-unit margin against all units entered during the POR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have evaluated these options in the context of these reviews covering entries from 1979 through 1986. We have determined that absolute assessment (option 1), as advocated by Timken, is not feasible for these reviews. Collection of the entered value of suspended entries of covered merchandise requires an amount of precision on a country-wide scale that, though possible for current ongoing reviews given today's level of electronic database maintenance, is clearly not feasible for the time periods in question in these reviews. Also, other than a limited number of Yamaha entries and the single instance cited by Timken ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Customs HQ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), we have no evidence that any entries of covered TRBs were incorrectly liquidated. Timken's concern about possible incorrectly liquidated entries is also unfounded conjecture and not based on substantial evidence. We disagree with Timken that these concerns constitute compelling reasons to use the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AFBs III <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  methodology. As for Timken's concern that TRBs entered as a part of a multi-product shipment may escape coverage of the finding, there is no evidence on the record to support this conclusion. Further, this option is not feasible because we did not ask the respondents for the entered value data necessary to implement this approach, and do not believe it appropriate to do so now, given the age of the reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since option 1 is not feasible, we have considered options 2 and 3. In order to be consistent with the Department's practice outlined in the second administrative review of the AFB orders ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Antifriction Bearings from the Federal Republic of Germany <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 28395, June 24, 1992) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AFBs II <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), we will calculate POR-specific appraisement rates using option 2, and we will instruct Customs to assess dumping duties on the entered value of suspended entries of covered TRBs during each POR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Timken notes that cash deposits were not required for Koyo and NSK until the completion of the first administrative review in June 1990. Timken maintains that the Department, in each of the administrative results of review issued to date in this case, has refused to assess interest on antidumping duties secured by bonds rather than cash deposits. Timken acknowledges that the CIT has upheld the Department's determination not to assess interest and notes that Timken has appealed those decisions to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timken Company <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  15 CIT 526, 777 F.Supp. 20 (1991),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> aff'd after remand, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  819 F.Supp. 1093 (CIT March 4, 1993),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> appeal docketed, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fed. Cir. No. 93&hyph;1312 (April 16, 1993)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken asserts that section 778(a) of the Tariff Act contemplates collection of interest on all ``underpayments of amounts deposited on merchandise entered'' and that the Department's rationale for distinguishing entries secured by bonds, as opposed to cash deposits, distorts the statutory purpose and benefits those respondents that failed to make cash deposits of estimated duties. Timken requests that the Department address this issue once again in these final results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK argues that the Tariff Act, the Department's practice, and judicial precedent hold that no interest is assessable on entries covered by bonds rather than cash deposits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo counters that Timken raises no new arguments in this review in support of its position and that unless and until the Department's longstanding interpretation of the Tariff Act is rejected by the Federal Circuit, the Department should continue to instruct Customs not to assess interest on antidumping duties secured by bond when liquidating the entries subject to these reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

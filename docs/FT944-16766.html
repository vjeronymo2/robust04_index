			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Stores pump up the volume: The battle for petrol sales In a new television advertisement, the engine leaps out of a car, zooms to the nearest BP garage and fills itself with petrol. The message of the advertisement, devised by Mr Joe Johnston, the Hollywood director of Honey I Shrunk the Kids fame, is supposed to be that cars know BP is the best, and best-value, place to buy petrol. As it was launched, Mr Rolf Stomberg, chief executive of BP Oil Europe, said BP was backing the campaign by matching at selected outlets the cheap prices of petrol sold by supermarkets. 'We are fed up with the growth in volumes achieved by hypermarkets and the erosion of our market share,' he said. 'We are taking them on.' BP's promise to match supermarket petrol prices is the latest skirmish in a long battle between the big oil companies and supermarket chains. Since the late 1980s, large retailers such as Sainsbury, Safeway, Tesco and Asda have opened more than 500 supermarket filling stations. Although they account for only a fraction of the total of 19,000 petrol stations in the UK, supermarket filling stations have increased their volume share of the retail petrol market from 6 per cent to almost 20 per cent within the last three years by selling at a discount. But the likelihood of a protracted price war in the UK is small. Many in the industry doubt that BP will be able to halt erosion of its market share for long. 'Supermarket prices will always be below those of the major brands,' said one industry observer. 'They are trying to stop the unstoppable.' Supermarkets have a number of advantages over the oil companies. Their market share is such that their purchasing power at the refineries is similar to that of the marketing arms of the oil companies themselves. The high volumes purchased means they enjoy good credit terms from refineries. By concentrating on a few high-volume sites, they can use large, economical tankers to fill large storage tanks. Oil companies typically have to pay a dealer or tenant to run their site, whereas supermarkets have to pay only a cashier. No supermarket sites are more than a few years old, so there is little need for the costly maintenance required at the generally older company-owned stations. There are also environmental clean-up costs at the latter when they are closed or refurbished. Those advantages allow supermarkets to offer average savings of about 3p a litre according to figures from Opal Oil Price Assessments, which monitors retail fuel markets in Europe. Intense local competition usually means the differential at company stations near a supermarket outlet falls to about 1p a litre. That local competition has also added to a widening of price differentials. Figures from Opal show that the highest price of four-star petrol was 61.9p a litre last week compared with a low of 52.9p and a supermarket average of 54.2p. In addition to lowering prices in some areas, the main response of the oil companies has been to question the quality of the petrol sold by the supermarkets. Even though all the petrol sold by supermarkets comes from refineries owned by the oil companies, it previously did not contain additives to make it flow more smoothly and prolong engine life. Sainsbury began mixing additives to its petrol last year, and other retailers are following suit. A better route for improving the profitability of oil company petrol stations is to take on the retailers at their own game - selling consumer goods. Oil groups are finding that adding pop-in, top-up shopping outlets can transform the profitability of sites previously dependent on low-margin petrol sales. According to a report from Corporate Intelligence, the turnover in petrol forecourt shops was Pounds 1.7bn in 1992 and is growing at more than 10 per cent a year. Shell, for example, is opening five convenience stores a week, and has begun promoting its stations as retail outlets, advertising price promotions on such products as Coca-Cola. Groups including BP, Mobil and Texaco are doing the same. At the same time, retailers are encroaching increasingly on to oil companies' territory. With scope for building new superstores shrinking, Tesco has opened two standalone petrol stations in London, both with 2,000 sq ft Tesco Express convenience stores attached. Sainsbury is reported to be looking for petrol station sites, too. Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based oil market analysts, published a report in August suggesting supermarkets were poised to become significant retailers of petrol. That could make dropping into filling stations for an extra pint of milk or loaf of bread commonplace. It also means future price battles between retailers and oil companies may not just be about petrol, but about soft drinks, crisps and baked beans.</p>

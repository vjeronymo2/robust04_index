			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Conversion on the road to capitalism: Ukrainian coupons and the art of motorcycle maintenance Mr Yakov Eisenberg, director of Khartron, one of the two factories where guidance systems for the Soviet Union's space and nuclear weapons programmes were designed, is trying to muster enthusiasm for a new product: an orange plastic, public transport token. In his office in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, he says with rather forced gaiety: 'The scientist who came up with this had a really good idea, and I am proud to say that I was part of the group that helped to make this token a reality.' Holding the token to the light, he explains that it is much cheaper to produce than the old, metal token and even harder to fake, because it contains a sensitive metal strip. But then Mr Eisenberg sighs deeply and explains: 'Of course, this sort of thing is just a hobby for us. Our real work is to design guidance systems for nuclear missiles and space shuttles. We are as good at that as anyone in the world. But now we have no more orders.' Sighs like Mr Eisenberg's can be heard all over Ukrainian factories, as managers of some of the world's most sophisticated arms plants struggle to adjust to the end of the cold war and the disintegration of their largest market, the Soviet Union. The pervasive mood at many defence factories, once the most cosseted and prestigious sector of the economy, is one of bitter nostalgia. For the Ukrainian government, striving to secure the new nation's independence, conversion of the factories to civilian uses poses one of country's most serious political and economic challenges. More than 1.5m Ukrainian workers and as much as 40 per cent of the country's industrial production were devoted to making arms when the Soviet Union existed. That is roughly equivalent to the number employed by American defence industry, but Ukraine's population is only 52m, compared with 249m in the US. The government's attitude towards conversion is ambivalent. Officials in the capital, Kiev, realise that military factories, many of which are standing idle but receiving state credits to maintain their workforces, are a drain on the national budget and one reason why the inflation rate is running at about 50 per cent a month. But the government is unwilling simply to cut off the credits - loans which are rarely repaid - and force those enterprises which are unable to convert to consumer products to close. Mr Vitalii Shmarov, deputy prime minister responsible for the defence industry, says: 'We cannot just allow all of this tremendous technological potential to die. If we do, our country will be reduced to the level of a third world nation.' Mr Shmarov wants to allow some factories to carry on making arms to sell abroad, and at the same time to subsidise others so that they can switch to high-tech manufacturing. However, Ukraine's parlous financial condition means the government's room for manoeuvre is extremely limited. Economically, it cannot afford to keep paying the credits; politically it cannot afford to stop them. The Malyshev tank factory in Kharkiv, which makes the sophisticated Soviet T-84 tank, illustrates the squeeze facing the government. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, arms, principally tanks, accounted for 70 per cent of the plant's output. But Mr Hennadi Levchenko, manager, says that since the first quarter of 1992 he has not received a single order from Moscow for tanks. Mr Levchenko and his workforce are trying to adapt: they have started to make motorcycles and machines designed to extinguish oil-well fires. The latter are tanks with water cannon mounted where the gun turrets would normally be. So far, sales have not covered costs. Mr Levchenko, who has kept a big stained-glass hammer and sickle in the foyer of his factory, admits: 'Our civilian products are only bringing us losses.' So how is the Malyshev factory surviving? 'We live on credits,' Mr Levchenko concedes, estimating his factory's total 1993 debt at 12bn Ukrainian coupons (Dollars 1.5m), most of it borrowed from the government at an interest rate lower than inflation and unlikely ever to be repaid. Even though the Malyshev factory is in the red and operating at just over half its capacity, it maintains a workforce of 25,000. Mr Levchenko is proud of providing his workers with 19 daycare centres, a recreation building and two holiday health spas. He complains that the government has not given him enough money to finish building a sports stadium. For Mr Levchenko, conversion to non-military production is a waste of time anyway. His main aim is to keep his workforce intact until the government decides to build more tanks, preferably for countries in the new Commonwealth of Independent States. He wishes that the Ukrainian military still formed part of the Soviet armed forces. If the split had not happened, as the Soviet Union broke up in December 1991, he could have carried on supplying the entire Soviet Union with tanks, he says. Now, Mr Levchenko hopes for the day when 'the Ukrainian army becomes a real army and asks our factory to build it some new tanks'. The Ukrainian minister of defence should, he says, 'be pounding his fist on the table and demanding money for new weapons'. Such views are shared by other managers of defence plants in eastern and southern Ukraine, where many of the region's leading designers and manufacturers of nuclear weaponry are located. Some western observers suggest they are lobbying for a nuclear Ukraine. Mr Markian Bilinsky, a British international affairs academic, says: 'Can you imagine the feelings of loss of prestige of factories switching from making some of the best military technology in the world to making ice-cream machines?' In the south, in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, workers who once built inter-continental ballistic missiles, for which Mr Eisenberg's enterprise designed the guidance systems, are now producing machines to dry rose petals for perfume. Further west in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea, the shipyard that produced all of the Soviet Union's aircraft carriers is switching to oil tankers - which are more lucrative but considered so easy to build that the factory manager dismissively refers to them as 'mere empty boxes'. But despite the reluctance of many former arms makers to change either their products or their methods, there is a groundswell of private enterprise which is gaining momentum. It is being prodded along by men like construction company owner Mr Stepan Erdik, who thinks there could be a western market for the Malyshev factory's four-wheel motorcycles. He has found a western partner, and they are buying 1,000 vehicles to sell in the UK and North America. Although Mr Erdik, whose primary business is building houses and offices, has only 300 employees, in contrast with Mr Levchenko's 25,000, it is the former who is providing the finance for some imported motorcycle parts. He also foots the bill when Mr Levchenko travels to trade fairs in the west. Mr Erdik does not share Mr Levchenko's nostalgia for Ukraine's once mighty defence sector. 'What is conversion?' he asks rhetorically. 'It is when factories that made goods which were not needed by the people are forced to make goods which the people want. I do not care if I am selling a tank or a toy. What matters to me is whether people want to buy it.'</p>

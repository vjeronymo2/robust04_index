The incident took place yesterday 22 February at a  place called Gasata on the outskirts of Kigali. The RPF leaders  who had been on their way to Kigali decided to turn back after  reaching Ngondole because of the worsening security situation in  Kigali. The RPF escort unit, together with UNAMIR troops,  decided to continue to Kigali, but were stopped by an abrupt  roadblock at Gasata, near Kigali, and before the vehicles could  stop they were spread with bullets from the nearby houses. The  two vehicles, that of RPF soldiers and UNAMIR overturned,  seriously injuring one RPF soldier. The injured soldier was  rushed to King Faysal in Kigali which is used by the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda.    President Habyarimana's intention to kill RPF leaders  (?just)  after the assassination of PSD [Social Democatic Party]  secretary general, the late Felicien Gatabazi, intended to deal  a blow to the opposition parties and to the implementation of  the Arusha agreement.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Management: Measuring up to success - Growing numbers of UK companies are turning to benchmarking to improve their performance Benchmarking - the practice of comparing business practices between companies - has come of age in the UK. More than three-quarters of the UK's top 1,000 companies claim to use benchmarking to assess and improve their performance, according to a recent Gallup survey. Such findings should perhaps be treated with caution. The success of management fashions is often exaggerated by the efforts of publicity-seeking pioneers, business-hungry consultants and the natural unwillingness of managers to admit to pollsters that they are neglecting state-of-the-art management practices. Nonetheless the benchmarking success stories are the stuff of management textbooks. Rover halved its test times after benchmarking against Honda. Lucas Industries cut the number of shopfloor grades four-fold following a benchmarking exercise against a German plant. British Rail cut the time taken to clean a train to eight minutes after benchmarking against British Airways. But despite the enthusiasm about benchmarking, there is little consensus about how best to do it. Even the meaning of the term causes 'considerable confusion', according to the Gallup survey, conducted on behalf of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the CBI. Knowing where to start can be daunting for newcomers, particularly if they are unwilling to spend large sums on management consultancy. The old hands make it sound easy. 'Benchmarking is so simple. It is just like a business meeting. The most effective benchmarking is to sit with another professional and talk,' says Shaun Pantling of Rank Xerox, a subsidiary of Xerox, the US copier company which pioneered benchmarking in the early 1980s. When Rank Xerox decided to improve its call handling, it approached companies with a strong reputation for answering calls quickly such as the RAC and British Gas. 'We have re-engineered our call handling as a result,' says Pantling. British Airways also makes benchmarking sound simple. When it wanted to improve the service on its frequent-flier programme, it visited the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok - renowned for pampering its guests - to pick up tips on how to record details of its customers' preferences. When it wanted to improve its passenger handling areas, it analysed its weak points and then studied some of its rivals. Benchmarking against a company which appears to be the best at a particular activity is the most popular option for large, confident companies. 'If you benchmark against mediocrity, you end up with mediocrity,' says Pantling. But it is not necessarily the best option for smaller, less experienced companies. Studies in the US, Japan and Germany have found that inexperienced companies which try to match the techniques of world-class performers often make things worse by trying to do too much, too soon. In any case, small, obscure companies are generally unable to ask leading companies to benchmark with them. 'A small, not well-known company would find it difficult to knock on Marks and Spencer's door and say 'will you benchmark with us'. It tends to end up with small and medium-sized companies benchmarking with each other,' says Graham Whitney of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. One solution to the problem of finding a benchmarking partner is to join a club or network. Over the last 18 months, a number of these groups has sprung up to provide companies with a pool of willing partners. The main disadvantage of a club is that it tends to restrict the number of potential partners. But even experienced benchmarkers, with large networks of contacts, find that belonging to a club makes benchmarking simpler. 'There are a lot of advantages of a club when it comes to finding the right contact within an organisation,' says Barry Povey, a quality management consultant at IBM. Most of the large management consultants also have benchmarking divisions, which draw on their large client bases for potential partners. Price Waterhouse, for instance, runs a Customer Excellence Benchmarking Club, which has 45 members. Another large group of benchmarking clubs is run by trade associations. The British Footwear Manufacturing Association has organised two clubs to look at factory performance and pre-production engineering and design. Many were started as a result of the DTI's Benchmarking Challenge, which last November awarded Pounds 500,000 to 13 trade associations to set up benchmarking clubs. These clubs generally focus on providing industry trends; firms tend to be reluctant to divulge information on their processes to competitors. Benchmarking against other companies in the same industry is the most popular form of benchmarking, practised by 80 per cent of large companies, according to Gallup. But the information offered is usually limited and it rarely helps companies identify radically innovative practices. More often, clubs offer companies the chance to benchmark against companies in other industries. For example, the Benchmarking Centre, which was set up in Hemel Hempstead a year ago, has 40 companies including SmithKline Beecham, TSB, IBM and ICL. The centre puts companies together in pairs or in groups to examine issues such as management information systems, supply chains, customer satisfaction, human resources and productivity. Both the management and the members of the club say its strengths lie in the loyalty and support that members can give each other. 'It is a place where we can go for help, where we can go for information, where we can go for like-minded companies which will share information and results,' says Gordon Cossar of Dexion, a shelving manufacturer. Yet finding a willing partner is just part of the battle. A problem that has dogged benchmarking from its inception is whether the comparisons of particular activities between companies have any validity. Even apparently straightforward measures such as the productivity of a finance or personnel department can be complicated. 'Why one company has a bigger personnel department than another is to do with complexity, staff turnover ratio and culturally driven factors about how highly companies value people,' says Keith Roberts of PIMS, a management consultancy which runs the PIMS Benchmarking Council. If companies use inappropriate benchmarks, it can raise unrealistic expectations on the part of senior management that can lead to dejection within the ranks of a company. 'There have been cases of chief executives using it as a weapon to bash their business,' says Roberts. 'There is a danger that people will become disillusioned.' Another potential morale problem arises when the benchmarking exercise concentrates on productivity or financial performance. 'There is a great chance that if people are being measured on a financial basis, they do get paranoid about their jobs,' says Steve Wright of Brown &amp; Root, the engineering group. Another potential pitfall for companies embarking on benchmarking is insufficient preparation. Too often, benchmarking has meant unfocused visits to companies and factories, a practice consultants dismiss as 'industrial tourism'. 'A lot of people try benchmarking and fail miserably. They are not prepared. They don't understand their own processes before they visit a company,' says Marcus Boyle of Arthur Andersen, the management consultants. This point is echoed by Glen Peters of Price Waterhouse. 'One of the mistakes people make is that they don't look at themselves in the mirror. They need to do a thorough benchmark on themselves.' Some companies find the process of self-examination one of the most useful aspects of benchmarking. 'What I found useful about the exercise was as much the exercise itself - the discipline of classifying our processes and putting numbers on it - as the report at the end,' says Steve Wright, continuous improvement manager of Brown &amp; Root, who took part in a benchmarking club organised by PIMS, which examined the costs of personnel functions. Many managers play down the importance of the benchmarking report. The reports that emerge from benchmarking studies are often treated with a degree of caution. This information - on how a company compares with the average score of the other companies within the group on a particular activity - may be useful in alerting companies to weaknesses, but should not be taken too literally. 'Classic, cost-based benchmarking projects where there is not adequate analysis of performance are dangerous,' says Alan Braithwaite of LCP, which runs a benchmarking network set up with the Cranfield School of Management and Logistics. 'It can be a wild goose chase.' Whitney concurs. 'If people just focus on numbers they get frustrated because it does not address how they achieved better performances,' he says. Too much effort is put into number-crunching and diagnosing the area that needs change and not enough into thinking about to improve the processes. The emphasis should be on learning, rather than just comparison. The possibility of learning from other companies is dependent on a degree of openness. 'The major gains come if you loosen the confidentiality,' says Boyle. But frequently companies are simply not willing to be open. When Price Waterhouse announced plans to hold a forum of all its benchmarking club members across Europe in October to exchange ideas on best practice, it found that about half the club was reluctant to take part. 'People are very guarded. I get more information from people on an unattributable basis,' says Peters. But on balance, the openness, rather than the secrecy, of companies is remarkable. Companies that are enthusiastic benchmarkers often point to public relations benefits, which outweigh their concern about giving away information to competitors. 'The information gets to our competitors; it also gets to our customers,' says Cossar. Benchmarking 'is part of the image of Rank Xerox as being a quality organisation,' says Pantling. Even companies which claim to be highly-proficient at certain processes claim to benefit from exchanging ideas and information. 'Generally if someone wants to benchmark you always learn something,' says Pantling.</p>

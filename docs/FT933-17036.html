			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Brussels unveils its policy of glasnost INFORMATION provided by the European Commission will from now on consist of 'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth', pledged Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, commissioner for internal political relations, announcing Brussels' long-awaited new strategy of openness. He hailed the new policy as 'a milestone' and 'a democratic approach', after which the Commission would present information to the public and the media on demand, speedily and without 'techno-babble'. The measure is intended to clean up the image of the EC in general, and of the Commission in particular. All Commission documents would eventually be made available, he said, once a system had been put in place to 'distinguish between those which are and aren't' official policy. Draft documents, which reveal the preliminary policy thinking of the EC's quasi-executive, should also be open to scrutiny. Mindful of the controversy within the Commission over opening up its workings to public view, Mr Pinheiro warned that 'the new policy will only work if it is identified with by everybody'. The commissioners themselves, some of whom are rarely if ever seen in public, would come forward much more regularly to give an account of their work, Mr Pinheiro said. 'It's important that there should be full disclosure of the Commission's views.' 'People want more information, better explanations and a faster service,' says the document approved by Brussels yesterday. 'What they do not want are propaganda and platitudes.' Throughout the Commission departments there will now be an official designated to provide information requested by the public and the press. A small strategy group will monitor the overall political coherence of Commission information, while a steering committee based on its information directorate will examine whether information is meeting the specific needs of those seeking it. In addition, feedback should come from an external users' advisory council, made up of business, trade unions, the professions, civic groups and the press. Although the Commission has now made its move, the Community's council of ministers has still to make up its mind on the possibility of freedom of information rules, allowing the public access to all EC documents on the US or Scandinavian model.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Euro Disney edges closer to Pounds 1.3bn rescue deal Euro Disney, the leisure group, and Walt Disney, its US parent company, are understood to have mapped out the basic framework for a FFr12bn (Pounds 1.37bn) restructuring plan with Euro Disney's banks. They are optimistic that an outline rescue can be agreed before the March 31 deadline. The main components of the deal are expected to be a FFr6bn rights issue and a FFr4bn reduction in Euro Disney's financial costs through a combination of the banks' reducing their interest charges on its debt and Disney's waiving entitlement to fees and royalties. The remaining FFr2bn would come from a series of smaller measures such as asset transfers. Euro Disney is owned 49 per cent by Disney of the US. The remaining 51 per cent is publicly quoted. 'There's still some way to go and all the details have yet to be ironed out', said a senior banker involved with the negotiations. Once a preliminary deal has been agreed, it will take at least three months to be completed. Disney is committed to bankrolling Euro Disney until March 31 but is understood to be willing to extend its support beyond that deadline if the banks have agreed in principle to a deal. A team of senior Disney executives, advised by Lazard Freres in New York, has moved to Paris and will stay until the deal has been agreed. It is holding regular negotiating sessions with the banks' steering committee, led by Banque Indosuez and Banque Nationale de Paris. Both sides have agreed that a rights issue will form the core of the restructuring plan. Disney will take up its full entitlement of the issue, maintaining its stake, and some of the creditor banks may act as underwriters. The two camps are still arguing over the precise terms of the proposed reduction in Euro Disney's financial costs. At present, Disney is entitled to royalties on 10 per cent of Euro Disney's admissions and 5 per cent of food and souvenir sales. The banks are pressing it to waive the royalties or reduce them to a token level. Disney is arguing that its royalty entitlement should eventually be reintroduced if Euro Disney meets, or beats, certain targets. Similarly, the banks are asking Disney to extend indefinitely its waiver of a management fee worth 3 per cent on Euro Disney's turnover. The US group again hopes eventually to reinstate the fee. Once the fee and royalty issue has been settled, Disney will press the banks for reciprocal cuts in their interest rates on a large part of Euro Disney's debt.</p>

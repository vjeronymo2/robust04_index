			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Time for stocktaking in steel talks - US and EC negotiators meet today in a sombre mood THE mood at today's Geneva negotiations aimed at formulating a multilateral steel agreement is likely to be tense. World steel exporters continue to fume at US dumping and countervailing duties that have virtually closed the US market to their products, while the EC is mulling steel production quotas and considering Ecu900m (Pounds 743.4m) in aid for steel plant closures. 'It should be apparent within five minutes whether headway is likely to be made,' said one senior US official. Three days have been set aside for the talks, which broke down in Geneva in March last year. Officials say it will be an encouraging sign if talks continue into the third day. Negotiators are not expecting any breakthrough. US negotiators may not quite be working in a policy void, but will need more time to receive clear trade guidelines from the new Clinton administration. Mr Rufus Yerxa, former US ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has yet to be confirmed formally as deputy to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and until that time negotiators have no one to take instructions from. Similarly, EC officials seeking a solution to the problems of chronic steel overcapacity among member states may not appreciate their hands being tied at this stage by a multilateral agreement. A meeting in Brussels tomorrow on reorganisation of Europe's steel industry is probably a more pressing priority. The meeting will thus focus on 'stocktaking', taking the draft agreement abandoned in March last year and ensuring there is agreement on what the package aims to achieve. For many the meeting will be a first opportunity to vent spleen against a blizzard of dumping actions taken over the past three months. Most sweeping have been US actions, announced late in January, which targeted carbon steel products from 19 countries, levying duties of up to 110 per cent. Significant also have been EC duties imposed on exporters from eastern Europe. The firm message from US steel producers is that there must be no dilution of US national trade laws - in particular the countervailing duty laws that target foreign subsidies. These and dumping actions have been used to great effect since November to shore up the domestic industry. As imports have been priced out of the market by high dumping duties, local steel prices have risen by at least 5 per cent, giving much-needed relief to less-efficient local producers. A year ago, the EC and other steel exporters were demanding that the US agree to a period for consultation before unleashing dumping or countervailing duty actions. They will be keen to know whether the US remains as fiercely opposed to this today as it was last March. The issue of subsidies will be high on the agenda. The last draft multilateral steel agreement bans subsidies for steel industries except where specific waivers are agreed. These would be confined to environmental needs, research, aid for laid-off workers, and for company closures. The US is likely to see the latest EC proposal to provide Ecu900m in aid for steel-workers laid off by plant closures as a litmus test: US steel companies have had no such help in coping with closures. An issue that is not likely to be pressed by US negotiators will be the call for renewal of any 'voluntary restraint agreements' - the expiry of which in March last year triggered the US dumping and countervailing duty actions. The VRAs were in force for 10 years, but by 1991 exporting countries were taking up no more than 60-70 per cent of the quotas allowed them under the restraint agreements. 'The problem was not the volume of imports, but the price,' commented one US trade lawyer. A lonely US lobbying voice is likely to be the steel users, who insist that the recently imposed dumping duties 'are already generating shortages, price increases, inflation, and increased retaliation' by trade partners such as Mexico and Canada. The American Institute for International Steel, which represents these importer interests, says dumping margins were overstated by at least 12 per cent because of currency fluctuations. US trade experts said these contrary US voices were unlikely to receive much attention in the US until shortages of certain steel products became acute, perhaps by May. By then, President Bill Clinton's trade policies are likely to be more clearly formulated, and substantive negotiations towards an MSA may be renewed. Meanwhile, it will not be overlooked by US negotiators that the EC delegation is taking the opportunity of its visit to Geneva to present to the Gatt its case for contesting the US dumping and countervailing duties as illegal under international trade law. This is the first step towards a formal Gatt panel investigating the US actions. Both sides will be hoping that a multilateral steel agreement can be in place soon enough to avert a full Gatt challenge.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Russian military 'seeks permanent Baltic presence' LEADERS in the Baltic states believe the Russian military wants to keep former Soviet troops on their territories indefinitely because it regards these small independent states as vital to Russia's security. Lithuania, largest of the three states, yesterday held a referendum on the presence of the 35,000 Russian troops there. A big vote demanding withdrawal was certain. The issue threatens to become a source of serious tension and instability in the region - though there are signs that some of the Baltic leaders favour a compromise. Mr Audrius Butkevicius, the Lithuanian defence minister, said last week he had been told by a senior Russian general that Russia intended to treat the external Baltic borders as its own. The Russian military has been concerned, since the break-up of the Soviet Union, that it is vulnerable to attack through the Baltics, which it would like to see as forming a kind of buffer zone. Mr Butkevicius said that in a meeting last Wednesday with Col Gen Kalininchenko, head of the border guards for the Commonwealth of Independent States (of which none of the Baltic states is a member), he had been told: 'The Polish- Lithuanian border is seen as our (Russian) border and our soldiers are there to defend the interests of Russia.' Lithuania is the only Baltic state which shares a western border with a central European state. The minister said Gen Kalininchenko justified his position by reference to a border treaty between the Soviet Union and the Polish People's Republic - both states which have been succeeded by different state entities. He said he did not expect any change in the Russian position after the meeting nine days ago between Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis and Russian President Boris Yeltsin - after which Mr Yeltsin was reported as promising to 'do his best' to speed the withdrawal of troops. A document revealed to the Baltic press by Mr Endel Lipmaa, an Estonian negotiator with the Russians on troop withdrawal, shows the Russians regard the Baltics in a category of countries described as 'ours'. The Russian position paper suggests Russian troops remain, paid for by the Baltic states in return for security. The Russians say the paper is just a draft. Estonia, with a Russian population of between 35 and 40 per cent, has been the most unyielding on the demand that the troops must leave by the end of the year. Its foreign minister, Mr Jan Manitsky, called on Saturday for 'large scale international support' to force out the Russian troops. However, Mr Landsbergis appeared to have softened his parallel demand in talks with Mr Yeltsin, proposing that the pull-out could be delayed until next year; while Mr Janis Jurkans, the Latvian foreign minister, last week warned against pushing Russia too far on the issue because of the 'fragility' of its democratic institutions.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHADOWING THE TALON SCOUTS OF PENNSYLVANIA'S HAWK MOUNTAIN SANCTUARY  </P> <P> The aptly named Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is the best place in the country to  view hawks en masse.  </P> <P> There are two routes to the wintering grounds for these predators of Eastern  Canada and the Northeast United States -- along the Atlantic Coast, and down  the Appalachian Mountains.  </P> <P> The inland-traveling birds catch the air currents to ride away from winter.  They do this in the same manner as a surfer contemplates, then slides aboard, a  well-shaped wave.  </P> <P> Hawk Mountain's location, near the terminus of what the Lenapi Indians called  the "endless mountains," makes it about the last point at which the birds can  catch a final, powerful comber toward the warmer southern climate.  </P> <P> The route can be spectacular. On an autumn day in 1948, for example, 11,000  broadwings, the most numerous species every year, were counted in their fly-by.  This number is rarely equaled, but several thousand a day is not unusual.  </P> <P> What makes Hawk Mountain so attractive to the birds is the bowl formed by its  ridges and the flat farmland surrounding it.  </P> <P> The cupped configuration is like a sea wall on which the surf breaks and  thrusts upward. And the heat boiling out of the sun-warmed fields generates  great currents upon which the hawks can elevate.  </P> <P> The word "boil" is used by hawkers interchangeably with "kettle," and describes  the phenomenon of the birds as they collectively ascend a geyser of air.  </P> <P> They spiral effortlessly, ever higher, until the lift dies out. They may then  sweep over to another, higher current to gain even more altitude. Or, if the  height is adequate, they may take a southward heading and shoot away for the  season.  </P> <P> The season for hawks and hawkers begins in late August when the broadwings  begin to show. September is a very heavy month and, historically, Sept. 11-24  is the best time to watch the raptors pass in review.  </P> <P> There are always birds, however, from mid-August through early December, and  the rare bald eagle appears in early September. Golden eagles, equally  impressive but fewer in number, fly past in early November.  </P> <P> Becoming a hawker requires no particular expertise. Michael Harwood's book "The  View From Hawk Mountain" is a good start for feather-and-beak data and a little  romance.  </P> <P> "Feathers in the Wind" also is a good one. It's on sale at Hawk Mountain  headquarters, offering tips plus a lot of interesting esoterica.  </P> <P> The book also explains what a hawker means when he yells: "Bird over No. 3!"  No. 3 is one of the series of five small, consecutively numbered points on a  ridge directly before the North Lookout.  </P> <P> They're indispensable observation points, but awkwardly are numbered from right  to left. However, once a hawker gets used to it, the spotting is simple.  </P> <P> The walk to the North Lookout is about half an hour up a lovely rough forest  path that ends in a tumble of stone about 1,000 feet above the countryside.  </P> <P> The view takes in 30 miles in all directions, which alone is worth the hike.  For the more tender of foot, the South Lookout is five minutes from the  highway. It requires less exertion, but offers less viewing opportunity, too.  </P> <P> The ambience around Hawk Mountain has not always been so receptive to the  birds. It might well have been called "Massacre Mountain" in the past, due to  the thousands of birds slaughtered from what is now the North Lookout.  </P> <P> Old-timers say that during the migration the stench of rotting birds was almost  unbearable. But hunters had no problem putting up with it: hawks were  predators.  </P> <P> Finally, conservationists won the day when, in 1932, it became the world's  first sanctuary for birds of prey.  </P> <P> Hawks, it seems, are not just birds. Mythology associates them with death and a  terrible aloofness. The dark side of man responds with a primeval, feral,  growling acclaim to the frightening wonder of a killer for sport.  </P> <P> Eagles, however, eat things already dead and rotting. Some hawks subsist mainly  on things as yucky as toads. But legends die hard, and the supreme arrogance of  the rapacious raptor -- lethal, amoral and totally without conscience -- is  something to which we all may be drawn.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Hawk Mountain is about a two-hour drive northwest of Philadelphia. Take the  Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike just outside Philadelphia,  turn left at the Allentown exit and follow the signs to Kempton about 15 miles  away.  </P> <P> A day at Hawk Mountain can include a journey through the Pennsylvania Dutch  pleasantness of rural Berks County.  </P> <P> Reading, the major community, is accessible from the Morgantown exit of the  Pennsylvania Turnpike.  </P> <P> Reading is the discount center of the Eastern Seaboard. The town calls itself  "The Outlet Capital of the World" because of the 250-plus discount houses in  the area.  </P> <P> Just before the approach to Reading is Hopewell Village. Known for its cast  iron from which, among other things, came more than 65,000 stoves and a whole  nation's worth of pots and pans.  </P> <P> The National Park Service supervises Hopewell, and has restored it to the  1820-1840 era, when Hopewell Village was most productive.  </P> <P> Just north of Reading is the little town of Temple, from which the Blue  Mountain &amp; Reading Railroad huffs and puffs its way up to North Hamburg and  back in about 90 minutes.  </P> <P> The railroad uses an old steam locomotive, the kind that produced the smoke  that used to outrage housewives when it settled on drying laundry and sifted  into just-dusted homes.  </P> <P> Also worth a visit, just outside Reading, is Roadside America. At a scale of  three-eighths of an inch to the foot, the miniature villages, factories and  farm towns trace 200 years of U.S. history. The magnitude of the undertaking is  suggested by the numbers: 300 buildings, 10,000 trees, 4,000 people and 2,250  feet of trolley and railroad tracks, all in miniature.  </P> <P> Not to be missed, either, is the Crystal Cave at Kutztown, discovered in 1871.  It takes about 35 minutes to tour through stalactite, stalagmite and dripstone  formations.  </P> <P> This fairyland of sculpted stone features such oddities as the Giant's Tooth,  the Indian Head and the Crystal Ballroom. But take a sweater; the temperature's  a constant 56 degrees.  </P> <P> Other attractions in Berks County are Daniel Boone's Homestead, the Boyertown  Museum of Historic Vehicles, the Pennsylvania Dutch Folk Culture Center and the  Maple Grove Auto Raceway.  </P> <P> For a comprehensive visitors' map and details on things to do, how to get there  and where to stay (there is an abundance of reasonably priced lodging in the  area), contact the Berks County Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box 1698, Reading,  Pa. 19603, (215) 376-6766.  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Recovery creates few jobs in US THE US recovery is generating far fewer jobs than past upturns, adding to the economic pressure on President-elect Bill Clinton, Labour Department figures indicated yesterday. The unemployment rate last month held steady at 7.3 per cent, half a point higher than at the official end of the recession in March 1991, although below the 7.7 per cent peak reached in June of last year. The failure of unemployment to fall reflected unusually weak employment growth for this stage of an economic recovery. Non-farm employment rose 64,000 to 108.7m last month, less than most analysts expected. Figures for November were also revised down to show an increase of only 76,000, against an initial estimate of 105,000. No job gains were registered in goods-producing industries last month. Analysts were also disturbed by a decline in the length of the average work-week last month. During 1992 payroll employment rose by a total of 600,000, far less than in past recoveries, when this many jobs were typically created in two months. The unemployment rate averaged 7.4 per cent, the worst result for nearly a decade. The jobs figures contrast with other, more encouraging economic news. Retailers this week reported a 7-10 per cent increase in sales last month compared to December 1991. High levels of unemployment, complicate the economic challenge facing Mr Clinton, who met senior economic advisers in Little Rock on Thursday.</p>

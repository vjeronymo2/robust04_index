			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: PRO FOOTBALL PROGNOSTICATION LOSES ALL OF ITS CREDIBILITY  </P> <P> At least seven publications have picked the Houston Oilers to win the AFC  Central this year, and the Philadelphia Inquirer asked Coach Jerry Glanville  for his reaction.  </P> <P> "Well, you know if they pick you last, you tell people not to pay any attention  to them or read them, so I guess if they pick you first, you have to treat it  the same way.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you how bad those magazines are. One picked me as coach of the  year."  </P> <P> Add picks: In college football, most of the publications are going with Notre  Dame as No. 1, but Newsday is picking UCLA.  </P> <P> "Move over, Independents," Newsday says. "It's time for a change at the top.  For three straight years, an independent has worn the championship crown. Now,  all that glitters will be gold and blue as the Bruins' eighth consecutive bowl  win will be their best yet.  </P> <P> "Coach Terry Donahue will replace quarterback Troy Aikman with Jimmy Bonds or  Bret Johnson, but look for tailbacks Kevin Williams, Brian Brown and Shawn  Wills to run wild behind a strong offensive line led by center Frank Cornish."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Former catcher Jeff Torborg, manager of the Chicago White Sox,  caught no-hitters by what three pitchers?  </P> <P> Can't miss him: At the PGA Seniors tournament in Seattle, Doug Sanders told  John Peoples of the Seattle Times that there are two questions that fans always  ask when the seniors play. "No. 1 is, 'What did Arnold Palmer shoot?' No. 2 is,  'What is Doug Sanders wearing?' "  </P> <P> Said Peoples: "Yesterday, Sanders sported a neon-orange and brown outfit. It  was mild compared to the baby blue and Circus Circus pink getup he wore in  Tuesday's pro-am."  </P> <P> Dome king: From Richard Justice of the Washington Post: "Bo Jackson in the  Kingdome: Eight home runs and 18 RBIs in 18 games for the Royals and 252 yards  and three touchdowns in two games with the Raiders."  </P> <P> He's thinking: Detroit rookie Rodney Peete, who quarterbacked USC teams that  lost to Michigan State and Michigan in the Rose Bowl, told Detroit writer Mitch  Albom: "Yeah, I knew I was gonna end up in Detroit, so I figured I'd just make  friends with the people early."  </P> <P> Piece of cake: Said San Francisco slugger Kevin Mitchell when asked if he was  feeling the pressure of the media: "No, I don't feel pressure. Pressure is when  you're in an alley with nothing in your hands and you're confronted by six  tough guys. What do you do? Hit the biggest, and run for your life."  </P> <P> Short shot: From Bob McGarry of the Providence Journal-Bulletin: "After  watching a commercial of Cincinnati Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason running  around in his Hanes underwear, here's hoping he sticks to playing football for  a living and his career in the advertising world is, shall we say, brief."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Sandy Koufax, Bill Singer, Nolan Ryan.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Philadelphia Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan, on his relationship with owner  Norman Braman: "We're good friends now. I think he knows I'm doing a hell of a  job. I've told him enough times."  </P></p>

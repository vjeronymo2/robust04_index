			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary under "Latest News" rubric: "One Budget for a </F> Dozen Problems]    [Text] At first sight, the decree on the federal budget for  1994 adopted by the State Duma is a strange one. The draft  budget proposed by the government has been adopted as a working  base. But at the same time the government is invited to revise  all the main budgetary indicators to allow for new economic  priorities, and to present the draft again for a first reading.    We will not, however, suspect the poor Duma deputies of  economic sabotage. On the contrary, in my view, they displayed  exceptional resourcefulness in seeking a constructive solution  to a complex problem. The draft budget was composed in an  extremely hardline monetarist spirit, as if at the behest of  Gaydar and Fedorov. And not because Premier V. Chernomyrdin has  suddenly rallied to the colors of Milton Friedman. At heart he  is still a sector specialist, but the current political  situation compells him to hoist the monetarist flag higher than  Gaydar and Fedorov themselves. There is no real money in the  state coffers, and all the problems of budget funding can be  resolved only by the nomenklatura method of "removing  difficulties" through back-stage bureaucratic horse-trading.  That is to say, today we bailed out this lot, tomorrow we will  bail out another lot, and a third lot the day after. To bail out  everyone at once -- that is, to adopt a budget which would  satisfy the interests of all lobbyists -- is not possible.    A way out of the impasse was found, as was to have been  expected, during lobby negotiations, during which Chernomyrdin  won over the agrarians by promising them money "later." The  aforementioned Duma decree, which was compounded on the  principle of "bread now and jam tomorrow" was also a reflection  of this "consensus." V. Zhirinovskiy took part for the first  time in lobby horse trading on an internal economic theme; in  exchange for his support for the compromise decision, he --  evidently maliciously -- demanded the inclusion in the protocol  of the decree a demand for the resignation of Ministers Yerin,  Kozyrev, and Chubays. The demand was indeed included.    This testifies not only to deputies' political  "flexibility,"  but also to their social alertness [sotsialnaya adekvatnost],  their understanding of the "scientific" fact that the real  conflict of interests lies not in the sphere of voucher  privatization, foreign policy, or the battle with crime. All  this is secondary. The crucial topic in Russian life is  competition between the major sector groups over the sharing out  of national income.</p>

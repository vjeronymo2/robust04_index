			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: Voyage round Morley ROBERT, MY FATHER by Sheridan Morley Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 16.99, 240 pages We are lucky to have Sheridan Morley's voyage round his father before any other. It gives an uncritical account of his life, with intimate anecdotes that might not be widely known, and a positive anthology of witticisms. Unapologetic in its filial loyalty, it records his dramatic activities ranging from the Stokes Oscar Wilde to TV commercials. Never a star of the Gielgud-Olivier type - and never ambitious to be - the quality in all his work is likeableness, though as one critic said, his parts 'all end up looking and sounding uncommonly like Mr Morley himself'. Alan Ayckbourn wrote when Morley was in his How the Other Half Loves, he 'is an actor who rapidly gets very bored and . . . treats theatres as one huge game organised by himself.' Morley was the only son of an eccentric retired cavalry major. Trained at RADA (where he 'never really learned how to act') he made his inconspicuous debut in Russell Thorndike's Doctor Syn. He then wrote a comedy, Short Story, which was miraculously accepted for production by Dame Marie Tempest and from then on, writing was as obsessive with him as acting. Characteristically, Sheridan was named, not after the playwright, but after the character Morley was playing at the time. Challenged in the Garrick bar, Morley said that having a theatre critic for a son was 'like serving in the Israeli army and waking up to find your son was an Arab'. He has been a friendly Arab here.</p>

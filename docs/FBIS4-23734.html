			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's land  redistribution programme was driven by humanitarian and moral  considerations, and was not concerned with the political views  of individual farmers, the country's president, Mr Robert  Mugabe, said on Friday [10 June]. Speaking at a press  conference in Cape Town, where he is attending the World  Economic Forum Southern Africa summit, he said former Rhodesian  Prime Minister Ian Smith could carry on farming as his land was  not needed for resettlement purposes.    Mr Mugabe said there were 10.5 million Zimbabweans, most of  them rural people who because of a land shortage had to lead a  subsistence existence. Most arable land was in the hands of a  mere 4,500 people. "Naturally we have to correct this position.  What morality would we find more impelling than that which  demands that the few, 4,500 people, must surrender it to the ten  million people?"    Some land had to remain in the hands of the commmercial  farming sector, and agro-industrial sugar, citrus, timber and  wattle plantations would not be interfered with. "But ordinary  2,000, 4,000 hectare pieces of land, some of these we say must  come to the communal sector. Not all of it. We are not  depriving all the farmers of their land. Mr Ian Smith's farm is  not in question just now, because we regard it as not lying in a  region where land must be acquired for resettlement purposes."  Mr Smith was "free to continue farming on his land whatever his  politics might have been in the past or still might be at  present".    Mr Mugabe said his government did not care about the  political thinking of an individual. "But we care about the  human question, the humanitarian question, the moral question of  doing justice. Justice will have to be done."</p>

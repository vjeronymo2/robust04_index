			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Zimbabwe steel plant may face closure ZIMBABWE'S state-owned steelworks, the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (Zisco), is threatened with closure for both financial and technical reasons. The more immediate challenge is financial. Zisco, sub-Saharan Africa's largest steelworks outside South Africa, owes the government-controlled coal producer, Wankie Colliery, ZDollars 78m (Pounds 8m) and the National Railways of Zimbabwe, also a parastatal, ZDollars 100m. Wankie, which supplies Zisco with about 600,000 tonnes of coal a year, is refusing to supply any more, while the NRZ is demanding immediate payment of ZDollars 25m. Zisco has appealed to the government for help and was granted a subsidy of ZDollars 100m in the 1993-94 budget, but this is inadequate to meet its existing debts, let alone fund its cash flow deficit. One blast furnace, closed early this year for rebuilding, remains in limbo with no decision yet on how to finance the rehabilitation. The remaining furnace, which broke down temporarily last week, is unlikely to last much beyond the end of this year. The plant is at present operating at about 35 per cent of capacity. The government wants to sell it but huge debts are likely to put off buyers.</p>

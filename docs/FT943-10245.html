			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Minister apologises over Bombay scandal report: Singh seeks to lure opposition back to parliament Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, yesterday apologised for words used to describe a parliamentary report on the 1992 Bombay securities scandal, in a bid to end the opposition's boycott of parliament. Mr Singh withdrew the words 'unwarranted' and 'unfair' that he said his ministry had used inadvertently to describe parliament's criticism of the government over the Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 820m) scandal. Opposition leaders said the report was a cover-up of the government's role in the scandal, and has boycotted parliament for the remainder of the session, until August 26, after the demand that the report be withdrawn was not met. Apologising for the 'lapse' which he said was 'entirely unintentional,' the finance minister said it was never his government's intention to reject the committee's report or to show any disrespect to the committee. It was not immediately clear whether Mr Singh's apology will be enough to tempt the opposition back to parliament. It accused Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao of reneging on his promise to punish all those responsible for the scandal. Bankers and brokers were accused of colluding to siphon money illegally from the inter-bank market in government securities to invest on the booming Bombay stock exchange. The government's enforcement directorate, perhaps to prove that action is being taken, yesterday filed a criminal complaint for violations under the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act against Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the heart of the scandal. The complaint could lead to Mr Mehta's rearrest; he is already facing charges of fraud, and of breaking bank and stock market regulations. Complaints were also filed against his brother Mr Sudhir Mehta, Mr R Sitaraman, assistant manager of the State Bank of India in charge of treasury operations at the time of the scandal, and his wife Mrs Meera Sitaraman. India's Home Minister Shankarrao Chavan yesterday accused Pakistan of conspiring with Moslem militants blamed for bomb blasts that killed 260 people in Bombay last year and said there was evidence the extremists passed through Dubai and Thailand, Reuter adds from Bombay.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Philippines yesterday condemned the massacre  last Friday of Palestinian worshipers by an Israeli-American  settler in the occupied territory. It called on Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organization to continue their multilateral  peace talks in Washington.    Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo announced this amid reports  that three Arab delegations were suspending participation in the  talks following the Hebron massacre, where a Jewish setler  opened fire inside the Ibrahim mosque and killed at least 43  Muslims and wounded many others. Romulo yesterday met with  Palestinian Ambassador Musa Amer Odeh [as published], who asked  the Philippine Government to formally condemn the massacre.  Odeh sent a formal request to President Ramos through the  Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).    Odeh said Israel's "official terrorism" cannot continue if  the United States and the United Nations or the whole  international community would really want to stop it. He said  countries may impose trade and economic sanctions on Israel  through a UN resolution.    "But any despicable act should be condemned in no uncertain  terms by everybody," Romulo said, in response to reports that  the UN was being asked to issue a resolution condemning the  massacre. Romulo said the Philippines also welcomes announcement  by Israel that it would take steps to disarm some 120,000 Jewish  settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said the DFA is in  a "unique position" as it can coordinate with the Palestinian  and Israeli ambassadors in Manila to encourage the continuation  of peace talks among parties concerned.    Odeh described the crime against Palestinians by the Jewish  settler as "a time bomb which may explode any minute," and that  this could endanger the ongoing peace initiatives between two  peoples. He said that for years the settlers have been allowed  by Israel to carry weapons to terrorize the Palestinians. Since  1967, this issue has been addressed several times by the UN  Security Council in numerous resolutions which considered  settlements as illegal and have to be dismantled. He told Romulo  that is is about time that security needs of Palestinians be  addressed by every country.</p>

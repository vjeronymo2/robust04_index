			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLY WATCH;  </P> <P> WAR GAMES  </P> <P> Rosemead was sprayed with malathion 10, count them, 10 times between November,  1989, and May of this year in order to eradicate Medflies.  </P> <P> But (need we really say it?) they're back: Two more Medflies were found there  in the last two weeks, and more spraying is scheduled to resume today.  </P> <P> There are all sorts of excuses. Some officials believe infested fruit could  have been brought back into the area. Others say that the eradication program  was simply inexpertly executed.  </P> <P> OK. It's nice to give people the benefit of the doubt, but obviously  eradication is not occurring. So maybe state Medfly officials have an odd  definition of "eradication"?  </P> <P> Isn't the seemingly permanent presence of the pesky fly evidence to support  entomologist James Carey's assertion that the Medfly has only been suppressed,  never eradicated, over the last 15 years?  </P> <P> If suppression is all we really gain from pesticide spraying, shouldn't the  state say that?  </P> <P> The danger is that maybe the enemy isn't so much the Medfly as ourselves: State  policy is premised on an endgame of wipeout, unconditional surrender,  eradication. But is this real? Must we really spray Rosemead 10 times in order  to save it?  </P> <P> The state should review the facts of the Medfly -- especially its consistent  reappearance -- and reassess just what kind of war this is.  </P> <P> It's hard to win a war if you don't know precisely what kind of struggle you  are in.  </P></p>

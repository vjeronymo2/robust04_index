			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (2): Rapidly shedding state controls - The economy SRI Lanka, embarked on a vigorous course of economic liberalisation, is rapidly shedding the vestiges of an inward-looking state-controlled economy. Instead, the country is diversifying from a traditional agricultural base by attracting export-oriented industry. There are three main obstacles to the success of the government's economic plans: Almost every developing country has the same economic agenda and is competing to attract foreign capital; Recession among developed nations has reduced the pool of available capital; Sri Lanka is still experiencing a costly and destabilising civil war. There is, however, cause for optimism. With single-minded determination, Sri Lanka's economic technocrats have charted a path through the minefield of fratricidal war into a period of tentative growth. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth rose from 2.3 per cent in 1989 to 6.2 per cent in 1990 and 4.8 per cent in 1991. Although it is forecast at 4.5 per cent this year, a severe drought in the first few months wiped out about 1 per cent potential growth. Between 1978-1991, the share of agricultural produce in total exports fell from 79 per cent to 31.5 per cent. Last year, tea - Sri Lanka's main agricultural export - accounted for 21 per cent of exports, compared to 48.5 per cent 13 years earlier. In the same period the share of manufactured items rose from 15 per cent to 60 per cent of total exports. The textile and garments sector has been particularly strong, rising 27 per cent last year to Dollars 850m and accounting for more than half of total manufactured exports. There has also been a recent increase in the direct foreign investment (excluding the stock market) which Sri Lanka has attracted, increasing from Dollars 32m in 1990 to an expected Dollars 70m-Dollars 120m this year. Donor agencies predict flows of direct foreign investment will reach Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m a year by the second half of the decade. In its efforts to attract foreign investment, the government has offered generous tax holidays and freedom from all import and export tariffs for export-oriented businesses, coupled with the right to remit profits. Ministry of finance officials say that all possible incentives are in place and it is now a question of marketing the reforms. Donor agency officials, however, question the government's emphasis on tax holidays, which for new export-oriented businesses can extend up to 20 years, equivalent to the production life of many factories. In giving these tax breaks, the government has cut itself off long-term from an important source of revenue. 'It's true, but we just can't help it,' explains a ministry of finance official. 'We had a plan to abolish the tax holidays, but then Vietnam, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan opened up. Unless we offer matching returns, it will be difficult to compete.' Donors have asked the government to reconsider, arguing that foreign companies are attracted more by cheap labour, a literate workforce, reliable infrastructure and minimal bureaucracy, than the generosity of the tax structure. Many businessmen agree. One executive of a multinational in Sri Lanka says: 'We don't go chasing tax holidays. If we make a profit, we expect to pay some tax.' On the domestic side, an ambitious programme to privatise state enterprises has begun with 21 companies already removed from the government's books. A restructuring of the economically important, but loss-making, tea sector has led to a majority of plantations being returned to private management. Steps have also been taken to open the stock market to foreign investors, promote domestic share-ownership and develop unit trust and bond markets. All this has been done with the active support of international donors who last February pledged Sri Lanka Dollars 825m in, mostly concessional, aid for the year. Aid might increase, in the manner of a 'peace dividend' if a solution to the conflict is found. Although the government has moved rapidly in its economic reforms, much remains to be accomplished if longer-term recovery is to be secured. While exports have increased in value, so have imports and the trade deficit, which stood at Dollars 1.02bn last year, remains worryingly high. Remittances from Sri Lankans living abroad help narrow the deficit, but continuing high flows of foreign aid are essential to balance the country's books. The flow of foreign direct investment has increased but, as the World Bank warned in its 1992 country report, Sri Lanka remains a marginal recipient in world terms. There are signs that recent economic growth has been consumer- rather than producer-driven. Commercial bank loans to the consumer sectors have grown, while loans to the commercial and industrial sectors have shown a relative decline. The size and make-up of the government budget is also in urgent need of redress. The budget deficit has been reduced from almost 16 per cent of GDP in 1988 to a forecast 8.8 per cent of GDP this year, in line with International Monetary Fund targets, but should be lowered still further. The recent reduction of the deficit has been achieved through a cut in public investment, down from 16 per cent of GDP in 1982 to just 5.7 per cent in 1990, rather than on recurrent expenditure. Donors have warned that this situation must be reversed if Sri Lanka is to maintain the quality of infrastructure required to attract private investment. There is, however, strong pressure on recurrent expenditure. As a result of the continuing civil war, the defence budget has risen from 1.3 per cent of GDP in 1983 to 4.1 per cent last year. In addition, the cost to government of caring for more than 1m people displaced by the conflict amounted to SLRs4.9bn or more than 1 per cent of GDP last year. Expenditure on social welfare programmes in 1991, deemed essential by some government officials if further civil disruption is to be avoided, amounted to SLRs7.8bn. With these levels of recurrent expenditure, economists are sceptical whether Sri Lanka can average more than 5.5 per cent GDP growth a year, significantly below its potential. Despite the best efforts of government technocrats, the civil war remains the decisive factor in the economy.</p>

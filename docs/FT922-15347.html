			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease as consumer confidence shows upturn US TREASURY prices eased at the long end but held firm among the shorter-dated issues yesterday, with the release of a mixed bag of economic statistics - which were, on balance, unfavourable to the market. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 100 3/8 , yielding 7.960 per cent. The two-year note, however, was up  1/32 at 100 9/32 , yielding 5.582 per cent. Prices had traded weaker early in the day in anticipation of the economic figures. When news of a rebound in consumer confidence and an improvement in some regional purchasing managers' reports came through, the market did not flinch because the data had already been discounted. The statistics backed up recent evidence that economic activity and sentiment was slowly picking up. The Conference Board's March consumer confidence index showed a rise from 47.3 per cent to 54 per cent, although the board warned that this level was still 'less than reassuring'. Purchasing management indices from Chicago and Detroit also showed increases, as did February leading economic indicators. Trading throughout the day, however, was quiet, with many participants staying on the sidelines until Friday's key employment report for March. A REPORT that Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, had tendered her resignation gave a boost to the French government bond market yesterday and helped set the tone for other European markets during the day. The market had been looking for Mrs Cresson to be replaced for some time, and gained further confidence from speculation that she would be replaced by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister. Though not confirmed during trading hours yesterday, the report helped to push French bonds up by  1/4 point on the day, with the June bond future closing at 107.62, up 0.24 on the day. With the yield on 10-year German bonds static at just over 8 per cent, the yield spread between the German and French markets narrowed on the day. From 72 basis points, equal to its high of recent weeks, the spread tightened to 67 basis points. Confirmation of the news would push bonds further ahead, analysts said, with the general view being that the spread over bunds would come down quickly to around 60 basis points or below. GERMAN government bonds were supported by the strength of the French market, with cash bonds ending generally slightly firmer on the day. The bund market was unnerved early on by inflation figures reported by Bavaria (among the last four states to report March inflation figures). These showed a 0.3 per cent rise on the month, to an annual level of 5 per cent, a figure that caused some consternation. However, the month-on-month rise was in line with the expected national average, and there is expected to be confirmation today that the overall rise during March had taken inflation to 4.7 per cent, in line with market expectations. POLITICAL concerns continued to stalk the UK government bond market, with long gilt futures falling early in the day on a report that government finances were in a worse state than either main political party was admitting, and again later on a report that the latest opinion poll had shown a marked increase in the showing of the opposition Labour party. STRONG reports that Japan's long-expected official discount rate cut would finally come today - and that, at 0.75 percentage point, would be larger than generally expected - gave the Japanese government market a strong start to the day. However, from an opening yield of 5.27 per cent on the benchmark no 129, prices fell during the day, with the yield rising to 5.315 per cent by the close.</p>

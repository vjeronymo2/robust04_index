			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hardie down 75% in year but expects improvement James Hardie, the Australian building materials and investment group in which Brierley Investments has taken a small stake, yesterday announced a 75 per cent fall in profits after tax and abnormals, to ADollars 14.2m (USDollars 10.4m) in the year to end-March. However, the company said it expected 'a very marked improvement' in the current financial year. Revenues in the 12 months rose to ADollars 1.72bn, compared with ADollars 1.6bn in the same period a year earlier. The comparable profits figure for 1992-93 was ADollars 56.5m (neither profit figure is equity-accounted). Part of the tumble in profits derived from a larger abnormal item - ADollars 54.9m in 1993-94, compared with ADollars 10.4m in the previous year. About half of the latest figure related to restructuring and rationalisation efforts. Even at the operating level, however, profits slipped to ADollars 54.9m from ADollars 70.3m in the previous 12 months. On the building products side, which accounted for most of the abnormal items, profits were up by one-fifth to ADollars 66.9m, on a 5 per cent sales gain. Hardie forecast a continued improvement at its US arm, which moved from a loss of ADollars 10.9m in 1992-93 to a ADollars 6.2m profit last year. But the pipelines business saw profits fall to ADollars 18.6m from ADollars 30m. The group's building services division also recorded a loss of ADollars 5.1m, compared with last time's ADollars 6.6m profit, due to the decline in non-housing construction in Australia and losses in New Zealand. On an earnings per share basis, Hardie's profits equated to 3.9 cents, compared with 15.8 cents last time. However, in the light of the board's belief that the figures represented 'a turning point', the final dividend was maintained at 6 cents a share, bringing the total for the year to 12 cents (fully franked), compared with 12 cents last time (70 per cent franked).</p>

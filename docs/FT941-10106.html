			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / White right threatens to disrupt all-race poll Prospects for peaceful elections in South Africa receded further last night when the white right wing, the Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF), said it would not take part in April's all-race elections, and would actively disrupt the poll. Compounding the threat to elections, the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly, the parliament in Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's homeland of KwaZulu, said it would take steps to resist the poll, though the Chief's Inkatha Freedom Party has not yet officially announced a boycott. Both announcements could be partly tactical, aimed at pressing the African National Congress and government to make last-minute concessions before Saturday's deadline for registration of political parties contesting the elections. 'If the ANC and NP come to their senses and decide there will be a volkstaat (white homeland) and self-determination for Afrikaners, we will consider (participation),' Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the ultra-right Conservative Party, said after the AVF's own 'parliament', the 'Transitional Representative Council', had met. The AVF leader, Gen Constand Viljoen, was to meet the ANC last night for what AVF officials described as a 'final' round of talks on the white right's demand for an Afrikaner homeland. At the same time, the government was making last-minute efforts to revive stalled trilateral talks between the right wing umbrella group, the Freedom Alliance, and the ANC and the government. There were few indications that agreement could be reached on constitutional amendments before the Saturday deadline. The Freedom Alliance has said such amendments are essential if they are to reverse their decision to boycott the poll. The government said last night it might extend the Saturday deadline if progress seemed possible, but did not think this likely. The Afrikaner Volksfront said it would use its 'total ability' to oppose the poll, though Mr Hartzenberg was careful to avoid an overt call to violence. But conservative white local councils would refuse to integrate with black councils as required by law, and the AVF would set up the equivalent of 'mini-volkstaats' in conservative rural areas. 'But if they are going to crush us, we must use a little bit of violence to protect ourselves,' he warned.</p>

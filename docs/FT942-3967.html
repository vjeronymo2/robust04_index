			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Battle against terrorism is now MI5 main role, says Rimington Three quarters of the work of MI5, the British security service, is now focused on fighting terrorism, particularly in Northern Ireland, rather than the infiltration of 'subversive' political groups or the type of counter-espionage portrayed in spy novels. The picture of the modern, post-cold war MI5 was drawn last night by Mrs Stella Rimington, director-general of the security service, in an unprecedented speech on television by the head of a secret service. Since the collapse of Soviet communism, the threats to national security had been transformed, Mrs Rimington said. 'Countering espionage now takes up less than a quarter of our resources; half what it was three years ago, and a far cry from the position at the height of the cold war,' she said, delivering the 1994 Richard Dimbleby Lecture on BBC1. The threat from subversion had also subsided, taking up less than 5 per cent of MI5's time. In the past, activities of Communist party members in Britain were the 'legitimate subject of attention' because of their 'subversive' intent. Now, part of the little time devoted to countering subversion was spent on extreme rightwing groups 'who are seeking to undermine democracy through the exploitation of racial hatred and xenophobia'. The service's overwhelming focus today was fighting terrorism, originating both from within the UK and abroad, she said. MI5's most important task was mounting intelligence operations to counter the threat from Irish terrorism. 'The Provisional IRA, in particular, is a sophisticated and ruthless terrorist organisation, and poses the most serious threat to our national security.' Until 1992, the Metropolitan Police special branch co-ordinated intelligence work against all Republican terrorism, but the transfer of that function to MI5 had meant 'a sharper focus, as well as a greater concentration of resources'. Mrs Rimington said the security service was 'an important plank in the defence of a free society and of its civil liberties'. However, it was important that it was accountable and ensured 'the most intrusive techniques' were used only 'to counter the most serious threat'. The modern MI5 was composed of 'people from a variety of backgrounds About half are female and half are under 40,' she said.</p>

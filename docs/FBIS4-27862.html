			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Chong Chin-sok from Washington: </F> "Why Is the Presentation of a Sanction Bill on the North Korean  Nuclear Issue to the UN Security Council Being Delayed?"]    [Text] Diplomatic negotiations over the adoption of a UN  Security Council resolution on sanctions against North Korea  have been undergoing some trouble.    The United States at first planned to have a discussion on a  resolution which the ROK, Japan, and the United States had  drafted at a session of the five permanent members early this  week to pass it as soon as possible. However, the countries  reportedly are having difficulties in reaching accord among  themselves. As a result, it will take some time to present a  draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea to the UN  Security Council.    The United States, which had been playing a leading role in  passing a resolution, had a tripartite consultation with the ROK  and Japan in Washington and New York and coordinated views among  the five permanent members of the Security Council toward the  end of last week. However, the United States seems to be  embarrassed because it realized the difficulty in passing a  resolution. In short, countries concerned do not positively  support the United States' ideas on the timing and method of the  sanctions.    The attitudes of China and Russia may be understandable to  the United States. However, Japan, a major country concerned,  expressed the view that it cannot accept the United States' plan  on sanctions. The two countries have reached agreement on  sanctions in principle. However, they have significantly  different views on details of the sanction plan, including how  to impose sanctions.    The consultation among the ROK, the United States, and Japan  which took place in Washington on 3 and 4 June (Washington time)  is the proof of the difficulties in passing a resolution. That  day's meeting was intended to draft a resolution. They agreed  on a general idea on sanctions for two days of separate and  expanded meetings. However, they reportedly failed to reach  agreement on what should be included in the sanctions.    For example, no agreement was reached as to whether  sanctions  will be imposed immediately after a resolution is passed or  whether a certain grace period will be given to North Korea to  see North Korea's reaction to the sanctions. Still, the three  countries appeared to have agreed that the effectuation of  sanctions must not be delayed for very long.    The problem was how to impose sanctions. Kim Sam-hun, the  ROK nuclear ambassador, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State  Gallucci reportedly had no different views. However, (Sunji  Yanai), chief of a bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry,  expressed his opposition in many respects. Japan said that it  "would cooperate on matters in which it can under the  constitution." It also said that it is not necessary to hastily  present a draft resolution.    It is expected that the passage of a resolution will be  delayed not only because it is difficult to draft a resolution,  but because countries concerned still want to try to resolve the  nuclear issue through dialogue. The United States and other  Western countries want to leave the door open for North Korea's  acceptance of special inspections of the two unreported  facilities in Yongbyon, the final exit.</p>

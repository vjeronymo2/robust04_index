			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks brings dividend forward Directors of Newman Tonks have decided to bring forward payment of the final dividend for the 14 months to end-December 1992. A second interim dividend of 5.5p in lieu of a final will be paid on March 29 making a total of 9.3p for the 14 months - the same as was paid for the previous 12 months. Last July the directors announced that the year-end was to be changed from October 31 to December 31 and that future final dividends would be paid in May. They said yesterday that they were bringing forward payment in order to give shareholders more time to adjust to the new payment timetable.</p>

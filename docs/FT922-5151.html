			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Local advertising lifts Midlands Radio Improved revenue from local advertising and reduced operating costs helped Midlands Radio achieve a rise in profits from Pounds 307,000 to Pounds 605,000 pre-tax for the half year to March 31. Turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 5.3m Earnings per share increased from 1.55p to 3.04p and the interim dividend is a same-again 1.5p. The increase in revenue from local advertising was not matched by increased national advertising. Mr John Parkinson, chairman, warned: 'The directors feel they must show some caution until there are clearer signs of the economic recovery'.</p>

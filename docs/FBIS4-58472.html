			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Hoseyn Qasemi: "From Tel Aviv to Muscat"] </F>   [Excerpts] The three-day meeting on water in the Middle  East, which was held from 17 April at the Muscat  Intercontinental Hotel with the participation of 44 delegations,  included a high-level Israeli delegation. When it concluded,  political observers described it as more of a political meeting  than a technical one. This is because for the first time the  despotic regime of Palestine was permitted to participate in an  intraregional conference held in one of the Persian Gulf  countries. This broke the traditional boundaries between the  said regime and the conservative Arabs of the region.    The Omanis do not seem very pleased with such an appraisal  by  political observers, because they sought to project the  invitation for Israel to participate in the Muscat session as  being within the framework of "a specialized task and to use  that regime's experiences with regard to water use and nothing  else." However, in a calculated move the Israelis sent their  deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin--who is known for  participating in covert talks--as head of the delegation, along  with 19 correspondents.    These preliminary actions indicate that although the topic  of  the meeting is water, this was merely a pretext for implementing  a political purpose. Thus, Beilin's mission can be construed as  part of the moves known as "confidence-building measures" in  order to create a psychological atmosphere in the Persian Gulf  region. [passage omitted]    Perhaps at first glance the connection between the  longstanding intention of the usurpers of Jerusalem to dominate  the area from the Nile to the Euphrates and the holding of this  conference on water may not seem very clear. However, if we  think about it deeply we will see that they are steps in the  same direction. This is because, with the Jewish government  gaining a foothold in the Persian Gulf region and access to the  markets and economies of the shaykhdoms in this region, this  entity and its territorial covetousness can get a desired show  case. Thus, in a way it can have the reins of the Arab  reactionaries from the land of the Nile to the shores of the  Euphrates at its disposal.    The reactionary Arab shaykhs and rulers are fully aware that  the breeding and multiplication of an evil spore such as Israel  in the region will naturally pave the way for the infiltration  of neocolonialism, the forerunners of which imposed that old  Methuselah called colonialism on the people of the region in  bygone centuries and in this century too.    However, the real loser in this imbalance will be the same  shaykhs and rulers who have been exposed by the Islamic  awakening and who see their hereditary governments being swept  away by the wind. The Islamic awakening will wipe out this  neocolonialism when it comes into the arena with its sword, and  it is here that yet another intifadah will emerge.</p>

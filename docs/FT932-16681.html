			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / IG Metall keeps up pay rise pressure IG Metall, Germany's big engineering union, has called for nationwide protests from April 24 in support of higher wage demands by eastern Germany's electrical, metal and steel sectors. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the unon, also told a rally in the east German city of Magdeburg at the weekend that members throughout the five east German states would be balloted later this month on whether to hold an all-out strike in the region. He added that IG Metall would continue warning strikes in eastern Germany until the employers' steel, and metal and electrical associations agreed a 21 per cent pay increase for the steel sector and a 26 per cent increase for the metal and electrical industry. The pay increases are part of a contract signed between the union, west German employers and east German managers in March 1991 aimed at equalising German wages by April 1994. Wages in the east are below 70 per cent of west German levels. The employers say they cannot now meet the demands because of the recession in western Germany and low productivity in the east. Mr Klaus Topfer, Germany's federal environment minister, arrived in Bucharest yesterday to assess ways to clean up 400 tonnes of toxic waste illegally exported by German companies to Romania in recent years, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. The waste, exported by both east and west German companies, has been stored in and around the Transylvanian town of Sibiu in coroding containers, according to Greenpeace. Mr Topfer is expected to sign a co-operation agreement with Romanian officials during his two-day visit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The fourth round of U.S.-  China textile negotiations begins Saturday [15 January] with a  new Chinese negotiator expected to fight 25-35 percent slashes  in import quotas on Chinese textiles, sources in Beijing said.    According to reliable Chinese sources, Shi Guangsheng, vice  minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Trade and  Cooperation, will lead the Chinese delegation in the talks.    Shi takes the place of Zhou Keren, director of the  ministry's  trade administration department, who led the Chinese side in  previous rounds. Zhou is also expected to be present at  Saturday's talks, the source said.    The change is believed to be a result of demands by the  chief  U.S. negotiator, Jennifer Hillman, who has asked for a  counterpart "with enough authority to make decisions," a U.S.  Embassy spokesman said.    China agreed to resume talks last week after U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kanter announced on January 6 that the  United States would be imposing lower import quotas on Chinese  goods due to illegal transshipments of goods to the U.S.    Transshipments occur when goods are disguised, through false  labeling and other means, to appear as if they were manufactured  in a country other than the country of origin.    The U.S., which received over 7.3 billion dollars of Chinese  textile imports in 1993, has accused the Chinese ministry of  allowing an additional 2 billion dollars of textiles to enter  the U.S. illegally, thus exceeding quotas established by the  U.S.-China textile agreement.    The two countries have been embroiled in talks to amend and  extend the agreement for nine months with transshipments,  overshipments and copyright issues at the center of the dispute.    China clamped down on several companies believed to be  involved in the illicit trade as late as last October, but  apparently the U.S. is not satisfied with the progress.    The Chinese source would not speculate on the outcome of the  three-day talks only saying, "It seems to be a political issue,  which cannot be decided by the Chinese side."</p>

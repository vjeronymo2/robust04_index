			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Hilder: "Czech Republic and Germany Pave </F> Way for Road Connection"]    [Text] "It's a historic flow, as important in its way as  the Channel Tunnel," said Vaclav Purchart, pointing to maps of  the northern section of the Czech-German border.    The object of such grand reflections is the planned highway  link that will guide an estimated 80,000 vehicles over the  border after its expected completion in the year 2002. The  connection is a key component in the Czech government's plans to  integrate the Czech transportation and communication systems  into European networks.    In the eyes of Purchart, a deputy at the Ministry of the  Environment, the road will complete a vital continental  connection between Berlin and Rome. Unfortunately, there is  still no decision on exactly where the Czech dalnice will meet  the German Autobahn.    The planned road is giving Czech officials a permanent  headache due to the nature of the area it will cross. It must  avoid the urban conurbation of Teplice and skirt the nature  preserves of the Ore Mountains while not disrupting the  activities of northern Bohemia's heavy industries.    Purchart has not had an easy job. "People still think of the  environment as just trees, whereas it is really an integrated  overview of numerous elements," he said.    In fact, the environment was not viewed in legal terms at  all  until a new law was introduced in March 1992 to limit the  damaging effects of construction on surrounding areas. This  forced engineers working on the road link to rethink their  plans, which they had been developing on purely technical  grounds, and led to the commissioning of a report from the  Environment Ministry.    Purchart and his department have narrowed the possible  routes  to a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) strip north of Teplice, between the  Czech village of Krupka and the German village of Furstenau.  They now have to decide between a tunnel crossing and an  above-ground highway.    Purchart favors two tunnel variants, between one-half and  five kilometers long, but admits that these are almost twice as  expensive as surface roadway. "The surface route would have to  be longer, though, so costs could level out," said Purchart.    The Germans are not so plagued by doubts. Last week, the  Saxon regional government approved a DM 1.8 billion ($1.05  billion) budget along with a route that will lead from Dresden  via the border communities of Liebenau and Breitenau to the area  designated by the Czech-Saxon working group.    "The German side presented less geographical problems,  rising  slowly to the hilly border region," said Purchart. "The Czech  side is steeper and more populated, and therefore more  problematic."    Milan Machart at the Ministry of Transportation said it will  be at least two years before the site for the international link  is finalized. His department's ultimate plan is for the major  Czech cities to be connected by high-speed roads to Germany,  Austria, Poland and Slovakia, providing cheaper services for  international north-south and east-west traffic. In addition,  road-building and service industries are expected to alleviate  the unemployment problems in certain border areas.    The highway expansion program is estimated to cost 100  billion Kc ($3.3 billion) in its entirety, a sum to be raised by  bank loans and an annual road-users' fee of 400 Kc, to be  introduced in January 1995. Given the extent of the planned  development, Purchart said he prefers that the Environment  Ministry maintain active cooperation with construction engineers  rather than vetoing plans as they develop.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SPORTSCLUB, BATTLING BANKRUPTCY, CLOSES ITS STORE IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY  </P> <P> All American SportsClub, a discount sporting goods chain, has closed its  Fountain Valley store as the company struggles to pull itself out of  bankruptcy.  </P> <P> SportsClub has been operating under Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy  Court in Los Angeles since last March, and it has closed a few of its stores  along the way.  </P> <P> Stores in Fountain Valley and Woodland Hills were closed on Sunday. The Burbank  and Culver City stores were closed earlier. Stores in Sacramento and San  Bernardino remain open, company employees said.  </P> <P> The Long Beach-based company has filed a reorganization plan, but a court  hearing has not yet been scheduled, said Sandra S. Kass, a SportsClub attorney.  Creditors have discussed the plan, and the company will add some information  and clarify existing points in the plan, she said.  </P> <P> SportsClub was founded by Robert J. McNulty in 1986, shortly after he sold his  interest in HomeClub, the Fullerton chain of discount home improvement stores  that he co-founded.  </P> <P> When he started SportsClub, McNulty said his concept was to apply to sporting  goods the same no-frills sales techniques that proved so popular in selling  paint and faucets. His plan was to undercut the prices of his competition by  25% to 30% by selling directly out of high-ceiling, cement-floor warehouses  with large volumes of inventory.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for SportsClub said McNulty was out of town and unavailable for  comment Tuesday.

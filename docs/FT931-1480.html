			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Platform shoes squeeze Lambert Howarth LAMBERT HOWARTH, the UK footwear supplier, yesterday announced an 8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.98m in 1992 on a 17 per cent jump in sales to Pounds 56.6m. Mr Robert Garfit, managing director, said the group had suffered from 'adverse conditions on the high street' and the effect of devaluation on its imported products. Margins had been under severe pressure, although Lambert had sought to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The impact of changing fashion - particularly increased demand for platform shoes - had also depressed margins. Platforms, the group said, required more complicated production processes and higher cost materials. However, the group had made significant progress in its acquisition programme. Honeywell footwear, a safety footwear group, and Technic, a manufacturer of mens shoes, were acquired and contributed some Pounds 1.5m to sales. Lambert reported net cash balances at the end of the year of Pounds 5m, after making the acquisitions. The final dividend is 8.75p for a total of 13p (12.5p). Earnings were maintained at 39.2p (39.3p), helped by a lower tax charge.</p>

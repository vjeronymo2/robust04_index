			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Streisand deal with Sony could exceed Dollars 40m SONY'S US movie and recorded music subsidiaries have struck an exclusive and long-term deal with Ms Barbra Streisand, the singer and actress. The contract is believed to be worth at least Dollars 40m and could rise to as much as Dollars 60m. The contract was orchestrated by a Sony team that included Mr Mickey Schulhof, vice-chairman of Sony USA, Mr Peter Guber, chairman of the Hollywood-based Sony Pictures Entertainment group, and Mr Mark Canton, chairman of Sony's Columbia Pictures division. Although large, it is consistent with other such deals for US superstar entertainers. Madonna, the pop star, recently agreed a Dollars 60m multi-media deal with the Time Warner group, while Mr Michael Jackson, another entertainer, has a similarly-sized contract with Sony Music. Sony yesterday said it could not comment on the financial terms of the new contract. But one executive explained that it could total as much as Dollars 60m, depending on how many films Ms Streisand became involved in and whether she worked as an actress, producer or director. Some parts of the new Streisand deal are believed to be extend to 10 years. The contract covers recorded albums, as well as acting, directing and producing feature films. The 50-year-old Ms Streisand began her career in 1962 with Columbia Records, part of CBS Records. CBS Records was acquired by Sony four years ago, and Ms Streisand has remained under contract with the Sony record division. Last year, Ms Streisand directed Prince of Tides, a Columbia Pictures film that cost about Dollars 30m to make and earned Dollars 125m in gross worldwide receipts at the box office.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Pact to limit pension costs hit THE future of an agreement to limit the cost of equalising pensions for men and women across Europe has been effectively snuffed out by the Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty. The treaty had included a protocol, quietly introduced by the Dutch government, which said that, although companies could not allow women to retire earlier than men and still earn equal benefits, they only needed to do so after May 17, 1990. On that date, the European Court, in a landmark case known as Barber vs. Guardian Royal Exchange, had ruled that pensions are effectively deferred pay and that companies may not discriminate in pay offered to men and women. Equalising pensions retrospectively in Britain could have cost up to Pounds 50bn, according to industry estimates. In the Netherlands, companies could face a bill of up to Pounds 30bn. Belgium and Ireland could face costs of up to Pounds 15bn and Pounds 500m respectively. Other countries could also be affected. The protocol provided the narrowest and least expensive interpretation of retrospective payments from the employers' point of view. It meant current pensioners would not be eligible for any enhancement in benefits and a man halfway through his working career would be eligible for improved pension benefits only for the period from May 17, 1990. If the EC fails to revive the Maastricht agreement, European governments will have to await a decision by the European Court in October, after it has heard a case brought by the trustees of the Coloroll pension fund, along with two other cases involving retired people in Germany and the Netherlands. That decision will determine the extent to which companies are expected to provide equal pension benefits retrospectively.</p>

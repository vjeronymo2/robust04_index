			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Bring on the Twingo - Practical runabouts WHERE IS the second car that is, above all, practical? A car cheap to buy and run; compact, yet roomy; and cleanable inside and out, if not with a hosepipe, then with a bucket and sponge? There used to be one: the Renault 4. But, having made 8,135,424 of them (two of which I bought) in 32 years, Renault knocked it on the head last December. Nothing like it exists now, although the Fiat Panda (also nearing the end of the road) could have been. It is cheap, square and sensible but not quite long enough as a load-carrier. And it was never made with four passenger doors - a must if children are to be stowed away easily and elderly passengers allowed to enter and leave with dignity. The Renault 4, like the Citroen 2CV that preceded it, was created for a France that no longer exists. It was a country populated by peasant farmers who had been weaned only recently from horses and carts. They wanted a cheap, simple car that would stand being driven overloaded on bad roads or across fields. The 2CV was an unbreakable runabout but the R4 was a better load-carrier - its tailgate and flat floor were bigger. Like the 2CV, it had nothing hanging down underneath and very soft, long-travel suspension. The soft suspension also meant that it rolled on corners like a flat-bottomed boat in a beam sea but never fell over. I cannot say it was very fast, but it would hold 65mph on a motorway and even gallop up to an indicated 80mph, downhill with a following wind. Its unorthodox gear lever sprouting from the fascia put off many prospective British buyers, but it worked in the same way as one on the floor. Its great advantage was leaving the front of the car free of any obstruction. When you parked, you slid across the seats - lovely soft ones they were, too - and stepped straight on to the pavement. The heater was adequate and the fresh-air ventilation primitive but effective. You opened two large vents in the fascia and bucketfuls of air rushed in. Wire mesh like a kitchen strainer removed the larger insects and small birds. A huge fabric sun-roof was a cheap R4 extra. Open, you could carry long poles or a ladder - on a fine day, at any rate. Closed, it was leak-proof in a thunderstorm (or a car wash). And because it was tall, there was enough room in a Renault 4 for dustbins - even old-fashioned milk churns - to stand upright. What would not go in could hang out. Stricter crash-safety requirements finished off the Renault 4. A 32-year-old design based on a strong, load-bearing platform with a flimsy, lightweight body could not crumple in the controlled, impact-absorbing way regulations now demand. Perhaps buyers are too sophisticated now to appreciate the merits of an ugly, if practical, car. And since it must be at least 10 years since I drove a Renault 4, maybe I would find it unacceptably basic as a semi-rural runabout. But there must be a place for a really simple, roomy car today. The idea of one lives on at Renault. Star of the 1992 Paris motor show was its Twingo, a brilliant 'one box' (no bonnet or boot) design with styling overtones of the Renault Espace but aimed at the broad base of the car market. Although not as long as the dear old R4 and only a three-door, it is roomier inside than it looks. That is because its cross-mounted engine takes up far less space than the 4's fore-and-aft engine plus gearbox stuck out in front. Renault is not sure if the Twingo will come to Britain. I reckon it would be the UK's loss (and Renault's) if it did not.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Deterrent overdue Sir, The plan by Michael Howard, the home secretary, to introduce a law to punish those who obtain private information by deception is long overdue ('Howard moves to protect confidential information', April 16). As legislation throughout Europe moves towards greater transparency when storing personal information on computer, the growth of an underworld dealing in 'confidential information' is an insidious corollary. A deterrent is vital, and criminalisation is a welcome development. T W Phillips, chairman, Institute of Credit Management, The Water Mill, Station road, South Luffenham, Oakham, Leics LE15 8NB</p>

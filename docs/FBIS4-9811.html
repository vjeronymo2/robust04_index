			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Harmodio Arias, deputy commerce and industries  minister, has referred to the banana situation, saying that  economic interests and not Latin American unity seem to prevail  on this issue and that Costa Rica had not reciprocated Panama's  actions in the banana business. Colombia's and Costa Rica's  decision to negotiate, on their own, a banana agreement with the  European Union negatively affects Latin American unity and  directly harms Panama, Harmodio Arias has said.    [Begin Arias recording] I believe this shows there is no  Latin American unity. With Costa Rica, we have respected our  promise to vote for Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus  [at the OAS elections], but they have broken our unity on the  banana issue. [end recording]    Arias said Colombia and Costa Rica want to get the best part  of the banana business with Europe without caring about the rest  of the region, and this cannot be.    [Begin recording] [Arias] We cannot accept a quota for each  country; this goes against everything that deals with free  trade. It is not possible for several European gentlemen to be  the ones to decide Panama only has the right to export 19  percent of bananas consumed by the European Economic Community.    [Unidentified reporter] What does this 19 percent represent  regarding our interests, farms, and workers? How much will this  hurt us?    [Arias] Crumbs. We are left with crumbs. Panama exports 70  percent of its banana production to Europe; thus, we have been  left with only crumbs. [end recording]    Arias was emphatic when he said the other banana-producing  countries will not allow unilateral agreements with the European  Union and will negotiate as a block to obtain added economic  advantages.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XVI. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communitites;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because the Administrator has determined that reformulated gasoline will cost well in excess of $100 million per year and therefore should be classified as a significant regulatory action. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record: EPA Air Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the reformulated gasoline program has been prepared and placed in Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;12 to accompany this EPA notice of final rulemaking. A draft version of the Regulatory Impact Analysis was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12866. Written comments from OMB and EPA response to those comments have also been placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. EPA has made subsequent updates and revisions to the draft version pertinent to the use of the simple model. A final version of the analysis is available in the docket cited above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XVII. Compliance With the Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No.1591.03) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA, 401 M Street, SW.

These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 8 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 38 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

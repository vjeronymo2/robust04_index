He said in a speech  he delivered at the official ceremony held to mark the occasion  that the country is entering a unique constitutional phase as  Sudan will be administered by 26 state governments in addition  to the federal government. He pointed out that each government  will enjoy executive and legislative powers which the citizens  have never experienced in the remote areas. He said that the  powers and jurisdictions of the governors and ministers have  been defined in a clearer and more comprehensive form.    President al-Bashir said that the Bureau of Federal  Governance must be regarded as responsible for following up the  implementation of federal governance in the states as well as  linking the states with one another, and linking them to the  federal government to facilitate proceedings and to save the  time of officials in the states.    Lt. Gen. al-Bashir said that measures will be taken in the  coming days to regulate the work of the legislative councils and  to define their powers to complete the effective consultative  framework. He confirmed the role of the Transitional National  Assembly which will take part in legislation and the  introduction of amendments and endorsements. His Excellency  stressed that Sudan will continue its march toward the  implementation of the revolutionary slogans despite the  conspiracies of the enemies of the nation to torpedo the  cultural scheme.    His Excellency appealed to the citizens to support their new  state governments by working continuously to arouse everybody's  energies and to utilize their capabilities to strengthen the  march toward stability and development. President al-Bashir  recommended to the governments of the new states the need to  take care of the weak, the elderly, the widowed, and orphaned in  line with social assistance objectives because it is through  them that God showers his mercy and removes the people's plight.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: PANAMA CITY;  </P> <P> CUBANS GO HOME  </P> <P> Eleven of 15 Cuban diplomats accredited in Panama face a Friday deadline to  leave the country, expelled because of Havana's refusal to recognize the  government of President Guillermo Endara, installed during the U.S. invasion  that toppled Gen. Manuel A. Noriega last Dec. 20.  </P> <P> The expulsions underline what analysts describe as the growing isolation in the  region of Cuban President Fidel Castro, who supported Noriega.  </P> <P> Cuba's ambassador to Panama City was shown the door last March, and Panamanian  Foreign Minister Julio Linares has warned that his country will sever relations  with Havana completely unless it ceases its "hostile conduct" toward Endara.  </P></p>

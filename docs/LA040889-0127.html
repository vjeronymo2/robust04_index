			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL;  </P> <P> PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE;  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS SHUTS DOWN LAGUNA HILLS  </P> <P> Dave Jacobson hit a third-inning home run as Trabuco Hills High School defeated  Laguna Hills, 1-0, in a Pacific Coast League game Friday at Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> Jacobson's homer, one of six hits allowed by losing pitcher Ron Kortman (5-1),  supported the pitching of David Lowery (5-1), who struck out 10 and scattered  six hits to record the victory.  </P> <P> "This is the best game Lowery has pitched this year," said Trabuco Hills Coach  Don Munsell, whose team improved to 8-3 overall and 5-0 in league play. "There  were times when he overthrew the ball, but each time, he settled down and got  back on his groove. I don't see anyone better than him in the county."  </P> <P> Said Laguna Hills Coach Jack Hodges: "He was getting a lot of calls that I  didn't think were strikes, but you have to give him credit. In a pitching duel  like we were in today, you have to play the little ball well, and we didn't  play the little ball well."  </P> <P> Laguna Hills (12-4, 4-1), which was ranked first in Orange County this week,  had its best scoring chance in the bottom of the first inning when Lowery hit  one batter and allowed two hits to load the bases with two out. But Lowery  ended the inning by getting Kortman to pop out to third. AL PRESTON  </P></p>

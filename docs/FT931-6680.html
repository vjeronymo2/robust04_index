			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / As they say in Europe: Try to understand John Major I WAS riveted by the phrase, 'We must condemn a little more and understand a little less.' The prime minister, John Major, uttered it in a newspaper interview last Sunday when asked about the wave of violent crime in which Britain is at present engulfed, as is demonstrated by everything except the evidence. The phrase finds only a limited echo elsewhere in Europe. In French it becomes the conclusion of the syllogism whose first premiss is the well-known saying, 'Tout expliquer, c'est tout comprendre.' It goes nicely into German: 'Mehr Verurteilen, weniger Verstandnis.' That could easily appear on the masthead of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a paper which constantly puts Major's injunction into practice. This week saw a nice round-up of the usual suspects - those phenomena which threaten civilised existence - Serbs, social- democrats and cuts in interest rates. And yet in a country that many still associate with strict attitudes towards deviant behaviour, the punishment of violent crime in particular seems, by comparison with Britain, astonishingly lax. When four youths beat an Angolan guestworker to death in the eastern German city of Eberswalde last year, they got a maximum of four years apiece in jail: Die Welt described the sentences as 'heavy.' Maybe this gives force to the views of a German friend of mine who once said: 'In this country you can get with murder, but very little else.' Moscow's Sovetskaya Rossiya provides the ultimate realisation of Major's advice. As its anachronistic name implies, it manages to condemn everything and understand absolutely nothing. This week it produced a memorable piece on the 'purposeful wrecking of the army and navy in every respect by the top military-political leadership of the country.' But most of the great newspapers of Europe, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Le Monde, El Pais and so on, get the phrase the other way round and hesitate to criticise anything. They tend to be depressingly fair-minded and objective, giving long explanations of the background to evil events and, as a result, are, in a word, boring. Nobody ever went out to lynch someone after reading the Neue Zurcher. Major's injunction was not translated in the Spanish and Italian papers I saw. Their journalists worked their way around it because, by itself, its meaning was hard to grasp in their languages. In Italy the phrase which has become derided as the ultimate expression of ludicrous liberalism in Britain, 'we are all guilty,' becomes the basis of the penal system. Any number of psychiatrists earn their living tramping through the courts explaining how the criminal is the victim. But Italy, of course, is perhaps the one country where 'we are all guilty' is probably nothing more than a statement of fact. If you are not on the take, you are letting your family down. And yet, in spite of its unique qualities, Italy remains the most under-reported country in western Europe. Pope-and-mafia stories provide the staple for most papers and the country is condemned without being understood almost everywhere, as it always has been. The Frankfurter Allgemeine had another go this week at highlighting the sufferings of the German-speaking majority of South Tyrol region: 'The Italians cannot bring themselves to accept the German origin of local place-names.' An English traveller in the 15th century described Italy as 'a paradise inhabited with devils.' Even the present spectacular round of arrests, a cabinet reshuffle and the incipient collapse of the state evoke only limited interest among the European reading public: in Italy nothing is surprising. As Shakespeare discovered four centuries ago, if you want to someone to believe the impossible, you set it in Italy. Britain seems far more interesting to most of its neighbours and it is coming to play a role as a sort of super-Italy. Others seem to have accepted the British evaluation of their country as an almost mythic land where not only can things be expected to go spectacularly wrong but where they can become exceptionally nasty too. The most recent horror to strike Liverpool, a city which has gained a notable reputation throughout Europe as the ultimate symbol of what it means to be British, was discussed in a number of editorials. The other Frankfurt paper, the Rundschau wrote: 'The insecurity which has gripped the British because of this terrible story has another side. Fourteen years of Tory rule have much to do with it - the ideology of a callous individualism which has no need to recognise such realities as poverty and social hopelessness.' Now, was that written by someone who knows how to condemn more and understand less, or vice versa? James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

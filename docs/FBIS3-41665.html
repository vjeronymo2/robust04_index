The report  contains further recommendations for the protection of the ozone  layer. To make the measures effective, the multilateral fund  providing assistance to developing countries to phase out  ozone-depleting substances was replenished at a level of 510  million U.S. dollars for the next three years, given unexpended  funds of 450 million U.S. dollars was required from developed  countries. [sentence as heard]    The composition of the executive committee of the  multilateral fund was agreed to be Australia, Denmark, France,  Japan, Norway, Poland, and the United States of America,  representing developed countries; and Algeria, Argentina,  Brazil, Cameroon, India, Malaysia, and Venezuela, representing  developing countries. Malaysia was selected to chair the  committee and Australia to act as vice chairperson. The meeting  agreed to add to the list of approved destruction technologies  municipal solid waste incinerators for foams containing  ozone-depleting substances. Several representatives endorsed  the proposal to finance a limited number of methyl bromide  alternative demonstration projects from the multilateral fund.    The Montreal Protocol meeting will be followed next week by  the third meeting of the conference of the parties of the Vienna  Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer on 23 and 24  November. The Montreal Protocol and the Vienna Convention are  the first global agreements to protect the atmosphere. The  sixth meeting of parties to the Montreal Protocol will be held  in Nairobi next year, and the seventh meeting in Vienna in 1995.</p>

As previously reported, Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas  Jarmalavicius, leaders of the underground Lithuanian Communist  Party, were arrested by Lithuanian and Belarussian officials in  Minsk and brought to a Vilnius prison Jan. 15.    The arrest and the extradition of the two communist leaders  to Lithuania caused a political storm in Belarus. Some  high-ranking Belarussian officials face dismissal.    Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of the Belarusian  parliament,  told the Russian Ostankino TV Sunday [22 January] that  Belarusian authorities had no right to extradite Burokevicius  and Jarmalavicius to Lithuania.    Viktoras Markovas, chief prosecutor of the Lithuanian  Prosecutor General's Office, said on Lithuanian radio Monday  that the problem in Belarus is dominated by political motives  and in fact is an attempt to oust the leadership of the  Belarusian Interior Ministry and the KGB.    The Lithuanian official said "what was undertaken, was done  in strict accordance with the requirements of the agreement" on  legal assistance. Markovas was among those who drafted the  agreement.    The chief prosecutor said all necessary extradition  documents  were presented to the Belarusian side in advance, Belarusian  officials considered the request and agreed to extradite persons  who are not citizens of Belarus and are punishable according to  the Belarusian law.    In Markovas' opinion, Belarusians should have assisted the  Lithuanian side even more and to help transport the alleged  criminals to Lithuania.    Burokevicius and Jarmalavicius are charged with conspiracy  to  overthrow the government and premeditated murder. If convicted  they face from 15 years in jail to capital punishment. As a  result of a military aggression in Vilnius Jan. 13, 1991, 13  civilians were killed and around 700 injured defending state  institutions from Soviet tanks.</p>

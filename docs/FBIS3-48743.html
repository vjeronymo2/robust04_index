			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 27 (OANA-ANTARA) -- A three-day  meeting on Ligitan and Sipadan islands started here on Wednesday  with Indonesia urging Malaysia to respond to its arguments to  expedite the settlement of dispute over ownership of the two  tiny islands off Kalimantan.    "I hope that the response would be given at today's  meeting,"  head of the Indonesian delegation Izhar Ibrahim said.    At the opening session, the Indonesian delegation also  expressed the hope that the two countries would agree upon  several principles of settlement which would serve as the basis  for the settlement of the dispute in the next negotiations.    Izhar reminded the participants of Indonesia's stance on the  status of the islands adopted at the first meeting in July 1992  when the Indonesian delegation submitted documents and maps to  back Jakarta's claim over the two islands and the Malaysian  delegation put forward a memorandum along with supporting  documents.    "The Indonesian Government has replied to the memorandum in  February, but the Malaysian Government has not yet responded to  the documents and maps we have submitted to the Malaysian  delegation," said Izhar, who is the director-general of  political affairs at the Foreign Ministry.    Ahmad Kamil Jaafar, who led the Malaysian delegation said  the  dispute over Sipadan and Ligitan was not a matter of determining  boundaries, but rather it was related to sovereignty which  should be evidenced with the international law.    Kamil, who is secretary-general of Malaysia's Foreign  Ministry expressed his optimism that the dispute could be  resolved amicably.    The row over Sipadan and Ligitan resurfaced in recent months  after Malaysia promoted the islands as a tourist attraction,  which sparked off criticism from the Indonesian authorities.    President Suharto and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir  Mohamed at their meeting in Langkawi, Malaysia, last July agreed  to solve the dispute over ownership of the islands through  negotiations. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said last  week the dispute was a problem but it did not threaten the  frienship between the two countces, which are both members of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.    In a reply to newsmen's questions, Kamil said the  delegations  of the two countries were expected to enter the stage of  negotiation at the meeting shortly after they settled problems  relating to the exchange of documents agreed upon at the  previous meeting.    In a separate occasion, Izhar said the Indonesian Government  hoped that the meeting would enter the phase of negotiation.    The meeting is the second held under the scheme of the  Indonesia-Malaysia joint working group on Sipadan and Ligitan.  The working group was established at tha conclusion of the  first session of the Indonesia-Malaysia joint commission in  Kuala Lumpur in October 1991, in which the two countries agreed  to hold negotiations aimed at solving the 25-year-old dispute.</p>

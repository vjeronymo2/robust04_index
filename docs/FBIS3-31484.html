Reportedly, Mr. Dimitrov  informed the SDS parliamentary group about his intention  yesterday, commentaries on the issue appeared in today's press.  The SDS leader made a special statement claiming  misinterpretation of what he had said. His intention prompted a  series of explanations by representatives of the SDS.    In his statement Mr. Dimitrov described the adoption of the  Judiciary Organization Act on Tuesday as an "open communist  counter-revolution." "The SDS chairman's walking out of  parliament, backed by the SDS parliamentary group, can be  interpreted as a clear signal of our readiness to react strongly  if the act enters into force. Until that time the parliamentary  SDS must go on fighting," Mr. Filip Dimitrov said.    Several SDS organizations has recently proposed that the SDS  MP's walk out of parliament to provoke early elections. In 1991  the SDS precipitated the elections taking a similar step. By  Tuesday, the day on which the SDS top leadership holds its  regular meetings, the coalition had not taken a stand on a  possible boycott of parliament. Representatives of several  influential SDS parties, including the Democratic Party and the  Radical Democratic Party, let it be understood that they did not  agree with walking out of the National Assembly. Local analysts  believe that the unity of the coalition, which already suffered  a serious split in 1991, is questionable. Some of the MP's,  opposing the SDS walking out of parliament now, took part in the  1991 parliamentary boycott. In their view, such an act now  would be in vain.    This afternoon a number of representatives of the coalition  came out with statements commenting on the SDS leader's  intention to walk out of parliament. It became clear that Mr.  Filip Dimitrov did not actually walk out of parliament, but  intends to do so backed by the MP's of the SDS parliamentary  group in protest against the communist counter-revolution in  parliament, as he put it. SDS MP Zlatka Ruseva (affiliated to  the Democratic Party) said that Mr. Dimitrov's decision was a  personal one. "We are going to consider some variants of  action, Mr. Dimitrov's variant is one of the possible ways of  action, but the decision is to be made at a general meeting of  the SDS leadership and the SDS parliamentary group," MP Nikolay  Khristov, deputy floor leader of the SDS parliamentary group,  told reporters.</p>

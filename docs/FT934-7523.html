			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Better supplies for the troops - A look at why Europe's manufacturers are unhappy with their information technology Europe's manufacturers are unhappy with their suppliers of information technology. They want IT equipment which meets their needs more effectively, enabling them to speed up their processes and link up systems at different sites. Determined to put pressure on their suppliers, leading automotive and aerospace companies have banded together in a project aimed at producing a new generation of IT systems for manufacturers. It is expected to last for more than six years and involve an investment of more than Ecu424m (Pounds 330m). The consortium involved in the project contains 17 companies from six countries and is headed by Daimler-Benz, the German automotive and aerospace company. The others are Deutsche Aerospace, Mercedes-Benz vehicles and AEG electronics (all part of Daimler), the Volkswagen group and BMW from Germany; British Aerospace and the Rover Group from the UK; Aerospatiale, Dassault Aviation, PSA and Renault from France; Alenia, Fiat and component supplier Magneti Marelli from Italy; Saab Aerospace from Sweden; and CASA from Spain. All use IT extensively for design and manufacture. By collaborating and keeping suppliers at arm's length, the companies believe they can reach a consensus on their future IT requirements. They also believe they carry sufficient weight to persuade the IT vendors, such as IBM and Computervision, to develop the products to meet those requirements, an important one being the need for integration of different systems. The companies' objective, says Horst Soboll, the project's manager and Daimler's vice-president for IT strategy, is 'to improve the competitiveness of European manufacturing'. Soboll believes this can be achieved both by developing innovative technology more closely matched to the requirements of users and by using existing technology more innovatively. In the initial phase of the project, which started this month, the consortium will specify its IT requirements including any de facto standards it wishes to adopt and set priorities for the research and development projects that will follow in the main phase. This will take up to 18 months. IT vendors and academic institutions will be consulted for suggestions. Among those stressing the importance of this, to keep users up to date with emerging technology, is US-based Computervision. A leading supplier of software to the European automotive industry, it reluctantly admits that IT suppliers could do better. The cost of the pilot phase will be Ecu24m, half of which will be provided by the European Commission and the rest by the consortium. Although the Commission is funding the project under its Esprit IT research and development programme, it is unlike any previous Esprit project. Advanced Information Technology (AIT) in design and manufacturing - as the project is called - only includes IT users and is focused on one of the main problems facing most industries today: bridging the gap between IT needs and IT offerings. The project has not gone through the normal lengthy Esprit project approval mechanism. It was proposed in response to the Commission's request to industry for more user-driven, less technology-orientated, projects. (The Commission has often been criticised for the lack of returns to industry from its research spending.) The initial idea came from Daimler, which approached Europe's aerospace and automotive companies (and some leading US companies in the same industrial sectors). In less than a year, the consortium was formed and funding approved for the pilot phase. Rover backed the project from the first. 'It brings together the expertise of the best people in the European automotive industry to develop a strategic framework for all IT requirements for design and manufacturing,' says Paul Towers, Rover's manager of computer integrated engineering strategy. The company is confident that despite some big differences between the sectors (such as the rate of manufacturing output), the consortium will reach agreement on common problems and how to address them. If it does, the next Ecu400m phase will follow, for which Esprit funding will also be sought. This level of proposed European financial support reflects the scale and importance of the project. The Commission's proposed total spending on research and development into information and communications technologies (of which AIT is a part) is Ecu3.9bn for 1994-98. In the main development phase of AIT, the work will be split into individual projects in which selected IT vendors will be involved. The vendors need not be European but if they are to receive Esprit funds, they will be regarded more favourably if they have research and development facilities in Europe. These IT projects will cover three areas: Product and process modelling (for example, the creation of digital mock-ups); Simultaneous engineering for the development and manufacture of new products, especially where the development is being carried out at several different sites; Production control and logistics support. By the end of the 1990s, it is expected that many of the new developments will be demonstrable at user sites. Rover is looking forward to the next generation of IT systems for design and manufacturing. They will have modules specially tailored to the needs of the automotive and aerospace industries, but have the same core. 'One of the benefits of this project is that we can start addressing the necessary organisational and cultural changes that the new systems will require ahead of their implementation,' says Towers. 'This way we're likely to reap more rewards from the systems.' In the past, technology has often been installed with little thought about users and the organisation. Towers admits that 10 years ago, Rover invested heavily in computer-aided design without a detailed implementation plan. Only recently has it started to re-engineer its business processes and introduce techniques such as team-based, concurrent engineering to make better use of the systems. One of the biggest problems, however, with existing design, engineering and manufacturing systems, is integrating them so that the information flow from one to the next is fast, reliable and accurate. At the start of important aerospace projects, for example, the partners still invariably specify the use of a common computer-aided design system to overcome the difficulty of exchanging data between different systems. This inability to integrate systems from different vendors is one of the biggest causes of complaints from IT users in the manufacturing sector, according to a report on prospects for computer-integrated manufacturing (Cim) in the European Community produced by consultants Computer Aided Technologies Network (CATN). User dissatisfaction with software suppliers, the report found, was higher than 25 per cent in some cases. Since a score of 5 per cent is regarded as cause for concern, this is extremely high. While there were few complaints about specific functional solutions, users felt that suppliers lacked the skills, experience and vision to integrate these. Cultural changes are required by many IT vendors, insists Paul Drath, a consultant with Cambashi, the UK partner in CATN; otherwise, they risk losing business in the fastest growing market across all Cim applications. According to the report, manufacturers in the EC will invest Ecu1.7bn in systems integration in 1995 against Ecu970m in 1991. Spending on all Cim applications - technical (design and engineering systems), process automation, logistics and integration - is expected to rise from Ecu9bn to Ecu12bn. The manufacturers want more of this spending to go on satisfying their own needs rather than computer companies' desire to shift their products.</p>

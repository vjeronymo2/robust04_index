			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ABS/PHF/MAR: "BLEU-China: Belgium Will </F> Align Its Position With the European Union"; as released by  Brussels BELGA Database]    [Excerpts] Beijing 2 Mar (BELGA) -- Coming from Shanghai  and Hangzhou (capital of Zhejiang, the province situated below  Shanghai -- BELGA editor's note), Belgian Foreign Trade Minister  Robert Urbain and the members of the Belgian delegation of the  Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU)-China Economic  Committee arrived Wednesday evening in Beijing, where the tenth  meeting of the committee is due to be held Thursday and Friday.  This meeting will follow on directly from a meeting of the  homologous European (Community) (EC)-China Committee. On  Wednesday, before the latter dispersed, the Belgian delegation  contacted observers at the meeting (which was chaired by  European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan -- BELGA editor's note)  with a view to taking its bearings. Generally speaking, during  the BLEU-China trade negotiations which will start this Thursday  with an interview with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi,  Minister Urbain intends to align his position with that of the  EC in all areas, including that concerning the normalization of  human rights.    Cooperation between Europe and China is still governed by an  economic and trade cooperation agreement revised in 1985, which  aims at increasing reciprocal imports at the market price in  priority sectors (mining, energy, transport, telecommunications,  technology -- BELGA editor's note). European-Chinese  cooperation was brutally interrupted in June 1989 (Tien An Men  -- BELGA editor's note) and gradually built up again in 1991.  Their full normalization remains subordinate to progress on the  question of human rights, and two "sanctions" are theoretically  still in application (meaning no visits by heads of state, a  provision which has not in fact been respected, and the  interruption of military cooperation and arms sales -- BELGA  editor's note). [passage omitted]    The essential precondition imposed by Europe with a view to  achieving full normalization and, above all, supporting China's  request with a view to its full and complete reintegration into  GATT as from 1996, concerns the accelerated emergence of a real  market economy, especially through adaptation of the Chinese tax  system (a single VAT [value added tax] of 17 percent has just  been adopted, but many hindrances remain at the level of the  cooperation from one day to the next with European companies,  e.g., the virtual doubling of the price of services since the  start of 1994 -- BELGA editor's note), abandoning all dumping  practices, and endeavoring hard to integrate environmental,  safety, and hygiene standards into economic trade in general, as  well as increased respect for intellectual property rights.

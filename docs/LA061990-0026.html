			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA DROPS PLANS TO MOVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OFF CAMPUS  </P> <P> UCLA has backed away from a controversial plan to move its highly touted  experimental elementary school off campus and into the Santa Monica public  school system, university officials announced Monday.  </P> <P> The plan was abandoned in the face of intense protests from some parents and  faculty from the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School, who lobbied  state legislators and officials to oppose the move, generating enough political  opposition to kill chances that the plan would receive the required state  approval.  </P> <P> "One of our concerns all along has been to guarantee (the school's) integrity  and independence," said UCLA Assistant Vice Chancellor Carlotta Melon. That  would have required legislation to allow the school to maintain its  independence while part of a public school system, she said.  </P> <P> "Without the support from the state, we have no choice" but to drop the plan,  Melon said.  </P> <P> The decision was a major victory for the small group of parents and University  Elementary School officials who had opposed relocation of the historic  laboratory school, contending it would not be able to continue to function as  an independent research facility under the supervision of a public school  district.  </P> <P> "It's crucial to keep the school (at UCLA), not just for our children, but for  the benefit of kids all over the country" who benefit from research conducted  at the school, said Kathy Seal, mother of a University Elementary School  student and one of the leaders of the protest.  </P> <P> UCLA and Santa Monica school officials have contended that aligning the school  with a public school district would better allow it to test the relevance of  its research outside of the rarefied atmosphere of a college campus.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the school -- which tests new teaching techniques on its 450  students -- would have been built on parkland in Santa Monica's ethnically  diverse Ocean Park section. It would have operated under the aegis of the Santa  Monica-Malibu Unified School District, but be staffed and supervised by UCLA's  School of Education.  </P> <P> "We're disappointed because we really felt we were doing something both to  assure (the school) of long-term security and to benefit students in our  district," said Dan Ross, president of the Santa Monica-Malibu School Board.  </P> <P> "We thought we had a good chance of getting there, and we've been  short-circuited by politics rather than a good educational study and analysis"  of the implications of the move, he said.  </P> <P> The difficulty of persuading legislators to support the plan -- coupled with  the likelihood that parents would sue to block the move -- prompted the  district to abandon the proposal, Ross said.  </P> <P> The elementary school has operated on the UCLA campus for more than 100 years,  drawing students of every ethnic group and income level from across Southern  California. In its ungraded classrooms, where teachers develop their own  curricula, children of movie stars, politicians and poor families have served  as guinea pigs to test innovative teaching theories and techniques.  </P> <P> Negotiations to move the school began after UCLA announced plans to use a  record $15-million endowment to build a new Graduate School of Management on  part of the nine acres used by the school.  </P> <P> Melon said plans to build the new graduate school will go forward, while the  university considers the future of the prestigious lab school.  </P> <P> Elementary school faculty and parents are proposing the university build a  facility alongside the school to house the Graduate School of Education and  coordinate lab school research. That would allow the lab school to share its  findings with schools around the state. Melon said that is only one of several  options under consideration.  </P> <P> The defeat of the proposal comes only a few weeks after UCLA was forced by  community opposition to retreat from some aspects of its plans for a major  campus expansion.  </P> <P> The university had to scale back a massive, long-range development plan earlier  this month after Westwood residents and community leaders complained about the  increased traffic congestion and air pollution the project would generate.  </P></p>

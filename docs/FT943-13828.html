			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Paperback writers - Reading Matter So you're off on holiday this week and you haven't had a moment to think about the paperbacks you'll need for the beach. And, truth to tell, for most of the year you don't have much time for fiction. Nothing too ambitious, then. No, not Tolstoy again this year, and you'll resist the present craze for George Eliot after the success of Middlemarch on TV. Nor can you face the new young Tolstoy of India, Vikram Seth, whose A Suitable Boy at 1,474 pages would fill at least a fortnight (Phoenix Pounds 8.99). Something more like fun? One solution would be John le Carre's The Night Manager (Coronet Pounds 5.99), the spy-master's latest novel and very good indeed with its globe-trotting tale of the hotelier who sets out to track down 'the worst man in the world', an international arms-dealing tycoon straight out of the pages of this newspaper. If you are a Wilbur Smith fan, in company with countless millions, think twice before you grab the latest River God (Pan Pounds 5.99) - not because it's no good, but because it is a total departure from his usual territory of African bush and sundowners. This is Ancient Egypt, fun and games among the Pharoahs. The switch may not be as surprising as it sounds when you remember that Rider Haggard was an Egyptologist in his spare time. The last-but-one Barbara Vine is also at the airport - Asta's Book (Penguin Pounds 4.99). Vine is of course another name for Ruth Rendell, and is a leisurely saga based on a Scandinavian woman's diary throughout the century. It is rather slow and fairly long, which may not matter by the pool. Last year's Booker Prize winner, Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha, is now out in paperback (Minerva Pounds 5.99). A small boy in Dublin, wonderfully done - but it won't last you more than a couple of days. So try Bill Clinton's favourite, Walter Mosley. The President is right on this one: Mosley is a splendid addition to the American private eye tradition established for all time by Raymond Chandler. Mosley's hero is Easy Rawlins, an amateur black gumshoe returned from the Second War to the Los Angeles ghetto. So far there have been three books: Devil in a Blue Dress, A Red Death and White Butterfly (available from Serpent's Tail, Pan or both) Utterly distinctive; well worth trying. And if you've finished them all by Tuesday week? You could move back into serious literature - Picador have brought out as paperback batch of the modern 'Westerns' of Cormac McCarthy, who scored in this country with All The Pretty Horses. But don't confuse him with Zane Grey - the comparison in this case would be with William Faulkner. Does that sound a bit alarming? Then all praise to Penguin which has just issued The Adventures of Dickson McCunn by John Buchan (Pounds 8.99), a sequence 70-years-old and so much less known than the ubiquitous adventures of Richard Hannay. Here are the Gorbals Die-Hards born again, with their patron, the retired and romantic Glaswegian grocer: Huntingtower, Castle Gay and The House of the Four Winds in one volume. Pure bliss] The perfect escape from the office, and from 1994.</p>

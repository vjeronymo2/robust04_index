			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FATALITIES BRING DRIVE WARNING OF DEADLY NATURE OF TRAINS  </P> <P> In the wake of the third fatal train accident in three weeks, transportation  officials on Monday announced plans for a public-awareness campaign designed to  remind San Diego County residents that, now more than ever, trains can kill.  </P> <P> Two people were killed Sunday night when they were hit by a train in Encinitas.  </P> <P> Jesus Garcia, district director of Caltrans, said his agency will meet with  city and county officials to decide how best to update the often-outdated  perceptions of railroad hazards.  </P> <P> "Most people are aware that a freeway is not a safe place to play, but for some  reason they don't understand that train tracks, in many cases, are even more  deadly," Garcia said in a statement. "We need to make them aware. Their lives  could depend on it."  </P> <P> The agency hopes to erase romantic visions of hobo-hauling freight trains  ambling leisurely -- and noisily -- down the track. Howard Robertson, an Amtrak  spokesman, said its trains -- 16 of which zip through San Diego County each day  -- are faster and quieter than ever. And as they have gained speed and lost  decibels, partly as a result of newly installed quarter-mile strips of smooth,  silent track, they also have grown more deadly.  </P> <P> "People like it (the improvements), but it's creating a little bit more  danger," Robertson said. The trains "are on you before you even know it."  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials said that is apparently what happened to a group of  at least five people Sunday evening. About 7 o'clock, a southbound train  appeared suddenly out of the darkness, moving at 87 m.p.h. along a section of  track in Encinitas where the group had apparently gathered to drink beer.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said the locomotive's engineer saw the group on the tracks  and sounded his horn in warning, but he was unable to stop.  </P> <P> The bodies of Juan Carlos Ortega, 24, and Sandra Spires, 45, were found dozens  of feet south of the point of impact. A third person, Eliseo Zarate, 30, was  taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla with fractured ribs, a broken  collarbone and numerous cuts. Zarate was believed to have been struck by one of  the two people hit by the train.  </P> <P> The accident brought the county's train-related death toll to four this month.  On Oct. 13, a 16-year-old girl was killed by an Amtrak train while she and two  friends were walking along the railroad tracks near her parents' home in  Encinitas. On Oct. 4, a 22-year-old surfer was struck and killed while taking a  shortcut along a train trestle to the beach in San Onofre.  </P> <P> Just the day before, a southbound Amtrak train hit an auto-transport truck that  was stuck on the tracks in the Leucadia area of Encinitas. Six train passengers  suffered minor injuries.  </P></p>

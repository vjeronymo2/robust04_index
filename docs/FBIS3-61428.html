			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Part I of two-part article by S. V. Kunegin under the </F> rubric ``Switching, Telephony''; UDC 621.391.664.12]    [Abstract] A new approach to the elimination of interfering  echo signals in long-distance telephone channels is presented  based on a combination of traditionally separate  echo-suppression techniques. The use of both echo rejection and  echo compensation models within the same equipment is desireable  to take advantage of the relative technical simplicity of the  former and the superior signal-handling capabilities of the  latter. Optimization of the internal characteristics, i. e.,  suppression methods, of echo suppressors has application to  dynamic, stochastic, discrete and both controlled and  uncontrolled systems. The effectiveness criterion for the  suppression method is composed of three subindicators: technical  difficulty of echo-suppression (in terms of complexity of  computation); signal quality (expressed in user rating units);  functional reliability (determined by the expanse of the  functional conditions). Echo rejection and compensation methods  are evaluated by the use of computerized simulation or modeling.  Algorithms are worked out for input, output and primary control  signals using a recognition device, threshold limiting device  and a delay line. Block diagrams detail signal processing stages  in the echo-rejection model, the echo-compensation model and the  echo-path simulation model. Use of a summing circuit in the  latter allows an analysis of the effect of various types of  additive interference for modeling of echo-suppressor breakdown  conditions. Modeling of external additive noise effects is  achieved by means of generators employing smoothed noise  distribution, Gaussian noise distribution, harmonic interference  and pulsed interference. Results of the evaluation of all  methods, including the combined method of echo suppression, are  to be examined in the second part of the article. Figures 3;  references 13: 12 Russian.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 19 (BTA) -- I state most categorically  that Bulgaria is lagging more than two years behind all former  socialist countries in the training of civilian experts for the  needs of national security, Lieutenant General Stoyan Andreev,  who heads the Military Training Reform Commission with the  Defence Ministry, told journalists today. This is due to the  stupidity shown in the taking of many important decisions by  ignoramuses who for various reasons found themselves at the top  after the fall of the totalitarian regime in 1989, the general  said. The destructive attitude to the military industry led to  its almost complete rout, General Andreev said. The system of  scientific technological intelligence has also been ruined,  according to him. There are no guarantees that there will be no  painful experimenting with the fate of the state by the method  of trial and error in the period before and after elections,  General Andreev believes.    At a recently held meeting President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov and Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov  agreed to set up a centre for training civilian personnel for  the army and for the military training of civilian specialists,  General Andreev said at a briefing today. The centre will work  with the assistance of the G.S. Rakovski Military Academy in  Sofia. The Defence Ministry intends to invite for training at  the centre officials of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church because of  its important role in raising the morale of the Bulgarian Army,  General Andreev added.    From 6 to 10 senior officers will compete for a place in the  one-year general staff courses which will start this autumn at  the Military Academy, Major General Kiril Ermenkov, chief of the  academy, said at the briefing. The training of Bulgaria's  future strategists is an event of prime importance, General  Andreev said. In this field too Bulgaria, whose generals were so  far trained only abroad, is lagging behind the other former  socialist countries, the Defence Ministry believes. The courses  will be conducted by foreign and Bulgarian lecturers and leading  specialists, politicians and scientists of the Bulgarian Academy  of Sciences and of other institutes, the chief of the Military  Academy said.</p>

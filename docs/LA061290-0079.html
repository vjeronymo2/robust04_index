			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGUS MCBEAN; PHOTOGRAPHER OF ENTERTAINERS  </P> <P> Angus McBean, whose photographs of British entertainers ranged from a young  Laurence Olivier to the even younger Beatles, has died at age 86, it was  reported Monday.  </P> <P> The Associated Press said McBean died Saturday at a hospital in eastern  England.  </P> <P> David Ball, his assistant, said McBean had taken ill in February at his winter  home in Marrakech, Morocco. "He had assignments there for Harper's &amp; Queen  and Vogue. Despite his age, he was very much in demand."  </P> <P> From the early 1930s to the mid-1960s, McBean's portraits graced nearly every  theater in England. When he gave up stage photography in 1963 he noted "I had  photographed all of Shakespeare's plays in major productions: 'Hamlet' 14 times  and 'Macbeth' 16 times."  </P> <P> He became the official photographer for the Old Vic, Sadler's Wells and the  Shakespeare Memorial Theater at Stratford-on-Avon.  </P> <P> One of the first young actors to attract his attention was Olivier, whom he  found in a stage corner during a rehearsal at the Old Vic. Other stage legends  he photographed included Ralph Richardson, Ivor Novello and Vivien Leigh. As  his reputation grew, many of England's most accomplished performers refused to  be photographed by anyone else.  </P> <P> For more than 30 years, McBean photographed Leigh. It was his portrait of her  that was sent to Hollywood for studio talent scouts looking for an actress to  play Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind."  </P> <P> McBean saw Audrey Hepburn in a chorus line and after he used her in a beauty  advertisement she was invited to Hollywood. He took the picture of the Beatles  leaning over a stair rail for the 1963 cover of their "Please Please Me" album.  </P> <P> McBean, a cheerful, bearded man, whose surrealistic Christmas cards were  eagerly awaited each year by his friends, began by emulating the avant-garde  artists of the 1930s with photographs showing actresses in extraordinary poses.  Flora Robson, for instance, was shown as a classical bust in a desert.  </P> <P> Collecting photographs was such an unappreciated pursuit that in 1974, when  McBean wanted to divest himself of his glass-plate negatives, no British  institution was interested. So he sold 4.5 tons of them, covering 700 stage  productions over 30 years, to the Harvard Theater Collection.  </P> <P> McBean was born in Newport, Wales, and discovered his gift with the camera at  age 12.  </P> <P> He got his break as a photographer when he was discovered by Novello, the  actor, dramatist and composer, while working as a maker of stage masks and  props.  </P> <P> McBean maintained that "anyone can be a photographer. It is the subject matter  which makes a great photographer."  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese  publishes in its 6 March edition, on page 16, four articles by  Octavio Guedes and Renato Garcia about alleged links between the  Comando Vermelho drug trafficking gang and the illegal animal  lottery bankers.    The first 400-word article states that police have realized  that the Comando Vermelho chiefs imprisoned in Bangu I  penitentiary do not have the wealth that all their criminal  actions should have given them. Police and judges believe the  real chiefs of these organizations are not in the slums, where  there is no infrastructure to launder dollars, import drugs, or  purchase imported weapons. According to the testimony of some  gang members, all the money collected in the drug markets,  nearly $2.5 million per month, was administered by an illegal  animal lottery banker known as Carlos Alberto Goncalves dos  Santos, aka Carlinhos Barbudo, who is currently at large.    A 200-word article states that the first time the full  extent  of the criminal gang was discovered was in the gang case in  Borel Hill, where close links between community leaders and drug  traffickers were demonstrated, as well as the existence of a  "court" to judge those who oppose the laws of the drug  traffickers, who organize parties to attract drug buyers and  youths for prostitution. Police found out that about 140 people  were involved in this illegal scheme in some way.    Another 200-word article reports on the activities of  Carlinhos Barbudo, who was named as the "owner" of the illegal  animal lottery's gambling sites. According to a gang leader's  wife, he was the treasurer for the drug markets, and other gang  members testified that he personally paid drug suppliers.    The last 200-word article quotes Rio de Janeiro Civil Police  Chief Nilo Batista as saying: "Nobody can tell who is the  Comando Vermelho gang's chief." He says he believes that a good  portion of the drug trafficking money moved in Rio de Janeiro is  spent on the drug markets' structure and the purchase of weapons  and drugs. The remaining money is used to pay bribes to police  and informers. Nilo Batista maintains that the organizational  level of the Comando Vermelho gang is very low. The  best-organized gang, he says, is that headed by drug trafficker  Orlando da Conceicao, which exploits drug markets in eight slums  in northern Rio de Janeiro. Police say there is no evidence to  link the illegal animal lottery bankers with drug trafficking,  and the Brazilian drug traffickers arrested so far are not rich  like the Bolivian coca "barons."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party Central Committee, visited a number of injured  yesterday who are to be taken abroad for treatment. This is  within the framework of the government's concern and interest in  the heroes of our brave Armed Forces and the citizens who are  defending the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Yemen  and the dignity and honor of the Yemeni people.    The brother chairman of the Presidential Council saw the  conditions of the wounded and wished them a speedy recovery and  return to continue their struggle and participate in the  building of the Republic and its defense.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid commended the heroic and  courageous  steadfastness of our brave soldiers in collaboration with the  sons of our people in the battle of resistance against the  al-Ahmar family which imposed this war on our people to maintain  their selfish and narrow interests. [passage omitted]    He assured the wounded that victory would be our ally  because  we have a cause. Our heroic resistance would teach the military  and tribal formations of al-Ahmar family a lesson they would  never forget. It would breathe its last at the hands of our  armed forces. He pointed out that the victories achieved on the  battlefronts prepared the proper conditions for the creation of  a better democratic future and would put an end to the  obstructions of those influential forces which wished to take us  back to the past.

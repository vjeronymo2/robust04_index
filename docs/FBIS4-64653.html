			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Colin Brown article: "Pro-Europe Group Set for Battle"] </F>   [Text] Tory MPs belonging to the Positive Europe group  have called a meeting at Westminster next week to discuss its  strategy for dealing with the ascendancy of Euro-sceptics.    Some warned that the anger of the pro-European Tory MPs  could  be held back, but only until after the European elections. They  denied they were the new "Euro-bastards", but their patience is  growing thin.    Some are threatening to break cover if the Tory manifesto  for  the European elections is Euro-sceptic in tone.    "Euro-enthusiasts" angrily accused Michael Portillo of  mounting a leadership bid with his own agenda on Europe.  Officers of the group privately demanded a firm rebuke from  John Major. "If he doesn't stop Portillo now, his leadership is  finished," a senior member said. One ministerial source said:  "Every time he fails to slap them down, he lets the  Euro-sceptics move a step further."    They rejected the Euro-sceptics' allegation that  pro-Europeans are now a tiny party minority and had become a  mirror image of "bastards" who opposed Maastricht.    The only member of the group to attack Mr Portillo publicly  was Hugh Dykes, who accused him of breaching policy by openly  opposing a single European currency.    The group claims the support of about 80 Tory MPs. None of  its leaders is a natural trouble-maker. They include Ray  Whitney, a former minister; Ian Taylor, parliamentary aide to  William Waldegrave; Emma Nicholson, another parliamentary aide;  Ralph Howell, a senior backbencher; and Jacqui Lait, MP for  Hastings.    Backbench supporters include party stalwarts such as Sir  Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, an officer of the 1922 Committee, Tom  King, former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and Graham  Bright, the Prime Minister's Parliamentary aide. Other founding  members have been promoted by Mr Major as ministers, including  Michael Ancram and Sir John Wheeler, both Northern Ireland  ministers.    The most ardent pro-Europeans -- Mr Dykes, David Madel,  David  Knox and Robert Hicks -- are also members of Nick's Diner, the  wets' dining club. Some privately admit their problem is that  they are seen as "wet" and unlikely to cause the difficulty for  Mr Major that the anti-Maastricht "bastards" did. But if they  sense they are losing the battle for Europe, that will be the  point at which the pro-Europeans adopt the tactics of the  "bastards."</p>

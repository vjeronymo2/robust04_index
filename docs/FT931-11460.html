			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Telmex in line with expectations TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's monopoly telephone utility and the country's largest private company, reported net profits of 7.972bn new pesos (Dollars 2.56bn) for 1992, an increase of 1.9 per cent in real terms on 1991. The results were in line with expectations, but Telmex shares fell in early trading yesterday. Excluding extraordinary items such as 1991's profitable debt swap, Telmex profits increased in real terms by 12.4 per cent last year, and 14.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, similar to growth of recent years. Telmex intends to invest 7.518bn new pesos in modernising Mexico's antiquated telephone system this year. It hopes to increase lines in service by 12.3 per cent, or 850,000 lines, and to extend fibre-optic cables carrying long-distance calls to 6,000km. The investment in updating the telephone system, mandated by the government concession, is one of largest in the world. The company, as required by government regulation, increased lines in service by 12.1 per cent last year, with sales up by an inflation-adjusted 13.7 per cent. 'There were no real surprises in the 1992 numbers, except the company took a Dollars 20m-Dollars 25m write-off for obsolete equipment,' said Mr Mickey Schleien, Latin American analyst at Morgan Stanley. Profit margins fell slightly, as costs grew faster than revenues, due to the company's 'additional commitment to quality,' Mr Schleien said. Line growth also slowed in the last quarter of 1992. Telmex is controlled by Grupo Carso, the Mexican conglomerate that successfully placed Dollars 350m of stock on international markets last week . The offering was the first important one by a Mexican company since Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, abandoned its share offer in June last year due to lack of demand.</p>

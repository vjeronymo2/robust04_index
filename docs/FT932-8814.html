			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard purchase HEWLETT-PACKARD, the California-based electronics company, has agreed in principle to buy BT&amp;D, a joint venture between BT and DuPont. Terms were not disclosed, but sources suggested the price was in the low millions of pounds. BT&amp;D employs 455 people at its Ipswich facility and another 35 in the US and Japan developing and making fibre optic components. It was founded in 1986 to exploit emerging markets for fibre optics in communications. It is understood that BT and DuPont were prepared to sell the company as part of BT's strategy of getting out of hardware manufacture. Hewlett-Packard, on the other hand, is increasingly focusing on communications as it gears up to become a supplier of 'information superhighways' for companies networking their operations globally.</p>

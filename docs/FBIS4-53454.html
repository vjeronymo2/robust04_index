			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2239 GMT on 14 May, in its "News 2001" program,  carries a 30-minute interview with Masayoshi Takemura, head of  Sakigake, by FNN announcer Yuji Kuroiwa and Megumi Sekito,  attended by writer Yoshimi Ishikawa, political commentator  Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki  Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo.    Asked to clarify Sakigake's political stand, Masayoshi  Takemura (hereinafter Takemura) says: "As I said during my Diet  speech, we have responsibilities to fulfill because we worked  with the Hosokawa administration in preparing the budget and  enacting the laws. Therefore, we will act as a ruling party and  cooperate with them as far as the budget and the laws are  concerned, at least during the current Diet session." He adds:  "However, as far as the Hata administration's new policies are  concerned, we will carefully study them and make a decision as  to whether or not we will support them. We will act as a  wholesome opposition party close to the ruling parties. You can  say we are an opposition party because we will be assuming a  stand opposing the government in some cases and supporting it in  others, depending on the issue at hand. We will act in  conjunction with the ruling parties during the current Diet  session and become a wholesome opposition party after that."    On the possibility of summoning former Prime Minister  Hosokawa to the Diet to testify on the issue of his loan from  Sagawa Kyubin, Takemura says that it may be inevitable. At the  same time, Takemura also says that as a member of the former  Hosokawa administration, he hopes that Diet testimony will be  avoided.    Asked how Sakigake will respond if the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) brings up a no-confidence motion in the Diet,  Takemura answers: "We still have not thought that far ahead."  He says his party will not be interested in a no-confidence  motion until the budget and the bills are approved."    On the issue of general elections, Takemura says: "We should  complete the redrawing of electoral districts as soon as  possible. I think the Diet should be dissolved after we form a  new election system."    Turning to the issue of tax reform, Kuroiwa asks Takemura if  his party is against the idea of increasing indirect taxes. In  response, Takemura explains the need promote tax reform to cope  with an aging society.    Kuroiwa then asks whether Sakigake attaches importance to  relations with the United States. Takemura answers: "Of course  we attach importance to relations with the United States. We  cannot destroy the framework of our political and economic ties  and military alliance with the United States."    Asked whether Sakigake thinks Japan should cooperate with  the  United States in imposing sanctions against North Korea without  waiting for a UN decision, Takemura says that it is not a good  idea to talk about this issue on the basis of assumptions. He  continues to say: "Frankly speaking, I think that without China,  our diplomatic or military policies toward the DPRK will have no  effect."    Asked if Sakigake will form close ties with the LDP,  Takemura  says that his party will seek cooperation with the LDP in wide-  ranging areas. He also says: "Our understanding is that the  reorganization of the political world will be realized by  involving the DLP."</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: A fighter come late to greatness - Gillian Tindall considers a new biography of Clemenceau AT THE HEART OF A TIGER: CLEMENCEAU AND HIS WORLD 1841-1929 by Gregor Dallas Macmillan Pounds 25, 598 pages DEATH, says a French proverb, turns a life into a destiny, imposing definition on a stretch of time which might, at earlier stages, have looked amorphous. With some public figures, however, it is not death itself but a late break, a sudden call to arms or power in old age, that gives a long and varied life its permanent shape. So with Georges Clemenceau. Born in 1841 under France's last king, he was raised as a disciple of Pascal, Michelet and Comte; he became mayor of Montmartre during the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune. A 'man of Victor Hugo', he subsequently kept the flame of moderate Republicanism going through the vicissitudes of the Second Empire and the chequered Republic that followed it, battling with the likes of Boulanger on the one hand and Ferry and Jaures on the other and raising an early and decent voice in favour of Dreyfus. More than once during these decades his career seemed to himself and others all but over - 'I am unrecognised in my home, betrayed by my friends, dropped by my party, ignored by my electors, suspected by my country . . . creditors bang on my door . . . I have nothing, nothing.' He was almost 73 at the outbreak of the 1914-18 war, and 76 by the time supreme command passed to him. Poincare, a long-term jealous colleague and now demoted rival, added to his existing accusations of obstinacy, swashbuckle and 'incurable light-mindedness' the charge that Clemenceau was increasingly deaf, portly and incapable of reasoning. Yet it was in Clemenceau's grey-gloved hands (he had begun to suffer from nervous eczema) that near-defeat was turned into victory and the peace that many of the French would have sought earlier on almost any terms became an Armistice imposed by France and her allies. The old man had at last become the 'tiger' - as in the lean title of this overweight work. The sharpest image left to the world is of the hunched, moustachioed carnivore crouched between Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson in the treaty hall at Versailles, standing as ever for justice, unwittingly doing his bit to set the scene for another war in which he would act as a model for another fighter-come-late-to-greatness: Winston Churchill. Of course this odd-shaped life poses problems for the biographer. Gregor Dallas has had to accompany his subject a long way before finally reaching, if not the heart of the tiger, at any rate the heart of the story. At times he loses himself in whole thickets of carefully scrutinised trees while giving his reader little indication of the overall shape of the wood. When at long last he sweeps out onto the devastated uplands of the First World War battlefields, the panoramic view is impressive. But, just because he knows the way himself, he fails to erect adequate signposts along the route. Although the book's comprehensive and sometimes overtly instructive style suggests that it is intended for the general reader, Dallas again and again omits pieces of basic information that are in fact necessary to the proper understanding of all this detail. The events of 1870-71 are described with a wealth of descriptive energy as befits a key period in Clemenceau's life - but if you did not know already about the Prussian assault, why the Commune supervened and what it represented, you would be in a complete fog as to what was really going on. And although Dallas quotes Clemenceau's famous put-down after Boulanger shot himself in 1891 on the grave of his mistress ('Il est mort comme il a vecu, en sous-lieutenant') there is, almost unbelievably, no mention of Boulanger's revanchist doctrine on Alsace-Lorraine and thus no adequate discussion of the war scares of 1886 and '87. Similarly, when we reach the moment of Jaures' assassination in 1914 only days before the outbreak of war, no mention has at that point been made of Sarajevo or of 'the German menace' at all. More minor, but more irritating because more specific, is Dallas's failure to tell us, when dealing with Zola's J'Accuse article, that L'Aurore was Clemenceau's own paper. Indeed he has a circumlocutionary, novelist-like way of creeping up to his favourite moments and then pouncing on them, which does not make for coherence. I do not want to sound ungrateful. I have learnt a good deal from this book, whose cognitive scope extends from the dawn of the Revolution to the Fall of Petain and Laval, and will keep it by me. Like Braudel, who is clearly his master though oddly unacknowledged, Dallas is at his best when describing events in the context of their settings. His earlier work deals with the peasantry of the Loire (Clemenceau's native land); to accompany him there, or to the northern mines of Zola's Germinal, or to the forest that now covers the destroyed villages near Verdun, is a treat. Perhaps, for his next work, he will chose a topic more rooted in one place and era and so really expand his gifts.</p>

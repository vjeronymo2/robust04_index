			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Treuhand financing for Eko Stahl The Treuhand privatisation agency will for the next two months finance Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill, following the decision by Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel manufacturers, not to buy the mill. The steel complex is losing DM150m (Pounds 60m) a year on a turnover of DM1bn. At the same time, the Treuhand is still determined to find a buyer for the mill, despite comments made by Mr Karel van Miert, the European Union's competition commissioner, who said last week that the EU's rescue package for steel was dead. The original EU package, unveiled last December, envisaged cutting 25m-30m tonnes of crude steel capacity out of a total 170m tonnes. Part of the package included backing a DM813m investment and modernisation plan by the German government for Eko Stahl, which is located in Eisenhuttenstadt, close to the Polish border. That plan had been contingent on the Treuhand selling the mill to Riva, which in turn would have invested more than DM1bn in transforming Eko Stahl into an integrated steel mill producing 900,000 tonnes of steel a year. According to Eko Stahl officials, the collapse of the Riva deal, and confusion within the EU on how to introduce capacity cuts, reduces the chances of finding a buyer willing to invest in an integrated mill. An integrated steel mill could help reduce some of Eko Stahl's losses, particularly transport costs, according to the Halle Institute for Economic Research, one of the six think tanks advising the government. Eko Stahl currently ships its slabs for hot-rolling to plants in western Germany. They are then returned to east Germany and cold-rolled. The Halle Institute says each tonne of transported steel costs DM100. To cut these costs, the Treuhand had intended to integrate Eko Stahl's steel-making and its steel-processing operations by building a new hot-rolling mill. The agency has received no takers for this plan following the collapse of the Riva deal. Thyssen, Germany's biggest steel manufacturer, which earlier led a consortium to buy 50 per cent of Eko Stahl's cold-rolling mill, still sees prospects for a cold-rolling mill for Eko Stahl. But the Treuhand argues this would make Eko Stahl dependent on west German steel manufacturers, and would entail further job losses. The mill employed nearly 12,000 people in 1989, and produced more than 3.5m tonnes of steel. It has since reduced its work force to 3,000, and its annual capacity to under 1m tonnes.</p>

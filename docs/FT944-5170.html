			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Century Inns poised for debut Century Inns, which owns 300 pubs in north-east England, is planning to come to the market early in the new year. The group, which is expected to have a market capitalisation of Pounds 60m, is aiming to raise more than Pounds 30m of new money. This would enable it to repay much of its total loan capital and borrowings, also of just over Pounds 30m, reducing gearing from 150 per cent to between 30 and 40 per cent and allowing for further expansion. Mr Alistair Arkley, chief executive, was unfazed by Thursday's last-minute withdrawal of its flotation by Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer. 'Ours is an entirely different business,' he said. 'We are in an oversupplied market as a buyer, rather than a producer.' Century was born as a Pounds 32m management buy-in in November 1991. Mr Arkley, former managing director of Brent Walker Brewing and Trading, and two colleagues formed the company to buy 185 tenanted pubs from Bass. 'We quickly saw opportunities to expand,' said Mr Arkley. 'We probably did the fastest ever refinancing of an MBI - for very good reasons.' The management raised a further Pounds 20m and did three deals that added another 100 pubs to the chain by June 1992. Mr Arkley believes his management team is strong enough to support a chain of 500 pubs - 'beyond that you need another layer of management'. The team was built up as people became available after the shake-out caused by the anti-monopoly beer orders. ' We want to continue picking up pubs by tweaking debt and from the cash thrown off by the existing business,' he said. Most of the current pubs are tenanted houses. 'In order to improve profits we have to get the rents up and sell more beer,' he said. 'Basically we are wholesalers of beer and advisers to three-year tenants.' However, he aims to expand the managed house side of the business, which comprises just four pubs at present, and sees the future in family facilities and catering. Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of September rose from Pounds 4.66m to Pounds 5.69m on sales of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 19.8m). Interest payable fell from Pounds 3.42m to Pounds 2.83m, reflecting the repayment of Pounds 2.5m of debt. Mr Arkley believes the latest figures are indicative of the underlying growth in the business, which has the same number of pubs as it did the previous year. Operating profits were up 6 per cent at Pounds 8.39m in a market that fell 4 per cent. The management, which will be selling some shares, owns 19 per cent of the business - a stake which would fall to about 10 per cent on flotation. Schroder Ventures, with 67 per cent, and First Britannia, with 12 per cent, have not decided how much of their stakes to sell.</p>

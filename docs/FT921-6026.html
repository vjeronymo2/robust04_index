			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The money-makers - Cash unit trusts CASH unit trusts sound like a contradiction in terms. Unit trusts normally invest in equities, which carry the risk of a fall in the value of the investor's capital. But cash unit trusts invest in the money markets, where money is bought and sold for short periods by institutions. The value of the trust rises as the interest on the deposits accrues. The value of the units - and your holding - goes up in proportion. As they can offer investors a high yield, cash unit trusts are an alternative to bank and building society savings accounts. RATES 'The advantage of a cash unit trust for the private investor is to gain access to money market rates, which can be better than rates of interest found elsewhere,' says Simon Ballard, marketing director of Morgan Grenfell. Money market rates change daily but are usually around those of base rates, now 10.5 per cent. When it is expected interest rates may fall, money market rates are likely to be slightly below base rates - as is now the case. Cash unit trusts are relatively new. Two started in 1989 and another eight the following year. Most of the 34 operating today were launched in 1991 and the total invested in them is Pounds 230.6m, according to figures from Finstat. Fidelity Investments has cornered about a quarter of the market, with its trust standing at Pounds 58m. The fund invests only in bank deposits. A credit analysis department selects the least risky banks with no more than 20 per cent invested in a single institution. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 but those who keep Pounds 5,000 in the fund can have a cheque book (cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250). On Thursday, Fidelity was paying 10.28 per cent gross on Pounds 1,000 and Morgan Grenfell 10.7 per cent. Daily rates are published in the Financial Times under the Authorised Unit Trusts section. (The yield figures listed in the table below indicate the current annualised rate of return from February figures provided by Micropal). Most cash unit trusts carry an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent, which is deducted out of the trust's income. Rates quoted above are net of this deduction. There are still a few banks or building societies that offer better rates on an amount as low as Pounds 1,000: Bradford and Bingley's Direct Premium postal account, has been paying 10.95 per cent gross on a Pounds 1,000 minimum (but this will fall to 9.95 per cent on Monday). Wimbledon &amp; South West Finance is paying 10.6 per cent gross (11.03 per cent CAR) on Pounds 1,000 in its High Interest (instant access) cheque account and Nottingham BS is paying 10.65 per cent on its Post Direct instant access postal account (minimum deposit Pounds 2,500). Otherwise, the best available rates are 10 per cent gross on Caledonian Bank's High Interest current account and Co-Op's Pathfinder account (10.5 per cent CAR). Southdown building society's Supersaver account is paying 9.7 per cent gross. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester pays 10.4 per cent on its London Share postal account, although the minimum deposit is Pounds 2,500. Most other accounts are paying well below base rates. Lloyds, with 8.5 per cent gross on its instant savings account, offers the best rate of the Big Four on Pounds 1,000. (This is due to drop to 8 per cent on March 2). Some bank and building society savings accounts will pay rates competitive with, or better than, those on the money market; but these tend to be on amounts of at least Pounds 2,500 or on a minimum notice period of 28 days and more (usually, 90 days). And banks and building societies can offer accounts which are competitive one day and less so the next - without investors being told of the change. Withdrawing your money from a cash unit trust operates similarly to postal accounts. Fidelity, Morgan Grenfell and Scottish Amicable provide customers with withdrawal slips which you post, and cheques are sent three or four days later. Fidelity will, at no extra cost, arrange for a telegraphic transfer the day after it receives the withdrawal form. If the depositor has more than Pounds 5,000, he can use the cheque book to settle bills or to pay money into a current account. CHARGES There is no initial charge on most cash unit trusts, compared with the normal charge on a unit trust is 5-6 per cent. Only 10 managers still retain a front-end charge on their funds, including Scottish Amicable. Yet, despite this seeming to be a disadvantage, Scottish Amicable has the second-largest share of the market, with Pounds 33.6m in its Maximum Income cash unit trust (minimum investment Pounds 5,000 and Thursday's yield was 9.9 per cent). The initial charge is 2.5 per cent and there is an 0.5 per cent annual management charge on top. 'We launched at a time when no one thought of offering a unit trust without a charge,' says a Scottish Amicable spokesman. 'The whole bid/offer spread was a policy decision to create a unit trust rather than a fund. But I would not be surprised if the decision were to be reversed.' Scottish Amicable created the fund to take advantage of the move to independent taxation in 1990, when it became possible for a non-taxpaying spouse to receive income gross. However, the abolition of composite rate tax has changed the market since then. Banks and building societies now can pay income gross without the need to reclaim tax, giving them an advantage over cash unit trusts if their accountholders are non-taxpayers. Cash unit trusts cannot pay income gross, although the investor can reclaim the tax in the usual manner. Investors with cash unit trusts are protected by the investor's compensation scheme, which provides a maximum of Pounds 48,000.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT THEY PAY ON POUNDS 1,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Unit Trusts                        Gross Yield (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fidelity Cash                           10.3 Scot Amicable Max Income*               10.2 Holborn Cash Haven                      10.1 Capital House Cash Acc                  10.7 Mercury Cash Acc                        10.5 Gartmore Cash Acc                       10.7 Midland Money Mrkt Acc                   9.6 Stewart Ivory Majority*                 10.1 S&amp;W Cash                                10.4 Stewart Ivory Managed Cash              10.2 Morgan Grenfell Cash                    10.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks and Building Socs                 Gross Interest (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Brad &amp; Bingley Dir Premium+              9.95 Wimbledon &amp; South West                  10.60 Caledonian Bank High Int                10.00 Co-Op Bank Pathfinder                   10.00 Southdown BS Supersaver                  9.70 TSB Flex Savings                         8.60 Lloyds Instant Savings+                  8.00 Abbey National Instant Save              7.90  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Unit trust stats from Micropal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Front-end charge, +from March 2.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

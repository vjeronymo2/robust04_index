			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (14): Modernised and export-oriented - The wine industry In the main plaza of Curico, about 200km south of Santiago in Chile's Central Valley, the festival to mark the start of the grape harvest is in full swing. The local bishop has blessed the year's first pressings and a wine fountain is flowing. The town band is earnestly tackling a vigorous march and the queen of the harvest is about to receive her reward - her own weight in wine. Although the festival looks like time-honoured ritual it is in fact the celebration of a very recent phenomenon - the emergence of a modernised, export-oriented wine industry. A combination of foreign investment and a renewed dynamism on the part of Chilean estate owners has translated into soaring sales. Exports grew 55 per cent last year to about Dollars 180m, according to the Chilean wine industry association. This was the fourth year in succession in which exports grew more than 50 per cent in dollar terms. Export volume last year climbed 25 per cent to 80m litres and the association forecasts overseas sales of 120m litres by 1995 and 180m litres by 2000. Mr Miguel Torres, the Spanish winemaker, is the man widely credited with sparking this revolution. Mr Torres first invested in Chile 14 years ago, after a lengthy search for new opportunities in both California and Latin America. 'I really think the Central Valley is paradise for anyone interested in vines,' he says at his bodega outside Curico. 'The climate, the quality of the soils and absence of phylloxera (the vine pest) make this place just about perfect.' Mr Torres introduced state-of-the-art wine-making technology, including the latest presses, new French oak barrels to lend more character to red wines, and cold fermentation tanks for the whites. In doing so he broke decisively with the Chilean philosophy of 'quantity not quality.' Other foreign investors have proved eager to follow his lead. Chateau Lafite bought a 50 per cent stake in the historic vineyard of Los Vascos at the end 1988, with the aim, according to Lafite oenologist Mr Gilbert Rokvam, of creating 'a French chateau in Chile in the tradition of the great Bordeaux wines.' Another small family-owned business, Errazuriz Panquehue, formed a joint venture with California's Franciscan Estates the same year. Errazuriz has a dual strategy, according to Mr Eduardo Chadwick, whose family have owned the business since 1870. On the one hand it is seeking to produce high-quality Reserva wines at the family's three properties. But it is also buying in grapes under long-term contract from farmers to produce Caliterra, a more middle-market brand. 'Our biggest job was getting farmers to prune back more to decrease yields and raise quality,' says Mr Chadwick. Caliterra, launched three years ago, has become the biggest Chilean brand in the UK market, Mr Chadwick says. The link-up with Franciscan proved short-lived - the joint venture was dissolved amicably in 1991. Franciscan moved on to a Dollars 6m investment in the Casablanca Valley between Santiago and Valparaiso. The company remains the agent for Errazuriz in the US. The main market for Chile's wines continues to be the US, which accounted for about a quarter of sales by value last year. Chilean wines make up 7 per cent of US wine imports and it has overtaken Germany as the third-largest wine exporter to the US after France and Italy. Small vineyards such as Los Vascos, Torres and Errazuriz are at the cutting edge of Chile's wine industry. But it is dominated by Vina Concha y Torro, which accounts for about a quarter of wine exports, twice as much as its nearest rival, Vina Santa Emiliana. The average price per litre these winemakers command is low compared with smaller operators, but they also produce top wines.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Court in US dismisses O&amp;Y case A COURT in New York has dismissed Olympia &amp; York's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, allowing its Canadian restructuring to be consummated by the March 15 deadline, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. O&amp;Y will now emerge from Canadian bankruptcy court protection. O&amp;Y had filed for US Chapter 11 protection in respect of certain US properties. It later asked the court for a dismissal to satisfy creditors. In Canada a court-appointed administrator will now take charge of the property company and an unsecured creditors' monitoring committee will assume its duties. O&amp;Y's Canadian creditors had refused to consummate the Canadian restructuring while the US Chapter 11 case was outstanding. In Canada creditors are already seizing O&amp;Y buildings to satisfy debt and the Reichmanns have already ceded operating control.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (12): Holidays reduce the flow of new money - Charges GIVEN THE current level of fierce competition in the fund management industry, pension funds ought to be in a better position than ever to get the service they want at attractive prices. Competition for pension fund management mandates has been heightened by, among other things, the recent surge of non-UK houses into the market. Major US firms, offering their expertise in index-matching and 'active quantitative' approaches to investment, have aggressively sought to mark out their stake in the pensions market. But also, competition has been heightened by a shrinking pie. The past three years' recession has caused so many companies to seek 'contributions holidays' from their pension funds that, in fact, pension funds under management in 1991 actually experienced a net outflow of roughly Pounds 2.5bn, according to figures compiled by Caps, the pension fund performance measurement service. Only 30 per cent of funds surveyed by Caps in 1991 had any new money to invest over the year. Since fund managers' fees are expressed as a percentage of funds under management, the shrinkage in pension pools hits them in the pocket. Mr Rob Collinge, director of compensation and benefits at SmithKline Beecham, said he had recently renegotiated management contracts with a number of his outside fund managers which, to his surprise, had resulted in lower charges for some. 'I was surprised at how successful we were,' he said, explaining that several of the managers involved had strong performance records and no shortage of clients. The problem with competition, he said, was that those fund managers with mediocre performance records were the ones most willing to cut fees. 'But for us, a few basis points of improved performance can far outweigh the advantages of slightly lower fees,' he added. The shrinkage has caused a pinch for investment managers who have now had to work harder to secure mandates away from their competitors. However, it has also provided the incentive for managers to find ways to cull fees from clients in ways which are not immediately obvious. Indeed, at least one US bank was said to have been offering its index-matching fund management services for no fee at all - provided the clients used the bank's global custody service. The use of hidden - or so-called 'dirty' charges  - is an issue that has troubled pension fund trustees for a long time. But in recent years, publicity surrounding charges and the ensuing calls for regulators to do something about them has made trustees look even harder at them. Indeed, the National Association of Pension Funds has formed a committee on fee transparency, to examine dirty charges and make recommendations to members about how to deal with them. Pure charges on pension fund pools range from 0.2 to 0.5 per cent for balanced pools, depending on the size of funds under management. However, segregated pools or specialist and overseas accounts incur transaction charges of up to 1 per cent and additional charges above that, depending on circumstances. By international standards, particularly those of the US, UK pension fund management charges come cheap. In the US, fees can easily average 1.5 to 2 per cent, partly reflecting the wider use of specialist and boutique-type fund managers. But it is the hidden charges that are the bone of contention in the UK. The most significant of these are 'soft commissions' - the provision of services in kind to fund managers who transact a pre-agreed level of commission-generating business through a broker. Last month, the Securities and Investments Board, after vacillating for months over the matter, declined to outlaw soft commissions, on the grounds that fund managers can use them legitimately to obtain services which ultimately enhance returns to clients. However, it has required fund managers who accept soft commissions to begin disclosing the extent of these to clients. Among services typically received by fund managers in exchange for soft commissions are research, data retrieval systems and software packages. Because all commissions costs are deducted from the clients' total funds under management, effectively, it is one way of shifting overheads to clients from fund managers. Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, partner at pensions consultants and actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said that there was no good reason for pension fund managers to pay soft commissions. 'Commissions are a voluntary cost, because many fund managers are able to negotiate transactions with no commission whatsoever,' he said. 'The only reason I can see for paying soft commission is to hide the charges from the customer.' In the US, where disclosure rules have been in place for some time, pension funds are increasingly demanding that soft commission payments be rebated to them by the managers which accept them. Also, fund managers are able to add on dirty charges by placing client funds in internal unit trusts, which carry charges of 0.5 to 0.75 per cent. While these are typically used for overseas assets, managers are often inclined to place clients with pools below Pounds 10m in domestic unit trusts as well. Mr Fitzpatrick says that he urges clients to seek 'clean' charging structures wherever possible. While these rarely mean lower costs for pension funds, they do clarify exactly what the service costs. In a clean structure, a client may not be charged for anything but the service fee. Mr Collinge said that almost all his fund management agreements were now 'clean'. 'Its a cost control mechanism - we know what we are paying,' he said.</p>

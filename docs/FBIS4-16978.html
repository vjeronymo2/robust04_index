			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- "The political situation in Russia  has begun to stabilize," Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated,  opening a meeting with heads of administrations of Russia's  krays and oblasts today.    Boris Yeltsin said that there has been real collaboration  with the Federation Council and the State Duma. "I have  frequent meetings with Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin, we  discuss issues of concern to Russia, and we reach agreement in a  calm atmosphere. This style of work has a positive effect on the  general political improvement in the country," the president  said.    Boris Yeltsin confirmed that the signing of the Agreement on  Civic Peace and Accord will take place on 28 April in St.  George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. About 140  organizations are expected to take part in the ceremony. The  president called for the agreement to be signed by all branches  of power, political parties, and public organizations. He  believes that representatives of the power structures of the  krays, oblasts, and Russian Federation republics should also  sign the document.    Of those political forces who have so far opposed signing  the  agreement, Boris Yeltsin said: "We will not insist on them  signing this document." Russians, he added "will see for  themselves what the words of such leaders and their programs  mean in practice." The head of state noted that, so far, only  the Communists have stated their opposition to signing the  agreement, but "perhaps, this only applies to a section of their  leadership," the president remarked.    "We want this document to be a major political step, like in  Spain, where a similar memorandum was also signed," he said. A  special coordinating commission should monitor implementation of  the agreement, the president believes.    I think, said Boris Yeltsin, that the accords on military  issues initialled in March 1994 create a legal and diplomatic  framework for completing the withdrawal of Russian troops from  the territory of Latvia, and for resolving questions relating to  this matter in a civilized manner. "They became possible as a  result of sensible compromises and responsible attitudes, and  they correspond to the real long-term interests not only of the  peoples of our countries but of the entire region, of Europe as  a whole." I hope "to have a meeting with Guntis Ulmanis in the  near future where a package of the initialled agreements will be  signed, which will become a turning-point in the relations  between our two countries," Russian president said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatol Hatowchyts: "One Should Not Deceive </F> People..."]    [Text] No politician has recently attracted more attention  of Homel Oblast residents than Stanislav Shushkevich, the former  Supreme Soviet chairman. Invited by the City Council of the  "Vyasna `94" Association [Spring], the former legislative  speaker visited Homel and had three meetings here -- with  activists of democratic parties and movements, with "Homselmash"  plant workers, and with broad circles of the public.    The meetings evoked so much interest that the audience  spilled from the room over to the hallways. By the way, Mr.  Shushkevich did not come all by himself. He was accompanied by  the deputy from Homel Aleskandr Sasnow, head of the legislative  standing commission, and Aleksandr Dabravolski, leader of the  United Democratic Party of Belarus.    It stands to reason that the current political and economic  situation of Belarus was the focus of their attention. It is  worsening, and people should not be deceived about this.  Meanwhile, the old Constitution, after its Article 6 about the  leading role of the Communist Party has been removed, specifies  no one to control operations of the government. It has been  three years since the Kebich government went from one extreme to  another -- to no effect, though. It even does not allow "its  own" newspapers to criticize it. This is easy to explain -- it  is not capable of governing, it can only execute someone else's  instructions.    To corroborate his point, Stanislav Shushkevich brought up  three facts. Although Belarus declared its sovereignty, it now  faces the question of abandoning it. Although a market  transition program was adopted some time ago, it is practically  dead now. Was the government brought to account for those  failures? Of course, not. By giving good positions to many  deputies, titles, and convenient land plots for houses, the  Kebich government formed a virtually unsinkable pro-government  lobby in the Supreme Soviet from the old nomenklatura. This  lobby drags its feet on adopting a new constitution and many  other things.    In this situation, S. Shushkevich thinks that the democratic  parties and movements should rally around the idea of building  Belarusian sovereignty, democracy, market economy, and force the  Supreme Soviet to keep to its declaration on calling early  elections this spring. This will enable a whole range of urgent  problems, including that of the government, to be resolved as  soon as possible. In the opinion of Stanislav Shushkevich,  people can determine on their own who to vote for and whom to  entrust with their lives over the next five years.    It was the demand for immediate legislative elections that  moved Mr. Shushkevich closer to the "Vyasna `94" bloc, even  though the former speaker has no intention so far of joining any  particular party. Also, his answers show that he does not  intend to establish his own party, either. So, this man will  probably play a coordinating role in the democratic camp, which  no one has played well so far. This is why Stanislav  Shushkevich once said that he mastered another profession over  the past three years -- that of a politician. He proved that in  Homel -- and not only through a deep and comprehensive  understanding of the situation and witty answers that now and  then made the audience burst into applause. The most important  thing is that he does not look defeated. During one meeting, he  artistically brought to nothing attempts by several dozens of  political hacks to obstruct the dialog.    I believe that many from the audience felt and realized that  it is too early for Shushkevich to leave big politics. And as  many, it turned out, are ready to give their votes to that  politician with high integrity. Ridiculous accusations of  misconduct just would not stick to him.    P.S. As we have just learned, Stanislav Shushkevich was  invited to visit Baranovichi, Borisov, Orsha, and other cities  of the Republic.</p>

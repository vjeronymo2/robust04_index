"This year is Visit Korea Year and we are thinking of  providing package tours enabling overseas Korean residents and  foreigners to visit South and North Korea at one time," a source  said. "North Korea has showed positive attitudes to attract  foreigners since the 1980s to earn foreign currency, so the plan  is very likely to be realized."    The Korea National Tourism Corp. and travel agents will be  allowed to contact North Korean officials to discuss developing  travel packages or joint advertising to attract foreigners as  soon as a breakthrough is made in talks over the North Korean  nuclear problem, the source said.    Such details as crossing points for tourists on the border  and procedures for cross-border travel could be discussed by  government officials if Seoul and Pyongyang resume dialogue, he  said.    "Considering the particular situation facing the North, the  package tours will be limited to foreigners and overseas  Koreans, " he said.    The board wants to make Mt. Sorak, Mt. Kumkang and Panmunjom  free tourist zones to attract foreigners, he said.    It will probably brief South Korean President Kim Yong-sam  on  its plan on Thursday, the source said.</p>

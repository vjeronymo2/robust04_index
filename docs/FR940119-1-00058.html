			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All salmon, regardless of whether possessed at sea or at land-based processors, would be required to be returned to Federal waters immediately with a minimum of injury regardless of condition, following notice by a NMFS-certified observer that salmon have been counted and the collection of any scientific data or biological samples has been completed. The discard of any salmon prior to notification by a NMFS-certified observer that salmon have been counted would constitute a violation of regulations authorized under the Magnuson Act. Such violations would be subject to enforcement action under the Magnuson Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Release of Observer Data on Vessel Bycatch Amounts of Salmon and Bycatch Rates of Other Prohibited Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Observer data may be protected from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because it is considered commercial or financial information (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). Release of such information may be facilitated by regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested NMFS to prepare a proposed rule that would authorize the release of certain weekly observer data: The name and Federal permit number of each vessel participating in a directed fishery for Alaska groundfish; the number of chinook salmon and other salmon species taken by each vessel; and the observed bycatch rates of Pacific halibut, Pacific herring, king crab, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. bairdi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tanner crab of vessels participating in the BSAI or GOA groundfish fisheries. Members of the groundfish industry have requested that vessel bycatch amounts or rates be made available in as timely a manner as possible to support independent industry initiatives to address the bycatch problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further support industry initiatives to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates in the groundfish trawl fisheries, members of the groundfish industry have submitted a separate request to NMFS for the release of additional observer data on prohibited species bycatch in most BSAI and GOA groundfish trawl fisheries. NMFS believes that disclosure of these observer data collected since 1992 could facilitate research by industry on salmon and other prohibited species bycatch that hopefully would lead to more informed decisions by vessel operators on alternative fishing practices to minimize bycatch rates of these species. These data would not be identified by vessel and would include the following data for observed hauls in the trawl fisheries:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Date;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Time of day gear is deployed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Latitude and longitude at beginning of haul;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bottom Depth;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fishing depth of trawl;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate chinook salmon (number of salmon/mt groundfish);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate other salmon (number of salmon/mt groundfish);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate Pacific halibut (kilograms halibut/mt groundfish;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate Pacific herring (kilograms herring/mt groundfish);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate king crab (number of crab/mt groundfish);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rate bairdi Tanner crab (number of crab/mt groundfish);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sea surface temperature (where available); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sea temperature at fishing depth of trawl (where available).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Representatives of the Alaska trawl industry have requested that the above observer data on specific hauls not be released for vessels participating in the rockfish, Greenland turbot, or Atka mackerel trawl fisheries because substantial competitive harm could result. These fisheries are conducted by a small number of vessels, involve relatively small amounts of quota, and are geographically specific in nature. Releasing observer data on individual hauls could effectively disclose commercial information of the current participants and cause them to suffer substantial competitive harm. The rockfish, Greenland turbot, and Atka mackerel fisheries generally have low salmon bycatch rates and contribute relatively little to the overall salmon bycatch amounts annually experienced in the Alaska trawl fisheries. Consequently, excluding from disclosure the observer data collected onboard vessels participating in the rockfish, Greenland turbot, or Atka mackerel fisheries is not anticipated to impair the effectiveness of industry initiatives to address the salmon bycatch problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trawl industry representatives have not presented to NMFS concerns about the release of observer data that includes vessel name and prohibited species bycatch amounts or rates or haul-specific observer data for groundfish fisheries other than the rockfish, Greenland turbot, or Atka mackerel fisheries. Other participants in the groundfish fisheries may perceive that the release of these observer data may cause substantial competitive harm to vessel operators, owners, or other persons involved in the groundfish fishing industry because the disclosure of haul location and depth data for these fisheries involves the release of traditionally closely held commercial information. Therefore, the disclosure of observer data on prohibited species bycatch and associated haul location and depth information could possibly be expected to divulge information on specific fishing operations in a manner that would result in substantial competitive harm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to a request for information under the FOIA, NMFS has determined that the disclosure of observer data for vessel haul location and depth in the BSAI pollock and cod fisheries collected during 1993 is not reasonably expected to result in competitive harm. This disclosure is based on the determination that trawl operations for pollock and cod in the BSAI occur within fairly well demarcated areas that have consistently supported historic foreign, joint venture, and domestic fisheries for these species. Given the established nature of these fisheries and the relative concentration of fishing effort to known fishing grounds, NMFS does not expect that the release of haul position and depth would result in the identification of unique fishing operations for pollock and cod that are not already known by the participants in these fisheries. However, NMFS still is concerned about whether the conditions allowing for the disclosure of observer data collected in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod fisheries will continue in the future. Accordingly, NMFS has not exempted the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod fisheries from this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 11 KYODO -- Japan's Ambassador to  the United States Takakazu Kuriyama assured Washington Monday  that the new government in Tokyo will press on with political  and economic reform initiated by outgoing Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa. Japanese diplomatic sources said Kuriyama  gave his assurance in a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor.    Kuriyama originally asked for the meeting to set the  groundwork for crucial trade talks that had been scheduled for  Friday in Morocco between Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata.    The surprise announcement last Friday that Hosokawa was  stepping down from office is likely to scuttle Hata's planned  trip to Morocco, however, as well as prospects for a quick  resumption of stalled trade talks between Tokyo and Washington.    Japanese diplomatic sources said Kantor and Kuriyama agreed  that the two countries should act prudently on the "framework"  trade talks. "Both sides realized that the framework should not  be allowed to fail once again," a Japanese source said.    Tokyo has urged Washington to resume the talks, which broke  down at a summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and  Hosokawa on Feb. 11.    The Clinton administration made it clear after Hosokawa's  resignation announcement last Friday that Washington wants to  settle trade disputes with Japan under the terms of the basic  framework trade accord reached with Tokyo last summer.</p>

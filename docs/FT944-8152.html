			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Opinion poll adds to pressure for resolution of Irish crisis Ireland's outgoing ruling coalition partners were under growing pressure last night to find a speedy resolution to the current political crisis. The coalition's difficulties were exacerbated by an opinion poll indicating widespread opposition to a general election and 43 per cent of those polled backing a new coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour. The Dail, Ireland's parliament, is due to meet tomorrow to try to agree a new government and vote in a new prime minister, though no conclusive result is expected. Political parties will probably ask for more time. Mr Joe Costello, a Labour MP, indicated that 'substantial' negotiations would only start after tomorrow's vote. Amid fears that a protracted delay in forging a new government could damage the Northern Ireland peace process, Mr Bertie Ahern, the newly installed Fianna Fail leader, said he would 'take account' of the poll, which indicated 73 per cent against calling early general elections. Ireland's outgoing government broke up last week with the resignation of the prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, before a vote of confidence which he was expected to lose. The crisis began when Labour accused Mr Reynolds of misleading parliament over the attorney-general's role in an extradition case involving a Roman Catholic priest who was later convicted in Northern Ireland of child abuse. Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general involved, also resigned from his new position of president of the Irish High Court. Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme, Mr Ahern referred to the 'fairly substantial nature' of yesterday's opinion poll and made it clear he favoured a new arrangement with Labour. However, in his first public statements since being voted in as party leader on Saturday, Mr Ahern also tried to reassure his traditional Fianna Fail support and backed the objective of a united Ireland with a promise of a social programme 'that takes account of our distinctive values and convictions'. Much will depend on Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader and outgoing foreign minister, whose withdrawal from the government on Wednesday ensured its downfall. A Fianna Fail-Labour coalition would do much to restore momentum in the peace process and provide continuity as Dublin and London try to finalise the framework document to provide the basis for a lasting constitution for Ulster.

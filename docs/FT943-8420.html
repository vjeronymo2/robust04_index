			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Pulling together the Asia-Pacific region - Co-ordination is key for Rolls-Royce's new regional director One of the most important recent developments in the way UK engineering companies approach the Asian market has been the appointment of top executives with group responsibility for the region or a large part of it. A classic example - mirrored in the two companies already covered in this series - was Rolls-Royce's appointment of Mr Timothy Jones as regional director, south-east Asia, about 18 months ago. Mr Jones spent a year in London 'selling' his job internally to Rolls-Royce's aero-engine and industrial businesses, before moving to Singapore in February. 'I'm here to take a corporate standpoint on regional activity,' he says. 'It was a conscious decision to co-ordinate things better, and to get leverage between the different parts of the business.' Mr Jones' region covers 10 countries from Burma to the Philippines and Brunei. Rolls-Royce already has regional executives, with offices in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Singapore, reinforced by sales directors for the specific sales businesses, and project development teams which come out from London. In an era when companies are more likely to remove levels of management, it is a measure of the importance Rolls-Royce attaches to the region that Mr Jones has been 'superimposed' on this structure to pull things together. The Asia-Pacific region already accounts for 25 per cent of Rolls-Royce's Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) order book. Mr Jones says he would not be surprised if that percentage rises, just as he hopes the total will increase in real terms too. 'I would be bitterly disappointed if the region's share falls,' he says. The aerospace side accounts for 55 to 60 per cent of business in the region, but the aim is to achieve an even balance between aerospace and the industrial businesses. Mr Jones points to a number of steps already taken beyond the region, which should help the company's prospects in the power generation market there. Restructuring at Parsons, Rolls-Royce's flagship power equipment company, has turned it into a turnkey supplier, he says, while Rolls-Royce's wide-ranging co-operation agreement with Westinghouse Electric of the US has given it a broader appeal than it could have achieved on its own, as it did not have the product range. With Rolls-Royce's aero-derived engines and access to the heavy-duty Westinghouse gas turbine range, Rolls-Royce and Parsons can look beyond the medium-sized power stations that have been its traditional strength. In July, Parsons won its first turnkey power station order in Indonesia  - a Dollars 90m order for a 60MW station in East Kalimantan. The deal covered all the electromechanical equipment, including two RB211 gas turbine-generating sets, and the civil works. At the larger end of the business, building a 1,000MW station was a possibility, but was a huge effort before the link-up with Westinghouse, says Mr Jones. Even so, Rolls-Royce's approach to the region will remain discriminating: 'It would be wrong to target a whole spectrum of activities and go into all sorts of build-own-operate and other projects because we don't have the size,' he says. As a consequence of his position, Mr Jones says he cannot view one part of Rolls-Royce's business in isolation, and especially wants to transfer to the industrial power business the experience gained from the risk- and revenue-sharing agreements made in the aero-engine business over the past 10 years. 'It makes perfect sense for me to come to this region from London, look at what are the best ways of forging ahead and achieving better business in the future, and what is the logical way to co-operate with local industry,' he says. One such venture, announced in February, has not exactly proceeded to plan. Rolls-Royce has formed a joint venture with EPE Power to meet the growing demand for power transmission equipment in Malaysia; a few days later, the Malaysian government announced its ban on UK companies winning public contracts. Mr Jones says: 'It's difficult to make progress on a venture designed to tackle government projects when there's a ban on doing business with government agencies. But as soon as the ban comes off, hopefully we can get on with the job we set out to do.' He stresses, though, that the ban is not a total trade embargo. There has been no noticeable effect on private-sector business, and Rolls-Royce is still discussing potential projects with independent power producers. 'We are still talking at all levels,' he says. 'We're just not able to do things while there's a ban in place.' Malaysia is also Rolls-Royce's best chance in an area where Mr Jones believes it is well-placed for new orders - refurbishing power stations. A Pounds 70m project to convert the Connaught Bridge power station near Kuala Lumpur to more efficient combined-cycle operation was completed last September. Elsewhere in the region he sees plenty of potential, though some of it, such as in Laos and Cambodia, offers less immediate prospects. In Burma, Mr Jones hopes to build on the links generated from being a long-term supplier of aero-engines to break into the power business, possibly in some form of partnership. In Thailand, Rolls-Royce is exploring a number of projects in various businesses, while in Indonesia, another country where it has been successful selling aero-engines, Mr Jones sees opportunities 'right across the spectrum'. The latest power station deal, he hopes, will lead to more in Indonesia. There are opportunities for the Cooper-Rolls joint venture, which produces power units for the oil and gas industry, while Rolls-Royce's cranes and materials handling equipment businesses stand to benefit from port development work.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet has authorized an additional 4,000  Palestinians from the territories to work inside Israel in  tourism, industry, and agriculture. The cabinet ministers were  told that the right-wing Knesset members [MK's] would be  evacuated from the ancient synagogue in Jericho.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin noted that a precedent for such  action had already been set.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the  cabinet will convene on Wednesday [11 May] to ratify the  agreement with the PLO. The agreement will also be brought  before the Knesset for approval.    The cabinet also discussed the decision to promote Efi Fein  to the rank of brigadier general after Minister Yosi Sarid  raised the matter.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lex Service collapses to Pounds 0.5m LEX SERVICE, the motor group, yesterday announced the virtual disappearance of pre-tax profits in 1991 and the early ending of its exclusive import agreement with Volvo. Volvo Concessionaires has been the mainstay of Lex's profits for years, making about Pounds 50m in 1988 and Pounds 13m last year. The share price shed 30p to close at 205p, about 40 per cent of its pre-1987 crash high. Pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 500,000, after interest costs of Pounds 16.5m, on turnover of Pounds 1.32bn (Pounds 1.79bn). Losses per share were 3.2p (earnings 4.9p) and the final dividend is cut to 6p for a total of 10p (15.3p). The ending of the Volvo agreement will bring in more than Pounds 100m for Lex. This comprises Pounds 20m cash on completion, Pounds 20m cash for properties, and three non-interest-bearing loan notes totalling Pounds 80m. It is anticipated that Lex will realise about Pounds 67m from their sale. Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said the group would have cash of about Pounds 70m by the end of this year, compared with Pounds 57m net debt in December for gearing of 34 per cent. Combined with a 34 per cent stake worth more than Pounds 60m in Arrow Electronics, a US-based international distributor, this gave scope for expanding the motor dealership network, the vehicle leasing business and possibly taking on another import concession. Last year, motor distribution contributed Pounds 14.9m trading profit on sales of Pounds 1.12bn. Volvo Concessionaires' shares were Pounds 13m and Pounds 564m. Associates, mainly joint ventures in vehicle leasing, which in 1990 accounted for Pounds 540m of off balance sheet liabilities, contributed Pounds 800,000. The group has now virtually got out of electronic components distribution (other than the Arrow stake). Arrow bought the North American operation last year and the European one last month. This was Lex's diversification of the 1980s after earlier forays into such things as hotels and employment agencies. However, even in the record year of 1988, vehicles accounted for all but Pounds 3.6m of Pounds 70.4m pre-tax profit. Yesterday Sir Trevor said of the latest expansion plans: 'We do not intend to enter any new business areas outside the automotive industry.' This year he expected demand for new cars to start to grow again, helped by the cut in special car tax in the Budget. The group would also enjoy the benefits of cost cuts. Contract hire had turned round. Pre-tax profit from the joint ventures with Lombard North Central was expected to be Pounds 4m for the six months to March 31, compared with a Pounds 5.2m loss in 1990/91. Taken with the elimination of gearing, the improvement in the business this year was expected to 'amply justify a maintained level of dividend'. See Lex</p>

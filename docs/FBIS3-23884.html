As a people's deputy of the Russian Federation, he  represented Novosibirsk Oblast in the deputy contingent which...  We will not go on; one election has already passed since that  time and the second one is at hand, as they say. Several  journalists from Novosibirsk newspapers immediately announced  their intention to run for the oblast soviet, and among them was  Boris Konovalov. He tells the VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK columnist  the reasons for this decision.    [Kuzmenkin] Many people have called Boris Konovalov a  potential candidate for deputy to the State Duma, and,  incidentally, considered his chances quite good.    [Konovalov] Yes, I did intend to. I had a sense of work left  undone. Right now the economic projects I was working on are  beginning to be realized. For example, a large Russian-German  agricultural community is being built near Novosibirsk. Money  was gotten out of Goskomnats [State Committee for Nationalities  Policy] and in Germany for this idea. Russian refugees from  Central Asia will be able to settle here, by the way.    [Kuzmenkin] Is all this just plans or is it already actual  work?    [Konovalov] The work is already underway and the community  of  Goluboy Zaliv not far from Akademgorodok will be turned over by  the builders this summer. What will it do for us? Jobs under  conditions of rising unemployment plus the potential to supply  Novosibirsk with wood products. In 1-2 years there will be a  return from the project to which I devoted considerable time and  effort.    [Kuzmenkin] It is probably useful to recall what Deputy  Konovalov did in parliament.    [Konovalov] I worked on the mass information media  committee,  where I was involved in issues of the SMI [mass information  media] economy. We tried to follow our own line, but we were  pressured both from the radical democrats and from the  communists and patriots who believed that the system for aiding  SMI should be political in nature. Unfortunately, many projects  which we prepared, the creation of tax benefits for SMI, for  example, encountered a great deal of opposition--both in  parliament and in the government. I do not think I have to  explain why. However, to the extent we could, we tried to  protect the independence of the press. In addition we worked on  those legislative bills which went through the Supreme Soviet,  plus routine work in the district. I held about 50 receptions  and there were 50-60 people at each one.    Inasmuch as a deputy cannot distribute cars or apartments, I  took it as my job to restore justice, that is to say, I handled  particular situations. Incidentally, in the elections to the  Duma I selected "my own" district.    [Kuzmenkin] But the well-known events which resulted in the  division of MOLODEZHKI into two publications occurred.    [Konovalov] There are various processes underway in any  collective. New leaders rise and want to make themselves known  and believe that they can be on top. Those people who arrived  without me have now left and are quietly producing a new  newspaper. The same people who know me or who worked with me  continue to produce the newspaper MOLODOST SIBIRI.    [Kuzmenkin] Does that mean the crisis has passed?    [Konovalov] Undoubtedly. Our newspaper is already 70 years  old, and it has seen everything in its life. I can say that  because I have been working here for 13 years myself. The  newspaper will live--there is no doubt of that.    [Kuzmenkin] How was the return trip, from parliament to  journalism?    [Konovalov] I believe that journalism is a very complex  thing. Although I have lived through two putsches, and the  second one in direct proximity to the battle sites (a shell fell  in the office next to mine in the White House--luckily I was not  in my office), I still believe that the profession of journalist  on energy costs is a lofty one and requires stricter  organization of labor.    [Kuzmenkin] Let us return to where we started: Today the  name  Konovalov is again listed among the other names which are  candidates for deputies to the oblast soviet. The question is  therefore a simple one. Why is all this necessary?    [Konovalov] I again chose part of my former district, since  I  believe that it shows a lack of seriousness and respectability  to run around to different districts in search of particular  options. If you work with people, you are responsible to them. I  must try to resolve the problems of those people whom I worked  with as a people's deputy of the Russian Federation.  Unfortunately, there are no fewer problems today.    [Kuzmenkin] So the oblast soviet will be able to deal with  these problems. Did I understand correctly?    [Konovalov] It seems to me that the political struggle will  be reduced to a minimum in the new deputy contingent; and it  will regulate the socioeconomic interests of various strata of  society. Of course there will also be groups of lobbyists who  will begin to stand up for their professional and territorial  interests. Therefore, in order to deal with the situation and  make a competent decision, the oblast soviet needs independent  deputies who have experience, both life experience and political  experience. As for me personally, the work in the Supreme Soviet  provided invaluable experience. Of course, I could have remained  in Moscow and taken a high official post--I had such offers, but  I believe that one has to live and work at home.    I also have economic experience, so to speak. I was closely  involved in the economic [nongovernmental] press on the republic  scale and therefore studied banking too. And I have the  experience of participating in resolving social problems: By  virtue of my deputy activity, I worked on it on business trips  to different oblasts of Russia and also visited a hotspot,  Northern Ossetia.    [Kuzmenkin] So in general, the editor in chief of MOLODOST  SIBIRI is of the opinion that something can be done, right?    [Konovalov] I believe that one of the basic jobs of the  oblast soviet will be monitoring the administration's actions.  Administrators are now running for election to the oblast  soviet--they have been assigned an appropriate task. A not quite  correct situation comes about, in my opinion, as in the saying  about the mice the cat was guarding. Subordinates will analyze  the work of their boss--it is amusing at least. Of course they  will say, "We know how things stand," but that is what they are  administrators for, through their activity to ensure normal life  in the rayons. Deputies should not view all issues from the  standpoint of the population of their districts. And it seems to  me that the most important thing is organizing normal  self-government. For something significant can be done only by  relying on people's opinion.    Yes, people now have retired into their shells. They are  told  that the time has come for competition and they must elbow their  way through; but one cannot do that in life--mutual assistance  is simply essential. So people must be helped to become aware of  their interests and learn how to stand up for them.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH'S BROCCOLI HATRED FLOWERS INTO PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION  </P> <P> George Bush, still harboring a childhood grudge against broccoli, escalated the  rhetoric today in his one-man war against the vegetable.  </P> <P> "I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my  mother made me eat it and I'm President of the United States and I'm not going  to eat any more broccoli," Bush proclaimed to cheers and laughter at the close  of an outdoor news conference.  </P> <P> Bush's forthright stand has brought howls from broccoli growers, who are  shipping 10 tons of the green, flowery vegetable from California to the  nation's capital to feed the hungry.  </P> <P> "Now, look. This is the last statement I'm going to have on broccoli," Bush  said. "There are truckloads of broccoli at this very minute descending on  Washington. My family is divided."  </P> <P> But the President admitted that at least one member of the Bush family likes  broccoli.  </P> <P> "For the broccoli vote out there: Barbara loves broccoli. She has tried to make  me eat it. She eats it all the time herself," Bush said. "So she can go out and  meet the caravan of broccoli that's coming in."  </P></p>

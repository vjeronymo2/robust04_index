			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: City welcomes a breath of clean air - Why Domnick Hunter's shares have risen since its March flotation This year's wave of new issues has proved to be a mixed bag. However, few companies have made as good an impression on the City as Domnick Hunter Group, a small manufacturer of filters for compressed air and liquids. The Tyneside-based company came to the market in March through a placing which gave it a market value of Pounds 65m. The flotation attracted a lot of interest, in spite of the shares being aggressively priced at 200p, or 21.5 times historic earnings. They have since risen to 262p, bolstered by last month's announcement of a 29 per cent increase in interim profits and an upbeat trading statement. So just what is the attraction of this group, described by analysts as 'a little gem' and 'one of the best small companies I have ever seen'? Investors have been impressed by the group's strong market position: it exports more than 60 per cent of its output to 40 countries and managed to expand its sales and profits throughout the recession. About 75 per cent of the group's sales come from its industrial division, which makes filters that remove dirt, oil and moisture from compressed air. Its most sensitive filters make air one million times cleaner than the air we breathe. Domnick Hunter makes significant revenue from replacement cartridges and also supplies original equipment manufacturers, which incorporate the group's filters into their own compressors. A growing proportion of the industrial division's sales come from dryers, which use molecular sieve technology developed in the US to produce clean dry air for the most critical of applications, such as paint-spraying or the handling of sensitive electronic components. Mr Brian Thompson, chairman, says Domnick Hunter's real expertise lies not just in manufacturing, but in finding solutions for each application. The group uses computer-aided design to study how air flows through systems to establish the optimum size and positioning of filters. All this adds up to an extremely lucrative business, which has a wide spread of customers both geographically and across a broad range of industries. The division currently enjoys a margin of operating profits to sales of nearly 20 per cent. However, what has most excited analysts about its prospects is the recent move into making nitrogen generation equipment. In January it paid Pounds 1.7m for Nitrox, a manufacturer which it had been working with for several years. Mr Thompson says the group's new nitrogen generators, which he claims produce nitrogen gas from compressed air at a fraction of the cost of cylinder supplies, are attracting tremendous interest. Sales increased by 50 per cent to Pounds 660,000 in the first six months of the year. Mr Thompson says: 'The potential nitrogen market is huge. Bottled is 35 per cent of what is a Pounds 2bn worldwide market.' Domnick Hunter's other division is process, which makes sophisticated membranes to filter pharmaceuticals and liquids such as mineral water, wine and spirits. The business was established during the eighties to reduce the group's dependence on compressed air, but is still described as being in an evolutionary phase. Domnick Hunter is one of only a small number of international companies which can make these membranes. Although smaller than its US and German competitors, it has won more than 20 per cent of the UK market. The process division's sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 4.2m in the first half, but heavy investment in an overseas sales network caused operating profits to fall from Pounds 151,000 to Pounds 51,000. Domnick Hunter was founded in 1963 and bought by the Scottish coachbuilder Walter Alexander in the 1970s. In 1990 Mr Thompson led a Pounds 42m management buy-out for the whole group. Two years later, the coachbuilding division organised its own buy-out and the company was left as a specialist filter operation. The group employs 550, mainly divided between the group headquarters at Birtley and a factory at Team Valley, both in Tyne and Wear. The flotation reduced heavy borrowings and has allowed work to start on a Pounds 2.5m extension to the industrial division's Birtley plant, expanding space by 50 per cent. Domnick Hunter has also invested heavily in increasing efficiency. Both managers and employees are converts to Japanese methods of continuous improvement and just-in-time manufacturing. The enthusiastic atmosphere apparent at the plants - which are set in an area of high unemployment  - is fostered by regular team building activities. The price increase since flotation means the shares are trading on a prospective multiple that represents a 60 per cent-plus premium to the market. However, the shares are tightly held. Given the group's quality and growth prospects, institutions which snapped up stakes are likely to stay on board.</p>

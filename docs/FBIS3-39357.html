Then, too, the world counted down the time  to the moment when the deadline would expire, and then, too, the  deadline led to increased diplomatic activity to try to avoid a  fatal explosion.    For the time being most Western governments are assuming  that  military action will not be necessary. They are counting on the  Serbs and the Bosnian Government Army to hand over their heavy  weapons to the United Nations within the deadline. Such  positions show again -- in so far as that was still necessary --  that no one is burning to really intervene. That is the big  difference with the Gulf war. Then, Western leaders were  determined to join battle with Saddam Husayn, no matter what the  consequences. The Bosnian tragedy soon will have unfurled  itself before everyone for two years and no one has ever shown  the same determination. Despite the far more serious human  rights violations, the bloodbaths, the "ethnic cleansing," the  destruction of everything a Western democracy claims it believes  in, no Western leader has ever taken action to make it clear  that enough was enough. That is not simply linked to a painful  lack of courage, but has just as much to do with a lack of  strategy.    The truth, which no one likes to hear, is that this crisis  has demonstrated the limits of the West's power and  possibilities in the most painful way. The West has allowed  itself to be dragged into a swamp from which it was impossible  to escape. The only way out of the policies followed up to now  is ever greater involvement at an ever higher cost, with  diminishing chances of a real solution. It is strange to hear  Foreign Minister Willy Claes now admit this. Even at the time  of the Bosnia conference in London in August 1992, everyone who  had followed the crisis could unerringly predict this scenario.    By carrying out air strikes against Serb positions, NATO  hopes to break through this spiral. And much is at stake for  the organization. The Western military alliance also shares the  impotence of the European Union and the United Nations. What it  comes down to for NATO is restoring its credibility. Air  strikes may achieve this goal, but they will contribute nothing  to the real goal, namely a just solution to the crisis.    The idea underlying the NATO threat is that the Bosnian  Government will be forced to agree to the division of the  country. If the Serbs give up their siege of Sarajevo, they will  be able to negotiate from the strongest position. They will no  longer have to fear attack and therefore will be rewarded for  their aggression. The Bosnian Government could then do nothing  else but give in. If it did not do so, then it would isolate  itself. Indeed, then the victims of the war would be regarded  as an obstacle on the way to peace.    As NATO understands, its air strikes provide no guarantee  that the Serbs will not restart the struggle or that they will  not move it to Tuzla or Srebenica or another safe area. Nor are  they any guarantee that the crisis will not break out in Kosovo,  where a time bomb has been ticking away for a long time.    NATO, the EU, and the United Nations are now in the  situation  where no intervention of any kind will provide any kind of  solution. Air strikes are no way out, but no one could bear to  look on any further, and no one wants to send even more UN  troops into a hopeless situation. Everyone is now learning the  bitter lesson that the chances which were lost right at the  beginning are now taking a huge revenge. By intervening  earlier, the Serbs could have been curbed, the parties could  have been forced to negotiate seriously, and thousands of people  could have been saved. The West is now paying a high price in  Bosnia for its lack of courage and short-sighted policies. And  everyone fears that the price has not yet been paid in full.</p>

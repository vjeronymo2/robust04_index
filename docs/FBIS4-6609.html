			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Question-and-answer session of the joint news conference by </F> coalition leaders Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata, SDPJ Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama, Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, DSP chairman  Keigo Ouchi, Kaikaku-no-Kai's Takeo Nishioka, the Democratic  Reform Party's Eiichi Nakamura; live; session begins following  Hata's statement on his candidacy for premiership, and is  moderated by JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka]    [Text] [Matsuoka] Thank you Mr. Hata for showing us your  resolve. We still have time until 1540 [0640 GMT], and we would  like to receive some questions. Thank you in advance for your  cooperation. Please go ahead.    [Reporter Kure] I am Kure from Nihon TV. In the last two  weeks since Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation announcement,  the coalition parties' opinions were at first split over whether  the next prime minister should be elected by coalition party  leaders or party secretaries general, and interparty disputes  continued until the very last stage of working out new policy  accords. It seemed to us that these disputes left serious  cracks in the coalition. However, the coalition reached an  accord early this morning to start again under the leadership of  Mr. Hata.    Mr. Hata, could you give us your comments on the two-week  dispute?    [Hata] In fact, a two-week period is not a very short time  to me. I think it took so long because the parties discussed  various issues frankly. While you said cracks may remain in the  coalition, we are allies who have been working together under  the premiership of Mr. Hosokawa. It is true that the coalition  often faced difficulties in such subjects as the Uruguay Round  and electoral reform; however, we somehow overcame all of these  problems. Recalling the last eight months, I do not think any  serious discord remains among us.    With respect to the pending issue of tax reform, we have an  international pledge to settle the issue before the end of June.  Taking this opportunity of forming a new administration, we  tried to narrow disparity in the parties' stances on such issues  as much as possible, and this was why it took so long to work  out an accord among the parties. In this sense, I think the  prolonged debates were quite meaningful. The coalition parties  have been working together over the last eight months, but each  of them has its unique standpoint and history. Throughout the  two-week debates, I have become confident of a point that the  coalition parties are always able to overcome their positions  when they exhaustively discuss the nation's present  circumstances. So, I have to say I do not see any cracks in the  coalition.    I met a foreign official earlier today. When I asked him if  the international community is worrying much about the prolonged  political confusion in Japan, he replied that, if the new prime  minister is nominated today, that would be regarded as a  relatively smooth election process as a nation ruled by a  multiparty government. He said one nation has a rule to set a  three-week period to form a new administration, and, when the  period runs out, spends another three-week period to continue  discussions. He said yet another nation conducted a national  election a long time ago, but anything but parliament membership  has been determined up until now. I thought that was a funny  way to cheer me up.    All party leaders gathered today know the fiscal 1994 budget  must be compiled as soon as possible, and political confusion  should not worsen the economy. Also, we have to work on the  1995 budget following the compilation of the 1994 budget. Under  such circumstances, we tried hard to reach an early accord, and,  as you all know, yesterday's discussions continued even after  midnight. My understanding is that mutual confidence and the  sense of unity are strengthened through the debates.    [Matsuoka] Next question, please.    [Unidentified reporter] In the beginning of the interparty  debates on the new administration, the coalition's  decision-making mechanism, or the conference of party  secretaries general, evoked so much controversy. The coalition  agreed to review the position of the secretaries general's  conference. How do you do that hereafter?    [Hata] I am not aware of such an agreement. As you all  know, party secretaries general played key roles in the  inauguration of the coalition government led by Mr. Hosokawa.  In the Hosokawa administration, we are all serving as cabinet  ministers, and we have to spend almost all day working on  administrative duties. As Mr. Nakamura noted earlier, party  secretaries general met 27 times in the two-week period. While  I do not know the total length of the meetings, it must have  been impossible for party heads to spend the time on political  debate. Since we are in the cabinet, secretaries general are  actually taking charge of all political affairs such as Diet  administration. In this sense, I think the conference is an  important mechanism for the coalition government. I do not  think some people are intentionally disparaging the mechanism,  and I think it is necessary to smooth out interparty talks.  However, I believe the interparty accord could not be reached  without the secretaries general's conference. So, my opinion is  that we have to set much value on the mechanism.    Any more questions?    [Unidentified reporter] Since the new policy agreement was  reached, the issue of forming a united lower house group will be  a new political task. Can I ask each party leader to briefly  comment on this?    [Hata] Chairman Murayama told me to go ahead first. We have  been discussing political reform since we were in the LDP. Now,  Japan plays a very important role in international society. We  have to daringly promote major reform at home too. Under such  circumstances, some people thought it was not a good idea to  have many political parties. I have been saying that the  dynamism of Japanese politics will be created if two major  parties debate and compete with each other.    However, we have formed the coalition. To tell you the  truth, I think it would be better if the coalition parties could  debate together on what party representatives or party leaders  discussed at party representatives' meetings rather than having  separate discussions. For example, we can have true cooperation  in elections if we all belong to the same party or the same  group. This is an issue over which we will have heated debate  again in the future. However, we all agree that we have to  promote reform. On the basis of this common viewpoint, I wish  we could form one main group or a concentric circle. If we can  do that, then we will be able to exert greater power.    [Murayama] On the basis of what we have gone through, the  second coalition government is about to start. As you know, we  are confronted with important international and domestic tasks.  We talked about what this administration has to do to respond  to the people's expectations. I am sure that all parties which  support the coalition administration are trying to find ways to  deal with these tasks. Therefore, I think it is possible that  some of them may try to merge into one group. This is something  each party or each group has to think about.    However, as I said earlier, the SDPJ will deal with the  reality to enable the Hata coalition administration to smoothly  respond to the people's expectations.    [Ishida] We confirmed in the policy agreement that the next  general election will be held under the new administration. In  this sense, we can say that the new system will determine which  party or parties will take power. Needless to say, I cannot  tell you when the general election will be held. However, it is  extremely important for Komeito to continue to exert efforts and  to seek formation of a united group because the new election  system will determine the governing party.    [Ouchi] Since it is the beginning of a new  administration, I plan to give this issue some serious thought.    [Nishioka] Regarding policy decisionmaking and other  procedures under the Hosokawa administration, for its part the  Kaikaku no Kai has fully witnessed the hardships encountered by  those who have participated in the process. I feel that maybe  it is necessary to adopt new ideas based on the experiences of  these people. In addition, as mentioned earlier by Chairman  Ishida, it has been decided that elections will be held under a  new electoral system. Therefore, I feel it is proper for the  coalition to move in this direction as a single unit, and we of  the Kaikaku no Kai are in the process of discussing the issue  with this thought in mind.    [Nakamura] Minshu Kaikaku Rengo has already formed an upper  house floor group called Shin Ryokufukai. This group is  comprised of Minshu Kaikaku Rengo, Shinseito, JNP, and DSP. We  are now in the process of asking upper house members from the  SDPJ and Komeito to join us in Shin Ryokufukai. Therefore,  particularly in the upper house, it is clearly evident that in  order to enact the long-awaited policy agreement and prepare for  next year's election, the coalition parties now want to move  toward forming a unified group. With this in mind, we are  actually in the process of moving in this direction.    [Matsuoka] We do not have much time left. Let us have one  more question. A while ago... please go ahead.    [Unidentified correspondent] This is for confirmation. As  the new coalition government is being formed, when we look at  the stage there is one member missing who was present when the  first coalition government was formed. Takemura from Sakigake  is not here. While Sakigake withdrew from the coalition amidst  the recent turmoil, there have been some LDP defectors, and many  small groups have been formed. This has been referred to as Act  II of the political realignment. Under such circumstances, in  what specific ways does the coalition plan to deal with these  groups, as well as Sakigake, in regard to working out  cooperative relations with them?    [Hata] I cannot talk about specific ways since I have not  spoken to any of these people yet. However, the representatives  of these groups have asked me to meet them immediately after  this news conference. I plan to hold frank discussions with  them.    [Matsuoka] Thank you very much for your cooperation. We  would like to conclude the joint news conference at this time.  However, to round things off, we would like all the party  leaders to shake hands together on the stage.</p>

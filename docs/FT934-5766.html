			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Clarke must take axe to bureaucracy  -Kevin Goldstein-Jackson makes his suggestions for the Budget / Diary of a Private Investor The credit card receipt said 'Murder One' followed by a rather large amount. I was preparing for Kenneth Clarke's first Budget on Tuesday. In history, many national declines can be traced to increases in bureaucracy rather than a growth in occupations actually creating something. It is partly to pay for vast armies of civil servants that Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, will be forced in his Budget to find additional ways of raising revenue. My 'Murder One' payment was not for a hit man to help reduce the ranks of Whitehall mandarins but to Murder One bookshop in London's Charing Cross Road for a large number of thrillers. I was stocking up in case Clarke imposes value added tax on books. I have also renewed several magazine subscriptions for two years rather than the usual one in order to escape any VAT that might be imposed on such publications. My share portfolio is much reduced from last year and I am not adding to it until after the Budget; I want to keep cash available for any new investment opportunities which may arise because of Clarke's proposals. I am certainly not rushing into any last-minute investments based purely on 'tax avoidance' promotions: to me, an investment must appear to have reasonable prospects quite apart from tax considerations. In his previous ministerial positions, Clarke has not been afraid to announce radical changes, so I feel he will put his own considerable mark on the Budget. There could be surprises for everyone. Not all may be pleasant. For one thing, he is known to view the various anomalies in VAT with some concern. Suppose he reduced it from 17.5 per cent to, say, 16 per cent - but put it on everything. Discussing VAT on fuel, Clarke has said: 'Most other countries do it.' Since, unlike Britain, many countries in the European Union do not zero-rate bus fares, food and children's clothing, the same argument could be advanced for imposing VAT on these items in the UK - especially as EC bureaucrats are keen to 'harmonise' VAT rates. Many people travel to the Continent to bring back alcoholic drinks, so depriving the chancellor of UK duties on beers, wines and spirits. VAT on ferry trips might make such expeditions less attractive. The chancellor has also said that extending VAT to fuel 'will encourage real energy conservation and contribute to our targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions'. Somewhat similar arguments could be advanced for taxing bus, aeroplane and ferry travel while zero-rating the railways. This might also make it slightly easier to privatise British Rail. The chancellor could also announce an end to mortgage interest tax relief, and major alterations to National Insurance contributions. Such dramatic changes would affect almost every sector of the stock market. But what, as a private investor, do I hope the chancellor will do? We know he wants to encourage industry. Although business expansion schemes are due to end on December 31, I hope a replacement, with tax advantages, will be announced to encourage investment in new and expanding companies that are genuinely involved in manufacturing. But sharp lawyers and accountants should not be allowed to hijack investments into property or other non-manufacturing activities. I would also like to see personal equity plans (Peps) abolished in favour of a new scheme to encourage direct investment in companies without the need (and expense) of investing through plan managers. Everyone should be allowed to invest a certain amount each year (say, Pounds 10,000) directly in shares without having to pay tax on any gains from these, or on money made from re-investing the proceeds. In addition, people should be encouraged to devise their own pension plans. Any money (up to a certain specified level) invested directly in shares for pension purposes would receive the same tax advantages now given to pension and insurance fund managers. Abolishing stamp duty on share transactions is also long overdue. Again, to encourage a more direct involvement with companies and to deter tax avoidance, stamp duty could be ended on shares bought and registered in the names of individual private investors, although others would still have to pay. This would help to level the playing field between private investors and institutions, which benefit already from lower dealing costs. Whatever the chancellor's tax-raising plans, I hope they will be accompanied by massive cuts in the size of the civil service - starting with top officials in Whitehall. Britain is dividing rapidly into two sectors: the haves (almost unsackable civil servants with guaranteed, inflation-proof pensions) and the have-nots (almost everyone else whose job security and pension benefits remain in doubt). I would also like to see a crackdown on the use of nominee names and other methods of disguising the identities of certain UK-based businessmen who make fortunes from share and other transactions but pay little or no tax. If ordinary people are being asked to contribute more, they have a right to expect that everyone shares the tax burden fairly.</p>

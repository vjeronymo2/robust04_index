			<p>BFN     [Text] On Tuesday the Federation Council approved a federal  bill on limiting state borrowing abroad and credits granted by  the Russian Federation to foreign countries in 1994. The bill  was adopted by the State Duma on May 11.    The bill puts a limit on Russia's borrowing abroad at 4.7  billion dollars, and on its credits to foreign countries at 400  million dollars. It goes into effect as soon as it is published.    As the chairman of the Federation Council committee for  budget, finances and currency regulation, Nikolay Gonchar,  explained to the deputies, under the bill "the maximum size of  credits will depend on the ability of Russia's economy to  service its foreign debts."    According to him, since the amount of 4.7 billion dollars is  one billion dollars less than the size of borrowing envisaged by  Russia's Finance Ministry in this year's budget estimates,  amendments will have to be made to the corresponding articles of  the state budget without increasing the budget deficit or  incurring additional expenditure.    According to the data submitted by Gonchar, Russia's foreign  debt (not counting the debts to East European countries and  overdue commercial payments registered by the beginning of 1994)  surpassed 80 billion dollars, while the annual payments Russia  is obliged to make under the schedule for servicing and repaying  the main bulk of its debt exceeded 20 billion dollars in  1992-1993. This year the payments connected with servicing and  repaying the foreign debt, taking into account payments  postponed from 1993, make up 32 billion dollars, or 70 percent  of the export revenues expected this year.</p>

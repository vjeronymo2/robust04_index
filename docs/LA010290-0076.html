			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COCAINE DEATH SQUAD CHIEF SEIZED, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> The chief of the death squads organized by the Medellin cocaine cartel was  arrested at a police roadblock in central Colombia, authorities said.  </P> <P> The latest drug-trafficking suspect to be arrested was Jose Manuel Cruz  Aguirre, who is wanted in Peru, the Administrative Security Police said in a  communique Sunday.  </P> <P> Cruz Aguirre was arrested Friday evening on a highway about 35 miles south of  Bogota, the security police said. There were no immediate details on what  charges he faces.  </P> <P> Death squads financed by drug traffickers have killed scores of peasants  suspected of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas, who have tried to extort  money from cattle ranchers in areas where traffickers hold property.  </P> <P> The squads also have killed about 740 members of the country's biggest leftist  political party, the Patriotic Union, presumably because the party has the  support of the country's estimated 10,000 guerrillas.  </P> <P> Cruz Aguirre was part owner of one of Colombia's professional soccer teams,  Deportes Tolima, the security police said. Colombian authorities have contended  for years that drug bosses are among the owners of several professional soccer  teams in Colombia.  </P> <P> Aguirre was the third purported member of the Medellin cartel arrested in four  days. The others were Jose Antonio Ocampo Obando and Camilo Antonio Ruiz Vega.  </P> <P> Ocampo Obando, arrested Friday, is wanted for extradition by the United States.  </P> <P> Ruiz Vega, arrested Thursday, was a top confidant of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,  the No. 2 man killed by police Dec. 15.  </P></p>

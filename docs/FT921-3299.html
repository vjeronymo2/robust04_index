			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / 'Supergun' report splits MPs MPs investigating the Iraqi 'supergun' affair split yesterday over a report which criticises officials but stops short of attacking the intelligence services and ministers. The cross-party trade and industry select committee approved by six votes to four a report to be published on Monday - hours before the Commons rises for the election. Four Conservative MPs on the committee tried to block the report, partly because they believe criticisms implied in it have not been properly substantiated or investigated. The Department of Trade and Industry has said it was not fully briefed about the Iraqi project until March 1990, when eight sections of steel tubing manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters were seized by customs officials. The report blames the DTI and the Ministry of Defence for not pooling information which, if put together, should have provoked suspicions much earlier. It suggests, however, the mistakes were innocent, rather than part of a conspiracy.</p>

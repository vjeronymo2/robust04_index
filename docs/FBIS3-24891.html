			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Sierra Leone's ruling military council is accusing  the Liberian rebel leader, Charles Taylor, of being responsible  for the recent escalation of the rebel war in southeastern  Sierra Leone. This morning the foreign minister, Dr. Abass  Bundu, claimed that NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  forces are active on the side of Foday Sankoh's RUF  [Revolutionary United Front] rebels, and he issued a warning  that the war may be about to assume a new dimension. From  Freetown, Victor Sylver telexed this report.    Briefing newsmen this morning in Freetown, Foreign Secretary  Abass Bundu said that there was ample proof that Charles Taylor  had moved large quantities of arms, ammunition, and men into  Sierra Leone, not only to beef up Foday Sankoh's RUF rebels,  said Dr. Bundu, but also to create an enclave within Sierra  Leone for keeping arms and men of the NPFL that would not be  disarmed when the process gets under way in Liberia under the  terms of the Cotonou Accord. The foreign secretary said that  the Cotonou Accords did not envisage that the ploys now being  used by the NPFL would crop up, such as using neighboring  countries to evade the disarmament procedure. He said that the  accords were mainly concerned with events in Liberia and that  recent developments of attempted attacks on Guinea and in Sierra  Leone call for a closer look at the agreement.    Dr. Bundu revealed that the Sierra Leone Government intends  to ask the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States]  secretary general to convene a meeting of the nine countries  that have been assigned the task of reviewing the implementation  of the Cotonou Accords in Liberia with a view to highlighting  the new development in the war in Sierra Leone. The foreign  secretary told the press that evidence now revealed that Charles  Taylor has been using a number of ploys to escape the process of  disarmament, disguising his troops as police personnel or [words  indistinct] of a number of different organizations. He said  reports from areas recently attacked by the rebels talk of  stories by local villagers that ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] forces were fighting  alongside NPFL and RUF forces against government troops. This  is just one ploy now being used by Charles Taylor, said Dr.  Bundu, to create confusion inside Sierra Leone.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J. Mironski: "No Justification for the Greek </F> Measures"]    [Text] German Foreign Ministry Minister of State Helmut  Scheffer and the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski held a  news conference yesterday in which they emphasized their mutual  interest in the further development of bilateral relations  between the two countries.    Crvenkovski indicated that Scheffer's visit coincided with  the embargo imposed by Greece against Macedonia, which was also  a subject of the discussions. Minister Scheffer pointed out  that he did not arrive in Macedonia as a mediator between Greece  and Macedonia, but as a representative of a government of a  member country of the European Union, which wanted to gain an  insight into reactions in Macedonia and then transmit these  impressions to its own government, and also to the Union.    He said: "My impression is that there is great tranquillity  here concerning the development of events, without any  demonstrative emotions about the Greek embargo. It is difficult  for every state to make concessions under foreign pressures.  That is why I consider the Greek measures to be wrong."  Minister Scheffer also added: "Nobody in Europe wants the  political isolation of Greece; it is part of Europe, but Greece  must also admit that it should have agreed with its partners  before taking these measures. The decision, which came without  warning or reasons, was hard for everyone in Europe to  understand."    "Greece must understand that it cannot make unilateral  decisions without any reason," he said, and added: "I cannot  find a single argument that Macedonia represents a threat for  Greece; it is nothing but a fantasy. We cannot allow the  borders in Europe to be changed by force. I do not believe that  Macedonian integrity will be endangered, because it is  impermissible to have another conflict on the territory of  former Yugoslavia."    Concerning the Greek embargo and the damage suffered by  Macedonia, Scheffer said: "Greece is losing a lot itself.  Perhaps not as much as Macedonia, but it is. I do not see any  reason why it should harm itself economically and politically.  The embargo is a question that will have to be solved by the  European Union, and the official German stance is that it has to  be lifted immediately." He also emphasized that he would  transmit his impressions to the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs  of the Union Hans van den Brook, suggesting that negotiations  should restart promptly, and he also pointed out that  preliminary agreements should be organized.    Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski said that Scheffer's  visit  was of enormous importance, first of all for bilateral and  economic cooperation between the two countries. An agreement  was made about an exchange of experts to help companies restart  the long cooperation that existed before the war in former  Yugoslavia. A larger scientific and cultural cooperation was  also subject of the discussions, and soon a German library is  expected to open in Macedonia.</p>

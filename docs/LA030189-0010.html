			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA GIRLS HEAD FOR FINAL WITH A STREAK OF 40 VICTORIES  </P> <P> What has 36 legs, 18 ponytails, 40 consecutive victories and a goalkeeper as  lonely as the Maytag repairman?  </P> <P> Answer: The Agoura High girls' soccer team.  </P> <P> The Chargers smothered visiting Kennedy of La Palma, 5-0, on Tuesday in a  Southern Section 3-A Division semifinal.  </P> <P> And they hope that life really does begin at 40. Agoura, ranked No. 1 all  season, will play Anaheim Canyon for the championship Saturday at Gahr High in  Cerritos.  </P> <P> Agoura, has won three consecutive 2-A championships and has not lost since  December, 1986, an unbeaten string of 77 matches. This season, the Chargers  (25-0) have outscored the opposition, 170-6, and set a Southern Section record  for goals in a season.  </P> <P> The Chargers assaulted three Kennedy goalkeepers with 19 shots. Agoura goalie  Tricia Arledge, meanwhile, was called upon to make just one save.  </P> <P> Such disparity in the semifinal round?  </P> <P> "Actually, we were a little flat in the second half," Agoura Coach Dave Godwin  said.  </P> <P> Godwin's girls flattened Kennedy (12-10-1), the third-place team from the  Garden Grove League, with three first-half goals -- four if you count an  apparent goal that went uncredited after deflecting off the crossbar over the  goal line. The official, however, failed to notice the line judge signaling a  goal with her flag.  </P> <P> "I was thinking," said Godwin, who protested the play frantically, "What am I  going to do with my coronary arteries if that turns out to be the deciding  goal?"  </P> <P> Godwin kept on ticking, thanks to some fancy kicking by some familiar feet.  </P> <P> Senior Julie Tingle, who increased her Southern Section-record career assist  total to 102 with three in the match, scored the Chargers' first goal when she  booted in a rebound early in the first half.  </P> <P> Tingle, dribbling on a breakaway, fed junior Heidi Walters with a perfect  centering pass. Walters' shot, however, caromed off the goal post back to  Tingle.  </P> <P> Walters followed with two left-footed goals before halftime to increase her  team-high total to 29.  </P> <P> "I'm not left-footed," she said. "They just came that way."  </P> <P> Said Tingle, who has 43 assists this season: "I cross (pass) it and she kicks  it in."  </P> <P> Vanessa Martin, a senior, scored two second-half goals on assists from Tingle.  </P></p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Daimler in Mitsubishi engine deal MITSUBISHI Motors of Japan and Daimler-Benz are close to an agreement under which Mitsubishi will supply the German vehicle group with diesel engines for light trucks. Mitsubishi confirmed yesterday the two companies were negotiating an engine deal, although it refused to discuss details. The deal, expected to be concluded by year end, would mark one of the first tangible co-operative arrangements between the two companies, following a widely publicised decision by the two in 1990 to seek a broad strategic alliance. An earlier agreement between the two companies under which Mitsubishi dealers in Japan have been selling Mercedes-Benz cars has run into difficulties, in part because Mercedes is interested in developing independent dealers in Japan who specialise in its vehicles. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper reported that Mitsubishi would be developing a 2,800cc diesel engine for Daimler-Benz's T1 model vehicles, to be marketed from 1995. Mitsubishi would supply about 9,000 engines a year.</p>

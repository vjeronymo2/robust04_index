			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Bank eases deadline The World Bank has extended to June 30 the deadline for the Philippines to comply with terms attached to the second and last tranche of an economic integration loan (EIL), Mr Callisto Madavo, World Bank director for the East Asia and Pacific region, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Manila. Mr Madavo said the bank had to move back the original December 1993 deadline to give the government more time to meet the remaining conditions attached to the EIL, notably liberalised import of used trucks and buses and the easing of restrictions on farm imports, specifically maize. Local officials are still trying to amend existing rules to be able to avail the Philippines of the Dollars 200m (Pounds 136.9m) left in the EIL. During the same news conference, Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, asked the government to address business concerns about the deterioration of the country's education system and the poor state of local infrastructure. He said, however, that despite these factors, the World Bank was still convinced the Philippines would succeed in carrying out its economic plans and that the bank 'will continue to give strong support to the Philippine government on its development efforts'.</p>

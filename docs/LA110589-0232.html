			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BERKELEY;  </P> <P> 1 SEIZED AT CAMPUS FLAG BURNING RALLY  </P> <P> An American flag was torched on the steps of Sproul Hall on the UC Berkeley  campus Friday as a crowd of about 500 people chanted, "Burn, baby, burn."  Police arrested one person, but not under the federal law against flag burning  that went into effect Oct. 27 and prompted the protest. Suzanne Lester, 20, a  student at the university, was cited for obstructing a police officer. Police  said because of the size of the crowd, they could not determine which  individuals actually took part in the burning.  </P></p>

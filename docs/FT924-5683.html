			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greek group suspends bauxite production BAUXITES PARNASSE Mining, Greece's biggest producer of bauxite (aluminium ore), has suspended production for three months because of a sharp decline in sales to its traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. The company used to sell about 400,000 tonnes of bauxite a year, much of which was used for the manufacture of abrasives, to Razno, a Soviet state trading company. But since the break-up of the Soviet Union, it has had to deal directly with individual plants in the independent republics. Bauxites Parnasse used to account for about 1 per cent of annual world bauxite producion. But output from its mines in central Greece has slumped from a record 1.6m tonnes in 1989 to about 1m tonnes this year. Mr Ulysses Kyriacopoulos, the company's managing director, said: 'We have shut down production completely until February at least. Though we're used to keeping a large stockpile, we'd built up a huge inventory of about 2m tonnes of bauxite, twice the normal level'. Sales to Russia and the Ukraine will amount to only about 100,000 tonnes this year, he said. 'Our task now is to put together deals with individual CIS processors, taking payment in alumina (aluminium oxide), and passing it on to a smelter. It is a much more complicated business.' At the same time sales to Romania have fallen. Bauxites Parnasses used to export up to 300,000 tonnes annually, which was used for producing aluminium. As a result of Romania's severe energy shortage, however, there have been big cuts in aluminium output over the past three years. Bauxites Parnasse expects to sell only 100,000 tonnes of ore to Romania this year. However, sales to western European bauxite users have not been affected, Mr Kyriacopoulos said. Aluminium de Grece, part of the French Pechiney group, buys 450,000 tonnes a year to help feed an aluminium smelter near Distomo in central Greece. Greek exporters face problems in finding alternative markets because 'hard' Greek bauxite cannot be used by western European processors, which are geared to producing alumina from the 'soft' bauxite mined in Africa or South America.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Honecker to enter hospital in Moscow MR Erich Honecker, the former leader of East Germany, is to be allowed to leave the Chilean embassy to be treated in a Moscow hospital, according to diplomats at the German embassy. They said the Russian government had told the Chilean ambassador, a friend of Mr Honecker, that 'there would be no problems' about allowing him to go into hospital. Yesterday the Russian foreign ministry confirmed the report. Mr Honecker, who is 79, has been in the embassy for two and a half months, following a demand from the German government that he be sent back to face charges of ordering the shooting of refugees to the west. His wife, Margot, says he has cancer and kidney problems, which Chilean diplomats say are worsening.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  Government stands firmly opposed to the official contact between  Taiwan and countries having diplomatic relations with China, a  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today.    When asked to comment on the plan by Li Teng-hui of Taiwan  to  "spend his holiday" in some Southeast Asian countries in  February, he said "we are very concerned about it."    Recently, the spokesman noted, the Taiwan authorities have  been trying to develop `substantive relations' with some  countries by spending holiday and paying private visits there,  which is what they call `holiday-making diplomacy'." [no  beginning quotation mark as received]    By so doing, he said, they attempt to squeeze into some  international and regional organizations and seek the status of  a "political entity". Therefore, under whatever names and in  whatever forms, Li Teng-hui's visits to those countries cannot  cover up his political intention and the official nature of such  visits, he added.    He stated that the Chinese Government stands firmly opposed  to the official contact between Taiwan and countries having  diplomatic relations with China.    We hope the countries concerned would cherish the fruits of  the all-round development of their relations with China and be  alert to the political intention of the Taiwan authorities so as  to protect the friendly relations and cooperation between China  and those countries from being disrupted and jeopardized," the  spokesman said.</p>

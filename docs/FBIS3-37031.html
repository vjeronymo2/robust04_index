			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As a result of a meeting between the Ukrainian and  Russian Government delegations held in Kiev last week, with the  aim of working out a mechanism of dismantling Ukrainian nuclear  warheads, Ukraine managed to achieve an agreement in principle,  which provides for far more advantageous compensation conditions  to Ukraine for the warheads that are being withdrawn [from  Ukraine's territory]. This was reported by Nur Nihmatulin, the  deputy chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for the Use of  Nuclear Power. Russia can compensate by supplying fuel for the  nine reactors operating at Ukrainian nuclear power stations, in  an amount ample to maintain the work of the stations throughout  36 to 42 months. The compensation can also be made in the form  of writing off or writing down Ukraine's debt for the power  sources imported from Russia.    Earlier, the Russian side flatly rejected the possibility of  writing off this debt as compensation for the dismantling of the  warheads. Ukraine's debt for the oil and gas supplied by Russia  now amounts to no less than 800 billion rubles and about 120  billion rubles for the fuel for nuclear power stations.    Undoubtedly, the recent ratification of START I by the  Ukrainian Supreme Council has received an unequivocally positive  response throughout the world and contributed to relaxing  Russia's stand.</p>

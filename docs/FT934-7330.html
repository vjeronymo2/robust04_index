			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Seaq breakdown disrupts trading THE London Stock Exchange's ageing Seaq automated price display system broke down for four hours yesterday, forcing market makers and investors to resort to telephones to find the best price to buy or sell shares. The breakdown is the second in two months, with a shorter disruption of about 90 minutes in late September. Seaq screens show at a glance the prices market makers are offering for the purchase and sale of stock, allowing instant comparisons for those seeking the best deal. The stock exchange declined to give any explanation for the failure, saying only that it was investigating the matter. The exchange is developing a successor to Seaq which it plans to build itself. After internal debate, the exchange's board rejected a proposal to allow Nasdaq, the US screen-based trading system, to build a successor. The absence of firm prices yesterday caused leading institutional investors to cease trading, with buyers deciding that they could not be sure they were getting the best price for stock. 'Who knows what deals were done, and at what price, while the system was down?' commented one trader. At Panmure Gordon, a leading institutional broking house, Mr Nigel Little, a senior trader, said: 'The Seaq problems caused major complications. It was all the more serious because there was some sizeable business around. Overseas clients felt themselves completely cut off from the market.' Meanwhile, the system's failure also threw the derivatives market into disarray because the London International Financial Futures Exchange was unable to calculate the value of the FT-SE, making it impossible to close the expiring November FT-SE 100 options contract. The closing price should have been based on the FT-SE between 10.10am and 10.30am, but had to be delayed for hours, leaving dealers with open positions. 'It was an absolute horror for the market,' said one futures dealer. 'This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this happen in the equity index market.' London stocks Page 15</p>

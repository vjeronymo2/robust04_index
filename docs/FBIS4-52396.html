			<p>BFN     [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology  under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  will start transferring know-how on Japan's quality control  (total quality management = TQM) to ASEAN nations as part of  economic cooperation programs. The TQM system, known as an  efficient way of improving product quality, has made unique  development in Japan through pan-corporate quality control (QC)  circle campaigns. Plans of support for individual ASEAN nations  will be worked out in 1994 and then be put into practice for  five years from fiscal 1995.    Specifically, 1) manuals on quality improvement will be  prepared; 2) Japanese experts will be sent to the ASEAN nations  for on-the-job training; 3) foreign students will be invited for  training in Japan; and 4) seminars will be held. MITI will soon  start coordinating requests from those nations, and will decide  how much time should be given to which industrial areas, for  instance.    At a meeting held between the six ASEAN economic ministers  and then MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai in Singapore last  October, an agreement was reached on action plans to promote  industrial development in the ASEAN nations. The action plans  included "the promotion of industrial standardization and  quality control for improvement of product quality."</p>

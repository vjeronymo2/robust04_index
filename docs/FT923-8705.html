			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / London's role in forex threatened LONDON'S position as the foreign exchange capital of the world is under threat because of the changing nature of foreign currency trading in Europe, according to a report by Greenwich Associates, an influential US think tank. The report says the volume of cross-border currency trading in Europe has doubled in the last two years with an increasing focus on bilateral currency trading between individual European countries. The researchers also discovered a growing debate over whether Europe should have a single centre for foreign exchange or several centres, in which London would be a first among equals. The report says cross-border trading has developed as protectionist barriers have fallen in the EC. Companies are trading more actively in the D-Mark/peseta cross, for example, because the amount of bilateral trade between Spain and Germany creates large currency flows. But there is also growing unease in Europe about London's role as foreign exchange centre. European corporate treasurers were concerned at the handling of the default of some local authorities on their swap obligations; the BCCI affair; and the number of large corporations running into financial difficulties. The study also discovered that UK companies are far more conservative than their European counterparts in the use of currency hedging techniques for profit. Of the UK corporate treasurers that were interviewed for the report, only 6 per cent said that they actively use risk management products such as swaps and options, compared with 22 per cent of European treasurers.

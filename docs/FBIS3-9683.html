In Geneva, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said all  convoys to the northern enclave of Banja Luka via Serb-held  territory would be suspended until further notice. Radio  Sarajevo reported clashes between the Moslem-led Bosnian army  and Bosnian Serb forces around the northern town of Maglaj. In  Vitez, a UN Protection Force spokesman said Moslem and Croatian  forces had pushed back Bosnian Serb forces by several kilometers  (miles) to the west of Maglaj, echoing the radio report.  Spokesman Rod Tracy, citing Moslem sources in Maglaj, said the  Moslem and Croat forces had advanced to Mount Gavranic, 7  kilometers (4 miles) to the west of the town. Tracy added that  the British battalion based here had given Moslem forces at  Zenica a 24-hour ultimatum to withdraw six anti-aircraft guns  deployed in the region in violation of a ceasefire agreement.  Echoing these reports, a Belgrade newspaper said Tuesday that  eight civilians, including three children, were killed in Moslem  shelling of the Bosnian Serb-held town of Doboj, also in  northern Bosnia. The daily BORBA cited military officials as  saying that the Moslem-led Bosnian army opened fire from  positions at Matuzici to the southwest of the town, launching  several dozen mortars onto the town.    Bosnian Serbs have reported an upsurge in fighting in the  region around Doboj, as well as around Brcho, Kupres, over the  last few days. Their leader Radovan Karadzic threatened on  Sunday [27 March] to launch a counter-attack. In Geneva, Foa  said the decision to suspend aid convoys to Banja Luka had been  taken after an incident on Saturday at the UNHCR depot in the  enclave, in which police seized 12 palettes of aid supplies from  two UN trucks. She said only local officials had been at the  time of the seizure. The police said the aid was to be  distributed in Banja Luka, but they had not been authorized to  take the aid, Foa said. Foa added that the suspension of convoys  in the region would remain in force until the issue was  resolved. "We have suspended convoys through the Banja Luka area  until this is settled," she said.    The UNHCR warehouse in Banja Luka is used to store supplies  not only for the town but also for other Moslem-held enclaves in  central Bosnia. Radio Sarajevo also reported fighting Tuesday  around the eastern enclave of Gorazde, with Serbs launching  intense mortar attacks on the town. One person had been killed  and eight injured, the radio said. It added that Serbian  reinforcements had arrived in a dozen trucks on the other side  of the Drina river.    Meanwhile Tracy added in Vitez that the head of British  forces, Sir Charles Guthrie, was scheduled to arrive in the  region Tuesday for a two-day visit taking in Vitez, Gornji Vakuf  and Zepce. Separately here Tuesday, the resumption of a session  of the Bosnian parliament was delayed for procedural reasons.  Lawmakers are due to discuss the adoption of a constitution of a  future Moslem-Croat federation.</p>

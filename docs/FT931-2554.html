			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Thai stock market speculators charged A WEALTHY Thai stock market player and 11 of his relatives and alleged associates were charged with share manipulation in a Bangkok court yesterday in the first such case initiated by the newly created Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Song Watcharasriroj, better known as Sia (tycoon) Song, and the others pleaded not guilty. They were charged with creating the false impression that there was a high volume of genuine trading in the stock of Bangkok Bank of Commerce; of failing to report taking a 5 per cent stake in the bank; and of failing to make an offer for the company when their stake exceeded 25 per cent. The SEC and other regulatory authorities, such as the central bank, have sought to exert more control over Thailand's growing but notoriously speculative stock market. Speculators, notably rich housewives, crowd into public dealing rooms of securities companies each day and treat them as betting shops. Ignoring fundamental profitability or dividend payments, Thai punters typically follow big players such as Mr Song in piling into and out of a few chosen shares. Prices soar or plunge as a result, prompting one stockbroker to refer to such shares as 'bungee-jumpers.' Although the move against Mr Song has helped cool the market's speculative fever - the SET index fell 2.82 points yesterday to close at 903.44 - the court could take years to conclude the case.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel rally Channel tunnel group Eurotunnel had another active day with 2.6m shares changing hands and the shares recovering 12 to 221p as rumours of institutional muscle-flexing buzzed through the market. There was a strong suggestion that a number of institutions were seeking compensation for losses suffered on shares taken up at the 265p rights issue last May. Sentiment was also helped as tickets for the service from London to the Continent went on sale for the first time and sales agents were swamped with demand.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> ASSESSMENT DISTRICT OKD  </P> <P> The City Council has voted unanimously to form a landscaping and lighting  assessment district that will cost the average homeowner nearly $93 a year.  </P> <P> The council took action even though 7,000 people signed petitions against the  plan. However, city officials said the protesters own no more than 28% of the  property to be assessed, and many do not own property in the city.  </P> <P> The new fees will take effect July 1. The council has adopted an assessment  formula that taxes property on the basis of its size and use. The assessment,  designed to raise $1.2 million a year, applies to all private property in the  city.  </P></p>

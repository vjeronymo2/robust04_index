Residents will receive notices  one week before their pickup date.  </P> <P> Special pickup items should be kept separate from regular trash but put in the  same location. Crews will pick up mattresses, refrigerators, water heaters,  washers and dryers, stoves, sofas, lumber and furniture. Workers will not pick  up tires, tree limbs, asphalt, cars, chemicals, hazardous waste, concrete,  dirt, oil drums or paint cans.  </P></p>

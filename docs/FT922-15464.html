			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Labour claims breakthrough MR NEIL KINNOCK last night claimed a breakthrough in the general election campaign after three opinion polls indicated that Labour would move into the final week with a lead of between four and seven points over the Conservatives. The surveys, which shocked the Conservative campaign team, are the first to suggest that one party has taken a decisive advantage. They show a slump in support for the Conservatives after last week's row over the health service and criticism of Mr John Major's 'negative' campaigning. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, whose support has risen in recent days, are shown as the main beneficiary. Labour support remains at just over 40 per cent but the Liberal Democrats have moved up from about 16 per cent to just below 20 per cent. But if the poll results were replicated on April 9 Mr Kinnock would move into Downing Street with an overall majority. Senior Conservatives responded by signalling that the party would redouble its efforts to detach 'protest' voters from the Liberal Democrats and intensify its attacks on Mr Kinnock's leadership. Some senior ministers suggested a radical rethink might be needed. The boost for Labour followed another day of angry exchanges over tax and spending. Mr Major underlined again his commitment to tax cuts and Mr Kinnock insisted he would not increase the bills of the vast majority of taxpayers. They dismissed suggestions in an independent report that an impending crisis in public finances would curb greatly their respective ambitions. The largest Labour lead came in a Mori poll for The Times today, which gave it 42 per cent against the Tories' 35 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' 19 per cent. A Harris survey for ITN's News At Ten put Labour on 41 per cent, the Conservatives on 35 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 19 per cent. An ICM poll for The Guardian had the parties at 41, 37 and 18 respectively. The Mori poll emphasised that Labour has retained its strong lead on the NHS, while the Harris survey suggested that more of the skilled working classes - the so-called C2s - have switched their allegiance to Mr Kinnock. A series of polls in marginal constituencies - including one suggesting that Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, would lose Bath - reinforced the gloomy news for the Conservatives. Mr Major refused to comment on the poll findings but senior ministers admitted they had been taken by surprise by the scale of the apparent swing against the Conservatives. Some predicted another agonising inquest into their lacklustre campaign. There were suggestions that if the results were confirmed in polls due today, the party could be forced into a complete shake-up of its election strategy and team. Mr Michael Heseltine gave a flavour of the expected onslaught on Mr Kinnock in a scathing speech yesterday questioning the Labour leader's fitness for office. Emphasising Mr Kinnock's policy reversals, the environment secretary said a Tory defeat would lead to government by 'a great big load of Kinnocks'. Mr Patten signalled that greater efforts would be made to convince potential supporters of Mr Ashdown that a vote for the third party would help Mr Kinnock into Downing Street. Mr Kinnock attributed the poll findings to the contrast between his 'positive' campaign and the 'desperately negative' approach of the Tories. He said the polls were in line with constituency and regional surveys which had shown his party doing well in key marginals: 'We will be making large gains and forming the majority government.' Labour signalled its intention to move the campaign on to what it regards as strongest ground  - the welfare state  - with the launch yesterday of its Pounds 600m package to improve education. Today there will be a return to the offensive on health, with Mr Kinnock renewing the charge that the NHS is being privatised. The Conservatives will attempt to switch the focus to Mr Kinnock's record on defence. That will follow the election broadcast last night which portrayed the Labour leader as a man who, after 30 years' membership of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, could not be trusted to maintain the country's nuclear defences. Mr Patten challenged Mr Kinnock to disclose how many Labour candidates were in CND after releasing documents indicating that all references to the organisation had been excised from Labour's official list of candidates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Last night's            Latest opinion      Betting      Futures FT forecast                 poll             odds        trading  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative 284 seats      37%               2/1         301 Labour       320 seats      41%               1/3         303 Liberal/Dem   22 seats      18%             200/1          25                        (ICM/Guardian)     William Hill  Dealing on the                    Field date 31 March (for most seats) number of seats                                                    (IG index mid-prices)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

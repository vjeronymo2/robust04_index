			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Maxwell talks focus on remaining Pounds 45m gap A financial settlement offered to members of pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell is still about Pounds 45m short of what is needed to meet all liabilities. This week, Sir Peter Webster, acting as a negotiator on behalf of the government-backed Maxwell Pensioners Trust, will be meeting institutions which have offered to contribute to the fund to encourage them to increase their offers. Also, some which failed to make offers will be encouraged again to do so. Those who do not make offers as part of a 'global settlement' are likely to be the subject of writs from trustees of the various schemes seeking recovery of assets. It is expected that Sir Peter will press for final offers to be received by the end of this week. For the past three weeks, Sir Peter, a retired High Court judge, has been acting as a deputy judge, thus diverting him from the negotiations. 'That is why we have been given three weeks to 'think things over',' one trustee said. However, in telephone conversations with trustees, Sir Peter has expressed 'cautious optimism' that a formal agreement can be reached. A trustee said: 'No one puts their last offer in at the beginning. The offer we have received is pretty good but it is not good enough.' The settlement, offered three weeks ago by a group of financial institutions and advisers, was about Pounds 240m, while trustees to the pension schemes estimate that about Pounds 285m is needed. Trustees said that one problem in deciding how low an offer they can accept is the fact that calculating the exact liabilities of the pension schemes is difficult. If schemes are required to buy annuities for each member, the sum which must be offered in the global settlement will have to be higher. However, if significant numbers of scheme members elect to take a cash transfer value into another pension scheme or into a personal pension, the liabilities will be much lower. That is because the method used to calculate cash transfer values gives rise to lower costs than the purchase of annuities. Meanwhile, trustees said that one of the main potential stumbling blocks to a global settlement appeared to have been removed. Trustees to the Mirror Group Pension Scheme, the largest of the Maxwell company schemes, had been seeking a guarantee that the government would not try to claw back payments it had extended to cover the guaranteed minimum pensions of scheme members. For all the schemes this sum is about Pounds 115m. While government officials have not explicitly reassured trustees, 'it has been implied that there will be no clawback if we accept the settlement', according to one trustee. For all schemes except the Mirror, this agreement will benefit scheme members. In the case of the Mirror, it will benefit shareholders because the sums clawed back would have had to be paid to pensioners by Mirror Group itself.</p>

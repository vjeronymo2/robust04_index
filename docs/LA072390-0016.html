			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: BO WILL TRY TO HELP KIDS TO KNOW, TOO  </P> <P> Come November, if there's still a preschooler in America who doesn't know Bo,  Public Broadcasting Service will try to take care of that.  </P> <P> Last week, while the Kansas City Royals were in New York to play the Yankees,  Bo Jackson taped a segment for the PBS children's TV show, "Sesame Street."  </P> <P> Kids watching the show will know, via Bo, the difference between up and down,  empty and full and near and far, as well as the alphabet and counting skills.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Which two states among the contiguous 48 don't have an NFL  franchise and don't border on a state that does?  </P> <P> Maybe Bo knows: Michael Kay of the New York Daily News recently asked New York  Yankee outfielder Deion Sanders if he privately knew what decision he would  make between football and baseball. Said Sanders: "I know, but I really don't  know. You know what I mean."  </P> <P> Corn Belt backlash: The award for most graphic soccer bashing, post-World Cup,  goes to Ed Anger, who writes a column called "My America" for "Weekly World  News" in Des Moines, Iowa.  </P> <P> Thursday's edition of California Staatszeitung, a statewide German-language  newspaper, reproduced one of Anger's columns, which led with, "I'm so happy  that those stupid World Cup soccer matches are over I could kiss a pig on the  mouth!"  </P> <P> The German paper's headline-response: "News from the wild west . . . Who has a  pig for Mr. Ed Anger?"  </P> <P> Send resume: Jackie MacMullan of the Boston Globe recently scolded Dave Gavitt,  the Boston Celtics' general manager, for considering Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski  as a candidate for the Celtic coaching job. She called Krzyzewski's withdrawal  "a blessing in disguise."  </P> <P> MacMullan quoted Detroit Piston Coach Chuck Daly: "The preparation is endless.  Our trainer, Mike Abdenour, knows more about the pro game than any college  coach right now."  </P> <P> Eleven pianos of granite: Former Michigan fullback Neil Snow, who scored the  first touchdown in the first Rose Bowl game Jan. 1, 1902, is one of five  players to be inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Snow, who died at 34 in 1914, was a member of Fielding (Hurry Up) Yost's  Wolverines from 1901-04. Those teams were unbeaten and tied only once,  outscoring their opponents 2,326-40.  </P> <P> Said The Times: "Michigan's men formed a collection of superb specimens of  all-around physical development -- calves like piano legs and arms to match --  all as hard as rocks."  </P> <P> Calling an audible: Former University of Washington quarterback Sonny Sixkiller  joined fellow native Americans, running a leg on the 1,000-mile, nine-day relay  that delivered a carved, six-foot-long "talking stick" through the Northwest to  Saturday night's Goodwill Games opening ceremonies at Husky Stadium.  </P> <P> Said Sixkiller: "When you stand there holding it, people listen. You can't  speak softly with this in your hand. We want the tribal kids to be proud of  where they came from."  </P> <P> Fiscal conservative: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Saturday attended  the Newbury track in Berkshire, about 55 miles west of London.  </P> <P> Whom did she like in the feature?  </P> <P> Said Thatcher: "It is nearing the end of the Parliamentary session and I am  here for sheer enjoyment -- there is no other motive."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Maine and Montana.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Lee Trevino, explaining how he was one under during a seniors  tournament: "One under a tree, one under a bush and one under the water."

The record includes earnings covered under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), earnings covered under title XVIII of the Act, and earnings not covered under the Act. The record is identified by the individual's social security number. Wages posted to an individual's record are based on wage reports submitted to SSA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by employers. IRS regulations at 26 CFR 31.6011(a)&hyph;1 require an employer to file employment tax returns with IRS each year and IRS regulations at 26 CFR 31.6051&hyph;2 and 31.6091&hyph;1(d) require an employer to file wage reports with SSA each year. These requirements are also explained on wage reporting forms and in related instructions issued by SSA and IRS. To help account for these returns and reports, IRS assigns an employer identification number (EIN) to every employer. However, SSA will assign a special identification number to one or more political subdivisions of a State which submits a modification to its coverage agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under section 218 of the Act. These numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended to periods prior to 1987. Then, the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Annual Wage Reporting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 232 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 432, was added by section 8 of Public Law 94&hyph;202. Section 8 is cited as the ``Combined Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance-Income Tax Reporting Amendments of 1975.'' Section 232 provides authority for the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of HHS to make available such documents that are agreed upon as being necessary for processing information contained in returns required by the Internal Revenue Code and by IRS regulations. Under this authority and Pub. L. 94&hyph;455 and 95&hyph;216, SSA and IRS have entered into an Agreement governing the manner in which employer wage reports will be processed. Included in this process are the wage reports which employers are required to file annually with SSA. As required by IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011&hyph;2, employers who file 250 or more wage reports per year must file them on magnetic media, unless the requirement is waived by IRS. These proposed regulations reflect these requirements for filing annual wage reports with SSA and explain how SSA will process the reports and reconcile reporting errors with IRS, employees, and employers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Incorrect Wage Reports <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are also proposing to consolidate &sect;&sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 422.115 and 422.120 to include in one section (proposed &sect;422.120) our current procedures for processing wage reports, submitted to us by employers, that do not include a worker's social security number or include an incorrect name or number. The existing regulations provide that we will first contact the employer for the missing information or correction. However, in the proposed regulation, we state our current procedure which is to attempt to contact the employee first. Additionally, we provide that we may return to the employer a wage report submittal if 90 percent or more of the wage reports are unidentified or incorrectly identified. We also explain in the proposed &sect;422.120 that we will inform IRS of all wage reports filed with SSA that do not include the required social security numbers. IRS may then assess the employer a penalty for erroneous report filing, pursuant to the authority provided in section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6721. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pension Plan Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6057, certain private pension plan administrators must file with the IRS annual reports that identify individuals who separated from plan coverage during the year and still have a right to future retirement benefits. In addition, this provision of the Internal Revenue Code provides for transmitting copies of the annual reports to the Secretary of HHS. The copies are forwarded to SSA and transcribed onto an electronic record for the purpose of maintaining the pension information which SSA must provide to specified individuals, as explained below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1131 of the Act requires that whenever the Secretary of HHS makes a finding of fact and a decision as to the entitlement of an individual to social security or medicare benefits under title II of the Act or is requested to do so, the Secretary must transmit to the individual any information, as reported by the employer, regarding any deferred vested benefits under a private pension plan. In these proposed rules, we explain how we administer this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

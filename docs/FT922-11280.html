			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / People: Cecil Parkinson joins Starmin The Abdullah brothers, Raschid and Osman, learned a salutary lesson about what can happen in public companies even when you own significant chunks of them. They were ousted at the beginning of 1989 from Evered, the quarry and building products group which they had turned into an aggressive mini-conglomerate; now they are determined to do things differently. With the combined family holding of the Abdullahs' new vehicle, quarry products company Starmin, standing at around 17 per cent, and the ability to grow further increasingly dependent on outside shareholders, the time has come to appoint another non-executive director, in addition to chairman Owen Rout, and a finance director. Consequently, former cabinet minister Cecil Parkinson arrives as an independent director and deputy chairman, the latter post being relinquished by Raschid Abdullah - who, nevertheless, remains director responsible for acquisitions and strategy. At the same time Barry Croucher, for many years financial controller at Evered and who moved over with the Abdullahs, is promoted to the board as finance director. Starmin did not have a finance director as such previously. Of Parkinson, Raschid Abdullah calls him 'quite an able businessman. We don't want figureheads just to make the Christmas tree look good'. Parkinson was a non-executive director of Tarmac and the family business he ran before entering politics was in the building sector; he is also a qualified accountant. 'I have known Cecil for five or six years,' adds Abdullah, apparently not put off by the fact that the introduction was made by Roy Kettle, once at Tarmac, who took over as chief executive of Evered when the brothers were ousted.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Review of building contracts proposed THE GOVERNMENT has proposed an independent review of contract arrangements in the construction industry after complaints that late payments and other contract abuses are forcing many companies out of business. The review would also examine customers' complaints that many contractors bid low prices to win contracts and then try to boost margins by claiming additional payments during construction. A letter to industry leaders from the construction policy directorate of the Department of the Environment says there is profound dissatisfaction with existing arrangements. It proposes an independent review of contractual arrangements, jointly commissioned by government and the industry. The review, which would cover public and private sector construction contracts, would be expected to report next autumn. It would cost about Pounds 250,000 and would be financed jointly. The proposal follows complaints that many small and medium-sized sub-contractors have got into difficulties because main contractors have delayed payments. The British Constructional Steelwork Association says more than 100 of its members and their subsidiaries have ceased trading since 1989. It says main contractors have been boosting their cashflows by withholding payments to sub-contractors, in some cases for several years. The association identifies three main areas of contract abuse: Late repayment of retention money, held back by developers and main contractors as insurance against defects emerging after work was completed. Delays in certifying that work has been completed correctly which would enable bills to be paid promptly. Querying bills in the knowledge that sub-contractors will accept a lower payment rather than risk long delays and potentially high legal costs pursuing extra money. Money retained against potential defects, normally worth between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of the contract value, should be repaid a year after legal completion of work, according to the association. 'One of our members had to wait five years for repayment because of a dispute over what constituted legal completion,' it said. The Environment Department said yesterday that there was deep concern about the adversarial nature of contract relationships in the construction industry. The review would be the first commissioned by the government since the publication 30 years ago of the Branwell Report into construction contract practices.

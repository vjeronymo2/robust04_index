			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article: "This `Bandar' Is Like That `Fahd' and Both Are </F> Soaked in Agentry" -- signed "AL-THAWRAH"]    [Text] If "Uncle" Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz's conspiratorial  stands against the nation and its aspirations for unity and  awakening are exposed and known to have been plotted by the  United States, which brought his family to power in  implementation of a spiteful plan against all the Arabs, the  stands of the nephew, Bandar Bin-Sultan, are similar to the  dirty stands of the uncle, and they are all directed against  will of the Arab nation.    The moment you mention Bandar, Arabs and non-Arabs will  immediately tell you that he is a protege of the U.S.  administration and the carrier of the purse of bribes, which he  uses to buy the consciences of government departments and  institutions that influence U.S. decisionmaking and harm the  Arabs and their interests. It is well-known that Bandar was the  link between his uncle's policy and Bush's move to create the  atmosphere that paved the way for the 30-state aggression  against our people. Whoever did not submit to the pressure of  the U.S. administration received his share from the purse of the  illicit funds that were set aside for such instigation and evil  purposes and killing the honorable sons of the Arab nation.    Bandar was behind all the arms deals that Saudi Arabia had  to  make, although it had no practical or real defense need for  them. He is an active commission agent who managed to clinch  those very costly arms deals, which depleted the Saudi treasury  for no reason other than showing loyalty to his overlords by  paying off the bills of the aggression against Iraq.    Whoever follows Bandar's moves will discover that he is an  obedient servant who has personally volunteered to call for the  normalization of relations with the Zionist entity and to  publicize the idea of ending the Arab boycott of Western states  that deal with that racist regime at a time when scores of  martyrs from the sons of our Palestinian people continue to  sacrifice their pure blood in defense of their Palestinian soil.    In harmony with the conspiratorial role assumed by the  regime  of his uncle, who is known for his grudge against everything  that represents goodness on the Arab land, Bandar is presently  working hard on a new conspiratorial move. This one is against  Yemeni unity by seeking justifications for the UN Security  Council interference in Yemen's internal affairs in favor of the  separatist clique led by the renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid and in  continuation of Saudi Arabia's policy which, since the  establishment of Yemeni unity, has been backing the separatists  and providing them with funds and arms bought from Washington in  fulfillment of a conspiratorial aim against the aspirations of  the Yemeni people, who adhere to legitimacy and unity and its  great achievements and to the democratic experiment that was  strengthened under unity.    By his new cheap conspiratorial moves, Bandar only reveals  his true mettle. For, he is not only following in the footsteps  of his uncle and father, but also in the footsteps of those who  run Washington's brothels. For he is known to be the man of its  red nights, as was his "Uncle" Fahd before that when he was its  captive and was being prepared for today's tasks.    Whoever is soaked in agentry cannot but drip vileness,  meanness, and grudge and stand in the rank of the enemies of the  nation. This "Bandar" is like that "Fahd."</p>

The political analyst added that according to another poll  held in December, 41 percent of the electorate would vote for  Luis Donaldo Colosio, 20 percent for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and  only 11 percent for Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. Nevertheless,  he said these results were not published and now none of the  political parties that support these candidates (PRI,  Institutional Revolutionary Party; PRD, Party of the Democratic  Revolution; and PAN, National Action Party, respectively) want  any further polls.    He explained that the reasons for this are that the PRI's  Colosio has sold the idea that he has a 65-70 percent backing,  the PRD bases its campaign on an alleged democratic switch that  has not taken place so far, and PAN does not want to admit that  its rapprochement with the government has cost the party about  eight popularity points.    Reyes Heroles, who inaugurated a cycle of conferences  programmed by Monterrey's Institute of Technology and Higher  Studies, which includes the participation of all presidential  candidates, said that for some people it seems surprising that  61 percent of the population backs in one way or another the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), but this can be  explained when one takes into account that the government itself  cultivated a cult for Emiliano Zapata and the Mexican revolution.</p>

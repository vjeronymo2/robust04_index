			<p>Manufacturing   Process   <F P=102> 94WS0350A Paris INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES in French 2 Apr 94  p 61 </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0350A </F> <F P=104>  Paris INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Laurence Girard: "How Snecma Is Computerizing </F> Its Methods Engineering Department"]    [Text] Its object is to improve the drawing up,  management, and circulation of technical documentation. All  stages of the engine parts manufacturing process will be  described by the engineers at workstations. These descriptions  will be added to a shared database. In due time, the workers  will consult the workshop instructions on screens.    The Snecma aircraft-engine parts manufacturing "script" is  handwritten by the methods engineering department's 160  engineers. It describes all the operations to be  performed--machining, milling, stamping, etc.--at each stage of  the manufacturing process, and is accompanied by schematics  showing the evolution of the parts. This "movie" will soon be  displayed on workstation screens. At any rate, this is one of  the objectives of the Spirit project that is under way at  Snecma's Corbeil site, which employs 4,400 persons, and whose  main activity is the fabrication of parts and subassemblies for  civil and military aircraft engines.    This project, begun in 1990, is part of the steps being  taken  toward computerizing the methods engineering stages. Of the  three stages involving considerable work by the methods  engineers, the first and the last have already been  computerized. The first consists of defining the major  production steps of a new product line. This takes place prior  to launching the manufacturing process. The second methods  engineering stage converts each production step into workshop  instructions addressed to the shopworkers. The third stage  serves to define the list of tool setups and quality checks that  are indispensable to the carrying out of each instruction. The  major production steps and the tool lists are already available  in the data base mode named Omega. Only the drawing up of the  instructions is still essentially a manual operation.    These instructions represent a considerable volume of paper.  Suffice it to imagine: Snecma's Corbeil site holds the reference  documentation on 8,000 parts. This represents 8,000  manufacturing operations. And each operation can represent as  many as 15 workshop instructions, each of which entails several  pages of description. In all, a stack of over 500,000 pages! To  boot, this documentation must be kept for some 30-odd years.  "This keeping and updating of documents was being done very  poorly," says Jean-Pierre Chavanon, who heads the Spirit  project, the main objectives of which are to improve the  traceability of the documents, reduce the cycles involved in the  creating of production data, and avoid the problem of retrieval  of documents.    For the moment, it is yet too early to know if these  objectives will be fully attained. The project is still in  midstream. After having "polished up" the document display  formats so as to rule out deviations stemming from personalized  touches, 1991 was the year of technical choices. Since two  thirds of the documents consist of drawings, and one third of  text, a tool had to be found to manipulate both. "We did not  want to produce sophisticated documentation, but simply  technical files. We had before us CAP (computer-assisted  production) tools oriented mainly toward text and display, and  CAD (computer-aided design) tools oriented more toward  drafting." Finally, Jean-Pierre Chavanon chose CimLinc, a  composite tool distributed in France by Intelligent Document. It  provides CAP and CAD capabilities simultaneously. The  application, based on CimLinc, is being developed in-house. "We  are designing it, to the extent possible, with the engineers who  will be using it, and we are trying to preserve their working  methods," says Jean-Pierre Chavanon. Since the middle of last  year, some 20 workstations have been installed, and 60 persons  trained. By the end of next year, 60 workstations are expected  to be available.    Spirit calls for each engineer to be equipped with a Sun  workstation. He will retrieve the drawings created previously  with Catia software, detail them, and annotate them. The  structure of the document will be automatically updated. He will  then draw up the workshop instructions, remarks, etc. These  instruction documents are not drafted in a single go. Several  persons lend a hand. Some methods engineers are generalists;  they are responsible for the part as a whole. But they call upon  specialists--welding specialists, for example, specialists in  surface treatment, and all other techniques--to fine-tune the  document. As of now, these documents, on paper, circulate  hand-to-hand among the engineers, with all the problems of  updating and the responsibilities this procedure entails. With  Spirit, each person, working at his or her workstation, will  have access at all times to the document, which will be stored  in the shared database. All modifications will be recorded  together with the name of the specialist who has made the  modification.    New manufacturing operations are already being carried out  with this new system. The database will be added to  progressively. Whatever is on paper will stay on paper, of  course. The paper files and the division storerooms, which have  the job of duplicating the documents and distributing them  within the workshop, will still be around for some time to come,  although the idea for the time being is to short-circuit the  division storerooms progressively by distributing the documents  that are still in paper form directly to the manufacturing  stations. Under the new system, each shopworker will make a  printout of the documents that are of interest to him or her,  and in due time will perhaps access the screen directly for  workshop instructions. This second phase of the project has been  taken in hand by Snecma's Gennevilliers site. A natural course  of events, given that Gennevilliers has decided to adopt what  has already been achieved at the Corbeil site. There is no point  in duplicating studies at a time when the aeronautical market is  hurting badly. And the more so considering that the project as a  whole is costing around 9 million French francs [Fr].  <H5>  Snecma: 13,800 Persons, 6 Main Sites </H5>   Snecma's 1991 revenue totaled Fr14.5 billion, approximately  80 percent of which was generated by exports. Its 13,800  employees are distributed over six main sites. Its Gennevilliers  site manufactures forged and cast parts. Its Evry-Corbeil  center, equipped with 1,500 machines, manufactures civil and  military aircraft engine parts and subassemblies. New engines  are designed and tested at the Melun-Villaroche site. Snecma's  highly automated Creusot plant produces the turbine disks.  Elecma Suresnes houses Snecma's electronics division. And  Snecma's Istres site is its flight test center.</p>

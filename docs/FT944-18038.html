			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Watts Blake seeks German buys - Last year's figures restated to take account of errors at United Clays Watts Blake Bearne &amp; Co yesterday outlined details of a acquisition strategy designed to strengthen its position as the world's largest producer of specialist clays. The Devon-based company, which mines ball and china clays for ceramic manufacturers, said it was discussing possible takeovers with a number of competitors in Germany, its largest market. Although talks are at an early stage, the group is keen to exploit the dominance of Fuchs-Ton, its German subsidiary, which already extracts 1.2m tonnes of clay a year. Mr John Pike, managing director, said the moves had been backed by Sibelco, the privately-owned Belgian company, which has a 47.6 per cent shareholding and last year mounted a hostile takeover bid for the group. 'An acquisition would help us reduce competition and strengthen our market position in Germany,' he said. Mr Pike declined to reveal the total gains at Fuchs-Ton, but he admitted that aggressive price competition had sliced Pounds 400,000 off the division's half year profits. Trading was affected by the strength of the D-Mark. Nevertheless, rising UK sales and exports outside Europe helped lift pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.13m in the six months to June 30, against Pounds 4.14m. The improvement was flattered by Pounds 475,000 of exceptional items last time incurred fighting Sibelco's now lapsed takeover bid and the downward restatement of last year's results to take account of 'serious accounting errors' at United Clays, the US subsidiary. Last year's interim profits were reduced by Pounds 118,000 and the full year figures by Pounds 235,000 to Pounds 7.71m. The division's chief financial officer has been replaced. The group improvement was underpinned by increased profits at Devon Clays, the largest division, which saw sales rise from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 20.8m, accounting for half the group total of Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 39.3m). In the US sales volumes improved with higher sales to Mexico offsetting lower figures to the US and Canada. Earnings per share rose from 12.2p to 16p and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.9p (3.5p). COMMENT If Watts is looking for short term gains, it had better think again about Germany. Some of Fuchs-Ton's rivals may be willing to sell, but in a sluggish market the rewards will be a long time coming. Questions also remain over Sibelco's role in such a deal. The Belgians are close to majority control and are unlikely to back a dilutive acquisition. However, the modest 9 per cent gearing gives it room for manoeuvre and improvements at Devon Clays should lift full year profits to about Pounds 9.7m. The shares, which closed up 3p at 545p, look pricey on a forward multiple of 18, although they offer safer long-term value.</p>

Of the 416 congressmen who were present at the session,  328 of them voted against this recommendation and 84 voted in  favor, while four others abstained from voting.    Congress approved, in a second round of voting, an amendment  that allows Brazilians to have dual nationality, thus modifying  article 12 of the 1988 Constitution. Deputy Jobim believes this  amendment "modernizes" the law. The measure abolishes the  bureaucratic requirements to recognize the Brazilian nationality  of those who are born abroad of Brazilian fathers and mothers.    The amendment made three changes to the original text,  Chapter 3 of the Constitution, about nationality. The first  change is that it is no longer necessary to register a child  born abroad from a Brazilian father and mother in a Brazilian  consulate or embassy in order to later obtain Brazilian  nationality.    The other change was to reduce from 30 to 15 years the time  of residence in Brazil required by a foreigner to obtain  Brazilian nationality. Another change was in the provision that  regulates the loss of Brazilian nationality. The amendment  approved yesterday allows Brazilians to obtain another  nationality when "the foreign law acknowledges the original  nationality of the individual" and when "a foreign country  imposes the naturalization of the individual as a condition to  continue living in its territory or to exert his civilian  rights."</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Garofano admits funding ruling party MR Giuseppe Garofano, the former senior executive of the troubled Ferruzzi group, has admitted that Italy's second largest industrial empire was illicitly funding the Christian Democrat party. The revelation emerged after he had been interrogated by Milan magistrates for more than 13 hours over the weekend. The interrogations followed an exceptionally swift deal between Milan magistrates and Swiss judicial authorities following Mr Garofano's arrest at Geneva airport on Tuesday after being on the run for six months. The return of Mr Garofano, who stepped down as chairman of Montedison, Ferruzzi's chemicals group, in November 1992, promises to shed light on how the Ferruzzi empire has managed to accumulate debts of L31,000bn (Pounds 13bn). The debts plus heavy losses forced a consortium of banks to step in last month to salvage the group. Among Mr Garofano's first admissions was that L250m had been paid to the Christian Democrat party in Lombardy from Ferruzzi-Montedison funds. Last September, when questioned by Milan magistrates, he had said this money had come from his own sources. It was on the charge of having provided this sum in illicit funding to the party that his arrest warrant was issued. Milan magistrates believe the L250m represented only a small part of wider illicit funding. For more than six months the magistrates have been examining the dealings behind the reorganisation of the chemicals industry and Montedison's sale of its 40 per cent stake in Enimont to ENI, the state oil concern. Mr Garofano is understood to know about this transaction, as well as others involving Enimont minority shareholders. Mr Garofano is due to be questioned again tomorrow.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 15 Ordibehesht [5 May] IRNA -- The Foreign  Exchange Market Regulating Committee, chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the republic, met and made new  decisions about controlling the foreign exchange rate and the  fight against brokers.    The public relations office of the office of the president  of  the republic reports that at this meeting the report on the  latest changes having to do with solving the problem of Iran's  suspended debts and the successes achieved was given to the  president of the republic. In view of the nation's foreign  exchange reserves, the decision was made that to fight the  corruption of the brokers in the foreign exchange market and to  stabilize the foreign exchange rate, in addition to providing  foreign exchange for goods that are obtained at the Foreign  Exchange Bank's official rate, the banking system is also  required to provide at a rate 50 rials [R] below the free market  rate the foreign exchange needed by importers who have  registered or are registering at the Ministry of Commerce to  import in exchange for exports.    Likewise, the banking system will buy foreign exchange  obtained from exports at the same rate, should the exporters so  desire.    Following the decisions made at the meeting of the Foreign  Exchange Market Regulation Committee, a statement was issued by  the Central Bank.    According to this statement, all importers of goods who have  obtained authorization to import in exchange for exports by  registering orders at the Ministry of Commerce may go to a  foreign exchange branch of the nation's commercial banks and  submit their request to demand a draft or to open a confirmed  letter of credit in the interest of the sellers.    When the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran  receives the requests and their statistical registration, it  will sell foreign exchange from the nation's banking system at  R50 less than the going rates and will issue a draft or open a  letter of credit. The rate of the foreign exchange for opening a  confirmed letter of credit through the nation's banking system  will remain fixed until the time of the exchange of shipping  documents on the goods, and there will be no risk of foreign  exchange rate fluctuations to the importers between the date of  the opening of the letter of credit and the date of the exchange  of the shipping documents for the goods.    The above procedures are exclusively for imports in exchange  for exports, and for other groups of goods the banks are  required as before to allocate foreign exchange at the R1,750  rate.    This statement was issued as a guideline to all banks and  the  banks are required to obtain the documents from applicants and  to take the necessary steps.    The decision by the Foreign Exchange Market Regulation  Committee was also presented to the Council of Ministers and it  was decided that if any government institution or institution  affiliated with the government goes to the free market to obtain  foreign exchange, this will be regarded as illegal and the  managers involved will be prosecuted.    Likewise, any kind of negligence or failure to perform by  the  banks during the process of allocating the foreign exchange will  be regarded as cooperation with people who are undermining the  nation's foreign exchange system.    Based on a decision by the Council of Ministers, all the  managers of the foreign exchange branches of the commercial  banks are required to expedite foreign exchange allocations, and  government institutions and companies are forbidden from  entering the free market for foreign exchange.  <H5>  Nonbank Credit Institutions </H5>   At the meeting of the Council of Ministers a report was also  presented by the chief of the Central Bank on how to create  nonbank credit institutions and the regulations appropriate for  them.    This report announced that the goal in creating these kinds  of institutions is to complete the organization of the nation's  financial system to make it more competent and to provide  resources and allocate them for investment in various sectors.</p>

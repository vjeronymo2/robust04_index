The gathering is the second of its kind, with the first held  in Tokyo last year, and is sponsored by the Foreign Ministry.  The idea was proposed by former Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi  Miyazawa and is expected to become an annual event. The aim of  the gathering is to establish future-oriented relationships  among four nations that were less than friendly during the Cold  War era.    Participants will tour the National Assembly, the ancient  Korean capital city of Kyongju, the truce village of Panmunjom  and industrial sites. They will stay two nights at private  homes to get acquainted with South Korean customs.</p>

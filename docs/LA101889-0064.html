			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCK MARKET STEADIES AFTER A JITTERY START  </P> <P> After worse-than-expected U.S. trade deficit figures set the stock market off  to a jittery start Tuesday, stock prices firmed in relatively quiet trading,  raising hopes that the markets are beginning to stabilize in the aftermath of  Friday's 190-point drop.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 18.65 points at 2,638.73,  following an 88-point rise on Monday. The Dow index briefly dropped more than  60 points early Tuesday after the Commerce Department disclosed that the U.S.  merchandise trade deficit had widened sharply to $10.77 billion in August, over  $1 billion more than many economists had predicted.  </P> <P> But with the sometimes erratic help of computer-driven program trading, the  market recovered much of the lost ground and traded in a relatively narrow  range throughout the afternoon in New York. Volume on the New York Stock  Exchange was 224.07 million shares, slightly more than half the extraordinarily  heavy 416.29 million shares that changed hands Monday.  </P> <P> "I do think things are calming down," said Jack Conlon, who is in charge of  U.S. stock trading for Nikko Securities International in New York. Referring to  Tuesday's 18.65-point decline, he said that "after the rally that we had  Monday, you were bound to get some kind of correction."  </P> <P> Technical analysts and investment strategists cautioned, however, that despite  the ebbing fears of a crash, the markets remain fairly volatile. "This was  still an emotional day, with plenty of ups and downs," said John Connolly,  chief investment strategist for the brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds. "You  can't really say we're stable yet."  </P> <P> Many predicted that in the coming weeks the Dow index will drop to or below its  low of 2,569 on Friday before resuming any sustained rise. "We had a big down  and a big up," said Brad Weeks, a senior vice president in the stock trading  department of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities. "Now we have to go  back down and test to see if the lows of the market (on Friday) are really the  floor."  </P> <P> Traders predicted that one longer-term consequence of Friday's panicky drop  will be to keep individual investors away from the stock market. They said it  has reinforced small investors' fears of devastating price swings that began  with the 508-point crash on Oct. 19, 1987. And they predicted that once the  dust settles from the events of the last few days, stock market volume will  drop back to the low levels of recent months that have made trading barely  profitable for many brokerage firms.  </P> <P> A seat on the New York Stock Exchange was sold Tuesday for $436,000, the lowest  price in four years. The price is considered an indication of profit  expectations in the brokerage business.  </P> <P> In the shorter term, blue-chip stocks are expected to outperform more thinly  traded issues as small investors stay on the sidelines and institutions  concentrate on "quality" stocks. "Until the volatility subsides, trading is  going to be dominated by institutions, and therefore blue chips will dominate  the trading," said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery  Scott in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> In Tuesday's trading, the steep drop in NYSE stock prices early in the day was  led by airline shares, which have been hit hard since Friday's news that an  investor group that made a $6.75-billion bid to take over UAL Corp., parent  company of United Airlines, had failed to obtain financing.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 20 transportation stocks closed the day down 49.96  points, at 1,254.27, following a 102-point loss on Monday.  </P> <P> News reports early Tuesday that bankers weren't coming to terms on loans to  back a revised offer for UAL led to a trading halt in the stock because of an  "order imbalance" -- far more sellers than buyers. UAL's stock later resumed  trading and ended the day at $198, down $24.875. The stock had dropped $56 on  Monday.  </P> <P> The UAL deal has been viewed by takeover speculators as an indicator of whether  takeover deals in general are in trouble because of growing reluctance by banks  and buyers of high-yield junk bonds to provide financing.  </P> <P> The stock of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, continued to suffer  from Monday's announcement that real estate developer Donald J. Trump had  withdrawn a $120-a-share offer for the company. The stock slid $3.75 a share on  Tuesday to close at $73.25 after a fall of $22.125 on Monday.  </P> <P> Traders said continued action by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday to assure  liquidity in the nation's financial system helped to steady investors' nerves.  The Fed pumped $1.5 billion into the banking system to boost commercial banks'  cash reserves and demonstrate the Fed's resolve to make sure that banks have  enough cash on hand to meet the borrowing needs of Wall Street firms. The Fed  on Monday had added $2 billion to the banks' reserves. Market analysts said  investors also were acting on the belief that the Fed may move soon to lower  interest rates.  </P> <P> On the NYSE, declining stocks outnumbered rising issues by about 7 to 5, with  931 down and 658 up. The NYSE's composite index of all stocks listed on the  exchange dropped 0.87 to 188.89.  </P> <P> Officials at several large mutual fund concerns said Tuesday that the level of  customer calls was gradually returning to normal. Tracy Gordon, a spokeswoman  for Fidelity Investments in Boston, the nation's largest mutual fund group,  said the volume of calls from customers declined by about one-third from  Monday's level, adding that there were signs of increased interest by investors  in stock funds.  </P> <P> Investment strategists and market analysts were divided Tuesday on the  longer-term outlook for the market. Many noted an apparent slowdown in the  economy and said the market may remain relatively depressed for the rest of the  year, in part because many companies are now expected to report relatively weak  third-quarter earnings. Others, however, said a softening economy in turn would  lead to a significant lowering of interest rates by the Fed, which in turn  could drive stock prices significantly higher.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: D1-2  </P></p>

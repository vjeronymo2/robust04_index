Work on the single-storey 165,000 sg ft building, Ikea's fourth in the UK, is scheduled to begin in May and will be opened early in summer 1992. The site covers 15 acres and occupies one of the last remaining development plots within the Metro Centre alongside the A1. The steel-framed building will incorporate a showroom, a 226-seater restaurant, a marketplace for loose household items, customer warehousing for self-selection of flat-pack items, general warehousing and office facilities. Car parking for 1,100 vehicles will be provided. The site is a reclaimed coal stock-holding and grading yard and a feature of the construction project will be the extensive foundation works. Ballast Nedam anticipates the contract being let in about 16 works packages, the first tenders for which have already been issued. At peak periods some 350 people will be working on site.

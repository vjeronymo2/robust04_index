			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Russians hold three men over plutonium smuggling Anxiety about nuclear material being smuggled out of the former Soviet Union grew yesterday when Russian police confirmed they had arrested three men trying to sell a quantity of plutonium for Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in the Baltic port of Kaliningrad last week. The police admission, which follows heated denials from Moscow that plutonium allegedly found in Germany last week and earlier this year was from Russia, coincided with efforts in Bonn to defuse speculation about an impending clash with Moscow over plutonium smuggling. Although there has been only one reported find of what could accurately be described as weapons-grade plutonium in Germany - around 5 grammes seized more than three months ago - last week's highly publicised police action at Munich airport sparked widespread criticism of Russian security. But Mr Friedrich Bohl, minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office, said yesterday there was no way the latest scare, sparked by three arrests and the capture of nuclear material at Munich airport last week, would lead to a crisis in relations between the two capitals, Smoothing the way for the arrival in Moscow this weekend of a delegation of nuclear experts led by Mr Bernd Schmidbauer - Mr Kohl's security adviser - Mr Bohl said the two sides were already negotiating possible co-operation agreements. Moscow had already basically agreed that German experts might be allowed to work jointly with Russian specialists to check security measures in a Russian nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, he said. But the arrests in Kaliningrad will heighten fears that criminal gangs have gained access to nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union despite persistent denials from Russian officials that any of their weapons-grade plutonium has gone missing. The three men are all Kaliningrad residents. In Brussels, the European Union's atomic energy authority, Euratom, said tests had confirmed that plutonium seized in Germany over the past four months had definitely been manufactured in Russia. Mr Schmidbauer and a team of nuclear experts will arrive in Moscow tomorrow for a two-day visit to discuss the plutonium finds with the Russians. The Munich find last week is understood to have been part of a fuel rod, used, from a nuclear power station or reactor. Used fuel rods can contain plutonium 239 used in weapons but extracting it requires reprocessing. Even then, the amount of weapons grade plutonium would depend on the amount of time the fuel rod had been in use - the longer it had been used, the less usable plutonium would be available. In addition, fuel rods are more difficult to transport than reprocessed plutonium. According to senior German government officials, some ill-informed media and ill-advised officials 'who do not understand the nature of our relations' were to blame for inflaming tempers and sparking angry rebuttals from the Russian capital.

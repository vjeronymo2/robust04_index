			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Rheumatoid arthritis drug from Celltech Shares in Celltech rose 5p to 214p yesterday after the biotechnology company claimed it had made a breakthrough in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The group, which floated last year, said phase two clinical studies using its new anti-arthritis drug - CDP571 - had shown 'considerable improvements' in the symptoms suffered by patients. 'The drug has all the anti-inflammatory benefits of steroid treatment with none of the side-effects,' said Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive. If further trials prove successful, the company aims to sell the drug for use in the treatment of up to 1m rheumatoid arthritis sufferers in the UK and US. The treatment would cost 'several thousand dollars a year for each patient', Mr Fellner added. Although a similar drug is being developed by Centocor, the US biotechnology company, Celltech said it could rely on strong patents to protect its product. The patents are held jointly with Bayer, its German marketing and R&amp;D partner.</p>

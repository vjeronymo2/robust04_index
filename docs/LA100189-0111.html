			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO. 3 CORNHUSKERS DEFEAT OREGON STATE  </P> <P> Oregon State lost to third-ranked Nebraska, 35-7, Saturday in a game that was  closer than the score indicates.  </P> <P> The Beavers trailed, 21-7, after Pat Chaffey scored on a two-yard run with 2:10  left in the third quarter, and if it hadn't been for three Oregon State  turnovers, it could have been close to the finish.  </P> <P> Nebraska scored after all three turnovers.  </P> <P> Nebraska, ranked second nationally in rushing with an average of 394 yards per  game, managed only 193 yards through three quarters. Nebraska finished with 278  yards.  </P> <P> Quarterback Gerry Gdowski ran for one touchdown and passed for another to lead  the Cornhuskers (4-0) over the Beavers (2-2).  </P> <P> Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne sounded as if his team had lost. "Hang with us,  don't give up on us," he said. "We're going to get better."  </P> <P> Gdowski ran seven yards for Nebraska's first score as he capped the opening  42-yard drive.  </P> <P> Bryan Carpenter added an eight-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter  after a fumble recovery by Nebraska's Mike Petko at the Oregon State 35.  </P> <P> Bruce Pickens intercepted a pass by Nick Schichtle to end an Oregon State drive  in the third quarter. Nebraska's Richard Bell then went 48 yards to help set up  a two-yard touchdown run by Ken Clark to give the Cornhuskers a 21-0 lead.  </P> <P> Chaffey's touchdown came after Schichtle threw 39 yards to Maurice Wilson and  had 16-yard completions to Jason Kent and Phil Ross.  </P> <P> Gdowski then found Jon Bostick on a 60-yard touchdown pass play just over a  minute after Husker safety Reggie Cooper intercepted another pass by Schichtle.  </P> <P> Sophomore quarterback Mike Grant added another Nebraska touchdown when he  passed nine yards to Mark Dowse with 4:34 to play.  </P></p>

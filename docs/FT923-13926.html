			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian crop estimate raises bread price fears EARLY FORECASTS suggest that the Russian harvest this year wil reach 98m tonnes - 8m tonnes higher than last year's poor harvest, but about 10m tonnes down on initial estimates made during the spring sewing campaign. At the same time, the republic's government is now expressing serious worries about the prospects for an increase in the price of bread, both because of the much higher prices already being demanded by farms for grain deliveries and because the price of imported grain to the purchasers will increase by some five times because of the abolition of state import subsidies, which set an artificially high exchange rate for imports of 20 roubles to the dollar. The price of a loaf of bread, which was less than one rouble only last year, has already increased more than tenfold. However, it is now generally accepted in government circles that further sharp price increases must be avoided - especially for bread, which is even more than ever an indispensable part of the diet for poor and even average families. Mr Victor Khlystun, the Russian agricultural minister, told a conference of local authority leaders on Wednesday that the 98m tonnes expected was down on the 104m to 108m tonnes originally forecast. He also said that that the harvest of potatoes, Russia's other staple food alongside bread, would also be down from last year's level. But he gave no figures for potato production. The government and the state farms, which still command the repiublic's agricultural sector, are now engaged in a prolonged wrangle over prices of grain. The Interfax news agency reported yesterday that producers are demanding wheat prices ranging between Rbs13,000 and 20,000 a tonne; the Russian Pricing Committee is proposing Rbs6,800 a tonne; and the agriculture ministry is trying to compromise on Rbs10,000 a tonne. The government is anxious to conclude contracts with the farms soon, in order to avoid being forced to pay higher prices - and it intends to use part of the Dollars 1bn tranche the International Monetary Fund has agreed to given to Russia for this purpose. However, preliminary contracts with farms cover only 24.5m tonnes of grain, and no prices have yet been agreed. Last year the farms managed to withhold deliveries until the last moment, thus forcing up the price to the state. This year, however, the farmers' shortage of cash, the high inflation rate and the severe problems experienced in buying fodder for livestock are expected to force a number of farms to conclude early contracts. The price of bread, at presently about 10 roubles a loaf, will at least double even if the government can keep the price down to about Rbs10,000 a tonne. Imported grain, which might make up between a quarter and a third of all requirements, will now be priced to the purchasers at the full market rate of the rouble, at present over Rbs130 to the US dollar. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, told the local authorities' conference on Wednesday that the state budget would again have to subsidise the price of imported grain, if a loaf of bread priced at Rbs60 was to be avoided. The Russian government has earmarked Rbs130m to finance the dispatch of troops to help collect the grain harvest, according to the official Itar Tass news agency. General Alexander Rutskoi, the republic's vice president, said on Central television on Wednesday that Russia would be forced to 'beg again round the word and collect humanitarian aid' unless all efforts were concentrated on getting in the harvest this year.</p>

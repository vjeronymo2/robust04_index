			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Russian industry may get more help SENIOR officials of Russia's central bank yesterday made clear their intention to strengthen policies designed to prop up ailing state industries. They said they were considering lowering the 80 per cent interest rate charged by commercial banks. They also said they could reintroduce subsidies paid by the state on imports of key products. Mr Valerian Kulikov, the central bank's first deputy chairman, said the move would reflect the willingness of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, to accommodate the pressures for support from the state industry bosses. This was made clear at the weekend in talks between the two men and leaders of the powerful Union of Industrialists, he adds. The interest rate, at 80 per cent, is thought punishingly high by industrialists - though it still represents a strongly negative rate, given inflation estimated at around 2,000 per cent per annum. Earlier this week, Mr Yeltsin made Mr Victor Gerahchenko, the central bank chairman, a member of his government. The move aims to bring the central bank, which is legally responsible to the parliament, under greater governmental control. However, Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a central bank deputy chairman, said yesterday that while the move would allow for greater co-ordination between the government and the central bank, the latter would remain answerable to parliament first. At the same time, deputies warned yesterday they might move to suspend all licences allowing foreign banks to hold accounts for Russian citizens. Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the budget committee, said that the law would 'stop the capital flight from Russia'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitutional Court has  decided at today's session to revoke the declaration issued in  Livno on 24 August 1993 on the formation of the so-called  Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. The Constitutional Court  believes that this decision is not in accordance with the  Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as -- in an  unconstitutional way -- it represents an attempt to create on a  part of the state territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina a new form of  social-political community with the basic symbols of a state and  legal entity. This violates in the strongest of ways the  constitutional organization, the sovereignty, the unity, and the  inviolability of the territory of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as an internationally recognized country.  This is issued in a statement by the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Constitutional Court.</p>

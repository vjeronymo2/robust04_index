			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons to hold debate on Maxwell LABOUR is to call a full-scale Commons debate on the Maxwell pensioners next week, in the first opportunity it has had in this parliament to choose the specific subject for discussion by MPs. The move, which will be announced today comes after ministers again faced pressure yesterday from both Tory and opposition MPs to provide an opportunity for the plight of the pensioners to be raised at Westminster. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, will open the debate on Tuesday, which is expected to concentrate on the need for compensation for the Maxwell pensioners. Depending on how the motion for debate is drafted, even Tory MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners might find it difficult to vote against it. Last night's meeting of the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners re-emphasised the urgency of the plight of the pensioners. The group's officers are to appeal to its 100-plus members to press ministers at questions in the Commons today about when the government expects to publish the report by the Securities and Investments Board into the oversight by the Investment Managers' Regulatory Organisation (Imro) of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the fund management company owned by Robert Maxwell which managed the assets of his company pension funds. The report is regarded as being critical to the pensioners' efforts to establish that government oversight of BIM was lax, and thus strengthen their claim for government compensation. Imro is the self-regulatory body for the fund-management industry. The SIB is said to be concerned that parts of the report may be deemed libellous and is said to have been told by its solicitors that its charter may not exempt it from libel actions. MPs agreed that to try to avoid this problem, they would press the government to publish the report as a House of Commons paper, so that the specific approval of the Commons would then be needed before it could be used in any legal action. The group yesterday wrote to to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, requesting a meeting, and will be writing to the main banks in support of the appeals that have already come from the Maxwell pensioners themselves. Mr Frank Field and Mr Richard Page, the group's co-chairmen, said that the real focus of the discussion was the urgency of the pensioners' plight, and the inadequacy of the state-support system to cover pensioners' immediate needs. The group is to step up its pressure on the government to set up a 'drip-feed' if necessary to prevent any more pension funds becoming unable to pay pensions from the end of this month. The House of Lords is to debate the position of the Maxwell pensioners today, but the junior minister replying is unlikely to be able to pre-empt the announcement from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, about a review of pension law and regulation. The announcement of the review, broadly as recommended by the cross-party social security committee in the last parliament, is expected next week, and may coincide with the mass lobby of Westminster by Maxwell pensioners planned for Monday.</p>

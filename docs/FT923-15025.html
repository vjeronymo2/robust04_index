			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The troubles of the G7 IN THE kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. It is only by comparison with Boris Yeltsin, the proud beggar whom they will meet next Wednesday, that the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries seem kingly. By most other standards their state is much reduced. US president George Bush, leader of the 'sole remaining superpower' must wonder whe-ther he will even be at the next summit. Last year's victor over Saddam Hussein is reduced to hoping, against reasonable hope, that the Germans and Japanese will do enough to help the Federal Reserve purchase the votes of the American electorate. After the jump in the unemployment rate to 7.8 per cent last month, hopes are less bright. The response of the Federal Reserve, another half a percentage point cut in short term US interest rates, is unlikely to make a timely difference. Mr Bush will not find rescue abroad. Mr Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, is still more enfeebled than Mr Bush. The Japanese stock market has declined by 60 per cent from its peak, the economy has slowed sharply and sluggish growth means that the controversial current account surplus is likely to be close to Dollars 100bn (Pounds 52.3bn) this year. All Mr Miyazawa could do is arrive with a carefully packaged fiscal initiative of Y7,000bn (Pounds 29bn) to Y8,000bn for later this year. At around 2 per cent of gross domestic product, the boost seems substantial, but there is less new stimulus than meets the eye. Even if not too little, for Mr Bush the package comes far too late. Germany will be no more helpful. The German federal government this week announced a tight budget for 1993, along with a plan for limiting the increase in its spending over the next four years to 2 1/2 per cent a year in money terms. But the implied promise of steadily falling public spending in real terms is barely credible. The German government hopes its budget will open the way to lower interest rates. But Mr Waigel, the German finance minister, can only propose; the Bundesbank disposes. Wage increases Yesterday, Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, pointed discouragingly to excessive German wage increases and the rapid growth of D-Mark M3, the broad money aggregate that the German central bank targets. Monetary growth must first fall, he insisted, if interest rates are to be cut. The other European leaders can only hope that the US succeeds in persuading the Germans to relax monetary policy. Their chances are poor. If German interest rates do not fall quite soon, however, the malady of the Italians is likely to become critical, that of the British chronic. What a fall from grace this has been for those who appeared only two years ago to be masters of the universe. The world economy is struggling in the toils of private sector debt deflation. The European economy is struggling in the toils of German unification. The UK, with that astuteness for which it has long been noted, is struggling with both: German interest rates and American indebtedness, a combination to sadden the heart of chancellor Norman Lamont. Structural deterioration When the world runs out of creditworthy private borrowers, it makes sense for the public sector to put itself forward. Over the last three years, public sectors have certainly not been backward in coming forward. But one can have too much of a good thing. According to last week's OECD Economic Outlook, the fiscal stance of every G7 country, bar Canada, has shown either no improvement or a structural deterioration since 1989. In Japan, France, Italy and the US that structural deterioration has been less than 1 per cent of GDP. In the case of Germany, the deterioration of more than 4 per cent of GDP has the good excuse of unification. Once again the UK is the dunce, with a structural deterioration of almost 2 per cent of GDP. With debt deflation making low real interest rates essential and fiscal deterioration helping to keep long term real interest rates up, prospects for strong recovery are modest. Low short term real interest rates are necessary. But not only do they not appear to be enough; in Europe they are not even available. Little then can be expected from the gathering in Munich of weak leaders, presiding over feeble economies. This does not mean that the meeting will be entirely useless. A gesture in the direction of Mr Yeltsin can at least be expected. Unhappily, the leaders of the G7 have built up a reputation for ineffectiveness where they ought to have been effective. Mr Helmut Kohl has said that the summit should increase investor and consumer confidence. As the leaders knew when they met in Houston in 1990 and in London last year, the best way to increase confidence would to ensure agreement in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. If they are unable to deliver on their promises where they are in direct control of the outcome, it would be foolish to expect more on overall economic performance, where they are not.</p>

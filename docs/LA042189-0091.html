			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT ARRESTED IN CATALINA KILLING  </P> <P> A 41-year-old Avalon man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a  34-year-old woman friend in what authorities said was the first homicide on  Santa Catalina Island in decades.  </P> <P> Bruce Edward Kingman was flown Thursday afternoon to Long Beach and then driven  to the Lakewood Sheriff's Station, where he was being held without bail in the  death of the woman, whose name was not released pending notification of  relatives.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said that Kingman telephoned at about 4 a.m. Thursday for  paramedics, who found the woman's body outside a trailer on Pebbly Beach Road.  </P> <P> Kingman said that he and the woman had argued, and that she was injured when  she slipped and fell on a wooden patio, deputies said. Authorities declined to  provide further details.  </P> <P> A former constable on the island and a sheriff's deputy on Catalina said there  has not been a murder case on the resort island since the 1940s. A woman who  shot and killed an intruder in the early 1960s was convicted of involuntary  manslaughter, said Fern Whelan, clerk of the Santa Catalina Justice Court.  </P></p>

Soldiers and gendarmes  were patrolling the city center and virtually no gunshots are  heard any more. According to a source close to the Army, the  clashes with automatic weapons, grenades, and, apparently,  rocket launchers may have left "several dead." The same source  asserts that the attackers whose number was not specified were  on the run and that some of them had headed toward the Ghanaian  border which is contiguous with the [Togolese] capital.</p>

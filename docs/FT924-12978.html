			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Not so much a summit, more a molehill  -Summit Diary WITH subsidiarity the main dish on the summit menu, the prospects of firing the public's rapidly waning enthusiasm for the Maastricht treaty were always slim. Even non-British journalists and delegates showed more interest in Mr John Major's domestic problems than in the agenda of a meeting billed from the outset as only an hors d'oeuvre to the full-scale European summit in Edinburgh at the end of the year. The Birmingham Post, in spite of a laudable attempt to mark a great European occasion by printing its whole front page in French, could not suppress its normal journalistic instincts. 'Assault on the summit,' its headline screamed. 'Confrontation avec les mineurs a Birmingham.' That put things in perspective. Mr Gus O'Donnell, the British prime minister's long-suffering spokesman, set the tone for the discussions on the Community's future by instituting two-speed press briefings: the first, in his capacity as spokesman for the UK presidency, on the discussions in the conference hall, followed immediately by a briefing on the latest breathtaking political and economic developments in Britain. Sympathy was expressed for the British prime minister in his troublesome task of trying to persuade the House of Commons to ratify the Maastricht treaty.

Normally, senior Spanish civil servants prepare a list of thorny issues for their prime minister attending a summit known as 'the minefield'. This time, perhaps because of the unfortunate connotation for Mr Major, they didn't bother. At times, the discussions took on a distinctly fruity flavour. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, always something of a card, presented Mr Major with a Danish 'Ingrid Maria' apple, which apparently does not meet EC export specifications because it is too small. 'An apple a day keeps the Commission away,' he quipped. Meanwhile, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Gonzalez were talking about the Community's classification and denomination of apricots, which prompted one bystander to ask, sotto voce: 'Is Maastricht a lemon?' President Francois Mitterrand of France did not miss much by turning up late for the meeting, as is his custom. And Mr Gonzalez appeared to sum up the mood of the occasion by remarking testily: 'Given that these seats are so uncomfortable, this should be a short meeting.' It was.</p>

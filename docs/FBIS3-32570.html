According to judicial sources, the witnesses had  already testified but their version of the incident is  confusing. It was added that Israel Vasquez, a driver, had said  the Salvadoran bodyguard's death occurred as a result of an  attack by robbers.    National Civilian Police sources indicated U.S. Major Ismael  Lopez shot his bodyguard and killed him, later abandoning him  inside the vehicle. The case has caused a controversy among the  various government agencies because the U.S. military officer  was illegally taken out of the country to Panama.</p>

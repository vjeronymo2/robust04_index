			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Israeli banks' higher profits Two of Israel's top five banks have this week released figures for 1993 that show increased profits over the previous year, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. United Mizrahi Bank yesterday announced 1993 profits totalling Shk135m (Dollars 45.3m), a 9 per cent increase over 1992. Mr Chaim Kubersky, chairman, said the bank was in 'good shape' ahead of the scheduled sell-off of up to 51 per cent of its shares later this year. First International Bank of Israel reported a 37 per cent rise in profits for 1993 compared to 1992, at Shk144m.</p>

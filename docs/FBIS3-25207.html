The measures were introduced after the 5 December  presidential elections. The lifting of these measures has,  nevertheless, been accompanied by a warning to all  trouble-makers. Gabonese Defense Minister Martin-Fidele Magnaga  explained the decision to Assane Diop:    [Being recording] [Magnaga] We saw that public order had  been preserved. The protection of people and property was  guaranteed. I would like to remind you that the curfew was  introduced just after the elections, after the publication of  the results of the presidential elections, because there was a  serious threat of unrest, of violence, of the country spiralling  into civil war.    [Diop] Your announcement today was, nevertheless,  accompanied  by a warning to those threatening public order. Is this mainly  addressed to the political parties who had contested the  validity of the election results?    [Magnaga] No, we issued this warning because we wanted,  above  all, to preserve peace in our country, to protect our citizens.  [end recording]</p>

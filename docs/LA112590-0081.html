			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL FOOD FOR REAL PEOPLE;  </P> <P> PACIFIC DINING CAR'S NEW BRANCH CELEBRATES MID-AMERICAN ABUNDANCE -- AND THAT  MEANS BIG AND MEATY (AND EXPENSIVE) MEALS  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine Santa in a really sunny sky. So even if you were born in  California, come Christmas you start hoping for snow.  </P> <P> Thanksgiving never seems quite Californian either: Pilgrims and palm trees just  don't go together.  </P> <P> This is the time of year when a lot of Californians start leaning toward the  east. If you are among them, you'll be happy to hear that Santa Monica's newest  restaurant makes a person feel as if he has landed in Kansas. It's a true blue,  manly sort of place that celebrates American abundance; it is where big people  eat big food (and pay big prices). If you're tired of eating turkey, but still  feeling like a gastronomic patriot, the new Pacific Dining Car is the perfect  place for you.  </P> <P> The room itself has a comfortingly nondescript air. The dark wood, cozy booths  and old-fashioned lamps erase both space and time: Walk in the door and you  could be anywhere in America, any time in the last century. In a city where new  restaurants strain to look up-to-date, hip and unique, this is a room that asks  only to be ignored. The original Pacific Dining Car is a charming collection of  rooms with the atmosphere that comes with a patina of age. The new Pacific  Dining Car is different: It is comfortable precisely because it doesn't call  attention to itself.  </P> <P> Neither does the menu; you could almost recite it with your eyes closed. There  are steaks. And more steaks. And more meat -- veal, prime rib, pork chops.  There is lobster (taken from a tank, sold by the pound and perfectly cooked).  For people who don't eat meat and won't eat lobster, there are a couple flavors  of fish (generally swordfish and salmon), but I suspect that it is hard to  order them without feeling like a wimp.  </P> <P> Even the meat can make you feel like a wimp; you may be feeling macho as you  order, but the portions are dauntingly gigantic. Watching that hunk of flesh as  it approaches the table can make you want to get up and run. (The most sensible  people I've seen at Pacific Dining Car were a couple smart enough to split a  single meal; they are just about the only people I've seen walk out the door  without a doggie bag.)  </P> <P> Your meat is accompanied by a baked potato, which comes equipped with someone  whose sole mission seems to be walking around the restaurant smothering  innocent spuds in clouds of sour cream. If you don't feel up to this onslaught  of cream and carbohydrates, you could opt for French fries, sliced tomatoes  (but why would you?), rice pilaf (the favorite of those fish-eating wimps),  cottage cheese (ditto), or very good cole slaw.  </P> <P> There will also be a token vegetable on the plate: One night it was spinach, as  dark and thick as a swamp with a strong back note of nutmeg. Another night it  was watery zucchini in tomato sauce, which made me realize that the spinach at  least had the virtue of keeping to itself; these vegetables insisted on running  all over the plate.  </P> <P> The meat is good aged stuff, expertly grilled over mesquite charcoal -- but  some cuts are considerably better than others. The T-bone costs $5 more than  the others -- and it's worth it. The next best, for my money, is the Delmonico  steak; order it without the bone and it becomes New York strip steak. I've  never much liked filet mignon -- too soft -- and the rib steak I had at Pacific  Dining Car was a real disappointment. But that T-bone was a powerful piece of  flesh -- well-aged meat that gave you something to dig your teeth into (not to  mention a great bone for breakfast).  </P> <P> There is a selection of vegetables to go with the meat and potatoes -- most of  them not green. There are great onion rings -- the skinny kind -- that come  folded into a napkin in a huge basket. They are hot and sweet and amazingly  delicious -- just the sort of food that makes you glad to be an American. The  fried zucchini is surprisingly similar; the zucchini is shredded into thin  strands, dipped into the same buttermilk batter and fried. It's hard to make a  case that these vegetables are actually good for you, but they are very  appealing. There are also mushrooms or steamed spinach or broccoli -- all of  them served in portions generous enough to feed a few hungry people.  </P> <P> Appetizers are big too. The fresh, briny Kumamoto oysters are served not in the  usual half dozen but nine to an order. They come with lemon, cocktail sauce and  wonderfully powerful fresh horseradish. Shrimp cocktail is not quite so  generous; for $12.50 you get 5 shrimp. They are, however, very large shrimp.  Cracked crab is served on ice -- and if you simply must have meat before your  meat, half a rack of baby back ribs should take the edge off your appetite.  </P> <P> As you might imagine, salads here are the sort that could never be called  "rabbit food." Spinach is drenched in bacon and eggs and the Caesar is creamy  -- laden with croutons and cheese. There is also a giant beefsteak tomato and  Maui onion salad whose main purpose seems to be to make you wonder why you are  fool enough to be paying $8.75 for this particular pleasure.  </P> <P> Desserts are big, sweet and all-American. There is pecan pie made with maple  syrup and big plates of strawberry shortcake. The hot fudge sundae comes in a  flat bowl with three scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, pecans -- and enough  spoons for the entire table.  </P> <P> If you've gotten to this point in the meal, you probably have forgotten that  you're still in California. Should you want to come back to reality (before the  enormousness of the bill brings you crashing down to earth), try the rather  leaden apple pie. If this really were Kansas, the restaurant surely would not  be serving a pie this poor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pacific Dining Car  </P> <P> * 2700 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica, (213) 453-4000.  </P> <P> * Open Monday-Friday, 11 a.m.-2 a.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 3 p.m.-2 a.m.  (Beginning December 1 the restaurant will be open 24 hours a day.)

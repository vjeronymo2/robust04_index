			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: John Foster Continuing progress in the reshaping and restructuring of its business helped John Foster &amp; Son, the mohair topmaking, worsted and spinning concern, cut losses from Pounds 921,000 to Pounds 605,000 for the half year to August 31. The company said the result was in line with expectations. The second half was likely to be similar to the first and an overall loss was expected for the year. Although the wool textile industry was generally more buoyant and the forward order book stronger than for some time, margins remained under considerable pressure due to the recent sharp rise in wool prices. Turnover dropped from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 6.2m. Losses per share were 5.4p (8.4p).</p>

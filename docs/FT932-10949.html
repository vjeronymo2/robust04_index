			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: IAWS shows 35% advance to IPounds 1.19m A 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was achieved from lower turnover by IAWS Group in the half year to January 31. This Irish-based food and agricultural company produced IPounds 1.19m (Pounds 1.17m) compared with IPounds 880,000. Turnover came to IPounds 176.2m (IPounds 182.8m) reflecting slightly lower unit prices which resulted from the strength of the punt. Directors said the results were good against the background of currency difficulties and high interest rates. The food companies performed particularly well following the buy-out of the minority in Shamrock Foods. Purchase of the Hull fish meal and fish oil business enabled the group to expand that activity into the UK for the first time. Earnings were 0.93p (0.7p) and the interim dividend is again 1p.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil dips 3.4 per cent after revised inflation forecasts Equities in Sao Paulo ended 3.4 per cent down in weak volume following the drop in foreign markets, but some traders predicted bargain hunting for today. The Bovespa index fell 1,102 to close at 31,276, after scraping 30,922 earlier in the afternoon and having edged as high as 32,885 at the opening. Turnover was Cr493.2bn (Dollars 205m). One negative influence on trading was an upward revision of inflation forecasts, to 50 per cent from 48 per cent. In spite of yesterday's performance, some brokers said they expected the market to improve today due to optimism ahead of the government's plan to cut inflation and introduce a new currency, the real, on July 1. Mexico Shares finished weaker for the third straight session, as slack trade exacerbated the effect on the market of the drop in the Dow Industrial Average on Wall Street. The IPC index of 37 leading shares fell 25.92 points, or 1.14 per cent, to 2,257.69. Turnover was an anaemic 39.3m shares. In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered rises by 59 to 9.</p>

			<p>President     Kim Il-song used his annual New Year's address to  reiterate Pyongyang's interest in dealing mainly with Washington  on the nuclear issue while minimizing Seoul's involvement in the  issue.  On the domestic front, Kim reaffirmed the somber economic  reports that surfaced at last month's party plenum.     Apparently attempting to bolster Pyongyang's preference for  solving the nuclear issue through talks with the United States,  Kim projected an upbeat assessment of the status of the ongoing  nuclear talks (Pyongyang radio, 1 January).  Invoking the DPRK-  U.S. joint statement of last June, he contended that if the two  sides "abide by and implement the principles" contained in the  agreement, the nuclear issue can be resolved in a way that is  "fair" to both sides.  Prefacing his assessment of the nuclear  issue with a reiteration of Pyongyang's warning against "pressure  and threat," Kim said that resorting to pressure would result in  the "collapse" of negotiations.     Further underscoring Pyongyang's interest in better relations  with the United States, Kim's address followed the precedents of  the past two years by eschewing harsh denunciations of  Washington.  Instead, Kim's most direct criticism of the United  States came when he blamed the delay in resolving the nuclear  issue on what he termed Washington's "persistent" antisocialist  and anti-DPRK "maneuvering"--relatively mild rebukes by  Pyongyang's standards.     Kim's stance on the nuclear issue reinforces earlier signs of  North Korean interest in projecting an image of progress in  ongoing DPRK-U.S. negotiations on the issue.  In the most  optimistic assessment of prospects for resolving the nuclear  issue so far, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was cited by the North  Korean news agency KCNA on 30 December 1993 as claiming a  "breakthrough" on the nuclear issue at a working-level bilateral  contact held in New York recently--a contact that the spokesman  touted as the 18th time working-level officials of both sides met  since high-level bilateral talks were held in Geneva last July.  According to the spokesman, the U.S. side removed an unspecified  "series of stumbling blocks" at the 29 December meeting, thus  bringing the deadlocked DPRK-U.S. nuclear talks "back on track."     South Korea     In contrast to its conciliatory stance toward the  United States, Kim in his New Year's address was stridently  critical of South Korea.  Underscoring Pyongyang's unwillingness  to engage Seoul in a substantive manner, at least for now, Kim  claimed that beneath the "veneer" of civilian rule the South  Korean government is no different from "the preceding military  dictatorial regimes," claiming that "evil laws of anticommunism  and fascism" enacted under previous governments remain in effect.     Kim's harsh portrayal of the South's new civilian government  appears to reflect Pyongyang's pique at Seoul's rejection of a  series of initiatives Kim had personally advanced.  For example,  Kim criticized the South for having ignored his "magnanimous  proposal" for exchanging special presidential envoys, along with  his 10-point program for national unification, even though Kim's  New Year's address itself ignored Seoul's current calls for  exchanging special envoys. Suggesting, however, that Pyongyang  has not written off inter-Korean dialogue entirely, Kim fell  short of refusing further dealings with the ROK government,  claiming only that South Korean "people and figures of all  strata" are proclaiming their loss of faith with the current  South Korean regime.     In keeping with Pyongyang's increasingly harsh rhetoric against  Seoul, North Korean People's Army (KPA) chief of staff Choe Kwang  also recently sounded a more belligerent note.  In a speech  commemorating the second anniversary of the appointment of Kim  Il-song's son, Kim Chong-il, as armed forces supreme commander,  Choe cited as the KPA's task the reunification of Korea "with the  gun" (Pyongyang radio, 23 December 1993)--a formulation not  observed in Pyongyang's public pronouncements in recent years.  However, in the same speech, Choe seemed to equate "the gun" with  revolutionary spirit when he used the phrase again to call on the  KPA to crush enemy challenges with "the gun of revolution."  A  week later, the party paper Nodong Sinmun seemed to make a  special effort to suggest that Choe's language was intended to be  figurative, carrying an article stating that "under no  circumstances" could Pyongyang "invite self-destruction" through  "a fratricidal war" (KCNA, 31 December 1993).     Gloomy Economic News     Continuing to project a somber economic  picture, Kim's address toned down his once standard boasts about  North Korea's economic prowess.  Last year, for instance, he had  claimed that North Koreans were "free from worry and anxiety  about food, clothing, and shelter," and that North Korea had no  unemployed or beggars (Pyongyang radio, 1 January 1993), but this  year he merely maintained that the people live "happy lives free  from social and political unrest or worries about livelihood."     Underscoring earlier signs of a shift in economic priorities, Kim  appeared to go out of his way to emphasize the importance of  foreign trade to the North Korean economy.  He called on the  nation to develop "foreign markets" and expand production bases  for export goods.  In another twist of economic priorities, he  seemed to reverse the traditional emphasis on basic and heavy  industry by calling for investment of "efforts" into the coal,  power, and metal sectors "in a bid to develop" agriculture and  light industry.     Implications     Kim's contrasting treatment of Washington and  Seoul suggests that Pyongyang will continue to press for  bilateral talks with the United States, while attempting to keep  inter-Korean dialogue at the minimum level required for the  resumption of the high-level DPRK-U.S. talks.  Nevertheless,  Kim's emphasis on foreign trade--something that cannot be fully  developed without the resolution of the nuclear issue-  -underscores Pyongyang's apparent desire to get this issue out of  the way.

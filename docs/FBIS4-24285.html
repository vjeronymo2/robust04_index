			<p>BFN     [Text] The leaders of 14 African countries met in  Libreville today to make a preliminary assessment six months  after the devaluation of the CFA franc. Even before this summit  began, Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, was at pains to  clarify that there is to be no further devaluation. The  adjustment of 11 January is the final one. This comment is in  response to the concern expressed by certain African heads of  state, and is also intends to kill off the rumors still  circulating in Africa. This statement by Alain Juppe was  recorded by Laurent Bertaud:    [Begin Juppe recording] We have not changed our strategy in  any way. The strategy for the franc zone is the maintenance of  fixed exchange rates, and all these rumors circulating are  clearly being fostered by those who want to make the operation  fail. This was a once and for all adjustment, and, I repeat, we  have good reason to believe today that it is succeeding. This  is due to many factors: the aid that has been made available by  France -- which, contrary to what has been said, has not  abandoned Africa, quite the opposite -- and by international  financial institutions, but it is also due to the determination  of the African governments and the maturity of the people, who  have displayed a strong sense of responsibility when faced with  what is obviously a difficult measure.

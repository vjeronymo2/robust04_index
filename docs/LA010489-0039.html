			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SUPERIOR PRINCIPAL IS LOST;  </P> <P> WEIGHT OF ACADEMIC BUREAUCRACY CANCELS OUT AN ACHIEVER  </P> <P> My friend Henry Gradillas, probably the best high-school principal in the city,  is about to leave his job with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The  state Department of Education has hired him to help improve school  decision-making. The children in the schools that he visits will surely benefit  from the influence of the man who helped transform Garfield High School.  </P> <P> Still, several of Gradillas' admirers, including me, wonder why his own school  district, the second-largest in the country, could not put his unusual talents  to work when he returned last summer from his doctoral sabbatical. Why did this  district, so in need of Gradillas' skill in motivating disadvantaged  teen-agers, choose instead to assign him to scheduling asbestos inspections --  a kind of academic Siberia?  </P> <P> The problem extends far beyond Gradillas. His story is only one small measure  of the deadening weight of academic bureaucracy on public education. The school  district not only misused him but also has seemed to shrug at the surprising,  and important, success of Garfield High, Gradillas' now famous East Los Angeles  school. This record of clumsiness and inattention reveals the risks that an  assertive individual like Gradillas takes when trying to change a system that  has worked tolerably well for everybody but the students whom it is supposed to  serve.  </P> <P> I was drawn to Garfield initially by one of Gradillas' teachers, Jaime  Escalante, hero of the film "Stand and Deliver." Escalante has achieved  remarkable success in turning ill-prepared Latino students into skillful  mathematicians.  </P> <P> Twelve of his students won national attention in 1982 when they successfully  passed a difficult Advanced Placement calculus retest after the Educational  Testing Service accused them of cheating.  </P> <P> After that episode, I became a Garfield habitue. I watched its unprecedented  metamorphosis and came to accept what Escalante had been telling me: Much of  the change would not have occurred without the principal's rare mix of  sensitivity and pugnacity.  </P> <P> Gradillas sharply reduced gang activity at the school. He cut back shop classes  in favor of more algebra. He expanded the Advanced Placement program far beyond  Escalante's calculus. In 1981, the year he became principal, 53 Garfield  students took 54 AP examinations for college credit in four subjects. In 1987,  shortly before he left, 234 Garfield students took 329 AP tests in 13 subjects.  </P> <P> District officials have recently said that they always wanted to find a good  job for Gradillas and were stymied by unavoidable delays. But that is not what  Gradillas' colleagues at Garfield and some downtown admirers believe. One  well-placed administrator told me that he personally heard the head of the  district's new school-based management project rule out Gradillas as "too  confrontational."  </P> <P> Garfield teachers had concluded long ago that Gradillas was on someone's  blacklist for making too many demands in support of Advanced Placement and  other programs. Garfield AP coordinator John Bennett noticed that other  principals with much feebler records were regularly promoted ahead of  Gradillas.  </P> <P> Garfield's achievements are unprecedented. No public high school with  predominantly poor, minority students has ever produced so many successful  Advanced Placement candidates, and only four high schools in the entire country  produced more AP calculus students in 1987. Yet district officials, with a few  exceptions, have done little to examine this phenomenon or spread the secrets  of its success to other schools.  </P> <P> Garfield's message suffers in part because no one high enough at district  headquarters can honestly take credit for it. Many educators have also soured  on trying to make one school's success work elsewhere. The Ford Foundation  suffered embarrassing failures in pushing pilot-project reforms in the 1960s,  and many veteran teachers and principals are understandably reluctant to try  what looks like another media-touted cure-all.  </P> <P> But there are signs that much of what Garfield did could work in other schools,  when given more support. Sheila Smith, coordinator of the district's  gifted/talented program and one of a few outspoken Garfield advocates downtown,  noted that a program to encourage AP courses in disadvantaged schools had  increased the number of AP exams in the district from 4,853 in 1984 to 7,619 in  1988.  </P> <P> Following Garfield's example requires a difficult suspension of disbelief.  Escalante, Gradillas and other Garfield educators showed that young people with  few books at home and poor academic records could still tackle college-level  material. School board member Rita Walters noted with chagrin that "people I  know, good people, simply cannot believe that."  </P> <P> That explains why people like Henry Gradillas who preach the gospel of tough  courses for poor kids are both so valuable and so vulnerable to the  bureaucrat's distaste for anyone who speaks out of turn.  </P></p>

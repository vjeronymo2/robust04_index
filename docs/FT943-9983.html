			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Shady side of the street Wall Street is caught between a rock and a hard place. Economic indicators which point to continued strong growth - such as last Friday's employment data - drive shares lower on the grounds that the Federal Reserve is more likely to raise interest rates. This week's producer and consumer price figures could be crucial. Gathering inflation, combined with the apparent strength of the labour market, would surely tilt the Fed towards higher rates at its Open Market Committee meeting on August 16. Yet pointers towards a significant slow-down in the second half of the year  -such as lower housing starts, car sales and weaker money growth  - raise fears that earnings expectations are too high. After the exceptionally strong second quarter figures reported by many US companies, that might seem an unlikely prospect. With many analysts again lifting forecasts for this year and next, though, there is plenty of room for disappointment. The worst of all possible worlds would be another half-point rise in rates just as it becomes clear that the economy is already slowing. It is always possible that the Fed will stay its hand and that growth will fall gently back towards trend, around 2.5 per cent. Under this golden scenario earnings estimates might turn out to be a touch optimistic, but a stable bond market would underpin equities. While this rosy prospect helped equities climb by 3 per cent last month, the outcome is delicately poised and the evidence conflicting. The course of events is rarely as neat in practice.</p>

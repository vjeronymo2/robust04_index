			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce worries A bout of nervous selling hit Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine and industrial power group, on reports that the company will announce job cuts of as many as 5,000, against previous estimates of under 3,000, when it reports figures today. Analysts were concerned that such a move would result in a higher level of provisions against the 1992 results, suggesting that profits may fall below the Pounds 50m predicted by the more pessimistic researchers. The shares weakened 6 to 129p in trade of 4.2m, with analysts still expecting the company to announce a cut in the dividend. A further blow to sentiment came from news that airliner China Southern had placed an engine order with Rolls-Royce rival General Electric for engines to power its new Boeing 777 aircrafts, an order many had expected Rolls-Royce to win. A Pounds 26m provision for losses incurred by Willis Corroon's Sovereign Marine &amp; General subsidiary, and to a lesser extent the halved quarterly dividend, at first triggered a big slide in the stock, although it later rallied to end a busy session only marginally easier. At their worst the shares touched 178p; they closed a net 2 off at 190p after turnover of 3m. Mr Nick Bunker, insurance broking analyst at Hoare Govett, said: 'As a broker, Willis is as well placed as any of its peers, but the Sovereign losses are a potent reminder of the snares that lie in wait for the unwary marine underwriter.' Hoare is sticking with its 1993 forecast of Pounds 72m. Barclays Bank eased 2 more to 411p on 5.3m traded and National Westminster lost 3 to 444p on 3.1m as institutions continued to switch into stocks such as Lloyds, slightly higher at 557p. HSBC rose 9 to 563p, also helped by switching. Sun Alliance was the pick of the composite insurance sector, adding 4 at 346p on very heavy turnover of 5.8m. BZW reduced its estimate of 1992 losses from Pounds 155m to Pounds 100m, with Mr Trevor May, composites analyst at BZW, citing the speed of recovery in UK underwriting, as evidenced by Guardian Royal's good results, for the change in his forecast. Oil group Lasmo met selling, losing 3 to 187p on very heavy turnover of 10m, with one securities house said to have unloaded a block of 3m shares at 187p. Lasmo's preliminary figures are due on March 24. Lasmo shares have fared badly compared with those of Enterprise Oil, its closest rival in the exploration and production sub-sector. Enterprise, boosted on Tuesday by news of its participation in a substantial oil find in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, edged up to 508p in spite of news that Norwich Union, one of the UK's biggest institutional holders of oil shares, has reduced its stake in the company over the past year from 7.98 per cent to 6.99 per cent, via the sale of more than 3m shares. Enterprise reports preliminary figures this morning. Renewed confidence for the current year lifted Vickers, which reported losses worse than market forecasts but a Pounds 60.5m rights issue lower than predicted. The shares gained 6 at 124p. Confirmation of a significant order from Rank Xerox boosted Tadpole Technology, which climbed 9 to 329p. Suggestions that British Aerospace would soon announce an order for Hawk aircraft saw the shares move 8 ahead to 280p. Another firm expecting a big order was Westland Group, currently visiting Scottish institutions. The shares firmed 4 to 169p. A sharp rise in profits and an increase in the dividend at BAT Industries cheered the market and the shares moved 18 ahead to 955p. International conglomerate Hanson gave up 3 to 254p, after SG Warburg was said to have changed its recommendation from a hold to a sell. Turnover was 8.2m. Results from Medeva were well received, the shares appreciating 10 to 235p. Nikko Securities is forecasting an upside of 300p on a six-month view. Good results from Cadbury-Schweppes sent the shares racing forward, closing 14 ahead at 508p. A series of upgrades by analysts followed, with Nomura lifting its forecast from Pounds 370m to Pounds 400m, although the house remains cautious over earnings growth and the premium rating. Smith New Court raised its forecast from Pounds 375m to Pounds 395m and retained its recommendation, the broker arguing that although the shares may not outperform in the near term, the stock remained a good longer term investment. Banana importer Geest was the subject of some takeover speculation as the shares continued their recent upward surge. US food outfits Dole Group and Chiquitta were being mentioned. Geest is a beneficiary of an EC banana agreement which comes into effect in July. The shares advanced 8 to 474p. Asda anticipated the announcement of its impending inclusion in the FT-SE 100 Index, the shares continuing their good run, closing 2 1/4 higher at 72p. Turnover was a combined 55m shares.</p>

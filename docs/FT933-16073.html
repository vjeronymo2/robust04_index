			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Technology: Disillusioned with computers - Technically Speaking ASPIRING young writers get tired of running out of pads and ball-points. So perhaps it was a good idea of my father's to let me use the Amstrad notebook computer which he had recently acquired. Then again, perhaps it wasn't. The computer, the NC100, is amazingly simple to understand and very light. It is perfect for times when you don't want to have to sit at your desk to write. There are no hassles saving files and storing them; everything is saved automatically. It can go pretty much everywhere with you. Initially, it seemed perfect. But problems - of the type which can affect any potential computer purchaser wanting a machine which combines low cost with ease of operation and some flexibility - soon occurred. The Amstrad (costing nearly Pounds 200) has a limited amount of storage - only enough for eight or so files ranging from one to three pages. For more space, you have to buy plug-in cards costing at least Pounds 40, too expensive for a 15-year-old student in the middle of her GCSE years. The other options are printing out every document or decanting them on to another computer with a larger memory. Both of these options have their difficulties. First, printing all your work out is useless, because the idea of using a computer is to have all your work in storage. Second, decanting files can be a problem. Where do you get another computer from? If it is your father's computer, what do you do if you need to see a file instantly and he is not around. It was around a month after I started using the Amstrad that I ran into serious problems. The computer went blank - pointlessly, infuriatingly blank. What had happened? This remains a mystery. After a few days of carefully checking it, shaking it and, eventually, screaming wildly at it, my father and I decided to send it back to Amstrad to be fixed, all the time praying that the files I had worked on for more than a month would be safe. They were not. The computer was sent back to us fully working but fully wiped of all my work. It was a long time before I could face using it again and when I did everything seemed fine. Although I had lost all my files and had no record of them, I built my work up again, slowly and painstakingly. And then disaster struck again. I wrote a short piece - only two paragraphs, in fact. I put in a final full stop . . . and it started to beep . . . beep . . . beep. I got worried. Again, I sought advice but the instruction book did not mention high-pitched beeping. The only way to solve this seemed to be to remove the batteries. This we did . . . and all my files were rubbed. Again. I never want to see this computer again. My father understands this and introduced me to the Olivetti Quaderno. The Quaderno (Pounds 585) is beautiful, much more attractive than the Amstrad. It has a larger memory, too, but it also takes memory cards - the same expensive memory cards. (These cost between Pounds 40 for 64K bytes, or 20 pages of text, and Pounds 150 for one megabyte, or 320 pages.) The Quaderno has more functions. These include a tape recorder (for when you have sudden brain waves and don't have time to type them out), a calculator, address book and organiser. It takes longer to understand and it has a much smaller keyboard which is harder to type on. With the Amstrad, I lost in total over six months' work and I have given up on the Quaderno, because school work means I do not have time to learn to use it properly. I'm sure that with a little time and patience it would be good . . . but not for someone who just wants to write rather than learn about computers. As for me, I'm going to have to spend a large amount of money on ball-points and pads. At least they do not take ages to learn to use or break down when you least want them to.

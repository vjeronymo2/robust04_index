			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC denies Canadian fish charge THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday strongly denied Canadian suggestions that overfishing by EC vessels outside its 200-mile limit was a major factor in the severe depletion of its fish stocks, writes David Gardner in Brussels. Canada announced on Monday a 35 per cent cut in this year's northern cod quota to 120,000 tonnes, immediately closing the winter fishery for offshore trawlers inside Canadian waters. Canadian officials say Spanish and Portuguese vessels last year took 42,000 tonnes of cod from the so-called 2J3KL area of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation. The EC quota, which it sets unilaterally, was 27,000 tonnes, and only 21,500 tonnes were reported to the community, the officials claim. They argue that this has a knock-on effect, exacerbating stock depletion inside Canadian waters and adding to unemployment in Newfoundland. A Canadian scientific body last week cut its estimate of the spawning stock from 1.1m tonnes in December to 780,000 tonnes. Commission officials argue that, even if Canada is correct, it is 'outrageous' to suggest that the EC's extra 15,000 tonnes was responsible. 'The cause of the problem in Canadian waters is overfishing by the Canadian fleet . . . just as the overfishing in Scottish waters is the result of the overcapacity of the Scottish fleet,' an official said.</p>

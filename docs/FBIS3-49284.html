			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Piotr Jakucki: "The Whole Army in the </F> President's Hands"]    [Text] According to a new constitutional law proposed by  the Belvedere, President Lech Walesa would exercise full control  over the Polish Army.    The draft, which consists of three typewritten pages,  basically includes a passage saying that the "president  exercises general command in the spheres of internal and  external security of the state" (Article 34). It provides for  the establishment of a new National Security Council, RBN, whose  composition and principle activities would be determined by the  president (Article 37a, Item 5). The RBN would be "an  institution in charge of the state's internal and external  security, making decisions on all matters that the Constitution  or other law did not delegate to the president's competence or  that of other state institutions, or local governments."    According to the proposed law, the RBN would decide about:    "1. General principles of internal and external security of  the state, including those concerning the defense of the Polish  Republic.    ``2. Basic organizational principles of the Armed Forces and  their size, as well as those of civil defense and paramilitary  units and other elements of the state's defense system.    ``3. Measures intended to heighten combat readiness; it  could also come up with proposals to introduce a state of  emergency or martial law, and order a mobilization or declare  war."    The RBN would also be responsible for controlling and  supervising the implementation of objectives in the sphere of  the general duty of protection.    According to the Belvedere's proposals, the RBN's decisions  would be "binding for institutions and organizational units to  which they were dispatched."</p>

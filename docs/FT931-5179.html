			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / US navy proposes the closure of a third of its port bases THE US navy is proposing a radical realignment of its port bases, offering to close about a third of its installations and concentrate on two main ports at Norfolk, in Virginia, and San Diego, in California. The proposal is part of a list of proposed military base closures presented to Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, by each of the US armed services, on the basis of which Mr Aspin will submit his own list to a presidential base closure commission. The independent commission was set up as a way of circumventing the deadlock that ensued every time the Defence Department tried to close a military base, as every member of Congress fought to avoid cuts in his or her district. Congress is restricted to voting yes or no on the entire list instead of each individual closure. The process remains highly politicised, nonetheless, and members of Congress are already rallying in support of their home bases. The cuts are expected to hit particularly hard in northern California, where the faltering economy would be further hurt by the proposed closure of a number of installations in the San Francisco Bay area. In a move that is unlikely to be seen as accidental, all five bases in the Oakland district of Congressman Ron Dellums, the new chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services committee and an advocate of deeper cuts in defence spending, are understood to be proposed for closure. Another controversial proposal is the Homestead air force base in Florida, targeted for closure until Hurricane Andrew devastated the area last year. Former President George Bush promised at the time to keep the base open.</p>

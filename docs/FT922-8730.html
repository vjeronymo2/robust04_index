			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Letter: Confused Sir, Re Mr Leonard Dowsett's letter (May 8), the suggestion that ICI invented polyester was the FT's, not ours. I am not aware that we have ever made any such claim. I think the explanation may be simpler; a confusion with polyethylene, colloquially known as polythene, which was indeed invented by ICI.

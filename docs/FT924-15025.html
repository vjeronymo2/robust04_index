			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Mexican governor resigns MEXICO'S ruling party governor from Michoacan state has resigned, almost certainly ending three months of opposition marches and protests, which followed his controversial election in July, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The resignation - formally a leave of absence for one year - comes as a blow to President Carlos Salinas and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party. Both had invested considerable energy and authority in supporting Governor Eduardo Villasenor. Michoacan is the stronghold of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution, whose president, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was the former state governor. Its candidate, Mr Cristobal Arias, lost the election by 16 percentage points in a process marred by a considerable disparity in resources between the two parties.</p>

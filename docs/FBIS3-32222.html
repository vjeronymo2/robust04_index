			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 3 Feb (EFE) -- Ecuador has been partially  paralyzed today during the first few hours of a nationwide  strike called by labor federations and other sectors to protest  gasoline price increases of up to 71 percent. In Quito and  other cities, mass transportation has been reduced considerably,  and thousands of people are walking in the main streets, some  going to work while others head to participate in demonstrations  scheduled for today.    Local media estimate that only one out of 10 buses is  providing service this morning. The few buses circulating are  filled with passengers hanging out of doors and even windows.    Picketing has closed several main streets in Quito since  early this morning, and it has prevented the circulation of  private cars, whose number is fewer than normal. In some  provinces in the Andean region, demonstrators have closed  national highways. Military and police units are protecting  many intersections and main streets, where some clashes with  demontrators have already taken place.    Disturbances have not ceased in Quito for a week to protest  the government's increase in gasoline prices. Police sources  are reporting dozens of people are being injured and arrested  every day, but there has been no official report giving overall  figures.    The strike has been felt with greatest force in the  industrial sectors of the capital and other cities in the Andean  region. According to local media, the strike has not been felt  as strong in Guayaquil, Ecuador's most populated city with 2  million residents.</p>

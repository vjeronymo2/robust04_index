			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Japanese to raise stake in Brazilian steel mill AN obstacle hindering Brazil's first significant privatisation - that of Usiminas, its largest steel mill - was removed yesterday with the signing of an accord substantially raising the equity of the company's Japanese shareholders. After months of negotiations it was agreed that Nippon Usiminas, a Nippon Steel-led consortium of 54 Japanese companies as well as the Japanese government, would have its stake in Usiminas increased from 4.6 per cent to 13 per cent. Usiminas was established in 1958 as a joint Brazilian-Japanese venture to provide steel for the motor and naval industries. The Japanese put up 52 per cent of the capital and retained 40 per cent of the equity, the maximum allowed. But government price controls on steel to subsidise other industries, and more recently to keep down inflation, prevented it becoming the profitable venture envisaged. So, as Brazil increased investment in Usiminas, the Japanese cut their participation to hold only 25 per cent of the equity. The real blow came in 1976 when all state steel companies were brought under the control of Siderbras which, through redirecting tax reimbursements, cut the equity participation of Nippon Usiminas from 25 per cent to 4.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Legal obstacles to contracting out targeted MINISTERS are considering legislation in the next session of parliament to sweep away legal obstacles to the contracting out of Civil Service work. The obstacles have emerged in the search for work to be put out to tender in a second round of market-testing, due to start in the autumn. The first round, currently in progress, has put contracts worth almost Pounds 1.5bn out to tender, forcing nearly 45,000 civil servants to compete for their own jobs. The contracts include some core Whitehall work such as the Treasury's economic forecasting and data collection, as well as support work such as information technology consultancy, legal and estate management services. Consultants have been helping departments and agencies to draw up lists of activities for the second round, which is expected to be worth more than Pounds 1bn. However, scope for putting more civil service work out to tender appears to be constrained by acts of parliament which prevent ministers from delegating their duties. The Civil and Public Services Association, the largest Civil Service union, says that plans to market-test the agency that pays Civil Service pensions have been put on hold after lawyers advised that ministers could not delegate their authority to administer the scheme under the Superannuation Act 1972. If legislation is needed it is likely to be in the form of additional clauses 'piggy-backing' on other bills going through parliament rather than a single bill to cover market-testing. Any changes will not, however, attempt to deal with the biggest obstacle which has emerged to the market-testing programme - the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981, or Tupe, regulations which guarantee the jobs and pay of the existing workforce in many cases when work is contracted out. As the regulations implement the European Community Acquired Rights Directive they cannot be removed by UK legislation. Local authorities in England will have to start contracting out construction and legal services from October 1995, Mr Robin Squire, environment minister, announced yesterday. Compulsory competitive tendering will be progressively extended to other white-collar services, including information technology services, housing management, finance, personnel, and corporate and administrative services.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Politicians and civil servants The British civil service is justly famed for its impartiality and objectivity. Such qualities are essential both in the task of administering public services fairly and in providing high-quality advice on policy matters to ministers. Yesterday's white paper on continuity and change in Whitehall must therefore be largely judged by the degree to which it preserves a non-political civil service that can serve governments of any persuasion. Much of the white paper contains good sense, extending to Whitehall the sort of management reforms already imposed on public services, such as health and education. Departments will be expected to improve the quality of the services they provide, with higher performance targets set each year as part of the Citizen's Charter. They will have to achieve these higher standards with frozen running cost budgets, putting strong pressure on managers to strive for efficiency. To help them reconcile these conflicting demands, permanent secretaries are to be given much greater freedom to manage. Departments will take responsibility for the pay and grading of their staff, whose salaries account for more than half of civil service costs. The cash-based Whitehall accountancy system is to be replaced by resource-based accruals accounting, to improve the management of current and capital resources. Managers will be encouraged to draw on a range of management techniques, such as market-testing, benchmarking and process re-engineering, to raise their efficiency and effectiveness. Less day-to-day interference is promised by the central departments, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. Best practice In principle, such reforms are welcome. They reflect best practice in the private sector. They have improved the quality of service in other parts of the public sector and may be expected to do the same in Whitehall. Also to be welcomed are the proposals to open the upper echelons of the civil service to outsiders. The top managers in Whitehall who have come from business or other parts of the public sector have contributed much to improving standards. A greater interchange between the public and private sectors is desirable, and will be assisted by the advertising of top jobs. At the same time, young civil servants with ambitions to reach the top will be encouraged to acquire experience outside Whitehall. The most controversial proposals in the white paper are those for putting some 3,000 top mandarins on personal contracts. The government has sensibly decided against short-term contracts that would inevitably politicise the civil service. But it has opted for indefinite contracts which spell out the rights and responsibilities of top mandarins more clearly. The carrot is higher pay for those that perform well; the stick is premature departure for the under-achievers. Increasing pressure The white paper says that such contracts will put them on a par with their counterparts in other walks of life. That may be so, but it is not difficult to see undesirable consequences flowing from increasing pressure on civil servants to satisfy the demands of their political masters. Mr William Waldegrave, the donnish public services minister whose white paper it is, may welcome robust challenges from his civil servants. But other ministers appear less tolerant of intellectual dissent, as the recent premature departure of two high-flying permanent secretaries indicates. And there is no doubting the unhappiness among many senior Home Office mandarins over the home secretary's unwillingness to listen to evidence that casts doubt on the wisdom of his criminal law reforms. If this reform is to go ahead, an independent appeals body is needed to which civil servants can turn if they feel they have been badly treated by their ministers. The present system of internal appeal up the management chain, ultimately to Sir Robin Butler, the head of the civil service, is inadequate. The fact that only one case has ever reached Sir Robin indicates that civil servants have little confidence in the procedure. If the public is to be assured that the government's shake-up in Whitehall will not politicise the civil service, a genuinely independent appeals body is essential.</p>

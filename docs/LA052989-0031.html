			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> MELANOMA GENE IDENTIFIED  </P> <P> Scientists researching melanoma reported Thursday that they have found a gene  responsible for a hereditary form of the deadly skin cancer associated with  abnormal skin moles.  </P> <P> The gene is associated with dysplastic nevi, larger-than-normal moles that  change color or shape and are prone to becoming cancerous.  </P> <P> Up to 12% of cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma occur in people whose  families are also prone to the cancer and usually in association with the  abnormal moles.  </P> <P> The scientists, headed by Sherri Bale of the National Cancer Institute in  Bethesda, Md., located the gene in members of six families susceptible to  melanoma.  </P> <P> Using molecular genetic techniques and gene linkage analyses, the scientists  found the gene near the end of the upper arm of chromosome 1 -- the largest of  the 46 chromosomes in human beings.  </P></p>

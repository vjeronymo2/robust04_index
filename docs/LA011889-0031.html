			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTAINING CAR INSURANCE COSTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jack Tenner wrote in The Times that insurance  companies in California should be treated like a telephone company or any other  public utility ("Logic Could Go a Long Way in Auto Insurance Dispute," Op-Ed  Page, Dec. 27).  </P> <P> Judge Tenner appears to be advocating a system that would require a state  agency similar to the Public Utilities Commission to guarantee insurance  company profits just as public utilities are guaranteed profits.  </P> <P> His proposal, unfortunately, is misguided and fails to attack the underlying  problem of California's auto insurance woes and voter outrage at premiums --  skyrocketing claims costs.  </P> <P> Even if insurance companies were treated like other utilities, as Judge Tenner  advocates, the regulating body still would have to hike rates (at the expense  of consumers) provided cost increases were left unchecked.  </P> <P> Why is it so expensive to provide auto insurance in California?  </P> <P> Some examples:  </P> <P> * Hospital and medical care payments in auto accident cases are 72% higher in  California than other similar states. And, those payments -- mostly paid by  insurance companies -- continue to escalate.  </P> <P> * Auto insurance fraud -- which is 83% higher here than New York -- is rampant  in California, costing consumers an estimated $500 million to $1.5 billion  annually.  </P> <P> * Costs associated with unusually large numbers of lawsuits are exorbitant.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Judge Tenner and the trial lawyers of this state also miss the  mark at the expense of consumers when they call for a hands-off policy on  California's tort, or civil justice system.  </P> <P> Statistics clearly show that our existing legal system for dealing with auto  accident cases is abused and overloaded with frivolous cases. And where does  that leave the accidents victims? Not as the ultimate financial winners one  might imagine.  </P> <P> The RAND Corp.'s Institute for Civil Justice stated in a 1986 report that tort  victims received only about 46 cents for each dollar awarded them for their  injuries.  </P> <P> Trial lawyers may receive up to 40% of those damage awards, which is the reason  they so strenuously oppose any meaningful reforms of the claims-handling  system.  </P> <P> EDWARD LEVY  </P> <P> General Manager  </P> <P> Association of California  </P> <P> Insurance Companies  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

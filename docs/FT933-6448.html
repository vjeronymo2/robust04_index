			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen Volkswagen's half year figures suggest that profits are now haemorrhaging more slowly, but the improvement is not fast enough to meet the company's target of breaking even by the year end. VW has now admitted as much, though given that the aim always looked optimistic, that is scarcely a surprise. More worrying is the likely weakness of any rebound in the market next year, reinforcing the need for the long-term cost reduction programme started by Mr Piech and Mr Lopez. Their troubles with GM are doubtless absorbing a great deal of management time and may yet cost one, or even both, their jobs. Shareholders can hardly be amused by full-scale police raids on the company. Senior departures - particularly of Mr Piech - would badly hinder the reform effort. Restructuring the high-cost Wolfsburg plant is a complex and difficult task, which will take time and a clear sense of purpose. Yet once the strategy has been laid out the task can be completed by others. Besides, around two-thirds of costs are attributable to suppliers: it is there that the greatest savings can be made easily. Yet VW will still have to turn its traditional trick of producing cars which can command a premium in the market if manufacturing at Wolfsburg is to have a long-term future.</p>

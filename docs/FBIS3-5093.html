Hosokawa told reporters the United States expects a more  favorable response from Japan over trade disputes, particularly  those over cellular phones, insurance and government procurement  markets.    The prime minister said he will take the lead in improving  ties between Japan and the United States.    Hosokawa said he was informed of the U.S. decision in an  early morning telephone call on Friday by president Bill Clinton.    Hosokawa quoted Clinton as saying that the U.S. Congress is  preparing more rigid trade action and that the reinstatement of  the Super 301 legislation is considerably more moderate.    The premier said, however, it would take a long time for the  U.S. to actually apply the Super 301 provision.    Earlier in the day, Hosokawa said he is not considering any  immediate steps to counter the fresh U.S. move. "No, none at  this moment," Hosokawa said. "We agreed to deal with the matter  coolly," he said.    Hosokawa later ordered cabinet ministers to give priority to  opening the telecommunications market and the distribution  system in working out economic deregulation to provide foreign  firms wider access to the Japanese market, government officials  said.    The officials said Hosokawa issued the order at a meeting  held after a regular cabinet session.</p>

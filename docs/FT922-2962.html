			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / EC shift working plans opposed BRITISH employers fear a massive disruption to shift systems if the government accepts the European Community's working time directive at the next meeting of employment ministers on June 24. The Engineering Employers' Federation and the British Printing Industries Federation believe the government has concentrated too much opposition to the directive on the issue of the 48-hour maximum working week and has virtually ignored restrictions on shift systems which could have much more damaging effects. Mr Peter Reid, head of employment policy at the Engineering Employers' Federation, said the proposed restrictions on shift work were 'much more important' than the 48-hour limitation and could cause havoc in continuous-process industries. The restrictions that worry both federations include an eight-hour limit on night shifts, an 11-hour minimum daily rest period, and 35 hours' consecutive rest at least once a week. Foundries, forges, plastics, plating and many other processes could be hit, the employers say, and argue that many night-shift employees prefer a pattern of four 10-hour shifts to five of eight hours. These details have been largely disregarded as the government has fought the ban on Sunday working - now won - and the 48-hour week. A Portuguese compromise to allow working weeks of more than 48 hours if employees agree, at least for an initial 10-year period, could provide the basis for a deal at the meeting on the directive. An agreement is also expected on the UK proposal to allow negotiations between the 'social partners' at the most appropriate level and not at national level. The Low Pay Unit has attacked the idea of allowing workers to volunteer for working weeks of more than 48 hours. It says that British employment law is not strong enough to prevent people being forced to work the longer hours. The unit adds that 12 per cent of male manual workers presently work for more than 48 hours a week.</p>

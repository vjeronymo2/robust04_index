A specific growth rate for defense spending for  fiscal 1994 will be set in the course of compiling the budget.  With the prime minister expressing his intention not to cut  defense spending, there is a high possibility that defense  spending will grow by 1.95 percent, the same percentage point as  the growth rate of the 1994 budget.    Asked by a reporter if he intends to cut defense spending  for  fiscal 1994 after a Japan Security Council session on 6 January,  the prime minister said: "I will not cut defense spending." The  prime minister also reiterated his plan to review the "Guideline  for Japan's Defense Buildup," a basic policy for the buildup of  Japan's defense capabilities and to reflect the review's results  in the 1995 fiscal budget.    The Japan Security Council session was called to discuss a  draft preliminary budget request for the 1994 defense budget.  At the session, Foreign Minister Hata and Defense Agency  Director General Kazuo Aichi sought an understanding by other  cabinet members about the need to increase the defense budget,  saying: "Although the U.S.-Soviet confrontation has ended, the  unstable situation still continues in Asia and disarmament has  yet to be carried out in the region." In response, some cabinet  members attending the session said: "Japan should define its  defense budget in light of the global disarmament trend."  During the session, cabinet members from the ruling Social  Democratic Party of Japan did not oppose the government's plans  to purchase two Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)  aircraft and modified Patriot antiair missiles.    The preliminary budget request for the 1994 defense budget  amounts to 4,731.1 billion yen [Y], an increase of approximately  Y96 billion from a year earlier. The increase is comprised of  approximately Y60 billion to meet increased wages for members of  the Self-Defense Forces and approximately Y36 billion to meet  the cost of maintaining U.S. Forces in Japan, while 42 percent  of the defense budget is allocated for personnel expenses and  food and 37 percent of it is set to be spent for military  hardware payments for 1993 purchases. For this reason, the  Defense Agency [DA] has made a "minimum request to avoid facing  any further cuts" (says a top DA official). The Finance  Ministry, however, has openly said that it will cut the defense  budget without regard to its sanctuary.    While some believe that the prime minister indicated his  intention not to cut defense spending because of his full  understanding of the present state of Japan's defense, others  believe that with Japan-U.S. summit talks set to be held in  January, the prime minister expressed his intention not to cut  defense spending after concluding that it was not good policy to  cut the sympathetic budget for U.S. Forces in Japan and the  budget for the AWACS aircraft purchase for which the United  States has asked Japan as part of the efforts to cut its trade  surplus with the United States.</p>

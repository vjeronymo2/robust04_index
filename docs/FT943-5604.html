			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (7): Battle is on to design fighter of the future - A look at the dilemma faced by defence departments and manufacturers of military aircraft Times have rarely been tougher for the makers of military aircraft. In western domestic markets, manufacturers are being relentlessly squeezed by reduced military spending on the one hand and escalating development costs for the next generation of equipment on the other. Export markets are also shrinking, because traditional Gulf states buyers are also short of cash. What is worse, now the cold war has ended, few western countries have a clear idea of the threat which the next generation of advanced aircraft will have to meet. As a result, many aircraft development programmes are being stretched and there is increasing doubt about whether some aircraft under development will ever enter service. Perhaps the safest of all programmes in this shaky situation is the F-22 US air superiority fighter. The aircraft has been under development for the past five years by Lockheed and Boeing and is designed to be a Mach-2 radar-evading 'stealth' aircraft which will guarantee the US command of the air up to 2020. Since air superiority is seen as vital by the US - a view confirmed by the Gulf War - the F-22 has strong backing from the air force, the Pentagon, and, crucially, from Congress. Because dominance of the air is seen by the US as an end in itself, few question the threat the F-22 will have to counter or the vast Dollars 71bn cost of producing the 442 air interceptors. Indeed, with plans for a new naval fighter to replace the F/A-18 scrapped, the department of defence is considering a carrier-based variant of the F-22 instead. And as the F-111 long-range strike aircraft is being retired early in 1996, the F-22 is one possibility to undertake that kind of air-to-ground strike mission. Despite the crash of one of the YF-22 prototypes, development is proceeding well. Work remains to be done in reducing the aircraft's weight and improve its stealth, but the programme is progressing smoothly. Lockheed, which has two-thirds of the project now that it has bought General Dynamics' tactical aircraft business, has yet to decide whether to consolidate its operations on one site, or continue development at Fort Worth in Texas and at Marietta in Georgia. While working on one site might be more economical, Texas is an important state politically and Georgia is the home of the leader of the Senate armed services committee. The company will thus have to balance politics against economics in deciding the future of the programme. In Europe, there is less certainty about the future of next generation fighters. Eurofighter continues to be dogged by worries about German commitment to the project - worries which are unlikely to be resolved until after the federal elections this autumn. If Germany does reduce its order for Eurofighters, there will be some difficult negotiations about how work in the production phase should be split between the British, German, Italian and Spanish partners. Germany would not be entitled to the third of construction work it was originally allocated if it orders fewer than the 250 Eurofighters it indicated it might buy or even the 140 recently mooted. The UK may even strengthen its hand by ordering more than the 250 it originally signed on for and buy another 100 fighters to replace its Tornado interceptor fleet. However, transferring the tooling from German factories to other partners might be uneconomic and an alternative solution may have to be found. Potentially more damaging is the worry that uncertainty over the German position could delay the programme further, increasing costs and, if the in-service date slips, reducing the Eurofighter's technical edge over potential rivals. As one US industrialist said, 'Eurofighter is a good aircraft, but they really must get on and build it before it dates.' Cost concerns on such collaborative programmes are also worrying governments. While the partners want to spread the development costs by working together, duplication of effort and progress at the pace of the slowest dulls the benefits. A British government official said that he would be surprised if any of these collaborative programmes had saved money over a solo development project in the end. France and Sweden have avoided the pitfalls of collaboration by going it alone with their Rafale and Grippen fighters, but they have their own problems. Exports will be difficult for either aircraft since it will be in service with fewer air forces than the Eurofighter. If times are tough in fighter aircraft, they are scarcely easy elsewhere. The US has stopped production of its B-2 stealth bomber at 20, though Congress has voted Dollars 100m to keep the production line open for another year. Northrop-Grumman, the aircraft's manufacturer, has offered to make a further 20 aircraft for a bargain Dollars 595m each. While this is less than the Dollars 850m which the first 20 cost, it may not be cheap enough to make a cash-strapped department of defence open its wallet. Another over-budget Californian aircraft is also in trouble. The C-17 strategic jet transport aircraft has already cost its maker McDonnell Douglas about Dollars 1bn in cost overruns. The department of defence has suggested building 40 aircraft and then evaluating its performance with a view to building the 120 originally planned. But at almost Dollars 300m each, the aircraft is hideously expensive. The C-17 must pass a month-long examination next year - including simulated operations under war conditions  -if it is to secure further funding. However, as California will be a key state in the 1996 presidential election, President Clinton will have to think long and hard before scrapping the programme. In Europe, the debate is over tactical military transport with a consortium that is likely to come under the Airbus aegis keen to develop a replacement for the Hercules. The Future Large Aircraft would be able to carry larger loads than the Hercules and would fly faster, but would also cost more. Estimates of its development costs run from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 5bn, and while continental countries are enthusiastically promoting the idea, full funding is not yet in place. Perhaps unfortunately, the FLA's first battle is against the new C-130J Hercules to replace the RAF's existing fleet. With Britain lukewarm about the project, it is an uphill climb. But with military budgets likely to be under pressure everywhere for the foreseeable future, it is the kind of battle that aerospace manufacturers worldwide are going to have to get used to.</p>

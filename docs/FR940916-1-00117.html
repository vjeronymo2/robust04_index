			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA also plans to require railroads to stencil the location where the most recent periodic freight brake test or single car test was performed and the date the next test is due on each car. The due date will tell both railroad and FRA personnel whether or not the car is in compliance with the regulation's time limits on the interval between periodic freight brake or single car tests. The location where the last test was performed will also be a valuable piece of information in tracking down recurring problems or in detecting patterns in brake system problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.617.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides the requirements for maintaining the equipment and devices used in performing periodic freight brakes, single car, or single passenger train set tests. The devices and equipment used to perform these tests are safety-critical items. FRA feels strongly they must be kept accurate and functioning properly. The calibration and test requirements proposed in this section are based on past experience with test equipment used in the railroad operating environment. FRA believes that the requirements contained in this section are the minimum necessary to keep the equipment in good working order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart H  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed subpart contains general requirements regarding the development of train brake system maintenance standards. In &sect;232.701, FRA proposes to require railroads to develop written maintenance procedures for each of the types of train brake systems operated by that railroad. The purpose of requiring these written procedures is to force railroads to carefully think through the maintenance process, with an emphasis on those steps that are safety-critical. FRA feels that these written procedures should be very valuable, both as a training tool to qualify new train brake system inspectors and as a check list for supervisors performing spot checks of train brake system maintenance work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA intends for the written procedures to become the railroad's policy for good train brake system maintenance practice. FRA expects the railroads to follow their written procedures, but FRA will actively enforce only those procedures identified by the railroad as safety-critical. FRA believes that proper train brake system maintenance is crucial to overall railroad operating safety. FRA contends that the single most important factor in achieving a quality brake system maintenance program is the knowledge and skills of the people performing the maintenance. For this reason, FRA intends to require that all train brake system maintenance work be performed by qualified train brake system inspectors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA also proposes to require that railroads wishing to use new train brake system technology develop a maintenance plan that describes how the new system will be inspected, tested, and maintained. Similarly, the purpose of this proposal is to require a railroad to carefully think through the safety ramifications that the introduction of the new technology will cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA further proposes that these written maintenance procedures be enforced for brake system test, inspection, and maintenance work performed by contract employees not employed by railroads. FRA will consider the railroad that contracts out brake system work to be responsible for ensuring that the contractor performs the work in accordance with the procedures developed by the railroad. FRA recommends that a railroad include their maintenance procedures in the statement of work for the contractor and closely monitor the performance of the contractor to be sure that the procedures are followed by the contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed subpart contains operating requirements for train brake systems. Unless otherwise noted, this subpart is applicable to all trains. Section 232.801 provides a general requirement that railroads develop written, detailed operating requirements governing the safe operation of train brake systems over their rail lines under all operating conditions. FRA believes that the development of written standard operating requirements forces a railroad to analyze the safety impacts of the various ways to handle potentially dangerous situations. For the most part, these operating requirements formalize what is already being practiced by most railroads. FRA believes that the forethought required to develop these procedures will preempt many mistakes that cause dangerous situations to occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.803.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains the operating requirements for the handling of train information. The purpose of these train-information handling requirements is to ensure that train crews are given accurate information on the condition of the train brake system and other factors that affect the performance of the train brake system when they assume responsibility for the train. This section contains a list of the specific information FRA proposes to require railroads to furnish train crew members about the train's brake system as they take over the train. FRA believes that train crews need this information in order to avoid potentially dangerous train handling situations and to be able to comply with various Federal safety standards. Some of these proposed requirements require railroads to inform the train crew of the operational status of all dynamic brakes. Although FRA will not require dynamic brakes to be functional on a conventional train equipped with them, FRA does intend that the train crew be informed at the time they take over the train as to the amount of operational dynamic brakes they have at that point. Railroads will also be required to provide an estimate of the total retarding force available from dynamic brakes in five-mph increments for the speed range of the train. Consequently, if only fifty percent of the dynamic brakes are operational on a train at the time a crew takes over the train, then the train crew should be given a close estimate of the retarding force available from those fifty percent operational dynamic brakes in five-mph increments. FRA recognizes that railroads will need some time to develop a system for calculating this information, and, thus, FRA proposes not to require the conveyance of this information until January 1, 1995. As with all the requirements in this section, FRA has left the method in which railroads will convey the required information to the train crews since FRA feels that each individual railroad is in the best position to determine the method in which to dispense the required information based on the individual characteristics of its operations. However, the means for conveying the required information will be part of the written operating requirements, and railroads will be require to follow their own requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

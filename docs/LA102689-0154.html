			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI PROBING REPORT OF PAYMENT SCHEME AT S&amp;L  </P> <P> FBI agents are questioning former officers and employees of Irvine-based  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan to determine if top executives were paid excessively  high salaries with the understanding they would contribute some of that money  to political candidates, sources familiar with the federal investigation said.  </P> <P> The inquiries involve a larger number and broader group of people than  previously reported, the sources said. It was reported earlier this week that  the FBI has quizzed state and federal regulators about their knowledge of any  scheme to funnel corporate assets to political campaigns.  </P> <P> Creditors who lost millions of dollars in the April collapse of Lincoln and  bankruptcy of its parent firm, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, have  claimed in lawsuits that political donations helped American Continental  Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. wield influence over regulators and keep the  S&amp;L alive about two years beyond the point it should have been seized.  </P> <P> "There's no question there's an extensive investigation going on," said Bradley  J. Boland, an American Continental spokesman. "At least 30 people we know of  have been interviewed by the FBI. But they all told us that they said their  contributions were purely voluntary and that they were not reimbursed at all."  </P> <P> Campaign contributions are expected to be one of the topics at a hearing today  before the House Banking Committee, which is investigating what could become  the costliest failure in thrift history. Taxpayers are likely to pay $1.1  billion to $2 billion to repair the damage.  </P> <P> An American Continental spokesman vehemently denied that executives were paid  high salaries for the purpose of financing political contributions and  circumventing campaign laws that limit contributions to $1,000 per person.  </P> <P> He also denied there was pressure on any employee to contribute money to  politicians, though Keating encouraged them to support the candidates of their  choice.  </P> <P> Keating and about 75 family members, employees and business associates  contributed more than $700,000 in campaign contributions to 37 politicians.  More than $300,000 of that went to Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other  U.S. senators, all of whom intervened with federal regulators on behalf of  Lincoln.  </P> <P> In addition, Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating for three voter  registration groups, including one headed by Cranston's son, Kim.  </P> <P> One of the witnesses expected to testify today before the Banking Committee had  been quoted in a newspaper report earlier this week as saying Lincoln laundered  campaign funds illegally. But the witness, William J. Crawford, commissioner of  the state Department of Savings and Loan, said he was misquoted.  </P> <P> Crawford also said an FBI document referring to his conversation with a Lincoln  executive contained substantial errors. "I don't know that there was any order  to pay anything to anyone, and no absolute suggestion that executives had to  make contributions," he said.  </P> <P> Crawford said that if asked, he would explain to the Banking Committee what he  knows about employee contributions to political campaigns.  </P> <P> Employees and executives interviewed shortly after Lincoln's collapse said then  that they were never pressured into making contributions, though they sometimes  arrived at work to find solicitations from political or religious groups on  their desks.  </P> <P> "We can categorically deny that people were paid in order to make campaign  contributions," the American Continental spokesman said. "They were not  reimbursed and not forced to do it. Any campaign contributions made by  employees was made absolutely voluntarily."  </P></p>

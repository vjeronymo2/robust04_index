			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Dieter M. Wolf of the German Aerospace </F> Research Institute's Central Space Systems Analysis Department:  "The Evolutionary DSL Space Carrier Concept"; first paragraph is  DLR-NACHRICHTEN introduction]    The DSL space carrier concept constitutes a promising  component for a future space launcher family. The following  paper sets the concept out in detail and presents the initial  results.    In comparison with launch systems currently in use or under  development, such as Ariane-4, Ariane-5, the Space Shuttle,  etc., future space launch systems must basically be cheaper to  launch, more reliable, safer, especially when used for manned  missions, they must allow launches in rapid succession and on  demand, and be environmentally acceptable.    Aerospace planes, a rough term for horizontal-takeoff space  launch systems with air-breathing engines, meet many of these  requirements. Their horizontal takeoff and air-breathing  engines give them significant inherent safety and reliability  advantages over conventional vertically launched systems. For  instance, a horizontal launch may be aborted at practically any  point in the whole launch phase, as the abort maneuvers are  considerably less critical than with a vertical launch.  Aerospace planes also permit a relatively high launch  frequency, as they only require a conventional runway, not a  special launch pad with a launching tower.    DSL is a two-stage space launch system with a supersonic  carrier aircraft as its first stage and a variety of types of  second stage. The potential range of second stages for the DSL  stretches from conventional expendable systems, via the  partially recoverable systems of the immediate future, to the  fully reusable systems of the distant future, with either  straight rocket or combined air-breathing and rocket engines.  The DSL concept thus paves the way for the evolutionary  development of a fully reusable space carrier family using a  supersonic carrier aircraft that will remain more or less the  same. This in itself holds out considerable further development  potential, for instance in the direction of a supersonic carrier.  <H3>  Development Characteristics of the Supersonic Carrier  Aircraft </H3>   The design of the DSL supersonic carrier aircraft is  determined by the following requirements:    1. Avoidance of heating-up problems as in hypersonic first  stages;    2. Use in principle of available aircraft technology;    3. The second stage to dock into a recess on the underside  of the fuselage.    To meet the first design criterion, the carrier is a  relatively simple modification of the supersonic carrier  aircraft in current use. The operational maintenance,  servicing, and overhaul requirement for first stages generally  rises in proportion to the thermal stress to which they are  exposed, or in other words, to the potential or actually  obtainable Mach number, especially when an extra thermal  protection system is required. For instance, hypersonic first  stages must be inspected after every flight and the structure,  which is exposed to high thermal stress, and thermal protection  system must be overhauled. In the DSL concept, therefore, the  separation Mach number is limited so as to obviate the need for  an extra thermal protection system for the supersonic carrier  aircraft.    In terms of materials and construction methods, the use in  principle of available aircraft technology means employing  conventional materials such as aluminum, titanium, and alloys  thereof along with carbon fiber-reinforced plastic components  etc. The top design separation Mach number is therefore  determined by the maximum operative range tolerated by these  materials. In terms of the propulsion system, available  technology means using kerosene turbo engines. Although it is  not state-of-the-art, the use of liquid hydrogen-burning  turbojets is being analyzed in parallel, with a view to  evaluating and assessing the impact of this technology on the  overall system. Both these propulsion concepts allow for an  optional extra rocket engine, as this can facilitate  acceleration to separation Mach number and have a positive  effect on the overall mass of the carrier aircraft. No  aerodynamic support is required as a result of having the second  stage dock into a recess on the underside of the supersonic  carrier aircraft. Moreover, it gives the DSL concept  flexibility as to the type, size, and mass of the second stage.  <H5>  Potential Types of Second Stage </H5>   The range of potential types of second stage is as follows:    -- Conventional expendable stages for carrying payloads  (e.g., similar to the Ariane-5 central stage with payload  cladding), which could be replaced at a later stage of  development by a reusable propulsion and avionics module.  Instead of a payload, various smaller systems can be carried in  this stage, for example:    a) capsules (including supply module);    b) winged systems for personnel transport (such as Hermes or  the PLS personnel launch system);    c) logistics vehicles (such as the ATV automated transfer  vehicle);    d) demonstrator vehicles (for demonstrating "tail on" or  "head on" reentry and vertical landing on Earth, for example);    -- Reusable winged systems with rocket propulsion, both  conventional-design systems and CCV (control configured vehicle)  systems or lifting bodies being conceivable; all these concepts  can be either manned or unmanned;    -- Reusable systems with air-breathing propulsion, of the  ramjet or scramjet type, for instance, both manned and unmanned  versions being conceivable.    In particular, the supersonic carrier aircraft can be used  to  carry experimental ramjet and scramjet aircraft. The supersonic  carrier aircraft can also be used to launch smaller multistage  systems such as Pegasus or a hypothetical "supersonic Pegasus."  <H5>  Separation Mach Number Ranges </H5>   The first two design criteria for the supersonic carrier  aircraft give a top separation speed in the Mach 3-3.5 (Mach 4)  range. As the separation Mach number should be as high as  possible with rocket-propelled second stages so as to achieve a  high payload-mass ratio, these systems are basically separated  from the carrier at the top sustainable or obtainable Mach  number. With second stages with air-breathing (ramjet or  scramjet) engines, on the other hand, the separation Mach number  is in the Mach 1.5-2.5 range so as to exploit the full potential  of air-breathing propulsion. As a result, the DSL concept has  two potential separation Mach number ranges, one from Mach 1.5  to 2.5 and the other from about Mach 3 to 3.5 (Mach 4).  <H5>  Implementation Stages and Potential Spin-Offs </H5>   In order to limit the development risk and, consequently,  keep development costs as low as possible, the first generation  of the supersonic carrier aircraft will in all probability use  kerosene turbojets. The shorter the development timeframe  available, i.e., the earlier the system is scheduled to enter  service (for instance, as the successor to Ariane-5), the  likelier this is. The second generation of the supersonic  carrier could then use liquid hydrogen- burning turbojets, which  would comply with the main first generation design criteria,  i.e., basically, a maximum separation speed in roughly the Mach  3.5 range. However, it cannot be ruled out that, for example,  the first generation of the supersonic carrier aircraft might  already use liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets for ecological  reasons or with a view to creating spin-offs for aviation.    In order to avoid a high development risk in connection with  the second stage as well, conventional expendable systems can  initially be developed. As explained in detail above, the  further development potential of small reusable systems for  carriage with the expendable stages in place of a payload  extends right up to air-breathing second stages, and various  second stages or types of second stage can be run in parallel.    The various types of second stage, however, reflect various  levels of progress, primarily in the structural and propulsion  technologies. Merely building them thus constitutes an  evolutionary development. The DSL space carrier concept with  the supersonic carrier aircraft and the expendable second stage  thus represents the true beginning of an evolutionary  development toward a fully reusable space carrier family.    As far as materials and construction methods are concerned,  experience with earlier systems, such as the central stage of  Ariane-5, can contribute to the development of the expendable  second stage. As will become apparent below, the rational  solution for this type of second stage is a rocket engine with  characteristic parameters such as mixture ratio and specific  impulse similar to those of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME)  or the RD-0120 Energiya central stage engine.    The development of the small reusable manned carrier will be  able to benefit from know-how and experience acquired to date  from the Hermes and Hermes Technology programs, although there  is an enormous development requirement here with regard to  materials and construction methods, thermal protection systems  included.    The evolutionary development of the fully reusable types of  second stage is expected to produce spin-offs in materials and  construction methods from the small carrier for the type of  reusable second stage with rocket propulsion, and from this  system for the type of second stage with air-breathing  propulsion. Nevertheless, they all present a considerable  development requirement. As far as the propulsion system is  concerned, the rocket-driven type of second stage benefits from  engine development for the expendable system, especially if a  reusable propulsion and avionics module for the expendable  system is developed in the course of time. Nevertheless, a new  engine type for this type of second stage could bring  advantages. Compared with the current state of the art, the  type of second stage with air-breathing propulsion requires  considerable development work on the propulsion, including  engine-fuselage integration. The development of the  air-breathing propulsion can benefit from the experience,  know-how, and developments provided by the German hypersonic  technology program and the French Prepha program, and further  know-how in this area might be acquired from the CIS states.    In one potential development building on the supersonic  carrier aircraft, the separation speed will be substantially  higher than Mach 3.5, for instance Mach 5. The advances  expected by then in materials and construction methods, in  particular with regard to hot bearing structures, should make it  possible to retain most of the advantages of the supersonic  carrier aircraft. Basically, this means avoiding an extra  thermal protection system. Various propulsion concepts are  conceivable for this carrier aircraft, for instance liquid  hydrogen-burning turbojets plus rocket engines or liquid  hydrogen-burning turboramjets. Spin-offs from the air-breathing  second stage type are to be expected in the latter case.    Basically, only reusable rocket-driven systems are being  considered as potential second stage types for this generation  of the carrier aircraft, expendable systems not being ruled out  for carrying heavy payloads. As the higher separation speed  gives second stages with air-breathing propulsion no advantage,  there is no point in developing a second generation of these  systems.    The DSL concept is expected to produce further spin-offs in  several areas. Firstly, the supersonic carrier aircraft could  result in spin-offs for aviation, primarily with regard to  turbojets and materials and construction methods.    The development of aerospace planes, which is conceivable in  the distant future, could exploit the technologies of both the  supersonic carrier aircraft and the various types of second  stage. The main impact of spin-offs from the supersonic carrier  aircraft would be on propulsion systems (LH2 turbojets, possibly  LH2 turboramjets), whereas those to be expected from the various  types of second stage would mainly affect materials and  construction methods and air-breathing propulsion.  Nevertheless, single-stage aerospace planes still require  considerable development work on materials and construction  methods and on the propulsion system.    In addition to the aforementioned spin-offs for aviation  and/or for the single-stage aerospace planes of the distant  future, the DSL concept holds out unique opportunities for an  international space carrier system. For example, the supersonic  carrier aircraft could be developed as an international or world  program. However single countries with their own space programs  could pursue the development independently of one another. The  second stages can also be developed by single countries with  their own space programs according to their specific needs and  their level of technological progress.  <H5>  Initial Results </H5>   Initial studies on the DSL space carrier concept were  carried  out at a separation speed of Mach 3.5. In order not to exceed a  pad weight of about 500 Mg [myriagrams] for the overall system,  the pad weight of the second stages immediately after separation  from the carrier aircraft was set at 200 Mg for the purposes of  the studies.    In addition to analyses for an expendable second stage, the  same calculations were also performed for a reusable second  stage with rocket propulsion. Both Vulcain-derived and  SSME-derived engines were used as the propulsion for both types  of second stage. The resulting payload weights for a 400-km  orbit are set out in figure 5. The SSME derivates gave the  expendable second stage a payload capacity of just under 19 Mg  and the reusable second stage one of approximately 8.5 Mg. The  propulsion concept considerably affects payload capacity. Using  Vulcain derivatives reduced the payload capacity by about 5 Mg  in the expendable second stage and by about 3.5 Mg in the  reusable system.    Initial analyses for the supersonic carrier aircraft gave a  pad weight of around 300 Mg: about 200 Mg empty weight plus 100  Mg fuel. The carrier aircraft is propelled by a total of eight  scaled Olympus engines with an overall installed ground thrust  of about 2,860 kN [kilonewtons]. The vehicle is about 70 m long  and has a wingspan of approximately 50 m.    The payload capacity of the reusable second stage propelled  by SSME-derived engines is about 1.6 percent of the pad weight  of the entire system. This payload ratio is only marginally  worse than in the Saenger with an unmanned upper stage but is  achieved with a first stage of substantially more conventional  technology. Using liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets in the  carrier aircraft raises the payload ratio, which ought even to  exceed that of the Saenger. Not least in the light of these  results, the DSL concept constitutes a promising version of a  future space carrier system or family and merits further, more  detailed studies with regard to both concept verification and  potential spin-offs.</p>

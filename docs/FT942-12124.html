			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / World News in Brief: Norwich Union fined Pounds 300,000 by life watchdog Norwich Union, one of Britain's biggest insurers, became the second company in three days to receive a Pounds 300,000 fine from life insurance industry watchdog Lautro. The fine was imposed for breakdowns in management control relating particularly to the implementation of higher training and competence standards. The regulator was also concerned about recruitment procedures and 'fact finds'  - the checking of information gathered by sales agents. It said the failures 'had risks for potential customers'.

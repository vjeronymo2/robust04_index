			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PLAYS HOST AS CHILDREN SCRAMBLE FOR EASTER EGG PRIZES  </P> <P> Thousands of children frolicked on the White House lawn Monday, hunting wooden  eggs and rolling real ones in a rite of spring that converted the presidential  estate into a playground.  </P> <P> President Bush joined briefly in the fun, blowing a shiny whistle to start the  Easter Egg Roll in which his 3-year-old granddaughter, Marshall Bush, was  entered.  </P> <P> There were no winners or losers in the 10-yard races. All participants got  wooden eggs bearing the names George and Barbara Bush.  </P> <P> The same prizes could be found without too much scrutiny under hay strewn about  in pens elsewhere on the lawn.  </P> <P> Some of the eggs bore the signatures of Michael Jackson and other famous White  House visitors.  </P> <P> The Bushes' pet projects were not forgotten. Some guests got Virginia pine  saplings, and all the children took away canvas sacks crammed with books and  other souvenirs.  </P> <P> Some families waited hours to get in; other groups, such as the four children  brought from a shelter in nearby Alexandria, Va., had special passes that let  them right in.  </P> <P> The lawn teemed with clowns, minstrels, an Abraham Lincoln look-alike, balloon  artists, dancers, bands, a yo-yo master and other entertainers, among them TV  puppeteer Shari Lewis.  </P></p>

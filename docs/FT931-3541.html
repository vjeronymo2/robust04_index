			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Simplify equality laws, says EOC THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission yesterday urged the government to simplify 'grotesquely complex' laws on equal pay after the settlement of a seven-year case involving five women. The women were employed by H. &amp; J. Quick, a Manchester-based Ford dealer, as administrators and financial clerks. They were awarded a total of Pounds 15,000 after a tribunal found that their work was of equal value to that done by higher-earning men who worked as parts salesmen, van drivers and car cleaners. The company has decided to withdraw its appeal against the ruling and has paid them the difference in wages. Only one of the women still works for the company. Quick said it 'felt it was the right time to settle'. It added that the law was very complex and that much management time had been spent on the issue. The Equal Opportunities Commission wants to see the existing acts covering sex discrimination and equal pay replaced with a single equal treatment act. There are now long delays before cases are brought before tribunals, and independent experts commissioned by tribunals to evaluate jobs take an average of 12 months to complete their reports. Cases going to appeal take on average a further 18 months.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Forte fails to win control of Savoy but expands role: Chairman announced in shake-up as company keeps independence Mr Rocco Forte won a role in the management of the Savoy hotel group yesterday. But the prize of overall control - for which his family has battled for 13 years - eluded him: the Savoy remains an independent company. The board announced that the Savoy would have a new chairman in Sir Ewen Fergusson, former British ambassador to France. He succeeds Sir Anthony Tuke, who is retiring at the end of the year. The board said it would appoint a new managing director to succeed Mr Giles Shepard, who resigned on Monday. This is likely to be Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager of London's Four Seasons hotel. The board added that a chairman's committee would be set up to work with the new managing director. It would include Sir Ewen; Mr Forte, who chairs the Forte group; and Mr John Sinclair, who represents shareholding trusts controlled by the family of Sir Hugh Wontner, Savoy president until his death in 1992. That is a success for Mr Forte, indicating acceptance that his group has a legitimate interest in the Savoy's future. Forte owns 68 per cent of Savoy's shares and 42 per cent of its votes. Nevertheless, Savoy loyalists such as Sir Hugh and Mr Shepard had long regarded Forte as a cost-cutting group unsuited to run such venerable properties as the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught. The Savoy announcement went on, however, to say: 'The board has been informed that discussions between Forte and certain of the trusts which have a significant interest in the share capital of the Savoy have terminated.' That means that the trusts controlled by the Wontner family are no longer thinking of aligning themselves with Forte to give the latter control. The dual share structure set up by Sir Hugh in the 1950s to see off predators such as Sir Charles Clore and Mr Harold Samuel, and which continues to deprive Forte of overall control, remains in place. The decisions followed months of acrimony and speculation. The Savoy board gathered at 11.30 am to settle the group's future and by lunchtime had finished after an apparently even-tempered gathering. Forte, however, was putting a brave face on the outcome. It said it fully associated itself with the words of Sir Anthony, who said: 'The board has a common pur-pose which is to provide the highest-quality service for all our customers at the same time as producing an adequate return for all our shareholders.' Under new management, the Savoy is likely to improve on its financial performance of last year, when it made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 725,000 on turnover of Pounds 83.3m. It announces first-half 1994 profits today. A better return might satisfy Forte. 'It's the end of the story,' one long-time participant in the struggle said hopefully. On the other hand, it might prove difficult for Forte to abandon an ambition of gaining full control. Time is certainly on the Fortes' side. Mr Forte's father, Lord Forte, who launched the takeover battle in 1981, is still going strong at the age of 85. Mr Forte is a youthful 49 - and his son Charles is not yet three.

It gains 68 per cent of       shares but only 42 per cent of the vote. 1981-89: Forte campaigns to secure change in voting structure to       enable it to obtain control of Savoy. 1989: Truce agreed. Forte appoints two directors to Savoy board;       agrees not to increase its stake for five years. Campaign       on voting structure continues. 1994: Mr Rocco Forte is appointed to Savoy's three-man       chairman's committee. But dual share structure remains.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

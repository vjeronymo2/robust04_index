			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LOADED GUN TO THEIR HEADS  </P> <P> When lawmakers vote against a proposal supported by 84% of the electorate,  they're usually driven to it by one of three things. Sometimes they do it out  of principle. Sometimes they do it for personal gain. Most of the time they do  it because they're afraid of something more vindictive than a spurned voter --  a special interest.  </P> <P> There is no clearer recent example of legislation by fear than the California  Senate's treatment of AB 497, a common-sense public-safety proposal that has  been approved by the Assembly and today will receive reconsideration in the  other chamber. The measure, which was introduced by Sacramento Democrat Lloyd  G. Connelly, simply proposes to extend to all firearms the current 15-day wait  between the purchase of a handgun and its delivery. That brief interval would  allow the state's Department of Justice to check on whether the buyer is a  person prohibited from owning a gun. These would include individuals found  mentally infirm under law, convicted felons, those found guilty of specified  violent misdemeanors within the previous 10 years and people forbidden to  possess a weapon as a condition of probation.  </P> <P> The bill's advantages are self-evident. The waiting period has been tested with  handguns for years, and has worked no hardship on ordinary people and  legitimate sportsmen. Since so many killings really are crimes of passion,  there are obvious advantages to imposing a legal "cooling- off" period on  unstable or distraught individuals in search of a gun. These common-sense facts  have been enough to win AB 497 bipartisan backing in both legislative chambers,  the support of every major law-enforcement official in the state and the  approval of more than two-thirds of the Californians surveyed in a recent Times  Poll.  </P> <P> Sadly, they have not been enough to overcome the fears of a handful of senators  intimidated by the well-financed, single-issue lobbyists of the National Rifle  Assn. Those fearful lawmakers helped the pro-gun ideologues defeat AB 497 on  its first Senate vote. When the measure comes up for another vote today, it  deserves the support of every senator with a decent respect for the public's  safety.  </P> <P> Dealing with the violence in our streets begins with a little courage in the  Statehouse.  </P></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: CPC buys 80% share of Polish food plant POLAND'S faltering privatisation programme received a much-needed, if modest, shot in the arm yesterday when the European arm of CPC of the US agreed to pay Dollars 8.8m for an 80 per cent share in Amino, a dehydrated food producing plant in Poznan. The deal is the second significant purchase by a foreign company in Poland this year. In April ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, paid Dollars 10.4m for a 51 per cent share of the Elta electrical transformer factory in Lodz. CPC, which takes labels such as Knorr, Hellman's and Marmite, is commited to investing Dollars 17m at Amino over five years with Dollars 5m going into modernising the factory in the first 12 months. The balance will be spent on general expansion. Amino's 700 employees have been promised job security for 18 months. It is Poland's second-largest dehydrated foods producer and its present range of products will be continued, the company says. Amino made a net profit of 6.3bn zlotys (Dollars 461,000) last year on sales worth 191.5bn zlotys. The first five months of this year saw sales grow to 114.4bn zlotys, while net profits slipped to 2.7bn zlotys. Mr Mieczyslaw Garstecki, managing director, said yesterday: 'We had enough of a profit to survive, but not enough to expand. This is why we needed the foreign investment'. CPC has a production facility in eastern Germany and a joint venture in Hungary. It hopes output from Amino will serve the domestic Polish market as well as other east and central European countries. The US group is planning to build a sales organisation and establish a catering organisation in Poland to cover hotels, restaurants, hospitals and schools. McDonald's is to open today its first Polish restaurant in Warsaw, employing 400 people. It will be followed by five others, two this year and three in 1993.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. REFUSES TO GIVE $7.2 MILLION FOR TENT CITY;  </P> <P> JAILS: THE COUNTY'S GRANT APPLICATION, WHICH SOUGHT FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF  AVAILABLE FUNDING, IS REJECTED.  </P> <P> A plan to jail Ventura County's casual drug users in a tent city, which would  cost nearly four times the money available under a nationwide federal program,  has been rejected as too expensive and outside grant-application guidelines,  U.S. officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Office of Justice Programs sent a letter, dated Oct. 22, to Sheriff John V.  Gillespie denying the $7.2-million grant application that he and Dist. Atty.  Michael D. Bradbury submitted last spring, said the project's grant  coordinator, Sheriff's Lt. Michael Brown.  </P> <P> Of 63 applicants for the $2 million available nationwide under the Innovative  Neighborhood Oriented Policing Programs, nine were awarded grants of $100,000  to $200,000 each, said Velva Walter, spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Justice  Assistance.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Drug Control Strategy, as local officials have dubbed the  tent city plan, was rejected because putting it into action would be too costly  and would not focus primarily on drug education as required under the federal  program, Walter said.  </P> <P> Brown said he had been unaware that the grant application was out of line  because the office of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) had assured the  sheriff last spring that $58 million was available and had encouraged the  county to apply for some of it.  </P> <P> "We were never told there was any kind of limit placed on the application,"  Brown said.  </P> <P> A $7.2-million grant would have paid for more police officers to arrest casual  drug users, more court staff to process their cases, a tent jail to house them  and education programs to deter others from becoming casual drug users, Brown  said.  </P> <P> "You get the feeling that maybe they're not serious about the war on drugs,"  Brown said of the Justice Department's rejection of the county's application.  "But they can't fund all of them. There were 63 applications."  </P> <P> Gillespie could not be reached for comment Thursday. But Assistant Sheriff  Richard Bryce, chief of the department's custody division, expressed  disappointment that the county program had been turned down for funding.  </P> <P> "It's hard to get upset," Bryce said Thursday. "We're not going to give up on  trying to find some sort of funding. We thought it was an opportunity for the  federal government to show a direct link with local government in the war on  drugs."  </P> <P> But Bryce said there are few options now that the federal request has been  denied and anti-drug-campaign funding was rejected Tuesday by California  voters. Plus, he said, the Navy's refusal last month to let the county build  the tent city on land at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port  Hueneme further frustrates the plan.  </P> <P> Bradbury said the government's rejection was "disappointing but not unexpected.  . . . We did not have high hopes of that kind of funding from the federal  government."  </P> <P> Bradbury said Gillespie told him Gallegly would see that the Ventura County  plan was presented to William Bennett, head of the president's office of  National Drug Control Strategy. Bradbury said he attended a recent political  function with Bennett, who announced Thursday that he plans to resign, and that  the drug czar had not heard of the plan.  </P> <P> "I specifically asked him about our plan because I had been told it was going  to be presented to him," Bradbury said Thursday. "He was unaware of it but  seemed very interested and asked me to get all the information to him, which I  did 10 days ago."  </P> <P> Gallegly said he does not know what led to the plan's rejection. "But our  office had corresponded with Bill Bennett's office in an effort to get this  into the hopper."  </P> <P> However, Gallegly said he does not remember personally mentioning the plan to  Bennett.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said he and Gallegly wrote letters in  support of the program to the Justice Department on June 19 but heard nothing  more until this week when they learned that the plan had been rejected.  </P> <P> Upon learning of the grant application's failure, Ventura County Public  Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said: "That's good. I think it would have been a  very wasteful thing."  </P> <P> Clayman said he would rather the county focus on anti-drug education in the  schools. "But to create a system to pump a whole new bunch of people into the  criminal justice arena is not a good idea," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

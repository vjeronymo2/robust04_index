The purpose of this program is to support State, Tribal, and regional-based programs that address the reduction or elimination of pollution across all environmental media: Air, land, and water. Grants/cooperative agreements will be awarded under the authority of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Your EPA Regional Pollution Prevention Coordinator.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since its inception in 1989, approximately $30 million has been awarded to over 100 State, Tribal, and regional organizations under EPA's multimedia pollution prevention grant program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In November 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (the Act) (Pub. L. 101-508) was enacted, establishing as national policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible. Section 6603 of the Act defines source reduction as any practice that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA further defines pollution prevention as the use of other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through: increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6605 of the Act authorizes EPA to make matching grants to States to promote the use of source reduction techniques by businesses. In evaluating grant applications, the Act directs EPA to consider whether the proposed State programs will:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Make technical assistance available to businesses seeking information about source reduction opportunities, including funding for experts to provide on-site technical advice and to assist in the development of source reduction plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Target assistance to businesses for whom lack of information is an impediment to source reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Provide training in source reduction techniques. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to this grant making authority, the Act authorizes EPA to establish a national source reduction clearinghouse, expands EPA's authority to collect data to better track source reduction activities, and requires EPA to report periodically to Congress on EPA's progress in implementing the Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Availability of FY 94 Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With this publication, EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $6 million in grant/cooperative agreement funds for FY 1994. The Agency has delegated grant authority to the EPA Regional offices which formally transfers the decisionmaking and awarding process for the PPIS grants to the Regions. Regional offices now assume responsibility for the solicitation of interest, screening of proposals, and the actual selection of awards. This sixth round of awards represents a more direct and active Regional role in determining FY '94 awardees. PPIS grant guidance will be developed separately by each Regional program and will be provided to all applicants along with any supplemental information the Regions may wish to provide. Interested applicants should contact their Regional Pollution Prevention Coordinator for more information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Act, eligible applicants for purposes of funding under this grant program include the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, any agency or instrumentality of a State including State universities and all Federally-recognized Indian tribes. For convenience, the term ``State'' in this notice refers to all eligible applicants. Local governments, private universities, private non-profit entities, private businesses, and individuals are not eligible. These organizations excluded from applying directly are encouraged to work with eligible applicants in developing proposals that include them as participants in the projects. EPA strongly encourages this type of cooperative arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The number assigned to the PPIS program is 66.900. Organizations receiving pollution prevention grant funds are required to match Federal funds by at least 50 percent. For example, the Federal government will provide half of the total allowable cost of the project, the State half of the total allowable cost of the project. A grant request for $100,000 would support a total allowable project cost of $200,000, with the State also providing $100,000. State contributions may include dollars, in-kind goods and services and/or third party contributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligible activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In general, the purpose of the PPIS grant program is to support the establishment and expansion of State-, Regional-, Tribal-, or local-based multimedia pollution prevention programs. EPA specifically seeks to build State pollution prevention capabilities or to test, at the State level, innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. Funds awarded under the PPIS grant program must be used to support pollution prevention programs that address the transfer of potentially harmful pollutants across all environmental media: Air, water, and land. Programs should reflect comprehensive and coordinated pollution prevention planning and implementation efforts State- or Region-wide and where approporiate, seek to address State environmental equity issues. States might focus on, for example: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Developing other multi-media pollution prevention activities, including but not limited to: Providing direct technical assistance to businesses; collecting and analyzing data to target outreach and technical assistance opportunities; conducting outreach activities; developing measures to determine progress in pollution prevention; and identifying regulatory and non-regulatory barriers and incentives to pollution prevention and developing plans to implement solutions, where possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Institutionalizing multi-media pollution prevention as an environmental management priority, establishing prevention goals, developing strategies to meet those goals, and integrating the pollution prevention ethic within both governmental and non-governmental institutions of the State or region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Initiating demonstration projects that test and support innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals accepted for review under this program must qualify as pollution prevention as defined by section 6603 of the Act. In May of 1992, EPA released a ``Statement of Definition'' as the formal embodiment of the Agency's working definition of pollution prevention, consistent with the Act. (See ``EPA Statement of Definition'' under unit VI of this notice.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program management <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

Media State Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Though the PPIS grant program is an instrumental component for building and maintaining State pollution prevention programs, EPA is seeking to further integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's existing media-specific grant programs. To this end, States are encouraged to access, where appropriate, media grant dollars to support state pollution prevention activities. This new Agency policy provides State programs with the opportunity to utilize grant funds, traditionally targeted for end-of-pipe activities, to support source reduction efforts. In November of 1992, in support of the Act and to further integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's existing regulatory programs, EPA released a Guidance for the Integration of Pollution Prevention into Media State Grants. The Agency-wide pollution prevention Guidance, beginning with the FY 1994 State grants cycle has four goals: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Promoting pollution prevention in State programs supported through Federal grants by establishing national principles to guide workplans negotiated between Regional Offices and States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Ensuring that grant requirements as interpreted by EPA/State workplans are flexible enough to support innovative State pollution prevention activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Establishing a simple accounting process to share information on successful State projects, and identify statutory or other barriers to funding State proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Building sustained State capacity in pollution prevention to the extent consistent with statutory grant requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new Guidance is designed to help integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's activities as required by the Act. In other words, it will now be possible, as a result of this guidance to use these traditional media State grants to support pollution prevention purposes. By emphasizing flexibility, the Guidance complements other Agency efforts to build a productive environmental management system in partnership with the States, and improve coordination with existing State pollution prevention programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's FY 1994 grant programs, in conjunction with the States, should build on the Agency's many successful pollution prevention efforts to explicitly promote pollution prevention in State workplans (also called agreements). This Guidance will be incorporated into the annual Agency Operating Guidance as well as program-specific Guidance developed in conjunction with the State/EPA Operations Committee. Program Guidance, intended to tailor the Agency-wide commitment to each grant program, will be applied by EPA Regional offices and States in the development of grant-assisted work. In general, the Guidance applies to all of the Agency's media-specific State grant programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further information, or for a copy of the Guidance, contact Tom McCully, Acting Director, Pollution Prevention Policy Staff in the Office of the Administrator, at (202) 260&hyph;8621, or Lena Hann, Pollution Prevention Division, at (202) 260&hyph;2237.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Definition of Pollution Prevention <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's ``Statement of Definition'' as defined in May of 1992 follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following EPA ``Statement of Definition'' is a formal embodiment of what has been the Agency's working definition of pollution prevention, and is consistent with the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. It makes clear that prevention is our first priority within an environmental management hierarchy that includes: 1) prevention, 2) recycling, 3) treatment, and 4) disposal or release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While it is subject to further refinement, this definition should provide a common reference point for all of us. As you review and apply the definition in your work, please keep the following points in mind: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; As always, whether the pollution prevention option is selected in any given situation will depend on the requirements of applicable law, the level of risk reduction that can be achieved, and the cost-effectiveness of that option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Accordingly, the hierarchy should be viewed as establishing a set of preferences, rather than an absolute judgment that prevention is always the most desirable option. The hierarchy is applied to many different kinds of circumstances that will require judgment calls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Drawing an absolute line between prevention and recycling can be difficult. ``Prevention'' includes what is commonly called ``in-process recycling,'' but not ``out-of-process recycling.'' Recycling conducted in an environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages of prevention, e.g. energy and resource conservation, and reducing the need for end-of-pipe treatment or waste containment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As EPA looks at the ``big picture'' in setting strategic directions for the decade ahead, it is clear that prevention is key to solving the problems that all our media programs face, including the increasing cost of treatment and cleanup. In the common-sense words of Benjamin Franklin, ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please keep EPA's definition of pollution prevention in mind as you perform your environmental work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> POLLUTION PREVENTION: EPA STATEMENT OF DEFINITION  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (pursuant to the Pollution Prevention Act) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, Congress established a national policy that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pollution prevention means ``source reduction'', as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act, and other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; protection of natural resources by conservation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pollution Prevention Act defines ``source reduction'' to mean any practice which: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants or contaminants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term includes: equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Pollution Prevention Act, recycling, energy recovery, treatment, and disposal are not included within the definition of pollution prevention. Some practices commonly described as ``in process recycling'' may qualify as pollution prevention. Recycling that is conducted in an environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages of prevention _ it can reduce the need for treatment or disposal, and conserve energy and resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pollution prevention approaches can be applied to all pollution-generating activity: including energy, agriculture, Federal, consumer as well as industrial sectors. The impairment of wetlands, ground water sources, and other critical resources constitutes pollution, and prevention practices may be essential for preserving these resources. These practices may include conservation techniques and changes in management practices to prevent harm to sensitive ecosystems. Pollution prevention does not include practices that create new risks of concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the agricultural sector, pollution prevention approaches include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; reducing the use of water and chemical inputs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; adoption of less environmentally harmful pesticides or cultivation of crop strains with natural resistance to pests; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; protection of sensitive areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the energy sector, pollution prevention can reduce environmental damages from extraction, processing, transport and combustion of fuels. Pollution prevention approaches include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; increasing efficiency in energy use; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; substituting environmentally benign fuel sources; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph; design changes that reduce the demand for energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mark Greenwood, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4048 Filed 2&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

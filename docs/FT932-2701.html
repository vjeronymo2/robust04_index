			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: SE Banken to call on shareholders for financial aid THE Swedish government and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's leading commercial bank, yesterday agreed that the first step towards recapitalising the loss-hit group should be a call on its shareholders. In a joint statement on negotiations under way since SE Banken applied for state support late last year, the two sides said a conclusion on government aid would not be reached until the August-September period. However, they said it was agreed that 'the bank's capital base should in the first place be strengthened by additional contributions from the owners of the bank'. It added that SE Banken would 'analyse the prerequisites for an issue of new shares' over the summer, but gave no details of the scope of such an issue. SE Banken's senior shareholder is the Wallenberg family, Sweden's powerful industrial dynasty, which holds about 7 per cent. The announcement, released shortly after the Stockholm stock market closed, effectively confirmed that recent improvements in SE Banken's operating conditions had removed any urgent need for state support, originally sought because the bank was in danger of falling below the international capital ratio minimum of 8 per cent. With non-performing loans totalling about SKr25bn (Dollars 3.5bn) and further heavy losses expected this year after the SKr5.4bn operating loss in 1992, it remains unclear to what extent, if any, the state will still need to provide aid beyond a general commitment issued in February to keep the bank solvent. In recent weeks, SE Banken shares have risen sharply on speculation that direct government aid might not be required. This followed publication of the first-quarter results, which showed a 55 per cent cut in operating losses thanks to a sharp rise in operating profits before loan losses. Yesterday, the most traded A shares closed at SKr38, up more than five times since April. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the bank's chief executive, acknowledged that the rising stock price, falling interest rates, a strengthening of the Swedish krona and better underlying performance had improved SE Banken's position. But he warned substantial risk still attached to loan losses which have come mainly from the crippled property sector. The government, which has laid out SKr74bn in aid to the stricken banking sector and has been forced to take over Gotabanken and Nordbanken, would clearly like SE Banken to earn its way out of trouble. Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, said last week she was concerned to avoid any risk of a credit squeeze imposed by financially-strapped banks choking off an anticipated slow move out of recession later this year.</p>

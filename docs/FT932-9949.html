			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Banque Indosuez pays Pounds 8.8m for Sheppards BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French investment bank, is expanding its UK interests by paying about Pounds 8.8m for Sheppards, one of London's oldest stockbrokers. Indosuez has been in discussions since November with Sheppards' management and its 51 per cent shareholder Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement, the Arab banking subsidiary of BNP. Sheppards will be merged with the relevant areas of Indosuez's existing UK businesses, Carr Kitcat Aitken, an institutional investment firm, and WI Carr Investments, which specialises in private clients. That business will be renamed Carr Sheppards. Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman of Indosuez, said the acquisition formed part of the group's long term international expansion strategy and its plans to strengthen its private client business, where Sheppards is well- established. He said the merger should yield 'significant cost savings' particularly in administrative areas and in central overheads. About 40 to 50 staff, a third of Sheppards' total, are likely to be made redundant following the merger. Indosuez, one of the largest subsidiaries of Suez, the French industrial and financial group, experienced a difficult time in the past year because of economic slowdown and the property slump in Paris. It saw net profits plummet 87 per cent to FFr101m (Pounds 12.2m) in 1992. Mr Jeancourt-Galignani said there had been a 'significant improvement' during the first quarter of this year. The group had come under pressure in France because of high interest rates and the slowdown, but had fared well in its international and private banking business. Mr Fred Carr, chief executive of Carr Sheppards, said the merger brought together two of the oldest names in the City. WI Carr was founded in 1825 and Sheppards two years later. 'It's one reason we felt we should keep the Sheppards name going on the private client side,' he said. Sheppards, with funds under management of about Pounds 1.6bn, is thought to have made profits of some Pounds 1m last year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement for operational checks in the AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the checks should be provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative is justified because no data exist to show that repetitive checks of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled adequately through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to include an operational check of the sync-lock. The initial check would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after modification. The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably revised the maintenance program. Operators choosing this alternative could use an alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 91.417 or 121.380. The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes the concerns of the commenter regarding the requirement for periodic operational checks of the sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA finds that the operational checks are necessary in order to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to ensure adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes. Representatives of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives from other organizations, such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from the recommendations of the task force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA acknowledges that the operational checks specified in this AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock to correct that unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational checks is necessary in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe condition. This determination is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. In addition, service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in activation of the sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested alternative to accomplishment of the operational checks would permit each operator to determine whether and how often these checks should be conducted. In light of the severity of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish checks of the integrity of the sync-lock installation in a common manner and at common intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA also finds that addressing operational checks of the sync-lock integrity in a recommended action, such as an MRB report, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust reverser system. However, the FAA recognizes that an operational check interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service, which will be recommended by Boeing for inclusion in the next revision to the MRB report, corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service for accomplishment of repetitive operational checks. In light of the safety implications of the unsafe condition addressed and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational checks of the fleet during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be readily available, the FAA finds that accomplishment of the checks at intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable level of safety. Paragraph (f) of the final rule has been revised accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0062, Revision 3, dated February 24, 1994. This revised service bulletin is essentially identical to the previous revision (which was cited in the notice), but contains certain minor editorial changes. The FAA has revised the final rule to include this revised service bulletin as an additional source of appropriate service information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 88 Model 767 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 26 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 480 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required modification, and 1 work hour to accomplish the required operational checks, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $687,830, or $26,455 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

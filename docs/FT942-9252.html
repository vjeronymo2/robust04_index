			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Watchdog barks but the MMC moves on - Disarray in UK competition policy after a pro-industry shift by Michael Heseltine Recent inquiry reports from the Monopoly and Mergers Commission point to a significant shift in UK competition policy. The MMC has adopted a pro-industry approach which threatens a rift with the Office of Fair Trading, the competition watchdog. The change in policy was inspired by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Competition officials and other advocates of a stricter policy believe the Department of Trade and Industry and the MMC have relaxed policy to help create strong UK champions capable of competing in global markets. The growing frustration of competition officials and consumer organisations is echoed at Westminster, where influential backbenchers led by Mr John Watts MP, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, have set up a lobby group, the Competitive Forum, to press for tougher consumer-oriented competition policy and reform of the MMC. When he took over at the DTI, Mr Heseltine signalled his preference for industrial over competition policy. His long-awaited competitiveness white paper, due next week, should confirm that preference. Mr Graeme Odgers, the businessman who took over as chairman of the MMC a year ago, appears to share his views. Last week he said he was 'four-square' with Mr Heseltine on privatisation, competitiveness and deregulation. Since his arrival at the MMC, Mr Odgers has also tried to instill a consistency of approach by encouraging a collegiate atmosphere among the Commission's 35 members. The result, say critics, is an increasingly doctrinaire style which places the interests of firms under investigation ahead of those of the public and consumers. This shift appears to be causing alarm at the OFT. Under Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, the OFT has taken a strongly consumerist approach to competition policy. Sir Bryan gives the impression that he believes markets should be free of any anti-competitive restraints unless they can be shown to benefit the consumer. He has made a number of referrals to the MMC recently, among others on fine fragrances and ice cream, which demonstrate his particular concern with vertical restraints (those affecting the chain of supply to the marketplace), such as measures tying in retailers to suppliers. But the MMC under Mr Odgers appears to take the view that that vertical restraints and anti-competitive practices must clearly damage the consumer interest before it will interfere in an industry. Companies that have built up competitive advantage should be allowed to profit from their investment, innovation and enterprise, he said last week. This increasingly laisser faire approach by the commission puts it on a direct collision course with the OFT. The clearest evidence of the shift in competition policy comes from recent monopoly inquiry reports. Some competition lawyers and economists trace the change back to the report in March 1989 on the supply of beer, when robust recommendations made by the MMC aimed at weakening the control of the brewers over pubs were rejected by the government following intense lobbying by the industry. Since then, critics say, the MMC has taken a much less interventionist approach and shown far too much respect for the views of the firms under investigation, an approach reinforced by the arrival of Mr Heseltine at the DTI and Mr Odgers at the MMC. The pattern began with the 1992 report on the supply of new motor cars, criticised by consumer groups for relying too heavily on manufacturers' own survey data and consumer satisfaction indices to establish that there was little wrong with the present system of car dealerships and after-sales service. The MMC again found itself under attack in November last year over its report on fine fragrances which concluded 'snob value' - high prices and exclusivity - were more important to consumers than value for money, so allowing leading perfume houses to continue refusing supplies to cut-price retailers. That was followed in March by the ice cream report which found that, although the three leading manufacturers had more than 90 per cent of the market for wrapped ice creams, the system of freezer exclusivity - providing free freezer cabinets to shops on condition they are not used to stock rival suppliers' ice cream - did not limit consumer choice by keeping rival products out of smaller shops. The unease at these reports should be underlined next month when the report on recorded music is expected to clear the record industry of acting together to keep the price of compact discs in Britain artificially high. There have been additional reports on mortgage valuations, newspaper supply, television broadcasting services and animal waste - all of which have drawn criticism for producing either half-hearted or unworkable recommendations to remedy adverse findings. Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association director of policy, says that at the heart of these reports seems to be a confusion between the interests of industry in general and the interests of existing companies. But there is no guarantee, he says, that what existing companies want will necessarily be in the interests of the productive sector of the economy. Mr Bill Bishop of Lexecon, the economic consultants, says you only have to contrast the beer report with the recent ice cream report to see the change of approach. On beer, the commission found the system of tied public houses did damage the public interest. It rejected the industry's argument that, if consumers did not like the choice of beer in one pub, they could go to another. But on ice cream it reached the opposite conclusion. Mr Derek Ridyard, associate director of National Economic Research Associates, says the dispute is really about the extent to which one supplier should be obliged to give competitors a leg-up in the market. Even in the case of ice cream there were perfectly sound economic arguments for saying that Unilever had taken the initiative and developed the market and invested in freezer cabinets, and that all Mars had to do to compete was take the same risks. There was a feeling that Mars was simply trying to use the competition laws as a short cut, he says. Mr Ridyard believes that, if there has been a change in approach, then it has come from the OFT which has become more hawkish on vertical restraints under Sir Bryan. He has referred areas such as recorded music and ice cream, which had been looked at and rejected for referral by his predecessor, Sir Gordon Borrie. Mr Christopher Bright, a partner in City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines, says it is easy to understand the frustration felt at the OFT at these developments. But he believes the OFT's main problems lie with the DTI rather than the MMC. Twice in February last year Mr Heseltine rejected Sir Bryan's advice to refer mergers to the MMC. The first case concerned the acquisition by GEC of the Philips infra-red components business. The second concerned the hostile bid by Airtours for Owners Abroad. Mr Heseltine considered the issues raised did not justify referral. These actions were not exceptional. Other trade secretaries have gone against the advice of the director general - in all in 11 cases over 20 years, says Mr Bright. But these instances suggested a swing away from the approach of former trade secretaries such as the late Mr Nicholas Ridley and Mr Peter Lilley - one of 'if in doubt, refer'. Further evidence of tension between the DTI and the OFT came in February this year when Mr Heseltine ordered Sir Bryan to stop his investigation into bus services on the Isle of Arran. It was the first time a trade secretary had ever used his powers to overrule a director general in that way. But the real problem for the OFT is that the DTI seems to have completely lost interest in competition policy. Merger referrals are at an all-time low. Only three mergers have been referred by Mr Heseltine to the MMC in the past 12 months. When the MMC publishes its recorded music report next month there will be only two monopoly inquiries on the go. The DTI is also dragging its heels on reform of the law on restrictive practices and abuses of market power. These developments are not lost on UK companies, says Mr Bright. No wonder OFT officials are said to be concerned at recent events.</p>

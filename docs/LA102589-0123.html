			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAIRMAN PUTS TOGETHER A CINEPLEX ODEON BID  </P> <P> Six months after a nasty brawl with his major shareholder, the intrepid  chairman of Cineplex Odeon Corp. on Tuesday reached an agreement with his  outside directors to proceed with a takeover bid for the company. The bid is  valued at nearly $16.50 per share (Canadian), or almost $14 in U.S. currency,  according to sources familiar with the Toronto movie-theater concern.  </P> <P> The bid would be worth about $700 million (U.S.), and the buyer would also  assume about $600 million in debt.  </P> <P> Cineplex Chairman Garth H. Drabinsky will have 21 days to formally launch the  bid, which requires firm financing under Canadian law. The price exceeds the  pessimistic valuations of $4 to $9 (U.S.) for the stock, set by speculators who  have bet the stock price will plummet and have sold the stock "short" over the  past 18 months. The deal will require a "fairly creative capital structure,"  according to one Wall Street source, who said financing arguably could come  from bank and junk bond financing, "a lot of equity" and short-term loans until  certain assets can be sold.  </P> <P> "He's going to have to sell . . . substantially all of the U.S. circuit,"  declared one industry source. Cineplex currently ranks second-largest among  theater companies in North America, with about 1,200 screens in the United  States and about 500 in Canada.  </P> <P> Trading of Cineplex shares was halted four minutes before the close of the New  York Stock Exchange at the company's request. The stock closed at $11.25, up  $1.125 on a volume of 828,300 shares, or more than double the recent average  daily volume of 330,000 shares.  </P> <P> A spokesman for an independent Cineplex directors' committee said an  announcement would be made early today before trading resumed.  </P> <P> The independent committee was formed last spring to sell the company after the  Cineplex chairman offended his largest shareholder, MCA Inc. of Los Angeles, by  attempting an end-run for control.  </P> <P> Drabinsky and a group of investors had privately struck a deal to acquire stock  held by the Charles R. Bronfman clan for $17.50 per share (Canadian), but MCA  protested that the Drabinsky group would enjoy control without offering the  same price to other shareholders.  </P> <P> After MCA went to court and petitioned Canadian regulators, the Bronfman group  bowed to the pressure to form an independent committee. In mid-June, the  company formally went on the auction block by providing financial data to  potential buyers.  </P> <P> The prospective buyers included other theater companies and Los Angeles-based  Davis Co., led by former 20th Century Fox Film Corp. owner Marvin Davis, but in  recent weeks, the industry wagered that Drabinsky would win the company if he  could put together a bid.  </P> <P> Drabinsky, after all, had the most personal and compelling reasons for staying  at the helm of the company he helped found 10 years ago. The mercurial chairman  has gained a great deal of visibility as a showman and patron of arts and  charities, and would be loath to be yanked off his stage, business associates  have said.  </P> <P> He is "going to try to do some magic with something that sounds like a lot but  is really a little," predicted one former film executive who had business  dealings with Drabinsky and Cineplex. "But have no fear: if he pulls it off,  he'll get into trouble again," the executive said.  </P> <P> The Cineplex auction was haunted by the fact that MCA publicly attacked the  credibility of the financial reporting practices of Cineplex last April when it  went to court to block Drabinsky's purchase of the Bronfman stake.  </P> <P> The theater company has already gained a reputation for having overpaid for  construction of new theaters, as well as for acquisition of existing chains in  such markets as New York, Washington and Chicago. Such factors may have  discouraged potential buyers who fear that Cineplex has assigned too high a  value to its assets.  </P></p>

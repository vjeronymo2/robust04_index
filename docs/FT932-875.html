			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Jakarta places travel ban on bad debtors THE Indonesian government has imposed a six-month overseas travel ban on more than 300 businessmen amid growing concern at the size of the bad debt carried by Indonesia's state banks. The identity of those affected has not been published but all have bad debts with the state banks of at least Rp250m (Pounds 80,000). Government officials say the travel ban complements a recent confidential report into the worst of the state banks' corporate debtors conducted by Bank Indonesia, the central bank, and the attorney general's office. An unauthenticated copy of the report, circulating in business circles for the past week, indicates that 26 leading companies  - many politically well-connected, including three led by relations of President Suharto  - are not servicing loans totalling Rp6,900bn from six state banks. Bank Indonesia has refused to confirm the report despite intense questioning of Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, central bank governor, by members of the parliamentary finance committee this week. He has publicly maintained the official line that the banking sector's bad debts  - including both state and private banks  - amount to only Rp3,500bn, while many of the companies cited in the alleged report have denied they are in default to the state banks. Total outstanding credits of the sector are about Rp130,000bn, of which state banks account for 55 per cent. Executives of private banks, however, believe the sector's non-performing loans may be as high as Rp20,000bn. The World Bank, which last year made a Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) loan to help recapitalise the state banks, described the banking system in Indonesia as 'under strain' in a report last month. Indonesian cabinet ministers have pledged to tackle the bad debt issue, regarded as a potential Achilles heel of an otherwise robust economy. However, the central bank report, if true, will leave President Suharto  - who has proven averse in the past to acting against businesses he considers loyal to his regime  - with some difficult decisions. Economists fear the travel ban will affect only relatively minor debtors while more influential people, who are better able to service their loans, will be allowed to move freely.</p>

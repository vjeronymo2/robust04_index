			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (22): 'Winners and losers' theory - Whatever their rhetoric, most western governments have all but abandoned a practical commitment to full employment / Macroeconomics 'THE GOALS OF MACROECONOMIC POLICY' By Martin Prachowny Routledge, Pounds 13.99, 217 pages Martin Prachowny's book has as its central theme the observation that macroeconomic policies generate winners and losers: there is always a conflict of interest, and policies that make everyone better off do not exist. The most important conflict that Prachowny identifies is between two groups of workers: on one hand those in secure jobs, on the other those in relatively insecure jobs and the unemployed. In a democratic system, the conduct of policy is decided by the 'median voter', Mr/Ms Average, who belong to the 'secure' group. This group is unlikely to lose their job except under extreme circumstances, and are relatively unenthusiastic about funding expansionary government programmes for reducing unemployment. Those not in secure jobs form a minority, and hence the democratic system does not deliver policies which would benefit them. This observation certainly has a ring of truth about it for those who witnessed the surprise victory of the Conservative party in the UK under John Major in 1991. Whatever their rhetoric, at the end of the day most western governments have all but abandoned a practical commitment to full employment. There were two main pillars of 'Keynesian' policy for 25 years after the second world war. First, a belief that 'full employment' was achievable, and that it was desirable. Second, a belief that governments could stabilise the economy around full employment by a 'countercyclical' demand management policy (boosting demand in recessions, restraining it in booms). Both of these pillars rested on the foundation that it was possible in the context of a big depression to have an expansion of output and employment that made everyone better off. Government spending would take people out of unemployment, and they would then consume goods, thus generating more employment and profits. Prachowny denies this, believing that an increase in employment cannot happen without a fall in real wages: an increase in employment which benefits the unemployed leads to a fall in the wages of those in employment. This notion has little empirical validity: indeed, most empirical analysis shows that the real wages of workers rise in booms. The power of those in employment to obtain higher wages is increased when unemployment is falling. More importantly, Prachowny does not take into account the fact that government spending is itself useful. There is a growing body of research in the US and elsewhere that public investment and education expenditure have a positive impact on productivity in the private sector. Just think of the huge costs imposed on British industry by the lack of an adequate transport infrastructure. Taking these factors together might indicate that the winners might be more numerous than Prachowny suggests. There is a clear truth in some of what Prachowny says. However, this book mentions neither poverty nor inequality. The years since 1980 have seen a dramatic increase in both poverty and inequality in most western economies. In European countries, the poverty is primarily related to unemployment: in the US it is primarily due to low wages for the unskilled. The real split is between the unskilled and the skilled. Job security is part of this difference (although since the shakeout of middle management and the financial sector, few jobs are secure in the old sense). The unskilled are becoming redundant technologically, and are competing with workers in China and eastern Europe. The relative wages of the unskilled are falling, and are likely to continue falling. The wages of the skilled have continued to rise. The unskilled are likely to endure more frequent or prolonged unemployment. The labour market is thus divided into two separate parts, which are driven by different factors. The growing social and economic distance between the skilled and the unskilled gives rise to the features that Prachowny highlights. The key feature is that the wages of the skilled are not related to those of the unskilled: but the taxes of the skilled are related to government expenditure. Those who benefit from relative private affluence rarely feel motivated to pay taxes to fund public affluence. The key developments in the labour market since 1980, and the politics of Thatcher and Reagan, are ignored by Prachowny who emphasises the continuity of the problem facing politicians. From an economist's perspective, this book is a strange brew. Most of the parts are not strong: neither theory nor empirics. The historical policy analysis of the US 1948-1990 is perhaps the most interesting chapter. At the end of the book, one is not only left to wonder whether the book has missed some of the most important developments: one is also left wondering whether the parts form a consistent whole. While the book provides interesting insights and a romp through several ideas, it should not be taken with much more than a pinch of salt.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Lottery ticket bonanza continues Sales of National Lottery tickets continued yesterday at a level not far behind Monday's total of 7.5m, Raymond Snoddy writes. Camelot, the lottery operator, said that by 6pm last night a 14m Pounds 1 tickets had been sold in the lottery's first two days, far above expectations. The sales are being helped by enormous publicity before Saturday's first multi-million pound jackpot draw. Camelot estimates that the top prize will be at least Pounds 2m and if the current level of interest is sustained it could be much higher. After only two days of ticket sales the five causes that will benefit from the lottery - arts, charities, national heritage, the millennium fund and sport - are already guaranteed a total payment of about Pounds 4m.</p>

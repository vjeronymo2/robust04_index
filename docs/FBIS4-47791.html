			<p>BFN     [Text] President Bill Clinton's special envoy is scheduled  to arrive in Luanda tomorrow, carrying a message for President  Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There has been a great deal of  speculation about the contents of the missive, but Ambassador  Jose Patricio clarifies the issue.    [Begin recording] [Patricio] There has been a great deal of  speculation about the letter. The letter has not yet been  delivered, and even the spokesman is not where our president is  right now. So, the news media should wait for the unfolding of  events instead of fabricating facts.    [Unidentified correspondent] So, the letter has definitely  not been delivered to the Angolan head of state.    [Patricio] No. As far as I know, the letter will be  delivered by Ambassador Paul Hare, President Bill Clinton's  special envoy, to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos during the  course of the week.    [Correspondent] Other media reports say in his letter the  U.S. president asks the government to give the governorship of  Huambo Province and the Ministry of Public Works to UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. Is that  true?    [Patricio] That is mere speculation. The contents of the  letter are still secret. [end recording]</p>

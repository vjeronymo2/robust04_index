			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: DEALING WITH MISS ETHEL  </P> <P> My wife was in the hospital recently for some relatively minor surgery and it  made a nervous wreck out of me.  </P> <P> I do not say that lightly. The only obvious genetic traits passed down by my  parents were my father's short legs and my mother's towering ability to worry.  </P> <P> So I paced the lobby of Tarzana Medical Center on my little short legs all  during my wife's surgery and worried myself into a frenzy.  </P> <P> Mom, had she not worried herself to death, would have been proud.  </P> <P> It occurred to me, however, on the fifth circle of the lobby that I had to do  something to alleviate the stress. It isn't easy pacing on short legs.  </P> <P> I thought about having a martini, but that probably wasn't a good idea at that  time of the morning and under those circumstances.  </P> <P> The hospital did not provide a cocktail lounge and I will not drink in bars  that open at 6 a.m. I have principles.  </P> <P> My second response to stress is to read. So I went into the hospital gift shop.  </P> <P> Hospital gift shops, for those who have not visited them lately, are the  province of old ladies with time on their hands. I met one of them on this day.  </P> <P> I could not quite read her name tag, so I am guessing when I say her name was  Ethel. She was somewhere in her mid-70s, maybe older.  </P> <P> When I selected a book, a pot of flowers and some newspapers, Ethel said,  "That's all you want?" There was a tone of incredulity in her voice.  </P> <P> "Is there something else I ought to be buying?"  </P> <P> "Suit yourself," she said.  </P> <P> Worry makes me snappish. Ethel was maybe 4-feet-9 and nearsighted. I could have  taken her in a fair fight, but it wouldn't have been right.  </P> <P> "What credit cards do you take?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Cash," Ethel said firmly, "I need cash. This isn't the Miami Hilton."  </P> <P> "I don't have cash," I said. "I have credit cards. Everyone takes credit cards.  Cash is going out of style."  </P> <P> "I don't have change," Ethel said.  </P> <P> That was my first indication that Ethel and I were operating on different  levels.  </P> <P> "You don't need change with credit cards," I said.  </P> <P> "I shouldn't even be here," Ethel said. "It's not my day. I don't know why I'm  here."  </P> <P> I took it Ethel was a volunteer and had been brought in on an emergency basis.  She wasn't happy about it.  </P> <P> "How about a check?" I said.  </P> <P> "Is it good?" she asked. "Don't get me into trouble."  </P> <P> "It's good," I said.  </P> <P> "Don't get me into trouble," she said again.  </P> <P> I wrote the check and handed Ethel my driver's license and a Citibank Visa as a  matter of habit.  </P> <P> "I don't take credit cards," Ethel said.  </P> <P> "It's for identification."  </P> <P> "My son works for Citibank," Ethel said. "He's only 42 and he's a vice  president."  </P> <P> She studied me in the manner of someone looking at a man who is over 42 and not  a vice president. What went wrong?  </P> <P> Then she said, "This card's no good. It expired in March."  </P> <P> "No," I said, "that's when the period started. See?" I pointed. " 'Valid from  03/01/89 to 02/91.' "  </P> <P> "Don't get me into trouble," she said. "I'm not even supposed to be here."  </P> <P> "The check is good," I said. "You're in safe hands."  </P> <P> "Your driver's license has expired!" she said suddenly. "It hasn't been good  for four years!"  </P> <P> I handed her a renewal card that indicated the expiration date had been  extended.  </P> <P> "It's good until July," I said triumphantly.  </P> <P> "Well," she said, "the picture doesn't look like you."  </P> <P> "Ethel," I said, impatience creeping into my voice, "how long have you been  doing this?"  </P> <P> "Who knows?" she said. "Forever. I need some other identification. I'm  suspicious about the picture."  </P> <P> I handed her my L. A. Times ID card. It is a card I use rarely as ultimate  proof of my worth and my existence. Only a media pass to Vatican City is more  impressive.  </P> <P> "Most doctors read the Herald Examiner," Ethel said, studying the card. "It has  more bad news. Doctors like bad news. What do you do?"  </P> <P> "I'm a nude model," I said. "Just OK the check so I can get out of here."  </P> <P> About then, I heard myself being paged. I left the gift shop with Ethel  watching me suspiciously.  </P> <P> "Where've you been?" an angry old man at the front desk demanded. "This is the  third time you've been paged."  </P> <P> Ethel had followed me across the lobby. "You didn't sign your check," she said.  "I knew there was something wrong!"  </P> <P> My wife was fine. I was exhausted.  </P></p>

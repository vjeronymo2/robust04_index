			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Furniture workers consider a merger FTAT, the furniture union, has held exploratory talks with several large unions including the TGWU general workers' grouping about a merger. Mr Colin Christopher, FTAT general secretary, said the recession 'has knocked us sideways'. The union lost 10 per cent of its membership last year and expects to go into deficit next year for the first time since the mid 1980s. Many larger unions would be interested in a merger because of its 32,000 members and considerable assets. 'We are still financially sound, but we have to look to the future and that might have to include a merger,' Mr Christopher said. 'We are just fishing around at the moment.' He believes the greatest industrial logic lies in a merger with the Ucatt construction union. But talks between the two have been called off because of organisational difficulties within Ucatt. FTAT has also spoken to the MSF technical union and the GMB general union, and talks are planned with the Usdaw shopworkers' union. Mr Christopher said FTAT would be 'a very attractive asset' for any large union, but stressed that, because of their craft tradition, members would not want to lose their identity in a merger and would expect to be offered their own section.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (5): Big chance for chosen suppliers - An important characteristic of Japanese vehicle producers in Europe is their desire to establish mutual trust with their European suppliers, as manifested in long-term relationships / Japan In Europe - UK suppliers score high marks with Japanese vehicle producers AFTER building up a sizeable assembly, presence in North America during the 1980s, Japanese vehicle manufacturers are focussing their attention on Europe in the 1990s. Based on existing proposals, output of Japanese-badged vehicles in Europe will amount to almost a million units a year during the latter part of the decade, spread through four countries - Hungary (Suzuki), the Netherlands (Mitsubishi), Spain (Nissan and Suzuki) and the UK (Honda, Nissan and Toyota). It is likely, moreover, that other ventures will be announced during the next few years to boost the volume still further. Rumours suggest that some of the smaller Japanese producers will link up with European partners to produce specialist models, and it is widely anticipated that Mazda will enter the European assembly arena in some form, despite its recent failure to reach an agreement with Ford. One unknown is the extent to which the Japanese have set their sights on producing in eastern Europe where the potential for market development is enormous. It is also possible, of course, that Honda, Nissan and Toyota may expand capacity, either at their existing facilities or on new sites. By far the most significant developments to date have taken place in the UK where both Honda and Toyota commenced car production towards the end of last year. Together with Nissan, which began UK production in 1986, it is estimated that these three will be producing more than 500,000 cars a year at their British plants in 1995. Clearly this represents a massive new business opportunity for their chosen component suppliers. For European - and especially British - component producers, the good news is that most requirements will be procured from local sources. Toyota estimates that it will be purchasing parts and assemblies from European suppliers to the value of Pounds 700m when its assembly target of 200,000 cars a year is reached in 1997. In addition, the company will be spending Pounds 50m annually in Europe on raw materials. Toyota has 160 European-based suppliers at present from ten countries in the European Community and Efta. Slightly more than half are from the UK and just over a quarter from Germany, while France accounts for around 17. The majority of these companies are European-owned, with 12 Euro-Japanese joint ventures and seven Japanese-owned operations making up the remainder. Local content - defined as the value of the car at the factory gate, less the Toyota content - amounts to 60 per cent currently and is scheduled to rise to 80 per cent at the end of 1994, six months earlier than originally planned. Nissan's assembly facilities in north east England are supplied by 198 European-based component producers, with no less than 132 operating from the UK. Other notable supplying countries are Germany (29), France (13) and Spain (11). Trailing far behind are Belgium, Ireland and Italy (three each), and Austria, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden (1 each). The relatively strong showing of Spain reflects Nissan's assembly presence in the country, and points to the company's purchasing function assuming a growing European dimension. Already steel is procured on a combined basis for both Spanish and UK operations, and it is probable that each location will become the lead buyer for designated parts and assemblies. European-owned companies have the lion's share of the business. Of Nissan's 198 European suppliers, 139 have no links at all with Japanese component producers, 24 have a technical agreement, 12 have a commercial agreement and 12 are joint ventures. Only 11 are wholly owned by Japanese groups. This year, Nissan anticipates spending Pounds 850m on components in Europe, based on the assembly of 270,000 cars. Local content amounts to around 83 per cent for the two models produced in the UK - Micra and Primera. The position is broadly similar at Honda whose British assembly facility sources from 150 European-based suppliers, (70 per cent of them British). Local content amounts to about 60 per cent presently. But as output builds up to the planned 100,000 units in 1995, local content is scheduled to rise to 80 per cent. At that stage Honda anticipates spending close to Pounds 500m a year with European component producers. It is clear that the Japanese have not been noticeably parochial in their choice of suppliers and have provided European companies with fair opportunities to win the business. This contrasts markedly with the position in North America where the establishment of Japanese vehicle assembly facilities has been accompanied by extensive investment by Japanese component suppliers. In addition to supplying the Japanese vehicle producers in North America, the expectation was that the US components sector would be something of a pushover, allowing contracts to be secured from the Big Three vehicle makers (Chrysler, Ford and General Motors). However, this has not happened to any significant degree, and instead many have over-extended themselves both financially and managerially. Japanese component producers' approach in Europe therefore has been more cautious. There is a lot of respect for the technical and manufacturing competence of European component producers, and a corresponding understanding that any attempt to barge in with heavy investment on greenfield sites would be a sure way of losing money. Also, it appears that Japanese vehicle manufacturers have provided their component producing compatriots with scant encouragement to set up new facilities in Europe, not least due to the political sensitivity of such moves. Instead, Japanese component groups with a mind to establish a European foot-hold have tended to favour co-operation rather than confrontation with their European counterparts. Thus a web of joint ventures, equity stakes and licensing agreements has evolved, and in some cases there have been full scale takeovers. In setting up their European assembly operations, Japanese vehicle producers have been meticulous in choosing their component suppliers. Toyota started its selection process in May 1989 - 3 1/2 years before output commenced - with a survey of local suppliers. An important characteristic of Japanese vehicle producers is their genuine desire to establish a spirit of mutual trust with their suppliers, as manifested in long-term relationships. Another notable feature is the Japanese companies' policy of setting up technical support teams to help in the development of production systems at suppliers. A key objective is to achieve continuously improved productivity levels. There is also the chance for European component suppliers to develop business through direct exports to Japan and other assembly plants of Japanese manufacturers worldwide. One of the most celebrated instances concerns Bosch whose factory in Wales supplies the alternator for all Micras built in Japan, as well as those produced in the UK. Toyota reports that several European component producers have won business for the supply of parts for Japanese-built Carinas. As yet, though, the flow of European components to Japan is strictly limited - and it would be wrong to suppose that the business will develop significantly - but the examples so far indicate that there is some potential. If there is any cloud on the horizon for the European components industry it is that success for the Japanese assembly plants may be countered by declining business among some of the less competitive European vehicle manufacturers. The impressive rates of productivity and concomitant low unit costs achieved by Nissan's UK operations are likely to be replicated eventually by Honda and Toyota, with the result that the threat of closure will hang over the region's less efficient vehicle producing plants. But for British component suppliers - still licking their wounds as a result of the erosion of the UK's vehicle manufacturing sector over the past couple of decades - the arrival of the Japanese presents the opportunity to restore former fortunes. The evidence to date indicates that the opportunities will not be lost.</p>

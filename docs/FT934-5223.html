			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Strike call adds to Italy unrest Italy's engineering unions have called out 400,000 workers for a one-day strike on December 10 in protest at growing unemployment. The strike call comes as Fiat said it would cut its workforce by 5 per cent and Olivetti, the computers and office equipment group, said it wanted a further 2,000 job cuts among its 18,500 Italian workers. The move underlines growing labour unrest. Last night petrol pump operators began a three-day strike; and throughout the rest of the week stoppages have been threatened by various groups of employees in air transport. Unemployment, now close to 11 per cent of the working population, has particularly hit the engineering and metal-working sectors. The unions say the recession is so severe that the Ciampi government must consider reducingthe 48-hour working week and resort to 'solidarity contracts' - a formula which permits work-sharing arrangements and temporary reductions in working hours. The unions are anxious to instil in both the government and among Confindustria, the industrialists' association, a more strategic view of industry. The issue of excess labour, they say, must be considered within the broader context of Italy's industrial policy and priorities. The employers, they claim, are too concerned with the mechanics of job cuts and plant closures.</p>

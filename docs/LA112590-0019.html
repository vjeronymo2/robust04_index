			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SWISS ROAD BUILDER TREKS INTO HISTORY  </P> <P> If Swiss geologist Toni Hagen had climbed instead of trekked for 40 years, he  could have conquered Mt. Everest 1,500 times.  </P> <P> Hagen, 72, estimates he has covered 5,550 miles of this Himalayan kingdom since  he came 40 years ago to help build Nepal's first highway.  </P> <P> "I have crisscrossed the whole country, and there is no corner where I have not  been," he said.  </P> <P> Recently King Birendra enacted a constitution, establishing a constitutional  monarchy and declaring a multiparty democracy. But in 1950, Nepal was one of  the world's last forbidden kingdoms. Few foreigners had been allowed to enter,  and none had explored it. It had no roads.  </P> <P> The government, seeking to build a highway through the Himalayas and across the  plains to India, sought help from Switzerland, another mountainous nation.  Hagen was asked to make a geological survey.  </P> <P> There already were a few cars in the kingdom: limousines that were carted over  narrow mule paths by human porters. Thirty-six men, marching in four sweating  rows, carried nine wooden beams bearing a shiny new automobile destined for the  aristocracy.  </P> <P> Other people, including Hagen, walked -- from Mt. Everest in the north to the  Indian border in the south.  </P> <P> Four decades later, Hagen still leaves his home in Switzerland's Lenzerheide  hill resort for an annual trek in Nepal. A stocky man with thinning white hair,  he reckons the trekking and a sense of humor "keeps me youthful."  </P> <P> Once, during his travels as a surveyor, Hagen reached what was then the kingdom  of Mustang on the northwestern border with Tibet. The next day the queen of  Mustang sent a message that she was suffering from sunburn and could Hagen  help?  </P> <P> Hagen sent the best he had -- a pain-relieving ointment that at least would do  no harm. "She was just curious," Hagen said. "She wanted to get some contact  with me."  </P> <P> The royal couple invited Hagen to tea the next day. The queen said the ointment  was excellent.  </P> <P> "I was not a doctor but had to carry a lot of medicines," Hagen said. "I had to  distribute them because the local people considered me to be a doctor."  </P> <P> Another essential was the sack of silver coins that would take care of his  expenses for six months at a time.  </P> <P> "The chief porter who was carrying the coins knew he was the most important man  in the group," Hagen said. "Whenever we came to a resting place in a village,  he would put down his basket under a tree with a big noise.  </P> <P> "But imagine doing that in any other country at that time, or today in Nepal.  The money would be gone in no time."  </P> <P> One of Hagen's most treasured possessions is his trekking permit, a document  now issued to tens of thousands of tourists every year.  </P> <P> But Hagen's slip of paper carries a unique distinguishing mark -- the numeral  1. It was the first ever issued.  </P></p>

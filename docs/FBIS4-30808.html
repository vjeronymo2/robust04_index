			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rahija Mesic from the Press Center of the 7th </F> Army Corps]    [Text] [words indistinct] tanks, the Chetniks in this  region are also using chemical agents in order to lessen the  combat strength of our units. After they had used chemical  agents several times, they launched infantry attacks, which, as  in the past, were futile and unsuccessful. Unable to realize  their intentions, the Chetniks shelled civilian facilities  according to their old scenario, though not as intensively as in  the past few days.    The aggressor has used all the available weapons in the  offensive on our defense lines. Fresh forces are coming from  the so-called Yugoslavia. This is evident from the mobilization  calls sent via the aggressor's media. The media reports that  brothers from Nis will help (?these) Serbs in liberating Serbian  territories. To what extent the aggressor considers important  the regions of Bugojno, Turbe, and Vlasic is evident from the  fact that it has issued mobilization calls to women. The  Serbian media is devoting most space to appeals for blood  donors. This is the best illustration of the losses that the  Golden Lilies of the 7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina have inflicted on them.</p>

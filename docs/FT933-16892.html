			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: AAH extends over-the-counter operations AAH Holdings, the acquisitive pharmaceuticals distribution group, has extended its over-the-counter operations with the acquisition of M&amp;S Toiletries and the connected Beauty Concessions - collectively MSBC - for an initial Pounds 15.6m in shares, cash and loan notes. MSBC is a wholesale and retail distributor of toiletries, cosmetics and other pharmacy OTC products. Edinburgh-based, it has 'a strong position in the Scottish market and has been building market share in the north of England', said AAH. In the year to June 30 1992, MSBC's sales (adjusted for inter-company transactions) were Pounds 25m and are forecast to be not less than Pounds 29m in the current year. Pre-tax profits in 1992 were Pounds 900,000 and, on a pro forma basis, are warranted to be at least Pounds 2.1m for the 12 months to completion. Of the initial Pounds 15.6m, the 2.39m shares to be issued to the vendors will be retained for at least six months. Further consideration of no more than Pounds 1m in loan notes will depend on the valuation of assets at completion. Net assets at June 30 1993 were not less than Pounds 4m.</p>

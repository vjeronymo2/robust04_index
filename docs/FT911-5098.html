			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / New bank offers City central role in Europe, says Major THE CITY of London will be turned into the 'financial crossroads' between east and west with the opening of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr John Major forecast yesterday. The prime minister, speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the bank which will have Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.9bn) capital to help former European communist countries develop market economies, emphasised that Britain intended to play a 'central role' in the future development of Europe. He told government leaders, finance ministers and officials from the 39 countries and two European institutions that have set up the bank that it was a 'natural fit' that London, as Europe's premier financial centre, should become the bank's home. It had a wealth of experience in the privatisation of state-owned businesses. The establishment of market economies in eastern Europe would not be easy but the European bank would make the transition a little easier and less painful. Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said the bank's creation was a step towards the development of a 'great Europe'. It would be the bank's job to encourage democracy and he warned that democratic institutions in eastern Europe would be the most fragile and threatened by the hardships of restructuring. Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, said it was unique for three reasons: it was the first institution of the post-Cold War period; the first institution of a united Europe; and the first institution of a new world order. However, the fact that European Community countries have a majority holding in the bank's capital appears to pose difficulties for the US. Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, struck one of the few discordant notes. He said that developments in Europe contained a special problem for the US. 'We should not be asked to accept the lowest common denominator that emerges from EC debate as the basis for international negotiation and we cannot be asked to negotiate the same issue twice - once with the EC as a whole and then again with the individual member states,' he said. Mr Attali said the new bank brought together former political, economic and ideological adversaries 'who would have found it unimaginable two years ago to be seated round this table today'. The bank has an overt political goal in that the former communist states it has been set up to help must be 'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics.' While it is likely to be some time before the bank has a significant impact on eastern Europe, its eastern and central European member states have high expectations. Mr Jan Bielecki, prime minister of Poland, called on the become an EC member. Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, drew a parallel between the creation of the bank and the setting up of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank after the Second World War.

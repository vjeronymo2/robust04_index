			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines returns to the black Northwest Airlines, the US carrier that returned to the stock market last month after being taken private five years earlier, yesterday reported net income of Dollars 18.3m in its first quarter, compared with net losses of Dollars 100.3m last time. The profit was in sharp contrast with the losses reported a day earlier by American Airlines and USAir, which said they had been hit by a combination of exceptionally severe winter weather and low fares. However, Northwest's figures were flattered by two non-trading items. It gained Dollars 9.2m before tax from an accounting item relating to its employee stock ownership plan, and a further Dollars 12.7m from a cut in depreciation expenses following a revaluation of some of its aircraft. Operating revenues rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn and earnings per share were 5 cents, compared with losses of Dollars 1.86 last time. One reason why Northwest's figures suffered less badly than those of American Airlines and USAir is that its route structure is not concentrated in the north-east of the US, where the worst of the winter weather struck. The airline is also benefiting from wage and benefit concessions worth Dollars 886m over the next three years, under an agreement with its employees which will give them a 27.4 per cent stake in the company. Mr John Dasburg, president and chief executive, said seasonal factors usually produced a loss in the first quarter. He attributed the results to the company's strategy of concentrating on profitable flying. During the quarter Northwest rescheduled operations at its Memphis hub to boost traffic and increase profits. It also announced new services in four North American markets feeding its hubs. Internationally, the airline announced a new Pacific spring schedule including extra flights on its Detroit-Tokyo, Los Angeles-Osaka and Tokyo-Shanghai-Beijing routes, and eliminated its unprofitable Los Angeles-Sydney and Seattle-Seoul routes. Northwest and its European partner, KLM Royal Dutch, also replaced first class with world business class accommodation on intercontinental flights.</p>

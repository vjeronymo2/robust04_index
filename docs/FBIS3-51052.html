			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As a consequence of the moralization wave that is  sweeping across the country in the wake of the CPI's  [Congressional Investigating Committee] discoveries, the cost of  public works has dropped by almost half. Construction companies  are now charging much less for their services. The decline in  costs has prompted the government to study the formation of a  special commission to renegotiate contracts. With just half the  allocation to extend the Fernao Dias Highway, which links Belo  Horizonte with Sao Paulo, it will be possible to finish the job.    A high-ranking DNER [National Highway Department] official  has given another reason for the drop in public works costs: the  DNER has paid for the contracted services on time, thus  preventing the overinvoicing by the construction companies. The  IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] and the World Bank are  excited with this trend.</p>

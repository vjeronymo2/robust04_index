			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Stotler &amp; Co. Charged: The Securities and Exchange Commission filed  administrative charges against Stotler &amp; Co., a securities subsidiary of  the company once headed by former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten  (Cash) Mahlmann.  </P> <P> The SEC accused Chicago-based Stotler of selling or trying to sell government  securities without being a member of a registered securities association, such  as the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. The three-page order called for a  public hearing before an administrative law judge. A woman who declined to  identify herself when she answered the telephone at Stotler's offices in  Chicago said no one was available to answer questions about the charges from a  reporter.  </P></p>

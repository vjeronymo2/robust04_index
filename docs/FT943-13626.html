			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / North-west reports industry busy Industry and commerce in north-west England is at their busiest for four years, even though nearly three-quarters of companies are still operating at less than full capacity, say the region's 12 chambers of commerce. The chambers' survey of the second quarter of this year says confidence is high but no longer growing, while a previously steady recovery in investment has fallen slightly. The survey covered 1,032 companies employing about 100,000 people, split almost evenly between manufacturers and the service sector. The region, the largest in the UK after London and the south-east, accounts for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product. Domestic sales and orders returned to an upward trend that started early last year, after faltering in the first quarter. Export markets also appeared to be expanding again, with 25 per cent more companies reporting rises than falls in orders, one of the highest balance levels since 1990. There were also signs of more jobs, with 16 per cent more companies recruiting than shedding labour and more than half staying the same size. Recruitment is expected to increase in the third quarter, with 18 per cent more companies saying they would take on people than shed them. The chambers say recovery is still fragile, however. Capacity is shallow in some sectors and nothing more than a slow, steady growth can be sustained without affecting cashflow, costs and prices and pushing up demand for imports. Investment in plant and machinery was ahead of last year, but less money is going into buildings. This reflects continuing rationalisation of space.</p>

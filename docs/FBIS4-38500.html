			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Mutual non-payments remain a characteristic feature  of the Russian economy. This has been confirmed by the latest  figures from the State Statistics Committee. As of 1 April 1994  the total debt of industrial enterprises, construction  businesses, transport and agriculture amounted to 93 trillion  rubles.    According to the estimates of the economics institute for  the  problems of the transition period, the budget deficit for the  first quarter has already reached 11 percent of the Gross  National Product. Let me remind you that in its draft budget  for 1994, the government undertook not to exceed the 10 percent  mark for its deficit.    There are still budgetary debts to a number of industries.  This in turn leads to non-payments on the part of the  enterprises, not only to each other and to banks, but to the  budget as well.</p>

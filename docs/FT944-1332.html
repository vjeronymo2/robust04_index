			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Billion dollar patents windfall for Glaxo Glaxo, the UK drugs company, could earn several billion dollars in extra revenues as a result of changes in US patent laws. The change in patent expiry arises from Gatt provisions which call call for a harmonisation of patent laws. In the US, this means replacing the patent protection term of 17 years from the date the patent was granted with a 20-year protection period from the date the patent was filed. The change in the rules appears to add 18 months to a US patent protecting Glaxo's ulcer treatment Zantac, the world's best selling drug. Zantac has annual sales in the US of about Dollars 2bn and several companies, most notably Switzerland's Ciba, have been preparing to launch rivals when the patent expires in December 1995. Zantac's patent was granted 18 months after filing. Several drugs companies with products facing US patent expiry over the next few years might also benefit. Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US might be able to extend the patent protection on its top drug Capoten by an extra six months, potentially worth almost Dollars 1bn in revenues. The rule change implies that any product for which a patent was granted less than three years after filing should have its patent protection extended, said Mr Robin Nott, an intellectual property consultant with international law firm Baker and McKenzie. He said that the law takes effect from June 1995 and applies retrospectively. 'It could even appear that a patent expires and then revives,' he said. If more than three years passed between patent filing and granting, the expiry patent protection would remain unchanged, he said. Bristol-Myers Squibb said it was still studying the impact of the rule change on all its products. Its best-seller Capoten, a heart drug, loses its patent protection in August 1995. But the company confirmed that patent granting took place two and a half years after filing, implying that patent protection could be extended by another six months. UK drug company, Wellcome, said that its best seller, anti-viral Retrovir, whose US patent expires in 1997, would not be affected because more than three years passed between patent filing and granting. Manufacturers that had planned to launch rival products once a patent had expired would be able to continue with the planned launched of their products, according to the new rules. However, the patent holder might be able to claim appropriate compensation payments.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WAR PLAN IN IRAQ: 'DECAPITATE' LEADERSHIP;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: THE JOINT CHIEFS BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO OUST THE IRAQIS WOULD BE AIR  STRIKES DESIGNED TO KILL HUSSEIN.  </P> <P> If the United States and Iraq go to war, the U.S. military plans to unleash a  relentless air campaign designed in part to "decapitate" the Iraqi leadership  by targeting President Saddam Hussein, his family, his senior commanders, his  palace guard and even his mistress, according to senior U.S. military planners.  </P> <P> A recently completed Joint Chiefs of Staff targeting review concludes that the  most effective way to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait is not with a ground  attack, but through the use of massive air strikes to kill Hussein and decimate  his war-making capacity by destroying scores of critical military and  industrial sites.  </P> <P> The Joint Chiefs publicly acknowledge that U.S. ground forces in the region,  which currently number about 100,000 soldiers and Marines, are not sufficient  to dislodge the 265,000 Iraqi troops and 2,200 tanks now in and near Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Air power is the only answer available to our country in this circumstance,"  Air Force Chief of Staff Michael J. Dugan said after touring U.S. air bases on  the Arabian Peninsula.  </P> <P> Dugan would not divulge whether U.S. officials know the precise whereabouts of  Hussein or members of his inner circle, nor would he say whether senior Bush  Administration officials had signed off on the plan to target them in an air  attack.  </P> <P> An air strike deliberately aimed at the Iraqi president and members of his  family could prove controversial because attacks on civilian leaders are  generally considered out of bounds, even in wartime.  </P> <P> The United States bombed Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi's home and other targets  in Tripoli in 1986, but Kadafi escaped serious injury. U.S. officials defended  the raid as an effort to punish and deter terrorism, but a number of nations  condemned it as a violation of international law.  </P> <P> To support the U.S. war plan in the Persian Gulf, which revolves around the  massive use of air power, the Air Force alone has ringed Iraq with an air  armada of 420 combat planes, nearly equal to the fleet dedicated to defending  Europe against the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In all, the United States has 1,000 Air Force, Marine and Navy aircraft poised  to strike Iraq from three aircraft carriers and 30 bases in the region. The  available facilities are so taxed that even if the United States and its allies  wanted to bring substantially more aircraft into the region, they could not,  Air Force officials said.  </P> <P> Gen. Dugan and his senior deputies, in several hours of interviews on his  aircraft traveling to and from Saudi Arabia, said that U.S. military commanders  from all services agree that air power is the best option for defeating Hussein  and his million-man army.  </P> <P> "I don't see us making a big (ground) invasion" of Kuwait, Dugan said, noting  that attacking forces generally need a three-to-one advantage in manpower to  dislodge an entrenched defensive force.  </P> <P> To attempt to beat Iraq on the ground risks "destroying Kuwait in order to save  it," Dugan said.  </P> <P> By using air power against targets in Iraq, on the other hand, "you would  attempt to convince his population that he and his regime cannot protect them,"  Dugan said. "If there is a nation that cannot defend its people against these  intruding foreigners -- protect their lines of communication, their means of  production, their cities -- that brings a great burden for their ruler."  </P> <P> Dugan, a fighter pilot with more than 4,500 flying hours and 300 combat  missions in Vietnam, acknowledged that air power has its limits. One cannot  predict how a population or its leaders will respond to a bombing campaign, he  and other Air Force officers said.  </P> <P> Nor can air power drive people out of jungle sanctuaries, Dugan said. "But  there's not much jungle where we're going. You don't have to get within a few  yards to attack them, intimidate them, kill them."  </P> <P> The effect of air power can be diluted, even negated, by constraints placed  upon its use by civilian leaders, senior Air Force officials noted. Most Air  Force officers believe to this day that if they had been allowed to bomb North  Vietnam without limits the United States would have won the war.  </P> <P> Dugan said that American political authorities had learned from Vietnam and  would approve unfettered air strikes against a broad range of Iraqi targets.  "This wouldn't be a Vietnam-style operation, nibbling around the edges. The way  to hurt you is at home, it's not out in the woods somewhere. We're looking for  centers of gravity where air power could make a difference early on," Dugan  said.  </P> <P> There is a long and bitter debate among military officers and historians  outside the Air Force over the utility of strategic bombing. While air power  advocates argue that the bombing campaigns against Germany and Japan won World  War II, that contention is still in question. Many officers contend that only  "ground pounders" -- the infantry -- can take and hold ground and ultimately  end a conflict.  </P> <P> But, the Air Force chief argued, "Air power, in peace and war, brings a special  kind of psychological impact. . . . I would not argue that air power alone can  be decisive. But air power is irreplaceable and absolutely essential."  </P> <P> The current Persian Gulf war plan calls for an intense allied air campaign,  probably beginning at night, to quickly establish absolute air superiority,  officials said. The immediate military targets, in order, would be air defense  installations; airfields and aircraft; ballistic missile launchers;  communications, command and control centers; munitions depots; arms production  plants, including chemical, biological and nuclear weapons facilities, and  concentrations of tanks and other armor.  </P> <P> At the same time, Air Force officials said they would like to take the fight to  Baghdad, to central command centers, to Hussein's suspected redoubts and to  other targets specifically chosen to break the Iraqi spirit.  </P> <P> "Hussein would realize very shortly into hostilities that he wouldn't have his  air power over the battlefield. Then it's all over. It's a matter of how much  pain you want to take before you quit," said Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas R.  Ferguson, commander of the Aeronautical Systems Division.  </P> <P> The primary targets are predictable military objectives, but wars are not  usually won by blowing up airfields and bomb factories, Dugan explained.  </P> <P> "That's a nice list of targets, and I might be able to accept those, but that's  not enough. I want to know what is unique about Iraq. What is unique about  Iraqi culture that they put very high value on? What is it that psychologically  would make an impact on the population and the regime in Iraq?" Dugan asked.  </P> <P> He said that about two weeks ago he assigned a team to find Iraqi military  defectors, knowledgeable professors, Iraqi expatriates and journalists who  recently have visited Baghdad to learn more about Iraqi culture and the mind of  Hussein.  </P> <P> As a result of that effort, Dugan said "a better list" of high-value targets in  Iraq was developed. The list stressed the importance of attacking Hussein and  his inner circle, but beyond that, Dugan would not detail the potential Iraqi  leverage points he intends to try to destroy.  </P> <P> If an attack is ordered, the full Air Force arsenal would be brought to bear:  B-52s, Stealth attack planes, F-15E ground attack fighters, F-111s, F-16s, F-4G  anti-radar jets, A-10s, all carrying the latest armament. The battle would be  coordinated at central command headquarters and a number of tactical control  stations in the field, all receiving data from AWACS, RC-135s, RF-4s and other  reconnaissance aircraft.  </P> <P> Several B-52s have been equipped with a new Israeli 50-mile-range cruise  missile known as Have Naps, and the Air Force has requested accelerated  delivery of hundreds more of the highly accurate weapons, officials said.  </P> <P> Navy and Marine Corps air and sea power -- as well as forces from numerous  other nations who have joined the United States in Saudi Arabia -- would also  be used to suppress Iraqi air defenses and destroy the 550-plane Iraqi air  force, planners said.  </P> <P> Estimates of the time required to accomplish the mission vary. Some pilots  assert that the job can be done in a matter of hours; more circumspect  commanders plan on several days to as long as two weeks.  </P> <P> The optimism, some might say arrogance, about the superiority of allied air  power stems from several key assumptions about the Iraqi air force, its weapons  and its tactics. U.S. officials discount the quality of the force based on its  performance in the eight-year Iran-Iraq War, saying that Iraqi pilots bombed  from 20,000 or 30,000 feet and often missed their targets by that much.  </P> <P> They also contend that Iraqi pilots, largely trained and equipped by the  Soviets, are heavily dependent on ground controllers and aren't allowed the  lethal "free play" practiced by American fighter pilots.  </P> <P> Thus the Air Force intends to locate and destroy the Iraqi ground control  stations and leave their pilots blind. The Air Force has deployed four RC-135  electronic intelligence-gathering planes in Saudi Arabia to locate these  installations and eavesdrop on all kinds of Iraqi voice and data  communications.  </P> <P> The RC-135s, modified Boeing 707s jammed full of sophisticated computers and  electronics gear, have traditionally been used to gather strategic intelligence  on the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Dugan said "it won't take very many minutes" to destroy the Iraqi air force --  if the planes come up to challenge American pilots. But he and other officials  acknowledged that the Iraqis could be troublesome for many weeks if they  disperse their planes and send them up in small numbers to harass allied  fighters. There is already some evidence that Hussein has ordered his aircraft  moved to widely separated airfields to avoid being destroyed on the ground.  </P> <P> Iraqi missiles, too, could present an "irritant" if the Iraqis conceal them and  launch them in small numbers, the general said.  </P> <P> "I don't mean to tell you we won't lose airplanes, but it's a manageable risk,"  said Lt. Gen. Jimmie V. Adams, Air Force deputy chief of staff for plans and  operations. "We have wall-to-wall, no-kidding fighter pilots in Saudi right  now."  </P></p>

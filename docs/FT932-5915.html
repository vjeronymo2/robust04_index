			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: Il Pirata at St Etienne - Opera St Etienne, a bustling city of medium size and no great visual distinction about 30 miles south-west of Lyons, has developed for itself an enviable reputation for fostering the arts. In musical terms, the hub of activity is the Centre de Creation Lyrique, Musicale et Choregraphique - 25 years old, a lively place whose activities have attracted a degree of attention and interest disproportionate to the city's size and the centre's age. Massenet, born in St Etienne, figures as the Centre's patron saint: the biennial Massenet Festival, only a few years old, has already engendered wave-making Massenet re-discoveries and recordings. The seasonal programming of St Etienne opera reflects a similar vigour in artistic policy, with interesting rarities dotted amidst the more conventional fare. The choice of Bellini's Pirata (1827) to round out the current season was typical: a work loved by Bellini devotees as a landmark in the development of Italian Romantic opera, but still not entirely assured of its place in the repertory. Callas, who inspired a famous 1950s Scala revival, left unrivalled recordings, studio and 'private', of the heroine Imogene's long final number, whose dreamy F major cantilena followed by stormy F minor cabaletta can stand as one of the great confluence-points of bel canto vocal writing and high-keyed dramatic situation. As a break from all the ceremonies, celebrations and raging controversies of the new Lyons Opera House (whose opening performances I reviewed last weekend), a trip to St Etienne for the Sunday-afternoon Pirata matinee was just the thing. The two theatres, the brand-new Lyons one and the 1960s-ish St Etienne arts complex, could hardly be more different. Comfortless 1990s high-tech glamour versus plain decoration, populist comfort and a theatre accessibly wide in layout: on grounds of user-friendliness the smaller Midi city wins every contest. The Bellini performance, with two specialists - the tenor Rockwell Blake in the title role, the soprano Lucia Aliberti as Imogene - at the head of the cast-list, was carefully if sometimes too cautiously conducted by the St Etienne musical director Patrick Fournillier (whose growing reputation as a Massenite will next season be tested in the new Welsh National production of Cendrillon). Blake's tone may sometimes strike the ear unpleasingly, but his style and presence (even in spite of panto-pirate get-up) are so cultivated and convinced that one soon learns to tolerate passing drynesses of sound. Aliberti, a technically ill-finished Covent Garden Lucia and Violetta not long ago, has developed some way since then: the shadow of Callas still falls heavy over her vocal manner and utterance, but no longer in a way to suggest only immature mimicry. Unfortunately, however, a very large fly was trapped in the afternoon's ointment of bel canto pleasure: a production heavily burdened by the French vogue for deconstructing operatic narrative - which now mostly seems to mean reducing it to a rubbish-heap of modern-opera cliches. I wrote last weekend of the new Lyons Tales of Hoffmann, removed to a mad-house; in St Etienne, what went under the name of Il pirata was a time-travelling melange of send-up Romantic opera and violent mad-house incident, with the hints of concentration-camp guards and doctors to spice up various scenes. In both shows, poverty of producer's inspiration got itself dressed up as high-fashion experiment. But the question thus raised seems to me a rather trickier one: at what point in modern-opera staging does representation of human frailty and physical handicap become opportunistic, even salacious? It would, of course, be both improper and, indeed, impossible to prescribe precise boundaries of acceptable taste; nevertheless, both these productions seemed to me to be worryingly out for kicks.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ARNIE'S ARMY ON ITS FINAL MARCH  </P> <P> An era will end at St. Andrews this week when Arnold Palmer walks down the 18th  fairway for the last time after 30 years as a living legend of the British  Open.  </P> <P> Palmer, approaching his 61st birthday, confirmed today that this was to be his  final Open, appropriately at the same course where he played in the most  venerable of the golf championships for the first time in 1960.  </P> <P> In all, Palmer has played 21 Opens, winning in 1961 and 1962.  </P> <P> Recognized as the man who resurrected the championship to its current exalted  status by persuading his fellow American players to follow him across the  Atlantic, he believes the time has come to fade into the background.  </P> <P> "I think it's appropriate I don't play any more, particularly if I keep  shooting the kind of scores I've been shooting recently," he said.  "Concentration is the major thing I lack today. I can remember when I played  and it didn't really matter if I was swinging good or bad. It was all about  what my mind was telling me at the time.  </P></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Venezuela's slip from spoils to scarcity / Examining how a two-party national political scene is disintegrating THE TWO parties which have run Venezuela since its return to democracy in 1958 are struggling in the face of elections this year. The leaders of the parties - Democratic Action (AD) and the Social Christian Copei - used to thrive by judicious division of the country's oil wealth among the elite groups which, with them, ran the country: business, trade unions and the military. Now that is over. Oil income has fallen sharply and a system of government equipped to divide spoils has found it almost impossible to allocate scarce resources. The parties, especially their leaders, are widely blamed for Venezuela's decade-long economic decline. Of the leading candidates for the December presidential election, only one, former president Mr Rafael Caldera, can be described as a politician of the old school, but he is not standing for a traditional party. Mr Caldera, 77, was forced to defect from Copei, the party he founded, to stand for president this time. As the candidate of the Movement to Socialism (MAS), he is sharing the lead in opinion polls, with support of up to 30 per cent. Mr Caldera has managed, by shifting parties, to avoid the perception that he is an party machinator in the old style. He has catered to popular demonology; his populist campaign is attacking President Carlos Andres Perez, now suspended from office on corruption charges, and the latter's economic reform package. Mr Caldera is also laying into the discredited leaders of the traditional parties, known as the cogollos. The other front-runner, say opinion polls, is Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, 50, governor of the important western oil state of Zulia and Copei's presidential candidate. A man from outside the party mainstream, he defeated the traditional Copei runner, Mr Eduardo Fernandez, in a primary. Mr Fernandez suffered because he was too closely identified with the cogollos. Now, says Mr Anbal Romero, a political scientist close to Mr Fernandez, Copei is 'a party without a candidate that has a candidate without a party'. Much of the old AD party machinery is also withholding support from its party's candidate, Mr Claudio Fermn, 43. The polls show him, also chosen by primary, attracting less than 10 per cent support. For the moment, links to AD appear to be more of an electoral liability than an asset, in part because of the deep unpopularity of Mr Perez, an AD veteran. Polls say Mr Andres Velasquez of the left-wing Causa R and governor of the eastern industrial state of Bolvar, is attracting support in the percentage high-teens, often from disaffected AD voters. Despite apparent growing momentum behind Causa R, Mr Velasquez is given only an outside chance of winning the presidency. Some politicians with contacts in the military say there is also doubt over whether the armed forces would accept a Causa R administration. So some analysts think Mr Velasquez, still only 39, might be do well to throw his support behind Mr Caldera, to form a powerful left-leaning coalition. Then he could benefit by a degree of power under a Caldera presidency and position himself for a future presidential race. Left or right, a future president will have to confront, sooner or later, the dire state of Venezuelan government finances - which will be only partly ameliorated if proposed tax legislation becomes law - and the deplorable condition of public services. It is difficult to see how these problems can be resolved in a non-inflationary manner without further fundamental reform of the state. Yet such reform is almost a taboo word for Venezuelan politicians seeking election. Mr Alvarez Paz is the candidate most closely associated with reform. When he secured the nomination in early May, euphoria ensued in financial markets. Yet what may be popular with bankers may be an electoral liability: Mr Alvarez Paz is thought likely to have to downplay economic reform in his campaign. Even if he wins, the governor will be a president elected by a minority and unlikely to have a secure majority in Congress. In fact, whoever wins, Congress is likely to be more fragmented - because of the declining popularity of the traditional parties and the fact that, as in 1988, half the deputies in the lower house will be elected from constituencies, rather than from the traditional party slate. The legislature will also probably be antagonistic to reform. According to some, potential antagonism between the presidency and Congress will be accentuated by the effort to impeach Mr Perez - sucessful so far - which legislators may try to emulate against other unpopular presidents. All of which suggests Venezuela will remain difficult to govern for the foreseeable future. Asked how he rated the chances of the next president ruling constitutionally for his full five-year term, Mr Romero answered: 'Not very high, I'm afraid.'</p>

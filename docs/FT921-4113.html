			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Lamont steals Labour's thunder: Surprise package targets low income voters - Major set to announce April 9 election today THE TORIES' bid for a fourth term in office was launched yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, with a Budget calculated to steal Labour's thunder by cutting taxes for the lower-paid. The measures, introducing a surprise 20 per cent lower band of income tax to benefit low-income voters, are expected to pave the way for the announcement today by Mr John Major, the prime minister, of April 9 as the general election date. Mr Lamont not only unveiled the lower band of income tax for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income, he also pledged extra help for poorer pensioners and extended assistance to small businesses and the car industry. The chancellor said government borrowing would double in 1992-93 to Pounds 28bn, unsettling the City. Speaking to a packed House of Commons, Mr Lamont set the tone of his tensely awaited Budget package by adopting another Labour party policy in announcing that Britain's unique and much-criticised two-part annual budget process would be scrapped. Mr Lamont said that from December 1993 the government's Autumn Statement spending plans and the traditional springtime revenue-raising Budget would be combined. But he held back from widely tipped tax moves such as cutting the basic rate of income tax by 1p from 25p in the pound or raising tax allowances by more than the rate of inflation. Mr Lamont limited the overall Budget 'giveaway' to just under Pounds 1.5bn in 1992-93 by raising tobacco and leaded petrol taxes and vehicle excise duty by more than the rate of inflation. The Pounds 1.77bn cost of the new lower income tax band will also be financed by freezing some tax allowances and drawing on Pounds 680m saved from the postponement of the abolition of stamp duty on securities transactions and other tax changes that have been announced since last year's Budget. Mr Lamont hailed his second Budget as one 'for the recovery' which built on the supply side economic reforms of the 1980s. But its immediate impact was to present an uncomfortable challenge to the Labour benches. Although the government's income tax reductions concentrated at the lower end of the earnings scale, Labour last night pledged to reverse the measures if elected. The tax cut for the coming 1992-93 financial year was lower than the Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn predicted by many commentators. But the chancellor forecast higher public sector borrowing requirements (PSBR) than the City had expected for both this financial year and the next. He estimated the 1991-92 PSBR at Pounds 13.8bn, or 2 1/4 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with City expectations of about Pounds 12bn, and the Pounds 7.9bn deficit forecast in his first Budget. For 1992-93, Mr Lamont forecast a PSBR of Pounds 28.1bn, or 4 1/2 per cent of GDP, against City expectations of Pounds 25bn and government predictions in last November's Autumn Statement of about Pounds 19bn. But he stuck to his commitment of balancing the budget over the economic cycle. The package provoked a mixed initial reaction on financial markets, with equities moving higher. However, sterling and gilt-edged securities fell in value on concern about the high borrowing requirement. The market reaction suggested that there would be no early fall in interest rates. But Mr Lamont later indicated to lobby correspondents that he did not rule out an interest rate cut during the election campaign. Although such action would be virtually unprecedented, he said it would be 'a matter for me and the Bank of England'. In his Budget speech, the chancellor painted a picture in which economic recovery had effectively been postponed for a year. He forecast 1 per cent growth of GDP this year with growth quickening as the year progresses. The Treasury now expects GDP to grow by nearly 2 per cent in the 12 months to the second half of this year, and by 3 per cent in the year to June 1993. Retail price inflation is expected to fall to 3 3/4 per cent at the end of this year, and 3 1/4 per cent by mid-1993 from 4 1/4 per cent in the final quarter of 1991. However, the chancellor said he was confident that the lower inflation combined with the interest rate cuts of the past year would help recovery. The tax cuts would assist this trend. The income tax changes will leave most taxpayers Pounds 2.64 better off a week, but benefit the lower paid in particular. A married man or single parent will have Pounds 138 more to spend a year, irrespective of whether he or she earns Pounds 8,000 or Pounds 25,000 a year. The higher paid, with taxable incomes of more than Pounds 23,700, will be Pounds 160 better off. The government also announced extra help for pensioners on income support of Pounds 2 a week for a single person, and Pounds 3 for couples, from October. Mainly to help small businesses, Mr Lamont announced that the uniform business rate on 900,000 commercial properties would be pegged in real terms in 1992-93. This and other measures easing the UBR burden will cost Pounds 480m in the coming financial year and Pounds 590m in 1993-94. The chancellor also announced technical changes to the levying of VAT to aid businesses, and exempted most business assets from inheritance tax so that family businesses could be passed on without charge. Mr Lamont resisted lobbying from organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry for an increase in investment allowances. But Mr Lamont announced a series of far-reaching measures to aid the car industry. He halved the special 10 per cent car tax to 5 per cent from today, reducing the price of a typical family car by about Pounds 400. He also proposed to: Lift restrictions on businesses claiming capital allowances on cars costing Pounds 12,000 or less. Allow driving schools, taxi and car-hire firms to recover VAT when they buy cars. Consult on plans to move the taxation of company cars to a system based on a car's price rather than its engine size. In a move that may encourage a surge in investment the Budget proposes to end the Business Expansion Scheme at the end of next year. The odds about the Tories winning the election shortened after the Budget. Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, is quoting 2-1 on for the Conservatives to win most seats, compared with 7-4 on before the Budget. Labour's odds eased from 11-8 to 6-4. The Liberal Democrats remain 500-1.

Japan made the call during bilateral talks in Tokyo on  nuclear nonproliferation, the second of their kind between the  two nations, the officials said.    Japan is greatly concerned about India's nuclear development  problem in view of its guidelines on implementing official  development assistance (ODA), they said.    The guidelines require Japan to take into account, when  extending ODA, the recipient nation's military expenditure and  development, production, import and export of weapons, missiles  and mass- destruction weapons.    Japan also called on India to accept inspections of certain  nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) to improve the transparency of its nuclear development  plans, the officials said.    The Indian delegation, pointing out that India's basic  policy  is the total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide, called on  nuclear power nations to make commitments to abolish nuclear  weapons by presenting specific schedules, they said.    India also told Japan it basically supports the nuclear test  ban treaty and a treaty to ban production of fissionable  materials, they said.    India will be able to meet Japan's demand to improve  transparency of its nuclear plans if the treaty to ban  production of fissionable materials takes effect, the Indian  delegation was quoted as saying.    Also in the talks, Japan pointed out the importance of  holding multilateral talks to discuss security in Southwest  Asia, including nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles.    India told Japan that if such talks are held, it is  necessary  to invite all nations that could influence security in Southwest  Asia and ensure that all nations shoulder equal obligations, the  officials said.    Touching on India's relations with Pakistan, the Indian  delegation explained that the ties are still tense despite talks  between vice foreign ministers of both countries, they said.    Japan and India held their first bilateral meeting on  nuclear  nonproliferation last March in Delhi.    The Japanese and Indian delegations agreed to hold a third  round of talks this year, the officials said.</p>

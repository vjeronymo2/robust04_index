			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Second view on Hanson FURTHER consideration of Hanson's results prompted a slide in the stock, finally 8 1/2 off at 227 1/2 p on very heavy turnover of 24m. The slide in London followed exceptionally heavy trade in the US overnight. Initial reaction to the full-year profits on Thursday was that the figures were less disappointing than expected. However, the meeting with analysts, which ended too late to affect Thursday's share prices, raised questions about the high level of provisions and the revaluation of Hanson's UK aggregates business. As City analysts circulated their research views to clients yesterday, both SG Warburg and BZW were believed to be expressing reservations about the results. Meanwhile, Hanson's broker, Hoare Govett, cut its 1993 profit forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 1100m 'in the light of pressure on UK margins.' The new figures are at the low end of the market's range of estimates. Glaxo strong The share price of Glaxo rose sharply ahead of the official opening of trading in London yesterday after the drugs group disclosed late on Thursday that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued an 'approvable' letter for Glaxo's Imigran migraine treatment, known in the US as Imitrex. There was also positive recommendation from US analysts. Glaxo was the most heavily traded stock in early dealing and closed 36 higher at 823p on final turnover of 7.6m shares. Had it not been for Glaxo's strong performance the FT-SE 100 index would have been 18 points off on the day. The FDA is expected to grant final approval for injectable Imigran once certain conditions are satisfied. Approval for the more lucrative tablet version would probably follow shortly afterwards. Predictions for the profit likely to be generated vary widely but UBS Phillip &amp; Drew has argued that Imigran will achieve US sales of Pounds 550m by 1996. Analysts said the announcement, though expected was nevertheless 'very good news' and opened the door for further long-awaited approvals. Dealers added that Smith Barney, the US house traditionally positive on Glaxo, was reiterating its stance, arguing that there was Dollars 5 of upside in shares traded in American Depositary Receipts form. However, Morgan Stanley lowered its stance and the shares were weaker in New York after London closed last night. Bank stock placed Shares in Abbey National were the most heavily traded in London yesterday as two brokers placed nearly 29m Abbey shares at 360p each, raising Pounds 103m for the bank. Kleinwort Benson Securities which sold the shares with SG Warburg to a number of institutions said the placing was carried out very quickly. The underlying share price held up well in spite of a downgrading earlier in the week from US credit rating agency Moody's. The stock represented part of the shares not taken up after the company's flotation in 1989. Further revision of the outlook for household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman prompted the shares to fall 16 to 606p with 1.1m traded, heavy for this stock. Credit Lyonnais Laing brought its current-year forecast down to around Pounds 245m, some Pounds 10m below the current range of estimates. Most analysts have been gradually reducing their estimates as they perceive that margins will remain restricted. Laing's pharmaceuticals analyst, Mr Mark Brewer, said: 'There is no real fundamental problem with the company but they don't see any sign of economic pick-up and are committed to spending in order to build market share.' A change of recommendation from US investment bank Lehman Brothers hit Grand Metropolitan in the wake of the food and drinks group's announcement on Thursday of disappointing full-year figures. At worst, the shares were down 11 but bargain hunters helped bring a modest rally and they closed 8 off at 420p. Lehman moved the stock from a buy to a hold. Water shares picked up after recent falls, helped by mildly encouraging half-year results from Severn Trent. Severn rose 4 1/2 to 449 1/2 p and Thames added 2 at 483p. Food manufacturer Unilever was held back at first by reports of a line of stock on the books of Kleinwort Benson Securities. The line was cleared later in the day but the poor economic outlook throughout Europe continued to weaken the shares, which fell 14 to 1052p. The same economic worries prompted weakness in Cadbury Schweppes which eased 10 to 459p. Several food retailers continued to rise on hopes of benefit from food price rises. Traders also talked of stock shortage in the sector. Argyll added 5 to 393p, while Asda firmed 2 3/4 to 53 1/4 p. Kwik Save gained 9 to 751p, and J. Sainsbury closed 7 ahead at 535p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew were reported to have been the day's main sellers of Guinness and the shares gave up 9 to 525p, in trade of 2.2m. Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley jumped 10 to 536p, after reporting a 6.6 per cent profits increase and an 11 per cent improvement in the dividend. Retailer Sears eased a penny to 96p on turnover of 6m shares after Nomura cut its profits estimate for the group by Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 92.5m for the current year, and by Pounds 9m to Pounds 116m for the following year. The securities house said current trading was weaker than expected and pointed out that the interest rate charge at Sears will rise as base rates fall because of its a high proportion of fixed rate debt. Suggestions of a better trading outlook helped Dixons buck the market trend and gain 5 to 267p. The market appreciated the news that John Menzies had decided to close its Early Learning operation in the US. The shares jumped 15 to 459p. United Newspapers, which has risen in a straight line over the past two weeks, gained 7 to 494p. SG Warburg has been pointing out the potential impact on earnings per share from the redemption of a Pounds 105m Eurobond issue. Redemption is expected before Christmas and Warburg says it will boost share earnings by 22 per cent. Stake building talk returned to Lonrho. The shares firmed 5 to 74p. Reports of improved car sales benefited stocks in the motors sector, including Lex Service which jumped 12 to 253p, and T &amp; N, up 7 at 155p. Profit-taking in Siebe left the shares 11 down at 379p, on turnover of 2.2m. The company reports interim figures on Tuesday and County NatWest predicts profits of Pounds 85.5m against last year's Pounds 75.2m. British Aerospace fell 8 to 134p, also on of profit-taking. ICI suffered as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew brought back its forecasts in line with the market and shifted its recommendation from buy to hold. UBS is looking for Pounds 580m for this year and Pounds 700m for 1993 but still believes the company will maintain its dividend next year. ICI fell 12 to 1036p. In the transport sector, profit-taking and fears of write-downs in its property subsidiary weakened P&amp;O, the shares falling 18 to 460p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (49).

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Eurotunnel defends track record: Efforts to limit damage Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, was characteristically robust in his defence of the company's performance yesterday. He had to be. Eurotunnel had a lot of damage to make good. Not only were revenues well below the levels forecast in its May rights issue prospectus, but Eurotunnel had attempted to dismiss the significance of this development last week, triggering unfavourable comment and a slide in its share price. The first half of 1994 should have shown the tunnel gearing up for a full summer service, but delays meant that it was able to launch only a limited freight service at discount tariffs. 'Clearly, we shall end the year with a substantial shortfall in revenue compared with earlier forecasts. But we hope to be back on track in the second half of 1995, which is the bigger half because it has the summer season in it,' Sir Alastair said. These limited activities produced just Pounds 2m of revenues which was overwhelmed by Pounds 33m of net interest and finance charges, Pounds 8m of operating costs and Pounds 8m of depreciation charges. In the year, as a whole Eurotunnel now expects to achieve only one quarter of the Pounds 135m revenues forecast in its rights prospectus. Analysts were yesterday surprised by the size of the revenue shortfall and the shares closed down 7p at 221p. 'Anyone buying shares is really taking a bet on whether the company actually survives and whether they make any money,' said Mr Richard Sanderson at Panmure Gordon. At best, he predicted, the group could expect revenues next year of Pounds 450m with all services running - some 12 per cent below Eurotunnel's forecasts of Pounds 513m - and would not make a profit before the turn of the century. At UBS Securities, analyst Mr Richard Hannah said: 'To miss first-year forecasts by this kind of margin is upsetting to say the least. One wonders how accurate their future figures will be.' Despite the revenue setback, Eurotunnel's management was keen yesterday to emphasise that the company's cashflow position was not so gloomy. Cost savings mean its cash position was Pounds 3m better than expected in the first half while it will be 'only' Pounds 50m worse than forecast by the year-end. This was just over 3 per cent of the Pounds 1.6bn funds raised in May. Eurotunnel still has Pounds 1.1bn of the loans and equity raised in May and should not need to start drawing on any loans until next spring, by which time it will be covering its operating costs, excluding interest payments, from revenues. The banks could frighten themselves into deciding they did not want to release these loans but they would simply be denying themselves the repayment of their earlier loans, according to Sir Alastair. 'The banks are in a difficult position,' said one analyst. 'The last thing they want is to see it fail because they haven't come up with the necessary finance.' A banker at one of Eurotunnel's main lenders predicted that the conditions over the access to the next tranche of senior debt could be relaxed next spring. 'There is no crisis. We remain supportive,' he added. Sir Alastair was also optimistic that Eurotunnel's share price will have recovered enough to make it attractive for warrant holders to exercise their warrants, worth Pounds 200m to Eurotunnel, at the 300p exercise price. But some institutional investors said the latest figures could prove a powerful disincentive for UK fund managers contemplating a stake in Eurotunnel. 'Institutions have been put off by the history of delays, and the remote prospects of earnings and dividends,' said Mr Kevin Fenelon, investment director at Scottish Amicable. In Paris, the Association Pour l'Action d'Eurotunnel, which represents 1,200 small shareholders, was not surprised by the figures. 'We are more concerned with its ability to repay its capital debt when the service is fully running,' said Ms Francoise Doumerc, the group's spokeswoman. 'We're advising our members to wait. As long as they haven't sold shares, they haven't lost.' Lex, Page 22; How the fares compare, Page 9</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Storms ahead in France FRANCE'S conservative parties have won a spectacular victory in the first ballot of the general election. If confirmed in the second ballot next Sunday it will produce a national assembly reminiscent of the Chambre Bleu Horizon of 1919, or even the Chambre Introuvable of 1815, both remembered as high points of right-wing electoral backlash. Yet the overwhelming parliamentary majority projected for the conservative alliance reflects only a modest jump in their popular vote. The truly spectacular event is the halving of the Socialist vote. This was foreshadowed in local and regional elections a year ago, but then it could, at a pinch, be interpreted as a mid-term protest vote. Certainly it was a warning, to which President Francois Mitterrand responded by dismissing his unpopular prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson, replacing her with the generally respected finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy. That response has cut no ice. Mr Beregovoy is still respected - by the markets, but in elections they do not have the deciding voice. With the public at large his reputation has been tainted - not so much by the personal peccadillo of an interest-free loan from a businessman as by the fact that his party has been involved in scandal after scandal, while the president himself is seen as well past his sell-by date. Crime and immigration prey on the minds of many ordinary voters, in France as elsewhere in western Europe. But none of these things would cause such fierce and widespread resentment were it not for the state of the economy. Growth has come to a stop. Bankruptcies are rising steeply. So, above all, is unemployment. Model of responsibility This sounds like a familiar pattern. Left-wing governments traditionally come unstuck on economics, and disillusioned electorates then turn to conservatives, with sounder and more rigorous policies, to sort things out. But that is not what has happened in France. The Socialist party sowed its wild oats way back in 1981-83, and since then has been a model of fiscal and monetary responsibility. France has one of the lowest rates of inflation on the continent, and is running a trade surplus. While it is certainly plausible to blame the current recession on the government's obsession with sound money, especially its determination to hold the franc-mark parity at all costs, this is in fact the one issue on which the main opposition leaders decline to criticise it. Even if the voters' howl of pain was directed primarily at this policy, the effect will be a government pledged to continue it. Poisoned chalice Inevitably the markets will question how credible, and for how long, such a pledge can be. Already voices within the victorious parties are calling for devaluation, and the very size of the new government's majority will make it harder to silence them. No doubt steps will be taken to reinforce the pledge's credibility, though it seems unlikely that a further rise in interest rates would have that effect. The Bundesbank will reiterate its commitment, but this too may fail to carry conviction unless accompanied by cuts in interest rates much more decisive than we have seen yet. If the franc fort is one poisoned chalice for the incoming government, another is the agreement on agricultural subsidies reached between the EC and US last November, which French conservatives denounced with even greater venom than the Socialist government, and pledged themselves rather more convincingly to reject. In attempting to honour that pledge they will find themselves at odds with Germany. The potential for a serious Franco-German split, with all that that implies for the EC's future cohesion, is obvious. Some elements within the coalition, especially on its Gaullist wing, may be tempted to make a virtue of such a split. Others, including Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the non-Gaullist wing, would strenuously oppose it, and would be supported by the President. His support may not count for much, at least initially. After such a defeat, and with only two years of his second mandate left to run, he appears the lamest of lame ducks. But on past form he will be quick to exploit the many fault lines in the new governing majority - not least the fact that its leaders will be rivals in their aspiration to succeed him.</p>

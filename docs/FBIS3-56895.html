In accordance with the resolution adopted on Wednesday, the  elections to the parliament of Moldova in the Dniester Republic  have been outlawed and the persons guilty of organizing the  election campaign will be prosecuted.    Observers in Tiraspol link this decision of the Dniester  Republic parliament with the decree of the president of the  Dniester Republic, Igor Smirnov, on the introduction of a  "special situation" in the region.    Parliamentary elections in Moldova will be held on February  27.</p>

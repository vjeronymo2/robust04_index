			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / People: Brian Goldthorpe Brian Goldthorpe, one of Midland Bank's most experienced bankers, died at the weekend after a short illness. A straight-talking Yorkshireman, he joined Midland direct from school in 1949, rising to become deputy chief executive. After Midland was bought by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in the summer, Goldthorpe was chosen to become a Hongkong Bank director with responsibility for controlling worldwide credit risk. However, he resigned because of ill-health in September. He is a particular loss to the bank because he was one of only a tiny number of long-serving Midland executives who survived a series of purges of the top management during the 1980s. Colleagues say his experience will be difficult to replace.</p>

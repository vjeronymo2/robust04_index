			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A'S STEWART NEARS THIRD CONSECUTIVE 20-VICTORY SEASON, 7-2  </P> <P> It has been more than a decade since a pitcher has won 20 or more games for  three consecutive seasons. Jim Palmer of the Baltimore Orioles did it in  1976-78.  </P> <P> Dave Stewart (19-8) of the Oakland Athletics is about to accomplish the feat.  The right-hander, who had a five-hitter at Milwaukee, should get five more  starts. And with the Athletics starting to score runs, there's not much doubt  he'll do it.  </P> <P> Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco each hit two-run home runs to help the Athletics  win, 7-2, and open their lead in the West to 2 1/2 games over Kansas City and 3  1/2 games over the Angels.  </P> <P> It was the third victory in a row for Stewart, who began his career in 1978  with the Dodgers, had only 39 victories going into the 1987 season, but needs  only one more to reach 100.  </P> <P> Stewart, who is 10-1 lifetime against the Brewers, struck out eight and walked  one. In his last four games, covering 31 1/3 innings, Stewart has walked only  three. After giving up two runs in the third inning, he retired the last 18 he  faced.  </P> <P> Canseco, who missed the first half of the season because of a wrist injury, has  had a big week. In the last five games Canseco is 12 for 22 and has driven in  13 runs. He has hit five home runs in the last four games.  </P> <P> In 41 games, he has 12 home runs and 37 runs batted in. His home run in this  game was a 430-foot blast.  </P> <P> "It makes it much easier to pitch when Mark and Jose start hitting home runs,"  Stewart said. "It takes some of the pressure off. I want to win 20, but I'd  rather win another pennant."  </P> <P> Texas 6, Kansas City 3 -- Nolan Ryan emerged from a mild slump to win his 288th  game and struck out 11 in eight innings at Arlington, Tex. to improve to 15-9.  </P> <P> Ryan, 42, gave up a two-run home run to Bo Jackson, his 28th of the season, to  give the Royals a 2-1 lead in the first inning. He went eight innings, giving  up eight hits to end his two-game losing streak.  </P> <P> With 254 strikeouts, Ryan easily leads the majors and already has 26 more  strikeouts than he did last season with Houston.  </P> <P> Ryan has struck out 10 in 15 games this season, a Ranger career record.  </P> <P> The Royals had won four in a row.  </P> <P> "He's a master," Royals Manager John Wathan said. "Whenever you go against him  you know you're in for a fight. When you lose it's no fun, but you can't help  but admire him."  </P> <P> Ryan, who threw 146 pitches, said he didn't get into a groove until after three  innings.  </P> <P> Toronto 4, Minnesota 2 -- When you're hot, you're hot. The Blue Jays had only  four hits at Toronto against the Twins, but they won their fifth in a row to  maintain their lead in the East.  </P> <P> Ernie Whitt and Kelly Gruber each hit two-run home runs off Roy Smith (10-5)  and that was enough to keep them a game ahead of Baltimore.  </P> <P> Most of the season the Twins have scored runs in bunches when Smith is  pitching. But this time three pitchers held them to seven hits. John Cerutti  (10-8) earned the victory and Tom Henke pitched the last inning for his 15th  save.  </P> <P> Baltimore 2, Chicago 1 -- Gregg Olson tied the league record for saves by a  rookie when he got the last four outs at Chicago for his 23rd save.  </P> <P> Olson tied the record set by Doug Corbett of Minnesota in 1980.  </P> <P> The Orioles, who had been outscored, 21-1, in losing their last two games, used  five pitchers to hold the White Sox to a run.  </P> <P> Pete Harnisch, who is 0-11 on the road, had a 2-0 lead in the sixth when he had  to leave because of a bruised right forearm. Former Dodger Brian Holton pitched  two scoreless innings to win it.  </P> <P> Boston 6, Seattle 5 -- Dwight Evans went ahead of Joe DiMaggio on the all-time  home run list when he hit a three-run home run at Boston to lead the Red Sox to  their 11th victory in their last 13 games.  </P> <P> Evans has 362 home runs for 34th place on the home run list. With 16 this  season, Evans, in his 17th season, needs four more to hit 20 or more for the  ninth consecutive season.  </P> <P> Evans' home run gave the Red Sox a 6-2 lead and they barely hung on to remain  five games out of first place in the East.  </P> <P> Detroit 10, Cleveland 4 -- The Tigers have the worst record in the majors  (49-89), but with their second victory in a row at Cleveland, they have just  about eliminated the Indians from the race.  </P> <P> The Tigers had lost 12 in a row when they went into Cleveland. With Dion James  going four for four, the Tigers dropped the Indians 10 1/2 games back in the  East. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

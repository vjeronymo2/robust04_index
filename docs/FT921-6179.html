			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Social Europe: Opting out and cashing in - David Goodhart assesses the implications for British business of the decision to reject an extension of EC social provisions Britain will become a paradise for investment,' was the verdict of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. His angry reaction to Britain's decision to 'opt out' of an extension of the European Community's social and employment policy at December's Maastricht summit is now approvingly echoed by British ministers. They believe they have preserved the right of British employers and employees to conduct their affairs free from centralised, continental meddling, to the benefit of the UK economy. For Mr Delors, and supporters of a deepening of the EC's social dimension, Britain is poised to become the Hong Kong of Europe, its barely protected labour sucking in foreign capital. This might be an unwelcome development but, to Mr Delors, it is preferable to the alternative, a social dimension that would be limited to a few health and safety directives, with the UK blocking attempts to establish a true set of EC-wide minimum standards at work. Now, thanks to their UK-free Maastricht 'protocol' agreement, the other 11 member states will, from 1993, be able to sidestep the UK. Should Britain try to block a measure supported by the other states, they could use the protocol to introduce reforms. That could mean legislation, covering the 11 only, on matters such as sex equality at work, minimum annual holiday entitlement, and works councils for consultation with employees. Whether this would allow the UK to consolidate its position further as the EC's favoured destination for inward investment from outside the Community is debatable. US and Japanese investors have, over the past 40 years, generally preferred the UK for a variety of reasons, not least the English language and the country's relatively low wage costs, especially compared with Germany. Although there has been some sign recently of a switch in Japanese preferences from Britain to Germany, Britain accounted for over 38 per cent of Japanese direct investment in Europe in the four decades to 1990 and for 61 per cent of such investment in 1990 alone. That the trend in favour of Britain was particularly strong in the 1980s suggests that the economic conditions which prevailed under the Thatcher government were an important driving force. Among these was a commitment to a continued regime of low non-wage labour costs (the social security and other benefits that must be paid by an employer) and a relatively unregulated labour market. By contrast, in most of the continental EC economies, including the poorest such as Greece and Portugal, the state intervenes widely to set minimum standards at work - for example minimum wages and maximum hours - and all have statutory systems for worker consultation. For this reason many employers in continental Europe have found the EC's social dimension easier to accept than their UK equivalents. Directives, such as that on maximum working time, which would require significant reorganisation in some sectors of UK industry, merely confirm existing practice in most other EC countries. Continental European employers, obliged to consult employee representatives at plant or national level, also find it easier to accept the agreement between UNICE, the European employers body, and the European Trade Union Congress, which is included in the Maastricht protocol and allows the 'social partners' the right to amend EC legislation and to produce EC-wide collective agreements as a substitute for legislation. Employers differ sharply about the position in which Britain now finds itself. 'Opt-out is good for smaller businesses and for businesses operating only in the UK, but UK multinationals with companies in Europe may have to accept the protocol in part of their business and that could get complicated,' says Mr Malcolm Greenslade, director of personnel at GrandMet, the food and drinks group. Mr Herwig Kressler, personnel manager at Unilever, says he will probably ignore the 'opt-out' altogether rather than have one set of rules for the UK and another for other EC countries. Other personnel managers say they would probably include the UK in low-cost protocol measures such as the works councils but try to opt out of more costly measures. The cost of implementing individual directives depends on the sector in which a company operates and what it already offers its staff. Mr Greenslade says GrandMet would face no extra cost from several measures, including the EC's statutory maternity proposals. But having to pay part-time workers the same, relative to the hours they work, as full-timers (a directive that is currently shelved) would cost Pounds 4m a year and make it less attractive to hire part-timers, who now number 16,000 out of a UK workforce of 21,000. On working hours, Mr Greenslade complains that a 48-hour weekly limit would force GrandMet's restaurant chains to adopt higher, continental-style, levels of staffing. The UK chemicals group ICI says it would not welcome legislation on weekly hours but adds that it lives with it in the rest of Europe and could live with it here. British Rail, which makes massive overtime payments, might face an even bigger bill from a 48-hour limit, but Mr Gareth Hadley, a BR personnel manager, says cutting overtime should be a goal of all managers and believes the government is wrong to oppose the directive. The commonest view of the 'opt-out' among larger UK employers - supported by UNICE and some members of the CBI - is that it would have been better if the UK had fought for a diluted version of the 'Social Chapter' under discussion at Maastricht for all 12 member states. Big business in the UK and in the rest of the EC believe the 'opt-out' could expose it to tougher social legislation than is strictly necessary. The UK multinationals add that they will have no influence over the development of EC social legislation, perhaps for several years, and will then have to swallow what has been established without them when the UK 'opts back' at some point in the future. Some UK employers blame internal Tory party politics for the outcome at Maastricht, pointing to the fact that the final, rejected, version of the Social Chapter included a more precise definition of the catch-all category 'working conditions' and ensured that the UK would retain its veto against European works councils; the two issues considered the stumbling blocks prior to Maastricht. According to UK officials in Brussels Mr John Major, the British prime minister, was ready to accept that compromise, but Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, and a clutch of Thatcherite junior ministers, would not. They cited the UNICE-ETUC agreement, with its undertone of 'Euro-corporatism', as the main objection, despite support from most EC employers' groups. Some observers say that the UK government is haunted by the memory of the corporatism of the 1970s and that Britain would still be able to retain many of its labour market peculiarities and its low wage costs even if it accepted the protocol. Moreover, EC countries that celebrate their corporatism, such as Germany and the Netherlands, seem to manage their economies more successfully despite a high degree of regulation. Inward investors sometimes prefer a well-trained workforce to a cheap and flexible one, as Mitsubishi Electric said when it opted to site its latest plant in Germany, and as the latest hints from Ford about moving its research centre to Germany indicate. Mr Howard eloquently defends his vision of European social legislation based on national tradition, flexibility, and individual choice. He also points to the UK's superior record on implementing social directives - the UK has implemented 18 out of 18 - implying that some governments like to talk about the social dimension but wriggle out of paying the bill. Britain's health and safety record is especially good, although, arguably, the UK is trying to export its high standards in that field much as Germany is said to be trying to do so with social costs in general. And it is health and safety legislation which the poorer EC countries have the greatest difficulty paying for. Mr Howard has allies. Small business in the UK sees nothing but good in the 'opt-out' and larger UK companies like Associated British Ports, which revolutionised its employee relations in the late 1980s by moving all staff on to individual contracts, are relieved that the UK will not be subject to Europe-wide collective agreements with unions. Aspiring EC members such as the Swiss and some east Europeans have also expressed an interest in 'opt-out'. Mr Ed Streator, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in London, says if the UK had agreed even a watered-down Social Chapter at Maastricht 'the perception of US business would have shifted in a negative direction'. He adds, however, that there is some positive interest in the idea of such a social charter in the US and it is being discussed in the North America Free Trade Zone talks. The debate among employers has plenty of time to run its course. Even if events unfold as Mr Howard hopes, the protocol and opt out will not take effect until 1993. There are also reasons for believing that the further divergence between the UK and its partners will be very slow or even non-existent. In the first place, the UK remains bound by existing EC social legislation and will continue to participate in areas such as health and safety. Controversial measures currently under discussion, such as that to establish maximum weekly working time, could still be imposed on the UK outside the protocol. There are many areas which remain outside the scope of the protocol agreement such as pay, the right of union organisation, and the right to strike, (although they could be taken up by UNICE and ETUC). There are also directives, such as improving conditions for part-time workers, which several countries oppose and which are unlikely to succeed even under the protocol. Further, with continental European economies growing only slowly over the next few years, any added burden on employers, however small, will be carefully scrutinised by the 11. Both the Irish and Spanish governments have woken up to the possible loss of the UK veto and tried unsuccessfully to water down the protocol. German employers also are again becoming alarmed about high labour costs and will do their best to render the protocol toothless. 'German employers say that the social dimension is not a bad thing because it forces some of our own high social costs on to all the others,' says an official at the BDI employers organisation. But that makes them very unhappy about the UK's 'opt-out'. As the EC's biggest exporter, they also face the most competition in world markets from the US and Japan. Like Mr Delors' verdict this seems too sweeping and, in its own terms, too pessimistic. The Conservatives may have won a political victory on the EC's social dimension at Maastricht, but for the British economy, is not likely to prove decisive one way or the other.</p>

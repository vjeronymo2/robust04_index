			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: SOME WILD PITCHES THAT GOT AWAY  </P> <P> It's that time of year again. The networks are moving in replacement series to  fill out the present season while mulling other new series for the coming fall  season.  </P> <P> As always, however, they've completely missed the boat by arrogantly rejecting  my very best suggestions. As always, I give them the pearls, and they ignore  them:  </P> <P> "Late Night With Ayatollah Khomeini": Very high concept. America's first talk  show from Iran, with subtitles. Guaranteed to knock Johnny Carson, David  Letterman, Pat Sajak and Arsenio Hall off the air. With various mullahs as his  sidemen, the Ayatollah reveals his playful side while interviewing an exciting  array of Islamic fundamentalists. ("So tell me, Ashmad. . . .") The wit just  shines. On the premiere, Khomeini brings down the house when he jokes: "The  world has many infidel nations. Take Iraq -- please!"  </P> <P> "Beauty and the Falcon Breast": Part One of an NBC package, this sophisticated  continuing drama is about greed and intrigue in California's silicone-implant  industry.  </P> <P> "Supreme Court Cuties": Part Two of the NBC package is an unforgettable sitcom.  Mini-skirted, garter-belted former go-go dancers who know their briefs, legal  and otherwise, show their stuff as appointees to the high court. Barbara Eden  as the braless chief justice.  </P> <P> "Steve Garvey Playhouse": Part Three of the NBC package is strictly for after  hours and not for kids. Stories from Steve's personal journal.  </P> <P> "Roe vs. Wade Boggs": Beset by scandal, the Boston Red Sox star leaves baseball  to star in this drama series about a social activist who begins his career by  leading a pro-vasectomy march on Washington.  </P> <P> "Snow White Meets the Village People": Allan Carr presents a weekly series  showcasing the best of Walt Disney. It opens with the Seven Dwarfs singing  "Y.M.C.A."  </P> <P> "Roseanne's Baby": A horrifying science-fiction spinoff from "Roseanne." After  being impregnated by the devil, Roseanne gives birth to a baby that looks and  sounds like . . . her.  </P> <P> "Married ... With Mildreds": Adorable sitcom. A very stupid couple  absent-mindedly names their three daughters Mildred, resulting in hilarious  high jinks. Sample dialogue: "Oh, Mildred!" "Yes, mother." "No, not you,  Mildred, the other Mildred." "Me, mother?" "No, not you, Mildred, the other  Mildred!" "Me, Mother?" "Yes, you, mother." "No I'm Mildred, you're mother."  </P> <P> "Designing Warthogs": Urbane comedy about four Southern women who manage to  operate a successful designing business and look chic despite having broad,  flat faces, large tusks and warts.  </P> <P> "Murder, She Writ": Mystery series. A very bad mystery writer is also a very  bad amateur detective, botching grammar and cases.  </P> <P> "Gassing Pains": Uproarious comedy. While Mom pursues her career, Dad stays  home and does the cleaning and cooking. The real fun comes when the dish he  makes night after night is beans.  </P> <P> "Who Do You Think You're Fooling, You Rotten Scum?": Provocative talk show.  Normal people who are not criminals, crime victims, cross dressers,  transsexuals, druggies or satanists are put on the hot seat and berated and  humiliated by a skeptical Geraldo Rivera, who makes them account for their  routine lives.  </P> <P> "Break My Nose, Break the Bank": Unique and exciting prime-time game show.  Contestants compete for cash prizes by throwing chairs at Geraldo in hopes of  breaking his nose. It's risky, for if contestants fail (a certified radiologist  will be on hand to examine X-rays of Geraldo's nose) they must pay a penalty.  They are grilled by Geraldo about their sex lives and must show Geraldo their  underwear.  </P> <P> "Capital Punishment": Another exciting game show offering cash prizes to  winners. Again, losers pay a terrible penalty, this time by having to spend 24  hours alone with TV sports commentator Dick Vitale.  </P> <P> "Moving In on the Movies": Theatrical movies are transformed into rotating  weekly series:  </P> <P> "Private Fly ('The Fly')": Science-fiction mystery/adventure. An otherwise  normal private detective turns into a disgusting-looking fly when angered or  provoked. Although it helps him when in surveillance, there are constant  perils. In the pilot, he becomes a fly to eavesdrop on mobsters, but is  immediately swatted. Concept may need reworking.  </P> <P> "Bedtime for Kong ('Gorillas in the Mist')": Cute sitcom. A woman and her  400-pound pet gorilla live in a cabin on a mountain. Their peace and serenity  are repeatedly disrupted by their zany neighbor, who is always popping in  unexpectedly.  </P> <P>  "Dukes of Mississippi ('Mississippi Burning')": A slapstick, but socially  significant sitcom about a couple of good-old-boy FBI agents who cause havoc in  the Deep South by racing after leggy young women and outwitting a dimwitted  sheriff.  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / The Long View: Old Lady or Aunt Sally? AS ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton retires to his Kent estate after 10 years at the Bank of England, he can reflect with satisfaction on the enhanced status of his institution. The BCCI scandal seems to have been brushed aside, and a real discussion is going on about whether the Bank should be granted independent control over monetary policy. Perhaps in future the governor will no longer be a remote City of London grandee, making speeches carefully overlaid with impenetrable waffle and stripped by the Treasury of all controversy, but will acquire a clear, anti-inflationary mission for which he is directly answerable to parliament. How things have changed in 10 years. Leigh-Pemberton's predecessor, Gordon Richardson, carried greater clout as a central banker but independence was not on the agenda. Of course, this may only reflect the difference between Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In any case, the swing of the pendulum back to the Bank simply reflects the fact that the Treasury has become such a disaster area. In the mid-1980s, the Bank was regarded with contempt by Whitehall, not least because of regulatory upsets such as Johnson Matthey Bankers. Now, the Treasury is licking its own wounds. But the news from Frankfurt, home of that doyen of independent central banks, the Bundesbank, is discouraging. Making only tiny concessions on interest rates this week, the Bundesbank continues to slug out a grim battle with the free-spending federal government amid the wreckage of the German economy. The Law of Misplaced Credibility states that economic concepts reach their greatest level of popularity just when they are about to hit trouble. Countries like the UK, Spain, Sweden and Portugal flocked to join or track the European exchange rate mechanism just when it was starting to choke on its own internal contradictions and newly-acquired rigidity. So it appears to be with the idea of central bank independence. There is an intoxicating appeal in an off-the-shelf formula that might solve deep-rooted problems. The ERM seemed so attractive to the British government three years ago because it would permit cuts in interest rates ahead of the next election while exerting a magic spell over the British economy, encouraging adjustment to a low inflation rate. Now, the Bank of England may be offered the tarnished magic wand. One argument is that the government will be forced to follow non-inflationary policies because of the influence of the Bank: interest rate cuts will not be possible ahead of an election, for instance. But it is also possible that, for a while, the government will be able to follow more dangerous fiscal policies because of the financial markets' exaggerated faith in the central banks' powers. At least, this is how it has been working out in Germany recently, although the magic is dissipating and French franc interest rates are slipping below those of the D-Mark. In fact, any anti-inflationary strategy requires more than money market manipulation  - it needs a degree of consensus throughout society. Sometimes, inflation is the best solution, and it would be dangerous to block it. In a low inflation environment, prices must be flexible downwards as well as upwards and, if they are not, disaster may ensue: inflexible wages have led to massive unemployment in the UK, and excessive mortgage borrowing has led to ruin for more than 1m home owners, not to mention serious losses for financial institutions. Nigel Lawson tried to manage the British economy on the basis of interest rates alone, and the Bank of England would be unwise to emulate him. Actually, Leigh-Pemberton's anti-inflationary record is not that bad, judged by the standards of several predecessors. He took over in July 1983 when headline inflation happened to be an erratically low 3.5 per cent, and it has averaged 5.2 per cent a year since. Perhaps that is an undeservedly low figure when broad money growth has averaged an extraordinary 12.5 per cent annually with M4 more than tripling within the decade; the Bundesbank would have been appalled. Certainly, there has been no swindling of savers under Leigh-Pemberton. Short-term depositors have done well, perhaps too well, with money market returns averaging 11.1 per cent before tax and holders of gilt-edged enjoying average returns of 11.8 per cent, nearly twice the rate of inflation. That was not especially expensive for the government given that the total net public sector borrowing requirement for the decade was only Pounds 64bn, scarcely more than Kenneth Clarke will be borrowing in 1993-94 alone. Since mid-1983, net public sector indebtedness has shrunk from 45 to 30 per cent of GDP. How different the trend will be in the rest of the 1990s. Now, however, Eddie George will have to preside over a period in which real interest rates are likely to decline and in which a still-bloated banking system will be forced to shrink. This will sorely test the Bank's sense of priorities. Already, it is troubled by conflicting objectives. The BCCI affair suggested that its concerns with polishing the City of London's image clashed with its responsibilities for protecting depositors; and, in the end, the ERM strategy threatened to undermine the solvency of the banking industry. Attitudes may have to change. This week, the new deputy governor, Rupert Pennant-Rea, remarked on what he had learned in two months at the Bank about traditional central bankerly behaviour. He discovered that if his son were to ask him what 5x12 made, his reply should be: 'It all depends.' 'Obfuscation,' he added, 'is altogether too precise a term for what central bankers do.' But a good one-liner will wear very thin if the Bank of England accepts new responsibilities without understanding how to handle the higher political profile which will accompany them. The Old Lady may yet turn into an Aunt Sally.</p>

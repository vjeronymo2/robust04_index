			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 7 (AFP) -- Three Belgians  working for the United Nations Mission in Rwanda have been  killed in the chaos that followed the deaths of the presidents  of Rwanda and Burundi, a UN spokesman said Thursday [7 April].    It was unclear whether the three who died were the same as  the three UN guards taken captive Thursday by elements of the  Rwandan Presidential Guard, the spokesman, Joe Sills said.    Another UN spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said there were  unconfirmed reports that the Rwandan prime minister had been  killed.    There was sporadic fighting in Kigali, the Rwandan capital,  as the government said that the plane that crashed killing the  presidents of Rwanda and Burundi had been shot down by  unidentified attackers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, Feb 4 (AFP) -- Estimated unemployment in  the European Community was 10.9 percent in December, unchanged  from the revised figure for November but a full percentage point  higher than in December 1992, the EC said Friday [4 February].    Eurostat, the EC's statistical agency, estimated that there  were 15.8 million people unemployed in the 12-member Community  last December -- giving an increase of 1.9 million over the  previous 12 months.    It said the average jobless rate for calendar 1993 was 10.5  percent. The unemployment rate has risen one percentage point a  year over the last two years. It was 9.9 percent in December  1992 and 8.9 percent in December 1991.    The EC's executive European Commission has predicted that  the  rate will peak at around 11.5 percent in mid-1995 before  beginning to descend.    The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in calendar 1993  rose fastest in Spain, western Germany, Italy and France. The  smallest increases were recorded in Britain and Ireland.    Unemployment last December was highest in Spain (22.5  percent), followed by Ireland (18.5), Italy (11.5), France  (11.2), Denmark (10.4), Britain (10.3), Belgium (9.8), the  Netherlands (9.5 in November), western Germany (6.0), Portugal  (5.5) and Luxembourg (3.0).    No figures were available for Greece or for former East  Germany.</p>

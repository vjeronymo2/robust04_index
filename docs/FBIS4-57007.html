			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 9 May (EFE) -- On 9 May, Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori stated Peru is "entirely sovereign" and if its  counterterrorist laws are flawed, Peruvians will correct them.  Thus, Fujimori answered several "recommendations" to study the  country's legal situation by a New York Bar Association mission  at the end of an eight-day visit to Peru. The visiting lawyers  recommended that Peru's counterterrorist laws be amended and  made more flexible. "We will make them more flexible as we  acquire more experience," Fujimori said. He added that any  changes should not "jeopardize" the peace process.    Commenting on the U.S. lawyers' "recommendations," Fujimori  asked "why should we accept their cooperation now, when they  left us alone for 12 years during which time 25,000 people  died." The president added: "The responsibility is ours alone;  should there be any mistakes, we will correct them." Fujimori  emphasized that delegations of lawyers "can keep coming" to  Peru, but it is up to the Peruvian Government to decide what  suits the country best.    The New York lawyers' "recommendations" include not trying  cases of aggravated terrorism or high treason in military  courts, not keeping terrorist prisoners incommunicado, and  giving lawyers free access and the right to meet in private with  alleged terrorists while in prison.    The New York lawyers also recommended that all innocent  people arrested on terrorism-related charges in Peru should be  pardoned, and that the anonymity which protects judges and  witnesses in high-treason trials should be lifted.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Seoul continues record-setting rally Small-lot buying by dealers and overseas investors supported share prices and the Nikkei 225 average ended higher for the first time in three days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally ahead 34.11 at 19,992.40 after a day's peak of 20,020.60 and low of 19,946.99. Prices moved within a narrow range with most investors still cautious over the yen's fluctuations. Volume came to 255m shares, against 200m. Activity remained low due to the rise of the yen. The Topix index of all first section stocks was just 0.19 firmer at 1,586.65 and the Nikkei 300 inched up 0.20 to 290.09. Declines led advances by 496 to 449, with 206 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.71 at 1,301.00. Traders said some individuals moved to trade in the second section and in the over-the-counter market. Second section and OTC companies were expected to enjoy larger increases in earnings than large first section corporations. According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper, pre-tax profits for OTC companies are expected to rise 32 per cent in the current business year. Overseas investors traded in shipping companies. Some analysts were bullish about an historically low level of world surplus shipping capacity - 2.2 per cent of supply for last year. 'We expect this to translate into significantly higher charter rates for most ship types,' said Ms Kathy Matsui, a strategist at Goldman Sachs. Kawasaki Kisen, the most active issue of the day, finished Y7 down at Y409 after hitting the year's high of Y422. Although higher gold prices helped mining and non-ferrous metal issues, profit-taking finally eroded the day's gains. Sumitomo Metal Mining was off Y15 at Y980 after touching a year's high of Y1,010. The yen's strength prompted small-lot selling of high-technology stocks by foreign investors. Toshiba dipped Y10 to Y753, Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 to Y1,660 and Sony Y70 to Y5,880. Reports of lower than expected profits depressed Honda Motor by Y40 to Y1,730. Isuzu Motors rose Y16 to Y528 on hopes of strong earnings, while other car makers were also firm, with Nissan Motor up Y7 to Y825 and Toyota Motor gaining Y10 at Y2,070. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 16.47 to 22,326.31 in volume of 26.7m shares. Roundup Sentiment in the region stayed mixed. Sri Lanka was closed for a holiday. SEOUL finished at another record high, but profit-taking eroded a sharp early rally that was prompted by the settlement of the US-North Korean talks. The composite index gained only 3.42 at 1,113.29 after posting an intraday all-time peak of 1,127.09. Construction and trading shares were among the day's beneficiaries on hopes that they would be major gainers when relations with North Korea improve. The sub-index for the construction industry advanced 13.12 or 2.3 per cent to 595.71. HONG KONG ended a sluggish session lower as investor confidence continued to be eroded by the weakness of the dollar, nagging talk about the health of Deng Xiaoping, China's leader, and tomorrow's local land auction. The Hang Seng index slipped 37.37 to 9,418.57 in preliminary turnover of a low HKDollars 2.38bn. The China incorporated H-shares index fell 27.62 or 2.1 per cent to 1,316.94, having lost almost 45 points on Monday. SINGAPORE eased, with retail sentiment dampened by talk of forced selling in Malaysian stocks traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.59 down at 2,383.98. Sentiment over Malaysian stocks was also weakened by Malaysia's finance minister Mr Anwar Ibrahim, who told Malaysians not to expect too much from the October 28 budget statement. KUALA LUMPUR again reversed an early firm trend to close lower, pressured by forced selling in the afternoon. The composite index lost 7.38 at 1,118.74, having touched an early high of 1,128.47, but trading was slow, volume of 245m shares falling below Monday's 307m. MANILA took its rally into a fifth day after San Miguel Corp reported a 40 per cent jump in its nine-month net. The composite index ended 42.81 up at the day's best of 3,092.95. Index heavyweights attracted foreign and local investors on the hope that they will follow San Miguel's example. Volume expanded from 2.43bn shares to 3.49bn, but turnover was only slightly higher at 2.07bn pesos, against 2.01bn pesos. SYDNEY faltered following the uneven session on Wall Street, the All Ordinaries index closing 10.7 lower at 2,003.4 in turnover of ADollars 397.4m. Resource issues fell by more than industrials. News Corp finished a token 2 cents higher at ADollars 8.40 as its chairman and chief executive Mr Rupert Murdoch talked of 50 per cent profits growth over the next two to three years at its annual meeting in Adelaide. WELLINGTON lost its way and the NZSE-40 capital index closed at 2,052.41, down 13.98, in turnover of NZDollars 32.9m. Trading in Telecom accounted for one-third of overall activity, the shares receding a cent to NZDollars 5.29 in NZDollars 11.3m dealt. TAIPEI buying centred mainly on foods, marines and steels, as the weighted index rose 24.30 to 6,755.53 in turnover of TDollars 72.67bn. In foods, President Enterprises and Weichuan Foods hit their daily 7 per cent limits at TDollars 59.50 and TDollars 36.40 respectively. Marines reflected improved prospects in coming months, with Yang Ming Marine and U-ming Marine both limit up at TDollars 39.50 and TDollars 37.50, and steels rose on product price rises, with Feng An Metal limit up at TDollars 66.50. BOMBAY was lower in the absence of fresh buying support after ignoring Monday's deregulation of interest rates by India's central bank which many brokers said was favourable to the industry. Computer problems prevented the calculation of the BSE 30 index, but brokers said that given the decline in prices the index would have shown a 25 to 30-point slide from Monday's 4,365.43. JAKARTA waited for yesterday's listing of Indosat in the US, and the JKSE composite index eased 0.71 to 510.63.</p>

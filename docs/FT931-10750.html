			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Banks under pressure FEARS that NatWest Bank was planning to call on investors for extra cash set nerves jangling in the banking sector. The rumours came at a time when, according to merchant bank Robert Fleming, the sector had hit an 17-year relative high against the market and gave an ideal opportunity to take profits. Mr Nick Dobby of Flemings said there was talk that NatWest could be considering a rights issue in the region of Pounds 1bn. But he added; 'There is no loan growth at the moment, the bank's capital ratios are well in excess of the regulatory minimum and investors would be likely to focus on Barclay's Pounds 921m cash call in 1988 which did not prove a very efficient investment.' NatWest shares fell 12 to to 448p with 14m traded. However, it was also suggested that, if NatWest needs to raise cash, Barclays needs it more and the latter's shares fell 16 to 429p. Meanwhile, Lloyds fell 11 to 537p hampered by speculation that it was lining up a bid for one of three old candidates, TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland or Standard Chartered. One might have expected the bid candidates to improve but the whole sector was held back by a feeling that base rates will not be cut any further in the short-term. Queens Moat deal The sale by the joint managing director of Queens Moat Houses of half his equity holding in the hotel group was followed by a heavy fall in the share price. The sale came just ahead of the closed period, during which company officers are prohibited from dealing in the stock market. Queens Moat, whose shares have traced an erratic path recently, will announce results at the beginning of April. The shares were marked back sharply in August. They hit a low of 27 1/2 p when the board revealed an unexpected jump in debt, in spite of improved profits and increased dividend. Yesterday, Mr Martin Marcus sold 500,000 shares at 57 1/2 p and a further 600,000 at 57p, a slight discount to the prevailing market price. The shares fell heavily but later rallied to close at 53 1/2 p, a fall of 4 1/2 . Turnover was a chunky 4.8m. Clifford approach An announcement from Clifford Foods that it had been approached by a potential suitor prompted excitement in the food manufacturing sector. Market fingers pointed at Unigate, with analysts close to the company hinting that the two may have held discussions recently. Others which might be interested could include Avonmore, the Irish dairy group, Northern Foods, French concern BSN and MD Foods of Denmark. Clifford is family-controlled and any offer would have to be agreed. Its concentration in the south-eastern liquid milk market would fit into Unigate's acquisitive milk-orientated strategy. Analysts put a price tag of around Pounds 50m on Clifford, a sum easily affordable by Unigate without resorting to issuing paper. Clifford ordinary voting shares jumped 85 to 505p, with the 'A' shares up 32 at 216p. Unigate slipped 5 to 325p and Northern a penny to 262p. Merchant bank Hambros had a volatile share performance ahead of an announcement that it had won a court case brought it in Oslo by the Norwegian Guarantee Institute. The shares were down 58 earlier as investors thought Hambros had lost the case but they finished a net 15 up on the day at 313p. Water utility shares lifted as analysts said their average dividend growth was likely to outpace that of the market and stressed the companies' defensive qualities. Thames Water was up 10 at 497p, Severn Trent 8 at 474p and Anglian Water 7 at 488p. Panmure Gordon's Mr Angelos Anastasiou estimates real dividend growth for the market at nine per cent over the next five years compared with 19 per cent for the water sector. Fisons lifted 6 to 233p following an announcement from the company that it has signed a marketing deal. The deal is not significant in itself but lends growing support to the growing view that the company is more viable. There was also a return of lingering bid speculation. Croda International jumped 13 to 263p on hopes for a new multiple sclerosis treatment. However, the company sought to temper optimism saying clinical trials had net begun yet. Worries over the possibility of VAT being imposed on food in the Budget again put food retail stocks under a cloud. Argyll Group declined 6 to 374p, J Sainsbury 10 to 558p and Tesco 4 to 250p. Rank Organisation was hit by two sets of switch advice, with Goldman Sachs advising a move into Ladbroke and Hoare Govett preferring Thorn EMI. Shares in the latter added 8 to 861p, while Ladbroke rose 3 to 203p and Rank recovered to close a penny adrift at 713p. Analysts declared themselves little better off after a visit to a WH Smith's Do It All facility. Speculation had been rife that the retailer may have taken the opportunity to announce a restructuring of the loss-making venture. Smith shares rose but then retreated to close a penny off at 425p. Confirmation that Lord King had relinquished his role as chairman of British Airways was well received in the market and the shares jumped 5 to 293p. One analyst said; 'What we were looking for was minimum disruption of a good management.' The shares closed 8 up at 296p, with volume reaching 5.5m. Shares in freight container and trailer rental company Tiphook fell 17 to 336p after several brokers downgraded profit expectations. The company's broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reduced its current-year estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 75m, and the following year's figure by the same amount to Pounds 85m. NatWest Securities went from Pounds 80m to Pounds 72.5m, for this year and shaved the 1994 figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 85m. Yield buying, greater confidence over the dividend and and improved outlook for the property sector all helped P&amp;O buck the market trend to add 5 at 570p. Profit-taking in ERF Holdings saw the shares fall 23 to 232p. It was also profit-takers in British Aerospace which saw the shares fall 8 to 270p at the day's worst. But bargain hunters later in the day helped it close 2 lighter at 276p. Dealers said recent currency movements would benefit Siebe and the shares gained 10 to 489p. Royal Insurance added 6 at 282p on talk that SG Warburg Securities was recommending the stock. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (276).

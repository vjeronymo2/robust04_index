			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Arab diplomatic sources said  today that the tension that has marred relations between Libya  and the Arab League has been contained. The tension rose when  Jum'ah al-Fazzani, secretary of the Libyan General People's  Committee for Unity [title as received], announced that his  country was thinking of withdrawing from the Arab League because  of the latter's failure to solve Arab problems, including the  Libyan-Western crisis.    The sources said that the desire shown by Ibrahim  al-Bishari,  Libya's permanent envoy to the Arab League, to head his  country's delegation to the Arab League Council meetings was a  clear signal that this tension is over.    The sources added that Libya is satisfied with the Arab  League's stance on the Libyan-Western crisis and that the Libyan  permanent envoy expressed his country's appreciation for the  role played by the Arab League and the seven-member committee in  solving this problem.    The sources went on to say that the Arab League secretary  general played a vital role in the meeting of the seven-member  committee and left his print on the resolution issued on the  Libyan-Western crisis issued at the conclusion of the Arab  League Council session, which emphasized the League's support  for Libyan efforts to find a peaceful solution to this crisis.</p>

"I am  afraid that, in view of the extremely difficult process of the  formation of public opinion, the West will no longer have the  power to implement stages two, three, and four of the ultimatum  after stage one. What will happen if the first stage does not  yield the desired result? This will be a real disaster." Mock  was also critical of the fact that Washington seems to agree to  Bosnia's partition. "The division is the weakest of all  solutions. It contains the danger of recurring conflicts in the  long run. Yet I do not rule out that it will be implemented,  because at least it will lead to a cease-fire."    In the meantime, THE WASHINGTON POST has reported that the  United States is apparently ready for a compromise in the  dispute over the control of heavy weapons. Some of the weapons  might remain on the mountains surrounding Sarajevo, the paper  quoted U.S. Government officials as saying.</p>

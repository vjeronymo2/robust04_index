			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (3): Crime, prosperity and science  -Nice, the changing face of a not-so-French city FROM time to time Nice-Matin, the daily newspaper for the Cote d'Azur, produces special supplements on subjects of local interest. Most of the supplements, like the rest of the newspaper, are published in French, but these days some are in Italian. Nice, as its inhabitants are swift to say, is not a French city. It has belonged to France for just over a century. Previously it was an Italian state as part of Savoy, the Nicois spoke a local patois, not French, and the Cote d'Azur was called the Riviera. For the first half of its 'French' century, Nice's Italian origins were a burden rather than a boon. Marseille was, after all, well-established as the main French port for trade in the Mediterranean and with France's North African colonies. The Nicois, isolated from the newly unified Italy, were left to adapt to their new nationality. But since the 1960s, as Marseille has declined with the collapse of its old colonial trade, Nice has been free to redefine itself as a centre for the new industries of the future - electronics, information technology and telecommunications. At a time when other cities are still struggling to attract investment, Nice's business parks are packed with French and foreign companies. The Nice of today has a prosperous air, with the mirror glass towers in the business parks around the airport and the spruce hotels with their pretty palm trees along the promenade des Anglais. Affluent expatriates are still arriving to swell the city's 400,000-strong population and unemployment is only a little higher than the national average at 11 per cent. But Nice also has its problems. One issue is the crime rate. Nice is now the centre for major crime in southern France. A glance at the front page of Nice-Matin, with its apparently endless tales of drug hauls and sinister Mafia murders, illustrates the consequences. On the political front the city is still reeling from the disgrace of Mr Jacques Medecin, its long-serving conservative mayor and the architect of a string of successful local initiatives, notably the Acropolis conference centre and the network of waterfront highways. Mr Medecin, whose father, Jean, was mayor before him, was the architect of modern Nice. He initiated a string of public works schemes and drummed up high technology investment to broaden the base of the local economy. But three years ago he fled into exile in Uruguay in the midst of a simmering scandal. Nice is still in conservative hands. But Mr Medecin's departure robbed it of its most authoritative political leader. This left a political vacuum which has undoubtedly helped to fuel the rise of another prominent figure in Nicois politics, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front. Mr Le Pen is not a Nicois (he was born in Brittany) but he has turned the city into his base for the Front's assault on national politics. He lost his fight for a Nice constituency in this spring's parliamentary elections. But his anti-immigration policies, combined with his success in making the Front respectable by attracting petit bourgeois supporters, have struck a chord in Nice and the rest of southern France. The image of Mr Le Pen and his sometimes violent skinhead supporters at their seafront rallies and marches is a side of Nice that local businessmen would rather forget. They prefer to dwell on the positive aspects of the city's cosmopolitan culture - its success in attracting international investment. The linchpin of Nice's success is the Sophia-Antipolis science park, nestling 20km away in the Provence hills above Antibes. The science park was founded in 1969 but expanded rapidly in the 1980s and now includes more than 900 companies spread over 2,300 hectares. Cordis, a products company, arrived there in 1984 as the southern European base for its US parent company. It now employs 150 people, mostly highly-skilled production workers and researchers. Mr Jacques Le Guillerm, chief executive, says the availability of skilled labour and good international air links were the chief criteria for choosing Sophia-Antipolis. The only disadvantage, he says, is the shortage of local machinery suppliers, which has raised the cost and time of new product development. One of the latest trends in Sophia-Antipolis is the arrival of smaller international businesses. Tepar is typical. A joint venture between five multinational oil groups including Elf Aquitaine in France and Texaco of the US, it is composed of a team of seven international oil executives who are launching Pan Diesel Card, a pan-European payment card for truck drivers. Tepar started in offices near Elf's headquarters in Paris, but looked for a cheaper location for its own small operation and the data processing unit that services it. Mr Carl Clump, chief executive, says its main requirements were the availability of multilingual staff for the truckers' help desk and good air links for the Tepar executives - both of which Sophia-Antipolis provides. Other small businesses have chosen cheaper locations in the business centres around Nice airport. But, despite the recession, more companies like Tepar are still arriving at Sophia-Antipolis, which is now doubling in size to accommodate extra demand. Cote d'Azur Development says that the level of interest in the sunny Riviera among prospective new investors is still so high that not only are more small business centres being built but there are also plans for a new, large-scale business park in the hills above Monaco on the border with Italy.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RETAIL SALES DROP 0.1% IN NOVEMBER AS CAUTION REIGNS  </P> <P> In a fresh sign of how tight holiday shoppers' pocketbooks have gotten, the  federal government reported Thursday that retail sales fell 0.1% in November  from the month before.  </P> <P> The retail sales total, at a seasonally adjusted $151.6 billion, was up 3.4%  from weak November, 1989, results. But with inflation running at more than 6%  this year, it means that most merchants are doing less -- or no more --  business than in 1989.  </P> <P> "It's not what a number of retailers were looking for, but we have to  understand that we're probably in a recession," said Rosalind Wells, chief  economist of the National Retail Federation trade group. She called the sales  total "a recession-type number."  </P> <P> Even so, the Commerce Department figures were better than many economists  expected, given the weak sales reports released by major retailers last week. A  Dow Jones survey had forecast a monthly decline of 0.9%.  </P> <P> Also, car sales -- which depressed the November retail sales total -- staged a  big, though possibly misleading, rebound in early December, auto makers  reported Thursday.  </P> <P> The figures, however, did little to change the growing opinion that the economy  has sunk into a recession and that consumers have grown increasingly cautious.  Retailing analysts predicted that department stores and specialty shops will  enjoy a surge of business in the days before Christmas, but not enough to turn  around what so far has been a dismal holiday shopping season.  </P> <P> They also said that, to drum up business, more retailers will follow such  giants as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Toys R Us in offering more and deeper  price cuts on holiday merchandise.  </P> <P> The weak figures reported by the Commerce Department were blamed on worries  about the Persian Gulf crisis, rising unemployment, declining consumer  confidence and rising energy prices.  </P> <P> "Most Americans are laying out so much more money at the gas pump and on home  heating oil that their discretionary buying power is substantially reduced,"  said Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Retail Marketing Report newsletter.  </P> <P> "There's a strong feeling across the country that it's more prudent so save  financial resources than to spend them."  </P> <P> "People are going to buy less than they did in the past year, and they'll spend  less on what they will buy," Barnard added.  </P> <P> One of the likely results: more retailing bankruptcies, said Carl Steidtmann,  chief economist for the retail consulting firm Management Horizons. Along with  the companies burdened with junk bond debts, he said, the list of failures  likely will include retail chains that simply can no longer make enough money  to stay afloat.  </P> <P> The retail sales drop, following a revised 0.2% gain in October, was the first  monthly decline since May.  </P> <P> Among the few comparatively bright spots was the apparel specialty store  category, where sales were up 0.8% from October and 2.3% -- before accounting  for inflation -- from a year ago. Gasoline dealer sales climbed 0.7% from  October and 21.6% from a year earlier, largely as a result of increased prices  amid the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Drugstore sales also climbed, up 0.2% from October and 8.4% from November,  1989. Furniture sales rose 0.3% from October, but were down 1.7% from last  November.  </P> <P> Much of the weakness came at home improvement stores, where seasonally adjusted  sales totals were down 2.6% from October and 5.2% from a year ago. At  department stores, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.2% from October but rose  1.1% from a year ago.  </P> <P> Auto sales, a major component of the government figures, were down 1.3% from  the month before and little changed from a year ago. Eliminating the auto sales  category, retail sales in November posted a 0.2% gain from October and a 4.3%  increase from November, 1989.  </P> <P> Separately, the 10 companies producing cars and trucks in the United States  reported a 22.3% sales increase during the first 10 days of December, versus  the same period last year.  </P> <P> But analysts and auto executives said the increase, coming while U.S. auto  makers are cutting production and losing money, does not reflect the true  weakness of the market.  </P> <P> "Last year's period was extremely weak," said Joel Pitcoff, a sales analyst at  Ford Motor Co. "It was a worse 10-day period than anything we've seen this  year."  </P> <P> Car sales were up 27.8%, and truck sales rose 14.3% from last year. The Big  Three auto makers reported a 29.3% sales increase in domestically made cars,  while sales of Japanese "transplants" increased 14.2%.  </P> <P> "It's somewhat refreshing that the number wasn't as bad as the 10-day period  that ended out November," said Clifford Swenson, an economist at Economic  Planning &amp; Consulting in New York. But when late November's weak showing is  averaged with early December's, Swenson said, "the figure is right in line with  the overall trend in the market, which for the fourth quarter is fairly extreme  weakness. And that extreme weakness should persist at least for the next couple  of months."  </P> <P> Luxury car sales -- widely expected to show a sharp increase before the 10%  excise tax on cars costing more than $30,000 begins Jan. 1 -- failed to meet  expectations, dealers and analysts said.  </P> <P> Americans bought 137,024 U.S.-built cars Dec. 1 to 10, a 28% rise. This  included a 29% gain at General Motors and a 32% increase at Ford. Chrysler  sales climbed 25%.  </P> <P> Among Japanese-based manufacturers, only Honda posted a decline, a drop of 32%.  Mazda rose 105%, Nissan 81%, Toyota 47% and Mitsubishi 35%.  </P> <P> Times researcher Amy Harmon in Detroit contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VEHICLE SALES  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.11IN:2.44IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Dec. 1-10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> year to year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GM*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 99,399  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +22.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 75,114  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +32.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chrysler*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 32,246  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +4.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Honda U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,821  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -31.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mitsubishi U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 875  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +35.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nissan U.S.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,006  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +49.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Toyota U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,628  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +47.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mazda U.S.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,186  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +147.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Subaru U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 347  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  **  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Isuzu U.S.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 370  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  **  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 220,992  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +22.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Includes light truck sales.  </P> <P> **No comparison possible.  </P> <P> There were 8 selling days in the selling period this year and last year.  </P></p>

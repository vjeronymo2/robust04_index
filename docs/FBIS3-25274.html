			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Nigeria's new military government seems to have no  qualms about using its powers of arrest. If reports in today's  state-owned press are to be believed, Shehu Musa Yar'Adua was  one of 23 presidential candidates disqualified from taking part  in last year's presidential elections, and while he supported  the scrapping the election results last June and is himself a  member of a previous Nigerian military government, he is opposed  to the Army's takeover last November, and it looks as if that's  what got him into trouble, as Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos:    [Begin recording] There is no official confirmation of  General Yar'Adua's arrest, but a local newspaper in Kaduna  quoted members of his family as saying that he was picked up at  his residence in Kaduna on Saturday [12 February] shortly after  his arrival from a business trip abroad. The federal  government-owned DAILY TIMES in Lagos also reported that the  general was being detained in Kaduna.    Normally, the state security service does not announce  arrests and detention of people. Information of such action  comes from the detainee's families and, only on very few  occasions, from government spokesmen. In this case, the press  office at the Presidency in Abuja said this afternoon that it  could neither confirm nor deny the general's arrest.    Hints of possible government action against Gen. Yar'Adua  were given two weeks ago by Information Minister Jerry Gana in a  public speech in Makurdi. He was quoted as saying that Gen.  Yar'Adua fled the country because he appreciated the  consequences of the statement which he made at a press  conference in Lagos. The minister described the statement as  offensive. Addressing journalists in Lagos, Gen. Yar'Adua has  criticized the apparently indefinite tenure of the new military  regime of General Sani Abacha and suggested that it should not  extend beyond this year. He also said that the forthcoming  constitutional conference should be a sovereign national  conference rather than one whose decisions would be subject to  approval by the Provisional Ruling Council.    A day after the conference, the police reminded politicians  of the ban on political activities and warned them to stop  making further statements on political issues or risk arrest.  Gen. Yar'Adua's arrest and detention will signal to other  politicians that the warning should be taken seriously. [end  recording]</p>

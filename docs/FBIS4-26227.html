			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News analysis" by Zhang Tiegang: "Why Yeltsin's Visit to </F> Far East?"]    [Text] Moscow, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's three-day working tour of the Russian Far East chiefly  aimed to curb the Tuva Republic from breaking away from Moscow,  according to observers here.    Soon after his return to Moscow on Thursday [16 June], the  Russian president said in an exclusive interview with the  evening "NEWS" program of the Ostankino TV Company that the  regions he visited became closer to him politically.    Yeltsin's trip, started on Tuesday, took him to the far  eastern cities of Blagoveshchensk, a central city of the Amur  region and Kyzyl, the capital of the Tuva Republic. On his way  back to Moscow, he made a brief stop in the Siberian city of  Novosibirsk on the final day of his tour.    At a meeting with Kyzyl leaders, the president offered over  8  million U.S. dollars to the Tuva Republic for its economic  development.    Tuva, which joined Russia in 1914, has an area of 170,500  square kilometers with a population of 300,000. In recent  years, the republic has shown light tendencies towards  independence from Moscow.    Yeltsin told Tuva leaders that the main economic indicators  in the republic are worse than the Russian average, and then  promised them a substantial aid from the federal budget.    But he noted that "the republic cannot live by relying only  on its own resources."    He said, "The republic can go through the deep economic  crisis only by closer cooperation with other regions and joining  in the inter-regional association called the `Siberian  Agreement.'"    Yeltsin also said that "it is necessary" for the republic to  develop relations with bordering Mongolia and with China.    The Russian leader stressed that efforts should be made to  implement the two decrees he signed in Tuva to develop the  economy of the republic.    According to the president, the former mistrust between  Kremlin and the Tuva leadership has disappeared after his trip  to Far East region.</p>

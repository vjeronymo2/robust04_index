			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Leading Article: One cheer for the MMC THE MOTOR industry is no doubt suitably relieved by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's failure to uncover any solid evidence that new car prices in Britain systematically exceed levels elsewhere in the European Community. However, the investigation raises enough other awkward questions about the structure of the UK car market to suggest the need for corrective action, beyond what the MMC or the government appear ready to consider. The MMC's most striking finding on prices is the scale of differentials inside the UK. As it points out, the ability of large fleet operators to obtain far more generous discounts than private buyers compels the latter, in practice, to subsidise the former. The inequity lies not in bulk discounts per se, which are normal in most businesses, but in the fact that they are the direct result of a distortion created by tax breaks on company cars. As the MMC report puts it, 'the present tax system disadvantages the private buyer and screens out a large part of the market from consumer choice'. Though recent budgets have reduced tax concessions on the company car, its continuing popularity suggests they have not yet been eliminated entirely. As well as adopting the MMC's sensible proposal to abolish the current 'banding' system and relate tax to actual purchase prices, the chancellor should ensure in the next budget that associated perks such as free insurance and repairs are fully taxed. Selective distribution The report is far less satisfactory when it comes to the selective distribution system, which permits car manufacturers to choose which dealers they supply. It proposes some minor modifications, but their effectiveness remains uncertain, given the failure to address the central issues. Specifically, the MMC seems to have accepted too readily industry arguments in favour of the system's supposed benefits to consumers, without attempting to weigh them against the advantages to be gained from free competition at the retail level. Perhaps the MMC was inhibited from inquiring too deeply by the unfortunate results of its efforts to weaken vertical integration in the brewing industry. But beer and cars are very different products, with very different markets. Indeed, the legal basis for selective distribution - a system which would be regarded as anti-competitive in any other industry - is that cars' technical sophistication makes them unique products, requiring standards of service and customer support which only franchised dealers can provide. Uneven service However, the much increased reliability of modern cars and the mixed quality of service provided by many UK franchised dealers raise doubts about the validity of this proposition. It is disappointing that nowhere in its 1,000-page report does the MMC attempt to question it. This is a serious omission, all the more so because the issue will be central to the EC's forthcoming discussions on whether to extend beyond 1995 its exemption of selective distribution from competition rules. It is to be hoped that the EC's deliberations will be based on a more rigorous analysis of the system than the MMC has provided. The undertaking by Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, to consider the report's proposal to open the British market freely to Japanese car imports is welcome. But in the circumstances, it may amount to little more than a belated gesture of repentance. The British government signed away to Brussels control over this area of trade policy when it went along last year with plans to replace national quotas on Japanese car imports with overall EC restraints. That would have been the moment to press for unrestricted imports. But ministers were much more concerned with avoiding output restrictions on Japanese-owned plants in the UK. Indeed, the prospect of continued protection of the British market seemed hardly to perturb them. Whether they will summon up greater determination to fight for free trade now remains an open question.</p>

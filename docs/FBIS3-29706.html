			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Sideline" column by Sophon Ongkon: "Chuan </F> Government Loses Leverage with Military"]    [Text] The displeasure of the military top brass over the  barter trade for arms must have startled the Chuan Cabinet. The  impressive line-up of the armed forces leaders was an overkill  for the increasingly beleaguered administrator which seems to be  limping towards the end of the road.    What has inspired the military leaders to take such a bold  move could be anybody's guess. Government weakness is a simple  answer. To the public, this is indeed a bad sign. The upbeat  statement on the barter trade made by the generals on Friday  would have been unthinkable in the days after the May 1992  bloodshed.    It was the worst moment for the administration which has  been  closeting itself in a self-woven political cocoon amidst the  public criticism over its lacklustre performance. It cannot  pick more fights, especially with the armed forces. The timing  was good for the military chiefs because they know that not many  people would want to side with the administration which has  alienated itself from former allies and supporters.    They are also aware that the administration has been  fighting  on many fronts and struggling to stay in power. Its energy has  been drained by inept handling of critical issues such as  protest rallies staged by farmers and other victims of  grievances while creating more adversaries in the same process.    Had the government been able to maintain a cordial  relationship with public-interest groups, such as NGOs,  academics, students, labour unions, and the Confederation for  Democracy -- or even the press -- things would have turned out  differently. The armed forces chiefs would have thought twice  before flexing their muscles -- something quite unfamiliar  during the past two years.    Alas, many cabinet members seen on television with sound  bytes showed only sheepish smiles, while avoiding reporters' eye  contact when they were pressed for their reactions to the  military hyperbole. Obviously, it was not their day. The ego,  inflated during the verbal duels with academics, seems to have  shrunk considerably.    We suspect that the way the armed forces bosses thundered  their statement, echoed through a spokesman, must have driven  some cabinet members out of their wits. They might be fretting  over a question: Would the doomsday for the government come so  soon?    There was one positive aspect though, when we saw that the  top brass behaved much less like bullies -- a style preferred by  their predecessors. May be they know the current limits, and  prefer to wait until the government can no longer function with  enough credibility.    But that was still not enough. The commanders should have  adopted a more subtle method, a low-keyed approach, in dealing  with this issue. A quiet chat would have been sufficient to  avoid unnecessary ill feelings and public concern when it looked  more like a confrontation.    At the same time, their rejection of the government's  proposal for a barter of agricultural products with defence  procurement must be amply justified instead of saying just that  such arrangements would be too complicated and unworkable. They  cannot spend other people's money on their own will.    They should explain why. If they do not have much regard for  the administration, they must still take the taxpayers into  consideration. The people have become more wary. They  certainly want to know who will be the eventual targets of the  expensive firearms and other fearsome weaponry bought with their  sweat and toil. There was a painful lesson for the people who  had braved the bullets and batons on Ratchadamnoen Avenue two  years ago.    The military leaders have to come up with some sort of  assurance that the weapons they intend to acquire, with cash or  other means, are not the defence equipment which have defects  and fail to perform reasonably well in time of war as witnessed  in the purchases of Stingray light tanks and the Spada air  defence missile system last year.    Things have changed. The commanders have to learn to cope  with the ongoing social evolution. At least a sense of  accountability to the public should be instilled in the holders  of public offices, no matter what branches in the government  they are in.    If the commanders want arms to modernize their forces, they  should produce credible proposals and allow more public scrutiny  to display sincerity. These are also means to ensure that some  fat-cat generals are barred from ill-gotten gains. An embracing  excuse such as "national security" cannot impress the people all  the time, especially those who are not gullible enough.    A fact is that there are no secrets anymore, even in the  arms  bazaar. All countries know what are being bought and sold, by  whom and to whom, with the smallest of details and  specifications. What remains a secret, or little known, is the  extent of commissions, or kickbacks, given by arms merchants to  grease the hands holding the pen to sign the procurement  contracts.    All commercial transactions offer commissions, and only  foolish buyers or traders would be unaware of the existence of  kickbacks. This is a major factor which has enriched so many  people involved in arms deals in our country in the past three  decades.    This is no wonder at all. Many military officers with simple  family backgrounds -- some as poor as church mice -- have been  able to amass wealth before their retirement like acquire  foreign assets and generously acting as political paymasters.    If Prime Minister Chuan and his administration think that  the  military show-off was in fact a bullying tactic, then they must  show some spines themselves. Chuan's legendary razor-edged  tongue must brave the menace of the bayonet. Beseeching should  not be an alternative to a compromise. The taxpayers and nobody  else, always have the final say with their money. They are  entitled to a sensible explanation as well.    Who knows? If government leaders are willing to take the  bull by the horns, cheering fans might emerge from somewhere to  give them a push while temporarily burying their hatchets only  for this particular incident. The last thing the government  should do is underestimate the power of the people.    After all, the people know that the bull cannot be allowed  to  run amok and frighten the public so that it can gain more  ground, and eventually dominate the whole arena again.    The government should not take pleasure in committing  failures so much that it is producing another one.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPACE STATION CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> MCDONNELL DOUGLAS LAUNCHES ADS TO SAVE PROGRAM  </P> <P> Two years ago, McDonnell Douglas Corp. tried to boost support for America's  fledgling space station program -- a project potentially worth $1 billion in  business for the aerospace company -- in a TV advertising campaign that some  people thought came on too strong.  </P> <P> The commercial -- dubbed "Reds" by McDonnell Douglas publicists -- showed a  Soviet space station drifting by as people are heard speaking Russian and  laughing. The letters "CCCP" and a red star are clearly visible on the  station's outer surface.  </P> <P> As the spacecraft passed out of view, a message appeared on the screen:  "Shouldn't We Be There, Too?"  </P> <P> NBC, ABC and CBS refused to air the commercial, calling it too controversial.  The commercial, however, did air for several months on selected local TV  stations.  </P> <P> This week, McDonnell Douglas is back with a new, more subtle TV ad campaign  aimed at bolstering the space station program. The new ad doesn't mention the  Soviet Union. Instead, it features a blonde, blue-eyed little girl and stresses  the themes of space exploration, education and America's future.  </P> <P> The ad campaign comes at a time when the space station program is facing  possible delays or cancellation due to the federal budget squeeze.  </P> <P> NASA has requested $2 billion for the program next year, a big increase from  $900 million in the current year. But Congress is widely expected to trim  NASA's $13.2-billion budget request for fiscal 1990, and the space station is  likely to share in those cuts.  </P> <P> NASA Administrator Dale D. Myers said recently that he will recommend canceling  the space station if Congress orders the agency's $13.2-billion budget cut by  more than $600 million.  </P> <P> Hoping to avert such drastic action, McDonnell Douglas decided to make its case  for the space station on the airwaves.  </P> <P> The new 30-second ad shows a starry-eyed little girl donning a space suit and  helmet and looking skyward as the space station floats by. The song "Twinkle,  Twinkle Little Star" plays in the background.  </P> <P> A female narrator says: "There's a big world waiting out there, little one. But  if you go to school and learn reading, writing, history, art, science and  everything else you can, who knows how far you'll go?"  </P> <P> After a short pause, a man's voice says: "For an educated America, even the  sky's not the limit."  </P> <P> The "Astro Baby" ad was developed by J. Walter Thompson, which also developed  the "Reds" commercial.  </P> <P> Tom Williams, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in Huntington  Beach, said the purpose of the latest commercial is "to create a strong  awareness of education and manned space flight."  </P> <P> The ad doesn't even mention the space station by name, but briefly shows the  station. "Some people here (at McDonnell Douglas) saw the ad and felt it was  perhaps too subtle," Williams said.  </P> <P> The company refused to say how much it is spending on the ad campaign, but  Williams said it will eat up a "large hunk" of the Space Systems 1989  advertising budget.  </P> <P> The Astro Baby ad began airing Monday on the Cable News Network. It will begin  showing on the major networks Sunday, Mother's Day, on morning public affairs  programs. The ad is scheduled to be aired through June.  </P> <P> The ad also will be shown in select local TV stations in areas targeted for  political reasons. Those areas include Baltimore; Baton Rouge, La.; Flint,  Mich., Jackson, Miss., and Springfield, Mass.  </P> <P> Baltimore, for example, is the district of Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.),  who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA's  budget. The ads will also air in the home district of Rep. Bob Traxler  (D-Mich.), chairman of the House panel handling the NASA budget.  </P> <P> "These are all areas where we wouldn't be disappointed if people contacted  their congressmen," Williams said.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas has a lot at stake with the space station program.  </P> <P> In December, 1987, a contracting team led by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems  was awarded a $1.9-billion contract to build a major section of the space  station. The contract involves construction of the station's external  framework, air locks and internal working areas. The company already has 680  people working on the space station and will hire several hundred more if the  program continues to receive funding during the next few years.  </P> <P> The company plans to move its space station employees into an 8-story office  building that is being constructed specifically for the project near its  Huntington Beach complex, at a cost of $25 million.  </P> <P> Current plans are to begin launching sections of the station, which will be  assembled in space, in 1995.  </P> <P> Williams said the new ad intentionally takes a more low-key approach than the  earlier "Reds" spot.  </P> <P> "Reds was made to create an awareness that the Russians had their Mir manned  space station in operation and the United States was lagging in space,"  Williams said.  </P> <P> The networks viewed the Reds ad as controversial because it played up the "Red  scare" theme reminiscent of the days of Sputnik more than 30 years ago. The  Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 caught Americans by surprise and  fueled fears that the Soviets had grabbed a technological lead.  </P></p>

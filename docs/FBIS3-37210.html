			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, 15 Feb -- "The aim of my visit to Zagreb can  be put in a single phrase: to prevent air strikes in the  Sarajevo region," Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation  president's special envoy and deputy foreign affairs minister,  stated on Monday [14 February] evening to the ITAR-TASS  correspondent. But this is a dual task, he said. The blockade  of Sarajevo absolutely must be lifted.    This issue was given absolute priority at the Russian  diplomat's meeting yesterday with Yasushi Akashi, the UN  secretary general's special representative to the former  Yugoslavia, as well as at consultations planned for today in  Sarajevo with General Michael Rose, the commander of the UN  forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with the commanders of the  Bosnian Serbs and Muslims.    Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent about  the actions that Russia will take if strikes were not  successfully averted, Vitaliy Churkin stressed that "everything  will depend on the specific situation." "If strikes are made  under conditions that we do not consider justifiable, then the  consequences for our relations with the world around us are  inevitable," the high-ranking Russian diplomat said, stressing  that this was his personal view.</p>

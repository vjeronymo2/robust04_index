			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mattel Sued for Cleanup Costs: A $1.4-million lawsuit was filed against Mattel  Inc. by H&amp;H Paramount, a Los Angeles limited partnership, which claims that  the toy maker "actively concealed" its use and disposal of hazardous waste at a  plastic molding plant in Paramount.  </P> <P> The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. At the time H&amp;H  bought the property in 1971, Mattel had been a tenant for one year, the suit  says. It was not until after 1988 that H&amp;H learned Mattel used the site as  a plastic injection molding facility, where it had used "various dangerous,  toxic and hazardous substances," according to the lawsuit. Hawthorne-based  Mattel could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

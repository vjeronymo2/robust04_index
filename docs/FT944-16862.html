At the official 4:10pm close the FT-SE 100 December contract was 40 points higher at 3,057. This was just short of the 3,058 best of the day. The premium to the cash market 24.7 points and the fair value premium around 16 points. The premium to cash equities was substantial for most of the day but traders said most attempts to provide the the cash market with a viable lead lacked conviction. Traders pointed to the lacklustre level of activity - there were just 10,657 contracts, against 13,892 on Friday - and said this reflected the finely poised balance of opinion on where the December contract goes from here. 'There are plenty of people around who cannot really believe that a recovery in equities is finally under way', said one leading trader yesterday. Volume in traded options totalled 24,420 lots, down from 27,669 lots on Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for more than half of the day's trading at 14026 lots. BT (765 lots), RTZ (765) and Redland (698) were the most actively traded individual options</p>

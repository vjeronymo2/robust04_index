			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Economic signals flash red and green: The conflicting figures in an attempt to see what they add up to THE US economy is disconcertingly Janus-faced. The signals from Wall Street could hardly be more encouraging. A strong stockmarket rally has swept the Dow Jones industrial average through the 3,600 barrier and into uncharted territory. The yield on the benchmark long bond, meanwhile, has dropped sharply to only just above 6 per cent, far lower than most analysts would have thought possible a year ago. Yet the real economy remains disturbingly sluggish. Wednesday's report of a 3.8 per cent decline in new orders for durable goods between June and July was typical of recent economic indicators, which have invariably been weaker than analysts expected. The biggest shock was inflicted by last week's trade figures for June, which showed a deficit of Dollars 12.1bn. This was about 40 per cent larger than expected and constituted the biggest shortfall since 1987, when the Reagan economic boom was still under way. In the light of these figures, most forecasters now expect economic growth in the second quarter to be revised down from an annual rate of 1.6 per cent to 1 per cent, or possibly even lower. The expected recovery of growth after the disappointing first quarter, when gross domestic product edged forward at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent, thus failed to materialise. The robust 4 per cent growth of the last six months of the Bush administration has become a distant memory. There are conflicting views about the immediate economic outlook. 'The economy is going to continue to disappoint,' says Mr Allen Sinai, a managing director at Lehman Brothers, the securities group. 'It is hard to achieve growth when defence is being cut drastically, when state and federal government are holding down spending, when companies are down-sizing, and when the rest of the world is extremely weak.' Mr Sinai predicts a continuation of the sluggish economic recovery of the past two years, with growth likely to average about 2 per cent, far below the rate normal in a US recovery. But other forecasters are far more optimistic. Mr Paul Mastroddi, senior economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, continues to predict growth at an annual rate of nearly 4 per cent in the second half of this year. He does not expect the tax increases mandated in President Bill Clinton's budget to have much effect on future growth on the grounds that the main measures have been known since late last year. The high-income individuals most affected by the budget have already had plenty of time to adjust. He regards the economy's recent performance as much more encouraging than the headline figures might suggest. At 6.8 per cent, the jobless rate is nearly a percentage point lower than at this time last year. Real gross domestic product is 2 1/2 per cent higher. Business equipment investment is soaring. Corporate profits continue to register double-digit increases. Inventories are very lean, suggesting that companies will have to step up production to meet higher consumer demand in the current quarter. And although a higher trade deficit arithmetically subtracts from growth, the surge in imports last month provides further confirmation of relatively strong domestic demand. The rising external deficit is a sign that the US is growing faster than other countries, not evidence of weak competitiveness in traded goods sectors. Looking forward, the domestic economic fundamentals are mostly highly encouraging. The inflation scare that worried the Federal Reserve earlier this year seems over: in the past three months consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of less than 1 per cent. Although few analysts expect prices to remain this subdued, the underlying rate of inflation has probably stabilised at 3 per cent, or conceivably a little less. The decline in inflation, coupled with the passage of President Clinton's mildly deflationary budget, has prompted sharp declines in interest rates of all maturities. As Mr William Griggs and Mr Leonard Santow, Wall Street bond market commentators, stressed in a recent circular, this is doing wonders for the health of sectors strained during the late 1980s. Banks have increased their capital ratios and should feel more comfortable about lending. Companies and households have refinanced debt on much better terms and should be more willing to spend. The federal government is able to finance its considerable debt more cheaply. Equally important, lower long-term interest rates lead to arithmetically higher share prices because they raise the present value of future corporate earnings. Higher share prices in turn raise the wealth - and hence spending power - of both the personal and corporate sector. There is no question that recent economic figures have been disappointing. But, since exports are still only about 12 per cent of gross domestic product, the US remains relatively well insulated from adverse international economic trends. Given the strong impetus from lower interest rates, it would be surprising if economic growth does not accelerate later this year.</p>

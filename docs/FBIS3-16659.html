			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Twenty eight members of Eduard Shevardnadze's office  were subjected to an unusual procedure on Wednesday. They began  to undergo medical tests designed to reveal drug abusers.    As Interfax learned from the Georgian leader's aides, state  counsellors, chiefs of departments and ordinary members of the  office had their urine tested, showed doctors their blood  vessels and answered questions. All this aims to rid government  institutions of drug addicts. According to an official, such  examinations will be regular.    On February 5th Eduard Shevardnadze signed a decree which  said that "the growing trend toward drug addiction jeopardizes  people's health, poses a threat to national security, and  discredits government institutions." In this connection a  governmental commission was formed. It is led by Deputy Premier  Irakly Menagarishvili.    The check-up will spread to other government institutions,  above all to the Defence and Interior Ministries, some of whose  members have been caught abusing or trafficking narcotics.</p>

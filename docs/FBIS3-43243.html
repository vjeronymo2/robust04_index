But the attack had to be seen "in the context of the daily  carnage sweeping across our country, especially in the East Rand  and the killing fields of Natal," said Deputy President Johnson  Mlambo in a telephone interview with SAPA. "The PAC calls upon  all our people to pay an equal value to all human life,  regardless of skin colour."    Mr Mlambo said the PAC would continue to work hard for a  mutual cessation of hostilities with the "regime". "We hope in  the new year to extend our slogan of peace amongst the African  people to apply to all who live in our country."    He added that the PAC did not know who was behind the  attack.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, member of the Popular </F> Front for the Liberation of Palestine Political Bureau, who  resigned his post as a PLO Executive Committee member to protest  the Gaza-Jericho agreement, by Usamah al-Rantisi; place and date  not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Rantisi] As the opposition,  what will be your position if the Syrians sign an agreement with  the Israelis?    [Malluh] We have from the very beginning, since the Madrid  conference, opposed the proposed settlement. We opposed it  while Syria was involved in it. Therefore, our opposition was  not directed against the Palestinian party alone, and it did not  start with the signing of the Oslo agreement. Of course, as a  Palestinian faction, our role and action should concentrate on  the Palestinian arena. At the same time, we believe that the  current negotiations will yield certain results between Syria  and Israel and between Jordan and Israel.    We in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  believe it is unfair to view us from the perspective of our  presence in Syria. The front is not hostage to this or that  place. We are present where the Palestinian people are. I  would not be revealing a secret when I say that our  organizational presence in Syria is the weakest link of our  presence as far as we are concerned. This is due to the size of  the Palestinian presence in Syria. So our opposition is not  linked to this or that Arab party. True, we may face some  difficulties if the Syrian-Israeli negotiations achieve results  in the near future, but this will not change our position on the  settlement and its threats to the [Palestinian] cause. When we  believe in a political stand, we will not allow the geography  factor to influence us. You remember our position in the unity  experience of 1987, the war of the camps, and other events.    We are interested in finding positions for ourselves. It is  our right to do so in order to move freely and say what we  believe in. Our search for contradictions in the settlement  equation in order to benefit from it is one thing, but our  position on the Oslo agreement and its liquidationst results is  another.

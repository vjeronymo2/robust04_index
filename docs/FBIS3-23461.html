			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara -- The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP),  which has maintained a very low profile ever since the Sep 12,  1980 military coup, has recently been attracting a lot of  attention with its activities in the Southeast in the run up to  the local elections on March 27. Political observers say that  there is renewed energy in the party ranks and its mayoral  candidates are conducting a very successful campaign with the  assistance and support of the security forces in the region.  They say that the MHP is being used as a shield against the  terrorist activities of the PKK (outlawed Kurdistan Workers'  Party) in the Southeast. Observers predict that successful MHP  candidates at the local elections will be open targets for the  PKK.    Opinion polls show that the MHP will do very well in the 27  March mayoral elections in at least two provinces and a number  of districts and townships in the Southeast. MHP candidates for  Sirnak and Bingol provinces are regarded as certain to win and  party officials have intensified their campaign for Diyarbakir,  the biggest province in the region.    Political observers say that MHP campaigns in the region  have  the active support of the security forces and make the  observation that MHP candidates are protected by the security  forces, consisting of police, special teams, village guards and  the clans who support the government. Furthermore, these groups  are able to convey the MHP's message to sections of the  community which are out of reach of the political parties.  Military personnel are not involved in the campaign but some  are reported to be encouraging people to vote for the MHP.  Observers also point out that the turnout of voters in the  region will be relatively low and this will benefit the MHP.  They believe that those who had intended to vote for the  Democracy Party (DEP) will not vote for any other party now that  the DEP has withdrawn from the elections. Many voters take the  threats by the PKK very seriously and will not risk voting for  another party. Voters will also experience difficulties in  reaching polling stations due to unfavorable weather conditions.  Added to this is the number of people who have moved away from  the area since they were registered on the electoral roll.    These factors will result in a low turnout which will be to  the MHP's advantage.    Based on the belief that MHP supporters are actively engaged  in warfare with PKK terrorists, commentators say that the MHP  and its young nationalist members are being set up for a bloody  confrontation with the PKK.    Chairman of MHP, Alpaslan Turkes, is reported to have said  that his party was very reluctant to have anything to do with an  outlawed group such as the PKK which worked against the state.  Turkes also said that it was the government's responsibility to  take the necessary measures otherwise any act by the MHP might  be regarded as provocation.    Observers also believe that the supporters of the MHP are  inadvertently pushing the party into the eye of the storm, into  open clashes with PKK terrorists.    "Let us assume that MHP candidates are successful in some of  the provinces" observers say, "The PKK will definitely kill  these candidates, even though there is no active anti-PKK  campaign in the region. They will owe their success to the  support of the armed forces once they are elected.    In the event that the PKK does kill the MHP candidates, not  only will they succeed in causing havoc in the region, they will  draw the members of the MHP into the centre of the Kurdish  problem.    The irony of the situation is that the PKK will finally set  the MHP against itself even though the MHP has always succeeded  in avoiding a confrontation with the PKK."    The MHP is well known for its willingness to be actively  involved in the Azeri-Armenian and Bosnian conflicts, but does  not want to have any dealings with the PKK.    They may not be able to avoid the consequences of the recent  political developments in the region.</p>

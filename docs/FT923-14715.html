			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (10): The unions in a new environment - Robert Graham reports on the changing face of industrial relations OF ALL the major economies, Italy has been the slowest to adapt its industrial relations to changing international conditions. The powerful trade union movement which emerged after the Second World War has won exceptionally favourable conditions for its members on the back of a fast-growing economy and a political establishment afraid of worker unrest. Job security, wage indexation, a short working week, long holidays and generous pensions have become part of a package taken for granted until very recently. But increased international competition, combined with a domestic recession and continually deteriorating public finances, are forcing change. Companies in both the public and private sectors are being obliged to improve productivity, curb wage costs and introduce more flexible employment policies. The trade unions themselves recognise the need to adapt to the new environment. Indeed, the traditional confrontational reflexes are disappearing and both sides, whether management or labour, accept that dialogue and consensus are more constructive. Last year the number of hours lost through disputes dropped 70 per cent to one of its lowest levels ever. However, the divisions between the two sides are as wide as ever, and it is far from clear how they will react to controversial issues now on the table such as job cuts and ending wage indexation. The long-standing system of wage indexation, known as the scala mobile, has come to symbolise the Italian way of doing things - beneficial to employees but inflationary to the economy and costly to the employers (who then try to offset the costs by avoiding taxes). Since the Craxi government of the mid-1980s, the extent of indexation has gradually been reduced and at the end of last year the decree to renew the scala mobile was allowed to lapse. By this time the payment had dropped to a 40 per cent top up of that percentage which inflation had risen above its level envisaged in the wage settlement. Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, interpreted the lapsing of the law as a clear government move to abandon indexed wages as known under the scala mobile. On this basis Confindustria agreed to resume a fresh set of broad-ranging talks on wage and labour costs. CGIL, the largest of the three big union confederations, challenged this view immediately, arguing that a number of wage settlements concluded last year had written in provision for payments of the scala mobile increase due in May. When May arrived, both the government and Confindustria flatly refused to pay this increase which would mean an extra payment averaging L28,000 a month. In a full year Confindustria maintains it would add some 2 per cent to the projected 1992 average wage increase of 5.6 per cent. The CGIL reacted by taking the matter to the courts and its metal-workers' union began at the end of May a series of rolling protest strikes. This was primarily intended to make the point, in the absence of a government, that an alternative had to be found to the scala mobile and that the issue of contracts with the scala mobile payment written in could not be ignored. The unions are willing to be more flexible - especially those in CISL and UIL, the two smaller confederations. However, as they see the centre of power shift towards the employers, they are reluctant to make concessions without a fight. Unless the matter is resolved, the climate of labour relations could sour in the autumn. The unions are divided among themselves on the type of 'protective mechanism' needed to shelter wages from inflation. But they seem to be moving towards a proposal whereby loss of purchasing power through inflation should be made up to those on the lowest wages. This approach has been favoured by Mr Franco Marini, the outgoing labour minister. Certainly, some sop will be necessary to keep the trade unions happy if the new government implements a tough austerity package. Confindustria, on the other hand, maintains that labour can no longer presume to enjoy the luxury of its purchasing power either permanently increasing above inflation or being protected at inflation levels - especially if wages are anyway rising above Italy's main competitors. The confederation is taking a tough stand, not least because this issue is providing the baptism for Mr Luigi Abete, the Rome entrepreneur who took over the leadership of Confindustria last month. The unions may prefer to opt for job security rather than wage compensation. Already, industrial companies are having to slim down to survive. Olivetti was the first of the big companies to propose cuts; and this has been followed up by Fiat which last month decided to close its Chiavasso auto plant which employs 4,200. Fiat is pledged to find alternative employment, but this may be easier said than done. Meanwhile, smaller companies lack the resources and diversity of Fiat; nor do they have its political muscle - thus the knock-on effect of the industrial downturn in the north will be keenly felt. A significant pointer has been the number of requests by companies to be included in this year's quota for government-aided early retirement. Even though the government insisted that only the most pressing cases would be considered of those companies seeking to restructure in advanced and strategic sectors, over 42,000 requests were submitted. The cost of this scheme is shared jointly by the government and companies and allows people to retire five years early. In most cases, it is merely people who previously would have been covered by temporary lay-off payments until proper retirement age onto pensions - so the net extra cost is limited, officials claim. Another issue that the unions will need to confront is wage differentials. The unions fought hard for the principle of equal wages for the same job throughout Italy. However, this has become an impediment to investment in the south. Employers are reluctant to invest when wages are the same but productivity is 30 per cent less than in the north. The question of wage differentials in turn opens up the whole structure of trade union negotiations. Until now, this has been done on a highly centralised basis with the main confederations laying down the guidelines for their demands in each sector - eg transport, chemicals, engineering, etc. Already, specialised groups such as train drivers and airline flight attendants have formed themselves into unofficial unions, the so-called Cobas. The latter have recognised that they can exploit their special bargaining power, holding to ransom users of strategic facilities; and in this way they can obtain better deals than those negotiated in their names by the large unions. Although the three main confederations deny the Cobas have affected them and their membership, they have undoubtedly had an important disruptive effect. In general, the unions have to respond to a trend of declining membership. This may not be so marked as in France and the UK, but it cannot be ignored. The CGIL has seen active members fall from 3.39m to 2.72m in the 10 years to 1991 while the number of pensioners has doubled to 2.45m. In part, this reflects the declining role of ideology in the movement, the CGIL always having been Marxist-oriented while the CISL was Catholic, backed by the Christian Democrats and the UIL was Social Democrat. Indeed, the rationale behind the maintenance of these three confederations is increasingly hard to justify. Last October, the CGIL in its 12th congress formerly buried its long-held credo in the class struggle, although a minority of hard-line communists took their distance. This had made a merger more politically feasible; but the two smaller confederations are afraid they will be swallowed up by the CGIL.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - South Africa Johannesburg's stock exchange announced moves to deregulate the market last week. The measures include a timetable for removing those barriers which have prevented banks and foreign companies from owning local brokers. The JSE, which ranks as the 11th largest stock market in the world as measured by market capitalisation, will be restructured to 'meet the needs of the new South Africa', said Mr Roy Anderson, the president of the exchange. Banks and foreign companies will be able to take a 30 per cent stake in local brokers as soon as legislative amendments have been passed by parliament, with full ownership to be permitted 12 months later. The South African Council of Banks has said that it will continue investigations into prospects for a rival stock exchange, although it was open to further talks with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.</p>

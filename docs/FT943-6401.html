			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Mobile phones lead race for new subscribers Mobile phones are enjoying such a boom in the UK that new cellular phone connections are racing ahead of links to traditional fixed phone networks. The UK's four cellular networks have about 2.6m subscribers compared with BT's 26m and about 500,000 for the cable companies. On current trends, the gap between numbers of subscribers on fixed and mobile networks will narrow, in spite of sustained growth in the number of fixed-line connections. Net new connections to mobile networks overtook fixed network connections to British Telecom and the cable TV companies last December, on a surge of pre-Christmas mobile phone buying. Analysts expected the mobile phone tide would ebb after Christmas, but cellular has stayed ahead every month this year except January in what is clearly a turning point for the telecommunications industry. It took the UK's cellular operators eight years from their launch in 1985 to attract their first 1.4m customers. The number of subscribers has almost doubled since the start of 1993, with the increase running at more than 50 per cent a year. The figures reflect the fact that mobile phones are no longer seen as yuppie playthings. Recent advertising campaigns by mobile operators have been pitched at mainstream consumers, and one of the four networks  - Mercury One-2-One - claims to be in direct competition with BT by offering free local mobile phone calls on its networks in the evenings. The mobile networks are far more expensive than their fixed counterparts, when allowance is made for monthly subscriptions of up to Pounds 28.75 and the high cost of phone calls, handsets and initial connection. However, mobile prices are falling rapidly, with call charges down by as much as a third over the past year and handsets widely available for less than Pounds 100. Two new networks - Orange and One-2-One - were launched in the past year to compete with established operators Vodafone and Cellnet. BT, which has a 60 per cent stake in Cellnet, is now adding new mobile customers more than two-thirds as fast as it is gaining fixed-line subscribers. At nearly five mobile subscribers per 100 people, the UK has a higher density of mobile phone users than any European country except Scandinavia, where the figure is about 10 in 100.

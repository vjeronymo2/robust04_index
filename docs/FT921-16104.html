			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): London weighting improved LONG-SERVING London staff at Yorkshire Building Society have become one of the first groups of employees to be paid more than Pounds 4,000 a year extra for working in the capital. The deal, which means staff with five years' service in the capital will enjoy a weighting allowance of Pounds 4,110, will add impetus to union campaigns for London workers to receive higher allowances. The new top rate at Yorkshire, which is available to staff within five miles of central London, compares with rates of between Pounds 3,200 and Pounds 3,600 paid by the big four clearing banks. Central London staff at Yorkshire with less than two years' service will be paid Pounds 3,420 (previously Pounds 3,318) extra and those with between two and five years' service will be paid Pounds 3,759 (Pounds 3.651). The previous rate for staff with five years' service was Pounds 3,984. Financial services companies have traditionally set the pace in raising London weighting. In recent years rises have been small as the recession has eased the recruitment and retention problems companies experienced in the late 1980s.</p>

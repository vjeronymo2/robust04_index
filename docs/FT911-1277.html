			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Portuguese bank to be sold THE Portuguese government yesterday resumed its privatisation programme, suspended in January, with the sale of Sociedade Financeira Portuguesa (SFP), an investment company under state control since 1969 and which was recently transformed into an investment bank, Patrick Blum writes from Lisbon. Sale of the 9m shares was split into two main tranches: an indivisible 80 per cent tranche sold by auction, and 20 per cent reserved for employees and other investors. The auction for the majority share was won by Mr Jose Manuel de Mello, who heads one of Portugal's large private groups.</p>

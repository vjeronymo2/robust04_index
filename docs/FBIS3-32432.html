The Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity [URNG] delegation was headed by Commanders  Gaspar Ilom and Pablo Monsanto and members of the rebel  diplomatic commission.    Augusto Ramirez Ocampo reported that the URNG delegation had  come to learn of the role played by the United Nations in the  verification of the Salvadoran peace process. On his part,  Commander Rodrigo Asturas, alias Gaspar Ilom, said the agreement  signed by the URNG and the Guatemalan Government on 10 January,  allowed them to anticipate a positive future for the  negotiations.    [Begin Asturias recording] [Words indistinct] specially  significant to us, especially based on our evaluation of the  Salvadoran negotiations and peace process. At the same time, we  wanted to verify, in situ, the United Nations' weight in this  peace process. In our case, we asked for UN participation as  soon as we initiated talks in Guatemala. We ratified our  request in the agreement signed on 10 January. We have called  on the United Nations to act as a mediator in the process and  this, of course, includes verification of all the agreements.  [end recording]    URNG Commander Gaspar Ilom, who is the son of Miguel Angel  Asturias, a nobel laureate for literature, considered that the  UN experience in verifying the implementation of the agreements  in El Salvador is promising. Ilom said the Guatemalan peace  process will be very complicated but not, as a result of this,  irresolvable. He added that they hope to reach agreements  leading to peace very soon. Ilom insisted that the main points  of the negotiation are to establish the role of the Army in a  democratic society, the country's economic problems, and issues  related to the Indian problem.</p>

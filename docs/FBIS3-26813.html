			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cheng Xiaohong (4453 2556 4767): "Tibet Will Soon </F> Undergo Finance and Tax Reform"]    [Text] This reporter has learned from a recent regional  conference on finance and taxation work that the region will  soon institute a finance and tax system reform plan. The plan  is based on Tibet's reality and follows the principle of  carrying out the reform actively, prudently, slowly, orderly,  appropriately, flexibly, and in an all-around way. The plan  conforms with the basic national guidelines while taking into  consideration Tibet's particular situation.    The finance and tax system reform consists mainly of a new  tax system, a finance management system under the separated  taxation system, and an enterprise profits distribution system.    While not deviating from the basic framework of the national  tax reform, the region's tax system reform has made appropriate  adaptations in light of Tibet's particular conditions.  Specifically, the region will be somewhat different from the  rest of the country in the range of incomes subject to different  categories of taxation and in tax deferment, retention and  abrogation of tax categories, the amount of expense deduction,  applicable tax rates, and tax reduction and exemption. The  number of tax categories is cut by half from 18 to nine,  reflecting the characteristics of minority regions [ti xian le  min zu qu yu de te dian]. Although the plan envisions an  increase in taxation targets, it will retain the original  preferential policies enjoyed by the region, thereby helping  keep the total amount of taxes to be collected from increasing.  As a result, the plan enables the masses of peasants and  herdsmen to maintain their vested interests without adding even  one cent of their tax burden.    Regarding the finance management system under the separated  taxation system, the region has formulated policies related to  management at different levels. The principal guidelines are:  The autonomous region and its prefectures and cities will each  have well-defined revenues and expenditures based on their  jurisdiction over administrative and financial matters; revenues  from newly established tax categories will be divided among the  autonomous region, prefectures or cities, and counties at a  specific ratio; and the financial resources will be  redistributed rationally between different areas. The  formulated policies also contain provisions concerning the  linkage between the past "contracted financial responsibility"  system and the finance management system under the separated  taxation system.    Regarding the enterprise profits distribution system, the  region will implement in an all-around way a reform package to  separate taxes from profits among state-owned enterprises this  year. Under the new system, revenues will be taxed at a  proportional rate of 30 percent and the regulatory tax and  energy and communications surcharges will be eliminated. With  the exception of a few enterprises which generated huge profits,  the overwhelming majority of the region's enterprises will be  able to retain all their profits in the short run for use by  themselves in accordance with the relevant regulations of the  finance departments. Financial responsibility contracts signed  with enterprises will remain valid until they mature.</p>

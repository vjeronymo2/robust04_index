			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "Green November 32 (Burma)," a Chiang Mai </F> University-based non-governmental organization: "In the name of  'constructive engagement'?"]    [Text] A number of senior cabinet ministers including  Foreign Minister Sqdn. Ldr. [Squadron Leader] Prasong Sunsiri,  Democrat Party General Secretary Maj. Gen. Sanan Kachonprasat  and PM's [Prime Minister's] Office Minister Sawit Phothiwihok  will be going to Rangoon in the coming weeks to discuss joint  energy development and water diversion plans with the ruling  military junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council  (Slorc).    It is anticipated that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  will be signed on Thailand's buying natural gas from the Manaban  Gasfield that is currently being developed by the multinational  oil companies Total CFP (France) and Unocal Corp (USA).    These projects are evidently a major component of the Asean  "constructive engagement" policy towards the Slorc.    A few points and some questions need to be pointed out and  asked about the planned gas pipeline, the ceasefires that are  currently being discussed between Slorc and the ethnic groups,  security issues, the repatriation/relocation of refugees, and  the living and labour conditions of villagers in the Ye-Tavoy  area through which the gas pipeline will run.    These are issues that are very much interrelated, a fact  that  some parties may not like others to realize.    In the past two months most of the 8,000 semi-recognized Mon  refugees who have been taking shelter in Thailand for the last  3-4 years have been compelled by Thai authorities to move to a  place called Halaukhani. This site is no more than 12  kilometres from a major Slorc army base and is in even closer  proximity to the military junta's frontline heavy weapons  positions.    The Mon, Karen and many others insist that the area that the  refugees have been sent to is clearly inside Burma, a claim  validated by all but a few recent Thai maps. Some UNHCR  officials have said that the site is in a "no-mans-land" on a  "very fluid" border, while other officials accept the Thai claim  that it is Thai territory. (Incidentally the UNHCR officials  say that the ideal secure distance for a refugee settlement is  around 50 kilometres from the borders.)    The Thai authorities have according to local sources been  inconsistent in their claims that the site is in Thai territory  although they are currently insistent that it is. Whatever it  is, it is vulnerable to attack, and there are many reports in  the papers expressing the reluctance of the Mon refugees and  leaders about going there. The Mon have used virtually every  form of media available to them other than coming out openly --  there have allegedly been personal death threats amongst other  threats -- to make plain their concern about the lack of  security in Halaukhani.    In the context of what they are convinced is a forced  repatriation, the Mon have also made their belief very "clear  that they are being pressured to agree to a ceasefire so that  the (natural gas) pipeline can be built" through the Mon lands.    The coerced repatriation into an area where the refugees  could be said to be as vulnerable as hostages is clearly one of  the forms of pressure that are being brought to bear on the Mon  leaders by Thai authorities as they begin the ceasefire  negotiations with the notoriously treacherous Slorc regime.    The second round of talks between the New Mon State Party  (NMSP) and the Slorc began in mid March, just after news reports  stated that two Slorc battalions had been deployed in apparent  preparation for an attack on the Mon Headquarters at Baho.    The talks have now been called off -- and the Mon leadership  have more than a little justification for being concerned about  the well- being of their kindred -- particularly the almost  defenseless refugees at Halaukhani.    A source of further worry connected to the gas pipelines is  its relationship to the Ye-Tavoy railway on which between 10,000  and 30,000 villagers from the vicinity of the proposed pipeline  are being forced to labour under appalling conditions.  Testimonies given to journalists and aid workers by people who  had escaped the work gangs are consistent with those given in  literally hundreds of human rights interviews conducted along  the border since the Slorc took power, attest to the pervasive  reality of conditions tantamount to worse than slave labour.    The villagers who are forced to work from early morning to  night are obliged even to provide for all of their own needs  including food, medicine, and shelter, and they must also  provide their own tools for doing the work of the Slorc. Slorc  officials as a matter of course vehemently deny that any human  rights violations take place under their governance, they also  claim that all labourers are paid. However, the escapees from  the railroad construction sites, including several Slorc army  defectors, were unanimous that the labourers never got paid.  This is also consistent with stories from numerous other sites.  The stories of the escapees are of beatings, rapes, deaths from  accidents and untreated diseases (such as a dysentry outbreak at  the Natkyizin section of the track that different witnesses  claim resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people in January)  and long hours of gruelling work.    The Slorc has denied that the railway has a military  purpose,  claiming it is for national development and to help the local  people. Despite the Rangoon military junta's claims, it's  infrastructure development programmes in the area seem designed  to increase the speed with which the unusually large numbers of  troops who have been brought into the area in the past few years  can be deployed. Even the logging concessions granted by the  Slorc have served -- by design -- to open up access routes into  the most remote parts of the border to the benefit of the Slorc  troops.    The railway route, which crosses the planned pipeline route  a  near a place called Kanbaut and which runs parallel to the  Ye-Tavoy highway some 7-10 km to the east would form a double  barrier to Mon and Karen army units moving from the mountains to  the sea. Units caught between the two routes by rapid  deployment forces could be easily surrounded and annihilated.  Furthermore, long range heavy weapons that could be brought  down by rail or the currently-under- repair railway to the  disputed territory through which the pipeline is to run would  allow the Slorc to shell even the most remote strongholds of the  Karen and Mon forces (in which areas it should be noted there  are numerous internally displaced people who have not wanted to  seek refuge in Thailand.) The development programmes of the  military dictatorship in other areas of the country where there  are ethnic minorities, have served to help the Slorc consolidate  its occupation -- the multi-billion dollar gasfield and pipeline  programme could be seen as a strong incentive to the Slorc to  make very certain that it controls the area securely.    Neither Thailand nor the Western multinational corporations  who are investing in the project have any guarantee that the  Slorc will not use the extremely brutal methods it has become  infamous for, to secure the ground for their profit-making  development programme.    Part of the process of securing the pipeline route appears  to  be clearing all inhabitants from anywhere near the sections of  the route that are most vulnerable to attack. The villagers who  formerly lived in the hills to the east of the Ye-Tavoy road,  particularly those in the Zinba stream watershed directly  between Kaleinaung and Nat ei taung (Ban I Tong) have all been  forcibly relocated into resettlement villages beside the highway  where they can be more easily controlled by the Slorc troops.    From these places they can also be easily taken to do forced  labour duty such as ammunition portering, serving the Burmese  troops in their encampments and labouring on the railway or the  road. The lands which they have been driven off have been  declared "black areas" -- free fire zones for the Slorc troops.  This is partially borne out by the Burmese official who said  "there are no people left" from the Zinba River to Kaleinaung,  leaving one to question what has happened to them.    One place other than the resettlement villages (called  "strategic hamlets" or "cluster villages" in military parlance)  where the villagers have gone to is Thailand. As refugees, they  remain in camps such as Da Now See, Pa Yaw and Aung Tha Pyei.  Many hundreds of people have fled to the relative safety of  Thailand from the railway, and many more are expected to do so  as people try to avoid doing murderous second or third work  stints.    There are reported to be a great many more people who have  left their homes to avoid the slave labour who have remained in  the "liberated areas" controlled by the NMSP and the Karen  National Union (KNU), and where they will probably stay until  food shortages or a possible Slorc attack drives them over the  border.    Reliable local sources say that an average of 20 new asylum  seekers per day are coming through just two of the many possible  routes into Thailand. It is hard to tell how many have already  crossed the border as most of the people who do so will be  trying to go deeper into Thailand to join the hundreds of  thousands of illegal workers who appear to be better off than  those on the border who fear being forcibly repatriated.  Obviously there are no guarantees that the people in the camps  will not be forced back over the border, especially after the  examples of Halaukhani and the recent pushback of people at  Pailin on the Cambodian border.    For those newly arriving at the border and seeking to stay  in  the camps there would be a great sense of insecurity as they  cannot be sure of being allowed to register as refugees or stay  in the refugee camps. Previously the number of refugees allowed  to stay in the camps was fixed by the Thais.    Thailand's policy on refugees, if there is one, seems to be  to keep them from ever feeling secure on Thai soil so that they  would rather go back home at the first opportunity -- even if it  is still not safe to do so.    Thai leaders owe it to their own people not to make deals  that will have serious negative repercussions for their nation.  In the past, personal interests of leaders have often been put  before the national interest, and certainly before the interests  of the indigenous peoples and the environment, with a result  that lives, cultures, national economies and the environment  could be severely destroyed.</p>

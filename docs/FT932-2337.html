			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Cash settlement plan for BT share issue abandoned THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday abandoned a proposal which would have made it easier to identify large sellers of BT shares in the days leading up to the government's sale of its remaining 20 per cent stake in the company. The exchange, however, did take the unprecedented step of requiring market makers to tell it of any transaction of 100,000 shares or more, a move aimed at uncovering efforts to drive down unfairly the price of BT shares. This will go some way towards meeting the concerns of SG Warburg, the merchant bank which is co-ordinating the BT sale, although the stock exchange said it would not disclose the names of sellers. Institutional investors had raised strenuous objections to the stock exchange's original plan to encourage all pre-offer dealings in BT shares to be settled in cash within 48 hours rather than over the normal two-week settlement period. Institutions said the proposal would have unfairly aided advisers to the offer in their efforts to support the price of BT shares. 'The stock exchange should be taking into account the interests of its users as well as its members,' said Mr John Thompson, head of UK equities at Standard Life. 'Apparently the only reason they took account of users is because they were publicly exposed. This is not the way for the stock exchange to behave.' The National Association of Pension Funds, Britain's largest shareholder group, said it would press the stock exchange to take greater account of users' interests in making rules for the markets. As well as large institutions, private investors considering applying for BT shares would have benefited from the type of concerted selling the exchange is seeking to uncover - because it would have depressed the price at which the government's stake in BT is offered to the public. The exchange did not explicitly say it was trying to uncover sellers who depress share prices, only that it was interested in 'satisfying itself that an orderly market is maintained at all times'. However, an exchange spokeswoman said that, in a similarly structured offering last summer of shares in Wellcome, the UK drugs group, advisers to the deal complained that institutions had depressed the price by selling through several brokers at one time. It is typical for institutional shareholders to reduce their stakes in companies which are about to offer additional shares for sale - a move which usually leads to lower prices. But Warburg had said it intended to reward those institutions who purchased additional shares in the run-up to the BT offering by granting them higher allocations. Those that sold would have lower allocations. Warburg said: 'It is not right for us to comment either way on what the stock exchange has done.' However, one official at the bank expressed disappointment that the exchange had failed to support its efforts to encourage cash settlement.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Siege of Iraq and Boycott of Enemy"] </F>   [Text] It is an economic disaster even to think of lifting  or easing the Arab boycott of the Zionist enemy, and it is an  economic and political disaster to include this topic in the  Arab foreign ministers meetings less than 40 days since the  martyrdom of scores of Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque.    It will be an economic, political, and moral disaster if  these ministers meet to discuss lifting the Arab boycott without  daring to discuss the racialist Arab, Islamic, and Western  boycott of sisterly Iraq and the war of annihilation launched  against its people, their bread, medicines, and security.    How did things get so bad? How did the U.S. and Western  disdain for the nation reach the point of asking it to lift the  boycott on the enemy and tighten it on a sisterly country? How  do the Arab League states meet in Cairo without remembering the  tragedy of the Iraqis who, thanks to this league and under its  pan-Arab flag, the first instigative resolution against them was  adopted without hearing the voice of the honorable Arabs which  warned that this resolution was against the whole nation and  targeted the nation's dignity, wealth, present, and future.    We were pleased with the reference to the continued Western  pressures on Libya, but we wonder why no reference was made to  the Western war of annihilation launched against the Iraqi  people?    We were pleased with the reference to the Libyan flexibility  in dealing with the Western pressures, but we wonder why no  reference was made to all obligations fulfilled by sisterly Iraq  and the flexibility it showed, which did not convince the  brother rather than the enemy, and did not convince the friend  rather than the foe?    What we hope to see is something concrete to show respect  for  the blood of Ramadan's martyrs in the Ibrahimi Mosque, and a  conviction by all that the Iraqis, Palestinians, Libyans,  Sudanese, Somalis, and all other Arabs are Arabs who should be  treated with the same standards -- that is if we have the free  will to do this and can make an independent decision.    What we hope is that some people would be ashamed before  God,  homeland, nation, and history when we hear talk about lifting  the boycott on the enemy and do not hear whispers about lifting  the boycott on the brother, although hundreds of Iraqis are  martyred by famine, disease, and horror, while this enemy is not  affected by our boycott because all Westerners support it, based  on all their hatred of us and racism in dealing with us.    What is the use of thinking about whether or not to amend  the  Arab League Charter if this is not preceded by a change in what  is in the hearts of some of us, especially concerning the Arab  peoples suffering from tragedies and disasters due to the  pan-Arab and religious positions of some of us?</p>

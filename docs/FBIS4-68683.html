			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoya Makmatova, chief engineer of the </F> information department of the West Siberian Administration for  Territorial Monitoring of the Environment: "Ecological  Monitoring; On the Ice--Oil, in the Water--Arsenic, in the  Air--Ammonia. Although It Could Have Been Worse"]    [Text] According to data of the West Siberian territorial  center for hydrometeorology and monitoring environmental  pollution, several emergency situations were observed at the end  of March and in April.    On the night of 29 March in Leninsk-Kuznetskiy, while  discharges from the worsted cloth combine were being pumped,  electric power was cut off in the second microrayon, as a result  of which the sewerage pumping station went out of operation. The  disposal of household fecal wastes into the Meret River (a  tributary of the Ina) amounted to 1,800 cubic meters a day. It  was not until the evening of 4 April that the sewerage pumping  station was brought back into operation.    On 30 March 12 tonnes of crude oil were poured onto the ice  of the Ob River, five miles below Kolpashevo (the pollution area  totaled 3,800 square meters). Part of the oil was pumped out,  and the rest was burned on the ice. The Tomskiy Geophysical  Trust was guilty of the pollution.    On 22 March an observer of the hydrometeorological post of  Shelabolikha (Ob River) noticed a yellow foam across the whole  river. Water analysis tests conducted in the rayon of  Kamen-na-Ob showed increased content of petroleum products (39  PDK [maximum permissible concentration], arsenic (14 PDK), and  synthetic surface substances (10-12 PDK)). The Altay Kray  Ecology Committee believes that the arsenic got into the water  along with pesticides that were washed off from the fields.    In April three incidents of high pollution (above 5 PDK) of  the atmosphere by nitrogen dioxide was observed in Novosibirsk.  One of the incidents (8.5 PDK) occurred as a result of waste  from the refinery plant Atoll.    Four incidents of atmospheric pollution by nitrogen dioxide  and one incident of methanol were registered in April in Tomsk.  The source of the pollution were the petroleum combine and  TETs-3 [thermal electric power plant].    The plant rayon industrial center and the coke and chemical  plant were the source of pollution of the atmosphere in Kemerovo  with ammonia (5.5 PDK) and carbon disulfide (24 PDK).</p>

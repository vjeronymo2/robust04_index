			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] In Mexico City the PAN [National Action Party]  candidate said that other presidential candidates should not use  the Chiapas situation to their benefit. During the weekly PAN  news conference, presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de  Cevallos spoke about events in Chiapas and called on other  presidential candidates:    [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] In view of the  latest  violent events in Chiapas, I believe there should be, not only  from me but from all presidential candidates, respect and basic  prudence not to take advantage of this painful moment to try and  gain an advantage. [end recording]    The other topic discussed during the PAN news conference had  to do with the presidential candidates' debates. Fernandez de  Cevallos rejected the proposal that the nine candidates debate  in two sessions.    [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I said that I do not  reject that all candidates appear. What I protest is the  intention to reduce the discussion of the country's major  conflicts and topics to only two appearances. It is not  possible, even with the country's modern communications system  and especially with the high expectations generated, that these  debates be reduced to two appearances for all presidential  candidates. It is not fair, it is not correct, and it is not  democratic. [end recording]</p>

American guns of course - Ellen, Cheers, Roseanne, proceeding from 9pm nose-to-tail like number 12 buses. Not to be outdone, BBC 2 fields The Larry Sanders Show, at 11.45pm as befits an often very rude if funny sitcom. Tonight's Machiavellian morality play concerns the real Hugh Hefner and the ethics of posing for Playboy. What of our own contribution to the genre? At his best Harry Enfield is brilliantly observant, as witness tonight's Harry Enfield and Chums (9.30pm, BBC1). If English comedy depends on quirkiness and eccentricity, English satire relies on smirking sledge-hammer subtlety. Have I Got News for You (10pm, BBC2) has descended from its civilised radio origins into smug schoolboy snook-cocking.

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / New fear of travel collapses sparked MASON International Travel, a Scottish holiday company, has ceased trading amid fears that more travel operators are facing collapse in the wake of sterling's devaluation. The Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday that five international travel operators had ceased trading in the last month. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, claimed that last week's devaluation had 'plunged holiday companies into financial crisis'. He said travel operators would find that the money they had taken from clients would no longer cover their bills abroad, because devaluation had increased costs by 10 per cent. Mason International Travel, based in Glasgow, specialised in package holidays to Canada and the US. All its holidays were covered by bonds with the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) and the CAA. The 300 customers estimated to be abroad will be able to continue their holidays, while those with advance bookings will receive a full refund. Mason International Travel traded under several names including Canada Air Holidays, Canada By Design, America By Design, Florida By Design and Albany Tours. It is believed that the company is seeking a buyer as a going concern. A recorded message at its Glasgow offices yesterday reported that it was temporarily closed but was 'hoping for good news by Tuesday'. Mr Griffiths claimed that about 1m package holidays a year were taken with non-Abta companies with none of the protection of Abta bonding. EC law would require all travel companies to be bonded from January 1 next year, Mr Griffiths said, but UK law offered no protection to holidaymakers booking between now and December 31. The government had already missed its deadline for issuing guidance on implementation of the regulations, Mr Griffiths said. The Department of Trade and Industry had previously told the travel trade that the bonding regulations would be published on August 1. Mr Griffiths accused the government of dithering and failing to take action. 'This gross negligence cost 40,000 holidaymakers their money and their holidays when Land Travel collapsed without bonding in July,' he said. He called on the government to publish the guidance regulations today and to take action this week to enforce bonding on all travel companies to bridge the gap between now and the end of the year.</p>

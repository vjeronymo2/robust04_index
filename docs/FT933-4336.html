			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: SingalongaMarx - but to a different tune Sir, Joe Rogaly, in his article, 'Marx the musical' (September 7), doubted whether any of his readers would be able to whistle the tune to the chorus beginning 'Strong as the steel which we shape with precision'. I cannot whistle but I suggest singing it (in the bath in my case) to the tune Epiphany Hymn, used for 'Brightest and best of the sons of the morning'. I think it sounds very good. My wife would disagree. Andrew G Gibbs, 23 Shooters Hill Road, Blackheath, London SE3 7AS</p>

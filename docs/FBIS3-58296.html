			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Portuguese Government believes the Lajes base  [Azores] will see its importance strengthened in the current  world situation. [Prime Minister] Cavaco Silva told RTP in  Brussels that Portugal advocates a new accord [with the United  States] oriented more toward cooperation and less toward  defense. It is possible that the quid pro quos for the use of  the base might materialize in the shape of development programs  for the archipelago. Antonio Esteves Martins reports:    [Martins] A strengthening of transatlantic ties, reaffirmed  at this [NATO] summit, is in line with the Portuguese position.  Because of its geographical and strategical position, Portugal  warmly welcomes the U.S. stance.    [Begin recording] [Cavaco] We are very happy with President  Clinton's declaration. It is a strong stake in cooperation with  Europe, clearly stating that the security of the United States  is not separate from that of Europe. It is also a commitment to  keeping a strong U.S. presence in Europe.    [Martins] Strong but reduced. This means that the U.S.  position in the old continent will henceforth be less important.  In practice, will this strengthen the Azores' negotiating  position on the eve on the conclusion of the accord on the Lajes  base?    [Cavaco] Of course, the importance of the Azores for the  defense of the Western world has been made clearer. But I said  it is our contribution. The Azores are not a bargaining chip  for us to obtain something specific for Portugal. It represents  our clear involvement in a more secure Europe, and a more stable  Europe.    [Martins] In this light, the future accord which might be  concluded before Easter will be a cooperation and not a defense  accord?    [Cavaco] A cooperation which includes defense and security  aspects, but not exclusively. It will be more extensive.    [Martins] In addition, will any money emerging from this  accord be directly invested in the development of the region?    [Cavaco] There is military cooperation and there are other  forms of cooperation, such as scientific and in the education  sector. We have entered a new phase of the transatlantic  relationship, because do not forget that at the moment the  European security identity is also being implemented. Thank  you. [end recording]</p>

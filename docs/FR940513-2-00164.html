The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Company and the Trust are open-end management investment companies consisting of multiple series. Nylife Distributors serves as distributor for the Company and the Trust. New York Life Insurance Company (``New York Life''), MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, Monitor Capital Advisors, Inc., and Quorum Capital Management Limited serve as investment advisers to individual series of the Company and the Trust. New York Life serves as administrator to the Company, and Nylife Distributors serves as administrator to the Trust. Nylife Distributors, MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, Monitor Capital Advisors and Quorum Capital Management are wholly owned subsidiaries of New York Life. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants request that relief also extend to all series of the Company or the Trust that may be created in the future and to other registered open-end management investment companies for which Nylife Distributors, or any entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Nylife Distributors, may serve as investment adviser or distributor (collectively these investment companies, the Company, and the Trust are the ``Funds''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Multiple Class Distribution System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants propose to establish a multi-class distribution system to enable each of the Funds to create an unlimited number of classes of shares. Classes could be offered in connection with a 12b&hyph;1 plan (a ``12b&hyph;1 Plan''), a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 administrative services arrangement (``Administrative Services Arrangement''), neither a 12b&hyph;1 Plan nor an Administrative Services Arrangement, or a combination of these options. These classes also could be subject to different sales loads. Classes offered subject to differing types of sales loads would provide investors the option of purchasing shares that would either be subject to a conventional front-end sales load (the ``Front-End Option''), subject to a CDSC (the ``Deferred Option''), subject to a combination of a front-end load and a CDSC (the combination option), any of which could be coupled with a 12b&hyph;1 Plan or an Administrative Services Arrangement, or not subject to any sales charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Under Administrative Services Arrangements, Funds may enter into agreements (``Administrative Services Agreements'') with organizations to provide services to the clients of the organization, who beneficially own shares of a particular class. Alternatively, a Fund may enter into an Administrative Services Agreement with the Fund's administrator to provide services to class shareholders. With respect to each class of shares, the Fund would pay an organization or the administrator for its services in accordance with its particular Administrative Services Agreement (such payments are ``Administrative Services Payments'') and the expense of such payments would be borne entirely by the beneficial owners of the class of shares to which each such Administrative Services Agreement relates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

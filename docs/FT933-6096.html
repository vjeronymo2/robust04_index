			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Don't fall foul of computer data - Many companies using personal details of individuals are breaking the law by failing to register their activities with the Data Protection Registrar It may be the last message that the thousands of small UK businesses struggling to survive want to hear. But there is an excellent chance they are committing a criminal offence each time they switch on their computer terminals. The reason is they are ignoring, or are not even aware of, their obligations under the Data Protection Act 1984. The legislation was the first in the UK to address the use or potential misuse of computers. Nine years on, enormous confusion and uncertainty surrounds its workings. Under the act, which does not cover information held and processed manually, organisations using data about people are required to register details of their activities and to adhere to a code of good practice. The same applies to computer agencies which might handle the data for them. Any organisation which fails to register - it costs Pounds 75 for three years - or does so and then breaks the code can face fines of up to Pounds 5,000 in a magistrates court. Unlimited fines apply in higher courts. More than 100 companies and individuals have so far been prosecuted. Under the legislation, private individuals have the right of access to information held about them and can demand compensation for any damage or distress arising from the storage of inaccurate data or from unauthorised disclosure of the information. The potential for financial penalties arising from non-compliance, is therefore immense. The enforcement of data protection is made more difficult because who is and who is not covered by the legislation often remains unclear. Even Eric Howe, the Data Protection Registrar, acknowledges he has found no satisfactory or reliable way of establishing exactly the number of data users who should be on his books. Howe, who is an independent officer reporting directly to parliament, says he recognises the complexities involved in interpreting the act and in analysing the diversity of situations in which it can apply. He has only 100 staff and limited finances to enforce the legislation throughout the UK. Small wonder then that the most unsuspecting candidates have fallen foul of the law. In one recent case, a local newsagent's shop found itself on the receiving end of an official visit, following a formal complaint from a local customer that a computer screen on full display was broadcasting the names and addresses of some of its customers, many of whom were elderly and vulnerable. The business was told to register under the act; the computer was immediately moved out of sight. In another example, a ticket agency was fined Pounds 250 with costs after a customer who had purchased cinema tickets then received unsolicited mail from a third party. The agency had sold on customers' personal information. A recent report from the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, said that as many as 100,000 data users who should be registered under the act have not done so. The NAO believes that the total may be considerably higher. A further problem is that organisations are failing to re-register after the initial three years. The registrar has consequently concentrated resources on this area. In doing so, however, and because of limited resources, other areas have failed to be adequately monitored, resulting in the growing number of qualifying companies which have yet to make a first registration. Howe believes that one-third of all small companies are unaware of their statutory obligation to register and more than two-thirds of all small businesses are believed to have no idea about the obligations which are imposed upon them as a result of the legislation. There is clear need for government departments and other public bodies to maintain the confiden-tiality of personal information on their files. The same arguably goes for the police, local authorities, educational centres and professional organisations. Less obvious perhaps is the requirement for smaller businesses - from travel agents, employment bureaux and ticket agencies - to register. According to the registrar's office, the general guideline is that 'anyone holding information about living individuals on computer is a data user and therefore needs to register. 'The information in question need not be particularly sensitive and it can be as little as a name and address'. Howe says: 'The act as it stands makes no particular allowance for small businesses. It requires every organisation to register and comply in exactly the same way, regardless of size or type of business.' In an attempt to improve on the general lack of awareness of registration requirements among small companies, a new information pack and free video designed to explain the act has just been produced. There are exemptions for some types of data handlers but they are very narrow and subject to strict conditions. Registration may not be necessary if, for example, the information is used only for calculating wages and pensions or for keeping accounts. Sports or recreational clubs which do not have limited company status are also exempt. The best advice for small organisations unsure as to whether they qualify or not is to register anyway. Once businesses are on the registrar's books, the code of good practice demands that they adhere to a list of guiding principles. The guidance includes obtaining and processing information 'fairly and lawfully', keeping it safe and up-to-date and not holding it any longer than is necessary. An information pack tailored for the small business is available from the registrar's office at Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF. Individual advice can also be obtained from Richard Ansell, the small business officer at the same address.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Statistical Communique on 1993 Educational Development] </F>   [Text] In 1993, the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council promulgated the "Outline Program for the Reform and  Development of Education in China," a blueprint for building a  socialist education system with Chinese characteristics. Then,  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress  approved the "Teachers' Law of the People's Republic China,"  which put the construction of China's teacher contingent under  the legal system. Later, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Committee adopted the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning  the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure,"  which further outlined the direction of our educational reform  and development. The promulgation and implementation of the  above principle, policy, and law have instilled new vitality  into our education work and effectively propelled the  development of education projects in all fields and at all  levels. At the same time, some questions have also appeared and  deserve our attention.  <H5>  Basic Education </H5>   1. Steady progress in popularizing nine-year compulsory  education.    Since the "Compulsory Education Law of the People's  Republic of China" was promulgated in 1986, elementary education  has been popularized in most parts of the country. In big cities  and some economically developed areas, efforts are being made to  popularize junior high school education. To further promote the  nine-year compulsory education throughout the country, the State  Education Commission has instituted a "two basic" (basically  popularizing the nine-year compulsory education and basically  wiping out illiteracy among middle-aged and young people)  appraisal system. Up to now, 26 provinces, autonomous regions,  and municipalities have conducted such "two basic" appraisals  covering some 350 counties (cities and districts). Meanwhile,  continued efforts have been made to popularize compulsory  education at the elementary school level. In 1993, our country  had 697,000 elementary schools. Students admitted to the schools  that year numbered 23,534,800, up by 1,702,800 from the  preceding year. The total enrollment was 124,212,400 million,  surpassing the preceding year by 2,199,600 million. Of the  school-age children around the country, 97.7 percent were  attending schools (covering different school ages and school  systems in various localities). This was 0.5 percentage points  higher than the preceding year. The percentage of elementary  school graduates attending junior high schools reached 81.8  percent, up 2.1 percentage points compared with the preceding  year. Compulsory education at the junior high school level also  showed a certain degree of development. In 1993, there were  68,415 regular junior high schools across the country. The  number of new students enrolled that year was 14,789,400  million, surpassing the preceding year by 139,300. The junior  high schools had a total enrollment of 40,822,000 million, up by  162,900 compared with the preceding year. In addition, there  were 1,582 vocational junior high schools. New students enrolled  in 1993 numbered 266,500, and the total enrollment was 562,400,  roughly the same as a year ago. The gross rate of children  attending junior high schools was 73 percent, or 1.2 percentage  points higher than the preceding year. The percentage of junior  high school graduates going to senior high schools was 44.1  percent, an increase of 9.7 percentage points above the  preceding year's record.    2. Regular senior high school education continued to decline  in scale.    In 1993, our country had 14,380 regular senior high  schools, less than the preceding year's number by 470. New  students admitted to these schools totaled 2,283,400 million,  down by 63,900 compared with the preceding year. The total  enrollment was 6,569,100 million, showing a drop of 479,800 from  the preceding year.    3. Relatively big progress in developing special and  preschool education.    In 1993, our country had 1,123 special education schools,  96 more than the preceding year. New students admitted to the  special education schools in 1993 reached 33,500, surpassing the  preceding year by 4,000. The students studying in these schools  totaled 168,600, up by 39,100 over the preceding year. There  were 165,200 kindergarten across the country with a total  enrollment of 25,525,400 million. The enrollment was 1,243,300  million more than the preceding year's record.    4. Increased number and better quality of teachers of high  and elementary schools.    In 1993, there were 3.1668 teachers in the regular high  schools (including junior and senior high schools) throughout  the country, 20,700 more than the preceding year. Elementary  school teachers totaled 5,551,800 million, or 25,300 more than  the preceding year. Among high and elementary school teachers,  the percentage of those with qualified educational backgrounds  was on the rise. Among senior high school teachers, the  percentage was 51.1 percent, or two percentage points higher  than the preceding year. In the case of junior high school  teachers, it was 59.5 percent, or 3.9 percentage points higher  than the preceding year. As for elementary school teachers, it  was 84.7 percent, or two percentage points higher than the  preceding year. With regard to the percentage of teachers with  professional teaching backgrounds, it was as high as 90 percent  for senior high school teachers, surpassing the preceding year  by four percentage points. The percentage was 81 percent for  junior high school teachers, three percentage points higher than  the preceding year, and 83 percent for elementary school  teachers, two percentage points higher than the preceding year.  The percentages of high-grade and first-rate teachers in senior  and junior high schools and elementary schools were 42.18,  18.71, and 11.88 percent respectively. Compared with the  preceding year, these were up, respectively, by 3, 1.6, and 1.5  percentage points.    5. Arduous task in popularizing junior high education.    On the whole, since the Decision on the Reform of the  Educational System was promulgated in 1985, our country's basic  education has developed well, and relatively big progress has  been made in popularizing the nine-year compulsory education.  Now, the percentage of elementary school-age children attending  schools has increased each year, and elementary education has  been basically popularized in most localities. However,  development of junior high school education is still at a slow  pace. For many years, the number of students at junior high  schools has remained at the same level--around 40 million. To  meet the target of 55 million junior high school students by the  end of this century, we must gear up our efforts. In 1993, the  gross rate of students attending junior high schools was only 73  percent, well below the target rate. Moreover, the dropout rate  in junior high schools continued to rise in the last two  years--5.8 percent in 1992 and 7.1 percent in 1993. Among junior  high school teachers, only 59.5 percent had qualified  educational backgrounds, while high-grade and first-rate  teachers accounted for only 18.7 percent, less than one-half of  the percentage in senior high schools. Because of this,  strengthening junior high education and striving to increase the  rate of students attending junior high schools should be  considered a key to achieving the "two basic" objectives in  developing education.    6. Inadequate funds and other conditions for developing  elementary and high schools.    The last few years have witnessed an acute shortage of  funds for developing education. The part of public funds used in  running schools has declined each year. Particular noteworthy is  that, in many provinces and autonomous regions, elementary and  high schools are unable to pay their teachers on time. With  regard to the renovation and construction of school buildings,  elementary and high schools have by and large met the target of  "one no and two have" (no school has a dilapidated building;  every grade has a classroom, and every student has a desk and a  chair) in recent years, thanks to the efforts made to raise  funds from various sources to meet the schools' needs. In 1993,  the percentage of dilapidated buildings in elementary and high  schools nationwide showed a slight decline to 1.96 percent from  the preceding year's 1.97 percent. However, the percentage in  rural areas began to pick up--it was 2.19 percent in 1992 but  rose to 2.27 percent in 1993.  <H5>  Vocational and Technical Education </H5>   1. Considerable progress of secondary vocational and  technical education.    Under the impact of the State Council's "Resolution on  Vigorous Development of Vocational and Technical Education,"  education in this field has shown considerable development. In  1993, there were 16,842 vocational and technical schools of  various kinds equivalent to the level of senior high schools.  This number was 280 more than the preceding year. A total of  3.1612 million students were admitted to these schools in 1993,  surpassing the preceding year's record by 725,600. The total  enrollment reached 7.623 million, showing an increase of 795,000  over the preceding year. The proportion of such students to the  total number of students at the senior high school level reached  53 percent as against 49 percent in 1992, meeting ahead of  schedule the target set in the above-mentioned resolution.    2. Rapid development of ordinary specialized secondary  schools    In 1993, the number of ordinary specialized secondary  schools reached 3,964, an increase of 61 compared with the  preceding year. The number of students admitted to these schools  that year was 1.1489 million, an increase of 269,700, or 30.7  percent, over the preceding year. The schools had a total of  2,820,300 students. This was 411,900 more than the preceding  year's figure.    Changes are noted in the specialties chosen by new  students. Numbers of students of finance and economics, physical  education, and arts were on the rise, while there was a downward  trend of students choosing engineering as their major. Among the  new students, those majoring in finance and economics increased  sharply. Of the above-mentioned 269,700 additional new students,  95,000 were finance and economics majors, accounting for 35  percent.    3. Considerable progress in developing vocational secondary  schools    In 1993, our country had 8,430 vocational senior high  schools, 136 more than the preceding year. New students admitted  to these schools numbered 1,348,800, an increase of 208,800 over  the preceding year, while the total enrollment was 3,063,500  million, up by 199,700.    4. Skilled worker training school took in more students    In 1993, the number of schools for training skilled  workers reached 4,477, an increase of 85 from the preceding  year. New students admitted to these schools numbered 663,500,  up by 61,700 compared with the preceding year. The total number  of students was 1.739 million, surpassing the preceding year by  183,000.  <H5>  Regular Higher Education </H5>   1. A sharp increase in students attending regular  institutions of higher education.    Students admitted to regular institutions of higher  education continued to increase in the past two years, the  magnitude of increase each year being more than 20 percent. In  1993, the number of regular institutions of higher education  reached 1,065, up by 12 over the preceding year. Students  admitted to regular and special colleges numbered 924,000,  surpassing the preceding year by 170,000 or an increase of 22.5  percent. The total number of students was 2.5355 million, up by  351,100, or 16.1 percent over the preceding year. Students  admitted to graduate schools totaled 42,100, surpassing the  preceding year by 8,700 or 26 percent. Of the new students,  6,200 were studying for doctorate, and 35,700 for the master's  degree. Graduate school students totaled 106,800, showing an  increase of 12,600, or 13.4 percent, compared with the preceding  year. They included 17,600 students studying for doctorate and  88,800 for the master's degree.    2. A further increase in students under the entrusted  training program and students paying their own tuition.    While the state mandatory plan remained stable with  respect to enrollment of students, there was a rapid increase in  the students enrolled under the state regulatory plan. Of the  new students admitted to institutions of higher education,  561,000, or 60.7 percent, came under the state mandatory plan.  This was 12.26 percentage points less than the preceding year.  Those under the entrusted training program and those paying  their own tuition totaled 360,200. They accounted for 39 percent  of the new students, up 12.31 percentage points over the  preceding year. Of the total number of students, 1,926,500, or  75.98 percent, were under the state mandatory plan, down by 9.09  percentage points compared with the preceding year, and 603,700,  or 23.81 percent, were students under the entrusted training  program or were tuition-paying students, up by 9.64 percentage  points.    3. Changes in proportions of students at different levels  and  of different majors.    With the increase in the students admitted to institutions  of higher education, there was a change in the proportions of  graduate students, undergraduates, and students studying in  regular and special colleges. Newly enrolled graduate students  and undergraduates were in the ratio of 1:25.9 as against 1:25.4  in the preceding year. Of the newly enrolled undergraduates, the  ratio of students studying in regular colleges to those in  special colleges increased to 1:1.16 from the preceding year's  1:1.39.    The change in the majors of newly enrolled students was  that there were more students majoring in liberal arts, finance  and economics, politics and law, physical education, and various  fields of arts. The percentage of new students majoring in  finance and economics increased by 3.16 percentage points over  the preceding year. A downward trend is noted in the percentage  of students majoring in science and engineering.    4. Inadequate facilities for operation of institutes of  higher education.    With the rapid development of higher education, some  noteworthy problems have cropped up: The imbalance between  investment and development became further intensified. The  problem of inadequate facilities for conducting higher education  was even more pronounced than before. A further decline is noted  in both the students' living conditions and the schools'  teaching facilities. An increased number of schools had  inadequate facilities to meet the requirements for conducting  higher education. In regular institutions of higher education,  the average campus building space per student dropped to 42.4  square meters from the preceding year's 46.7 square meters. Some  schools had insufficient dormitory space for their students. The  average dormitory space per student in regular institutions of  higher education declined to 6.2 square meters from 7.2 square  meters in the preceding year. Another problem was that some  schools were seriously short of laboratory equipment for  education and research.  <H5>  Adult Education </H5>   1. Rapid development of certificate-awarding higher  education  for adults.    After several years' curtailment of its scale,  certificate-awarding higher education for adults began to show  fast development in 1992. In 1993, there were 1,183 institutions  of higher education for adults, a drop of 15 from the number in  the preceding year. In addition, 796 regular institutions of  higher education had correspondence courses and night schools  for adults. New students enrolled in adult institutions and  schools (including radio and TV universities, correspondence  schools, and night universities) totaled 862,700, an increase of  271,000, or 45.8 percent, over the preceding year. Total number  of adult students was 1,862,900 (including 131,000 students of  radio and TV universities and correspondence courses), an  increase of 384,200. Of all institutions of higher education for  adults, management cadre colleges and radio and TV universities  showed the fastest increase in enrollment. The new students  admitted to these two categories of schools increased from  30,000 and 145,800 in 1992 to 59,600 and 213,300 in 1993, up  98.7 and 46.3 percent respectively.    2. Changes in specialties of certificate-awarding higher  education for adults.    There was an increase in the percentage of adult students  admitted to schools of finance and economics, politics and law,  science, and medicine. New students majoring in finance and  economics showed the fastest increase. Their percentage was 6.73  percentage points higher than the preceding year. Students  admitted to normal colleges declined by 4.12 percentage points.    3. Less students taking non-certificate-awarding courses run  by institutions of higher education for adults.    There was a decline in the number of students taking  non-certificate-awarding courses (exclusive of seminars giving  professional certificates) run by institutions of higher  education for adults. In 1993, 1,567,200 million adults finished  such courses, down by 204,000, or 11.59 percent, from the  preceding year. Those taking on-the-job-training courses showed  a remarkable 23.3 percent decline from the preceding year.    4. Further development of elementary and secondary technical  education for adults.    In recent years, the number of elementary and secondary  technical schools for adults, mostly farmers, has been on the  rise. In 1993 the number of adult technical schools throughout  the country increased to 298,300, or 14,200 more than the  preceding year. As many as 57,068,000 million people attended  these schools and graduated, showing an increase of 7,482,900  million above the preceding year. Of these schools, 288,500 were  technical schools for farmers, 17,000 more than the number a  year ago. The number of graduates from these schools reached  52,814,600 million, or 8,213,600 more than the preceding year.  Farmers attending such technical schools accounted for 12.2  percent of the total rural labor force, up 1.8 percentage points  compared with the preceding year. Throughout the country, 30.7  percent of the townships and 81.1 percent of the villages had  technical schools for farmers. Meanwhile, there were 9,800  technical training schools for staff members and workers. This  number was 2,800 less than the preceding year. The number of  graduates totaled 4,253,400 million, down by 730,700 from the  preceding year.    Secondary specialized schools for adults, mainly staff  members and workers, showed a certain degree of development. The  number of such schools reached 4,783. This was seven more than  the number a year ago. New students admitted to the schools  numbered 856,700, or 143,600 more than the preceding year. The  total enrollment was 2,067,600 million, an increase of 323,300  over the preceding year.    5. Relatively quick development noted in conducting special  examinations at higher and secondary levels for self-study  students.    In 1993, nationwide examinations for self-study students  at higher education level were held for 142 specialties. This  was 11 more than the preceding year. A total of 4,838,100  million people took part in the examinations. Of them, 127,100  passed the examinations. In addition, 15,100 passed the  examinations equivalent to the level of secondary specialized  schools. In 1993, some professional-qualification examinations  were also held for those who had completed  non-certificate-awarding education courses.    6. Upwards of 5 million illiterates educated in three years.    In 1993, there were 106,400 literacy schools (classes)  across the country. This was 5,000 less than the preceding year.  A total of 5,481,700 million people attended the schools  (classes) and graduated, showing an increase of 248,600 over the  preceding year. The efforts over the past three years benefitted  more than 5 million illiterates, and each year the plan for  wiping out illiteracy was overfulfilled.

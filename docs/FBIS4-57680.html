			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salvadoran General Mauricio </F> Ernesto Vargas, former deputy chief of staff of the Armed Forces  and member of the Dialogue Commission, by unidentified reporter  on 19 May; from the "KL Radio News" newscast -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Reporter] Good morning General. We want your  opinion on the attack on the security guards of FMLN Deputy  Nidia Diaz.    [Vargas] These incidents, not only against Nidia Diaz, but  also the kidnappings -- all these problems are deplorable and  should be rejected and condemned. We cannot permit violence and  the principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth prevail  in our society. Since 16 January 1992, Salvadorans are  committed to taking a totally different path. The fact that  this is the second attack on this same person, specifically this  same security guard, is strange. I believe this should be  thoroughly investigated and that the weight of the law should  fall upon those who are responsible, so that the exemplary  punishment can dissuade others from acting the same way within  Salvadoran society.    [Reporter] Deputy Nidia Diaz mentioned the political  connotations that this attack could have. As member of the  Dialogue Commission, and within the framework of the Chapultepec  Agreements how do you view these actions against a party like  the FMLN which recently entered the country's political life?    [Vargas] As I said.... [pauses] although I did not say it  directly, I believe it is somewhat strange that the attack was  against the same person, the same security guard who was  attacked the first time. As you said, this incident warrants a  thorough investigation, as it could have other connotations.  Attacks that could occur at a given time which could be  directly or indirectly related to political groups should be  rejected; not only against the FMLN, but also against ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance) the Christian Democratic  Party, the Unity Movement, the National Conciliation Party, all  political parties.    It is not possible for persons who disagree with each other,  who have different ideas or ideologies, to react this way. This  is unacceptable as a political system. I may disagree with your  ideas, you may disagree with mine, but we should discuss our  differences without resorting to violence. This is one of the  basic principles we have established. We must exercise personal  and institutional coexistence, so the process can mature and  reach its maximum expression for the benefit of the entire  society.    [Reporter] Do you think an incident such as this can  undermine politics in El Salvador?    [Vargas] I would not say it could undermine politics or  create a crisis. It creates an unstable political balance.  This means that.... [pauses] we must remember that these are  factors that go through cycles at a given time. I believe sound  judgment, good sense, mutual respect, and above all prudence  should guide our steps. Provocations should not produce  visceral reactions because this will take us nowhere. It would  take us to a polarized confrontation similar or worse to the  ones we had in the past. Definitely, generations who went  through that experience do not want to see the same thing happen  again. In that sense, I want justice -- as the main factor to  discourage actions that violate society rules -- to prevail. I  believe a thorough police investigation is necessary. This case  should be given more attention because there could be factors  that are not political, which if not properly investigated can  have repercussions in the political field, which of course would  be totally undesirable.

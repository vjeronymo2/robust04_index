			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations an issue Sir, May I congratulate Britain on its stylish withdrawal from the ERM. For too long the British have been obsessed with interest rates to the detriment of the real problems of the economy. Monetary policy is to the economy what petrol is to a car: if there is no car, the fuel is no good. In Japan when there is a recession a company first seeks to improve its productivity; second to cut costs; third to encourage government spending; and only finally, interest rates. In the UK, industry responds in the exact opposite order. It concentrates on the symptoms of a weak economy - high interest rates - and ignores the source of its problems, inefficiency. The Japanese may have it wrong, though I am far from convinced that the British way is right. But those who wish to follow the German model should be warned that an independent central bank in the UK will not provide either a stable or strong currency unless it mirrors the realities of the economy. This is determined less by bankers than by the behaviour of governments, companies and consumers. It is they who are independent - or rather inter-dependent - and who pay the piper. Britain must now quickly find its own way to do things. Tetsuro Kikuchi, economics editor (Europe), The Mainichi Newspapers, Associated Press House, 12 Norwich Street, London EC4A 1BP</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke pushed to tackle juvenile crime MR CLARKE indicated last night that he will respond to strong pressure from Tory MPs and set out within the next two weeks details of plans for tackling crimes by young people - almost certainly including new privately operated institutions for persistent offenders. The home secretary's comments came after he faced calls at a meeting with Conservative backbench MPs for swift legislative action. Mr Clarke will avoid delays by not producing a 'white paper' but his decisions are still unlikely to be implemented for at least a year.</p>

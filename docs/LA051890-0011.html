			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GIL MASTERS MONTGOMERY FOR CASTLE PARK  </P> <P> Castle Park's Benji Gil didn't seem overly impressed with his four-hit, 3-0  victory over Montgomery High Thursday.  </P> <P> He rated it just his third-best performance this season -- behind a one-hit,  5-0 victory over Carlsbad and a two-hit, 1-0 decision against Monte Vista.  </P> <P> It is easy to see why Gil, a junior right-hander, leads the county in  earned-run average at 0.55.  </P> <P> In overpowering co-Metro Conference champion Montgomery, Gil (6-3) carried a  no-hitter into the sixth before allowing four singles in the final two innings.  He also struck out eight, giving him 89 for the season.  </P> <P> But those weren't the impressive numbers.  </P> <P> Montgomery managed to "hit" just two balls to the left side of the field. The  first didn't occur until the fourth inning. It was a check-swing blooper that  diving shortstop Raul Molina snared over his head as it headed for left field.  The other was a weak grounder to Molina.  </P> <P> A third baseman, left fielder and center fielder essentially were of no use to  Gil.  </P> <P> "He showed us why he's the best," Montgomery Coach Manuel Hermosillo said.  "That's why he's got that oh-five-something ERA."  </P> <P> Said Kiko Palacios, Castle Park's catcher: "There are times he's thrown better  pitches and had to work less."  </P> <P> Montgomery's Mike Arroyo (5-4) was effective as well. He allowed only five  singles, but three came in a three-run fifth with two outs.  </P> <P> After two singles and a hit-by-pitch (Gil), Palacios, a sophomore hitting .447,  lined a two-run single to left that was misplayed and thrown around enough for  Gil to score all the way from first.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, Montgomery completed one of the greatest turnarounds in the  30-year history of the San Diego Section.  </P> <P> The Aztecs finished 10th in the 10-team Metro last year. This year, with six of  eight Metro teams playing .500 or better on the field (Hilltop had to forfeit  17 games), Montgomery is 19-8 and 11-3. Southwest, a 6-5 winner over Mar Vista,  is 13-12, 11-3, Castle Park (19-10, 8-4) finished third.  </P> <P> Montgomery and Southwest will play today at Hilltop High at 3 p.m. to determine  the league's top seeding for the 3-A playoffs. The loser is also assured a  playoff spot, and Castle Park, playing its best baseball of the season,  probably wrapped up one of eight at-large berths in the 16-team draw. JIM  LINDGREN  </P></p>

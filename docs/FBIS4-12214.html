			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Majid al-Lami, Nabil al-Wadi, and Hiyam Ahmad] </F>   [Excerpts] Calls for lifting the unjust siege imposed on  Iraq are intensifying on the official and popular levels.    These calls urge the Security Council, the United Nations,  and humanitarian organizations to expedite serious action toward  ending the siege since Iraq has responded to all Security  Council resolutions.    Chinese Ambassador in Baghdad Zheng Dayong emphasized  China's  principled and firm position in support of Iraq and its  continuous efforts aimed at lifting the siege imposed by the  states of aggression.    At a meeting with Health Minister Dr. Umid Midhat, Zheng  urged the international community to stop this tragedy that the  Iraqi people are facing, which has increased fatalities among  children, the elderly, and women as a result of scarcity of  food, medicines, and basic human requirements.    He emphasized that the siege has entered a dangerous phase  on  which silence should not continue because this is a pure  humanitarian subject.    The ambassador emphasized the importance of expediting the  unfreezing of Iraqi assets abroad so that Iraq can buy medicines  and food, and keep the ghost of death away from innocent  children. [passage omitted]    Cuban Ambassador in Baghdad (Luis Mas Reyes) emphasized his  country's firm position in rejecting the continuation of the  siege imposed on the Iraqi people.    The Cuban ambassador conveyed the greetings of the Cuban  parliament speaker to Sa'di Mahdi Salih, the National Assembly  speaker, and his eagerness to foster friendly relations with  Iraqi parliamentarians.    During his meeting with Dr. Anwar Qasirah, chairman of the  Iraqi- Cuban Parliamentary Friendship Committee, the Cuban  ambassador expressed his appreciation of the relations between  the Iraqi National Assembly and the Cuban Parliament and the  willingness to foster these relations and coordinate positions  at regional and international parliamentary meetings.</p>

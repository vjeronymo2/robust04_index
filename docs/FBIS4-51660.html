			<p>CSO     [Text] The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has begun trading  on the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (TIFFE).  The objective of the bank is to avoid the risk of losses  associated with changes in interest rates by utilizing futures  to better manage an increase in yen-denominated assets held. The  move represents recognition of yen interest futures by an  international agency and may support an expansion in the  utilization of the yen in international markets. Other  international agencies are also in the process of studying entry  into the TIFFE.    Total investments of the ADB as of the end of fiscal year  1993 were roughly $6.7 billion, $1.4 billion of which were  yen-denominated. Those investments include not only short-term  yen assets, but involve redemption of long-term yen bonds which  expose the bank to risks associated with fluctuations in  short-term interest rates of the yen. The portion of  yen-denominated investments has continued to increase from the  latter half of the 1980s and the need had risen to take risk  avoidance measures.    Accordingly, the ADB signed a contract with the Bank of  Tokyo  to engage in Euroyen interest futures transactions and has begun  trading in futures via the Bank of Tokyo. During the past  several days, transactions have been limited to less than 100  transactions, with one contract covering 100 million yen, but  ADB plans to increase its transactions on a phased basis while  keeping an eye on the markets. Since it foresees a future rise  in short-term yen interest rates, it will sell interest futures  for the time being. Since profits will be realized on the  futures when the interest rates actually rise, such profits will  be used to cover losses in the value of assets held.    Yen interest futures began trading on the TIFFE in 1989.  Volume of Euroyen interest futures which is a principal product  traded on the exchange reached 23.38 million contracts in 1993,  ranking fourth on a worldwide basis for a single product behind  that for U.S. Treasury bond futures. ADB decided on full-scale  participation in the markets, assuming that it can engage in  stable transactions relative to yen interest futures on the  TIFFE.    Emphasis is placed on worldwide avoidance of risks in price  fluctuations, but it has been pointed out that international  transactions have not increased because inadequate avoidance  measures existed for the yen. The commencement of trading in yen  interest futures by an international agency of high credibility  is substantiation that the Tokyo markets have acquired avoidance  means to minimize risks associated with market fluctuations. As  a result, there is the possibility of increased use of the yen  by international financial agencies and businesses as well as  increased internationalization of the yen.</p>

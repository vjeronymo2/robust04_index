			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> About 70 members of a Mohawk Indian band opposed to gambling on their  reservation staged a quiet demonstration outside a polling station as residents  began two days of voting on whether to allow casinos on their land. The  protesters picketed the tribal council building, demanding a halt to the  referendum, which they said was illegal and in violation of tribal law. At a  meeting Saturday of the tribal council, members voted to postpone the vote  indefinitely until a mechanism could be found for traditional Mohawks and those  on the Canadian side of the reservation to express their views on the gambling  issue.  </P></p>

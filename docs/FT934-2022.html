			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: Developing nations give way on patents - Intellectual property The intellectual property accord in the Uruguay Round package is a triumph for Gatt negotiators. 'This is the most important international agreement on intellectual property this century,' says one senior trade official. The US secured as good a deal as it could reasonably have hoped for, and far better than it imagined was possible when the multilateral trade talks were launched in 1986. From outright opposition the attitude of developing countries swung to grudging acceptance of the need for tougher intellectual property protection in Gatt, to attract foreign investors and avoid increasingly aggressive arm-twisting by the US. The result is an agreement encompassing all forms of intellectual property that would strengthen and harmonise standards of protection and provide for effective enforcement at national and international level. Among its main features are: Protection of patents for 20 years, regardless of place of invention or whether products are imported or produced locally. The main permitted exclusions would relate to animal and plant inventions and biotechnological process for their production; thus the agreement does not require 'patents on life'. There will also be strict limits on compulsory licensing of patented products by governments, often used for pharmaceuticals in poor nations. Copyright will be protected for at least 50 years, to include computer programs and data compilations. Authors of computer programs and films will largely have exclusive rental rights, as will performers and producers of sound recordings and broadcasts. Trademarks and geographical indications, especially important for European wine producers, will be given stronger protection. Semiconductor layout designs will be protected for 10 years. For the first time, trade secrets will be protected from unauthorised disclosure. All these rules will have to be implemented in national legislation, observing the basic fair trade precepts of national treatment (equal treatment for domestic and foreign right-holders) and non-discrimination between trading partners. Intellectual property disputes will be handled by the World Trade Organisation's disputes mechanism. Least-developed countries such as Bangladesh have an extra 11 years to implement the accord. Most developing countries, such as India and Thailand, have been given five years and industrialised nations one. Where no patent protection now exists of any kind, in areas such as pharmaceuticals, developing countries have 10 years to put legislation into effect. But for pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals, the agreement requires developing countries to permit the filing of patents from the time the agreement comes into force in 1995 and to treat them 10 years hence as if the legislation had been in effect from the start. Since drugs typically require upwards of 10 years' safety testing, those invented now would be protected at the point at which they came on the market. If they reached the market earlier, the patent-holder would be given exclusive marketing rights in the interim. Not satisfied with this, the US pharmaceuticals industry wanted but failed to get protection for drugs already invented but not on the market.</p>

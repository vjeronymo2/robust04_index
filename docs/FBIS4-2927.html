			<p>BFN     [Text] On a family planning inspection tour in Guangdong  Province yesterday, Peng Peiyun, state councillor and minister  of the State Family Planning Commission, noted that Guangdong  had made progress year after year in family planning.    Talking about family planning for the floating population,  Peng Peiyun said: Guangdong Province, which is experiencing  rapid economic development, tops the country in terms of the  size of its floating population. It is very difficult to carry  out family planning among this section of the population. In  this regard Guangdong Province has provided a great deal of good  experience.    Peng Peiyun stressed that family planning is a long-term  task. To do a good job in this respect we must rely on the party  committee and the government and we, on our part, must exercise  leadership well. In raising the question of exploring the  potential of the leading stratum, we mean to encourage leading  people to seek knowledge about the population theory so that  they will have a better understanding of family planning work.  So long as our leading people are enhancing their  understanding, they will show greater initiative in family  planning.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Baker ducks questions on campaign role MR Jamer Baker, US Secretary of State, has left open the possibility that he will shortly give up his post to run President George Bush's re-election campaign, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. En route to the Middle East at the weekend he repeatedly ducked questions on his next step. Last week he spent two days on a private fishing trip with Mr Bush, during which the question was discusssed. The arguments in favour of a reshuffle at the top of the Bush campaign has been reinforced by a surge in support for Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic party nominee, after a successful convention in New York last week and the sudden withdrawal of Mr Ross Perot as a prospective independent candidate. Most polls give Mr Clinton a lead of more than 20 points over Mr Bush. Even though Democrats concede this must be a temporary phenomenon, it was the biggest convention 'bounce' a candidate has received in polling memory. There also could be no disguising the large and enthusiastic crowds greeting Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, on their campaign swing in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the start of a 1,000 mile, six-state bus journey from New York to St Louis through important rust-belt states. The immediate Republican response, a clear harbinger of the campaign to come, has been to portray Mr Clinton and Mr Gore as liberals from the standard 'tax and spend' Democratic tradition. The Republicans have also begun an attempt to pick Mr Clinton's character apart. The initial spear carrier was Senator Jake Garn of Utah who, at a Bush campaign rally in Provo and in the president's presence, derided Mr Clinton and Mr Gore as 'pretty boys'. Mr Garn attacked Mr Clinton for enrolling in the military reserves to avoid being drafted to fight in Vietnam, saying that to have fled to Canada would have been better. Mr Bush did not join in the onslaught on Mr Clinton, implying that at least until after the Republican convention next month in Houston the president will let his surrogates do the dirty work while he takes the high road. The problem for Mr Bush is that he is still not articulating any vision of his own, preferring to blame Democratic control of Congress for the frustration of his policies. This is where Mr Baker's known knack for projecting policies would be invaluable. A few more bad polls for the president and the demands for his return may become deafening.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Management: Why high technology leaves Stanley cold - Lucy Kellaway meets the boss of Dixons in a converted church, where he is happily shuffling papers 'THIS is the office of a tidy, disciplined person, someone who is well organised and pretty savvy. He is a senior businessman with average tastes.' An outsider might not altogether agree with Stanley Kalms' appraisal of his own office. The room, which is carved out of a converted church in the quiet back streets of Mayfair, seems rather feminine, cosy and chintzy. With its bordered carpets, fake coal fire, co-ordinated floral curtains and sets of reproduction furniture, it strikes an odd contrast with the crowded high-tech displays of his Dixons shops. Kalms is happy with the general effect. 'Since I understood what style meant,' says the self-made retailer, who joined the Dixons business at the age of 16, 'I have always gone for a sense of warmth. 'I like browns and I don't like modern things.' While the room has the feeling of a pretentious suite in a hotel, its occupier makes up for it with a certain engaging directness. Kalms is one of the survivors in retailing; for 44 years he has presided over Dixons, watching other high street chains come and go. He is a staunch conservative, both a big C and a little one. He has made generous contributions from his substantial private fortune to the Tory party, and in general seems opposed to change. His office has been managed in the same way for 20 years by Olive, a kindly, matronly sort of woman. 'I depend 100 per cent on Olive. She looks after me every hour of the day.' But while the chain has grown by selling increasingly sophisticated products, Kalms himself has stuck to old-fashioned habits. In his office is a photograph of the first Dixons store opened in Edgware, north London, in 1948. One senses that his ideas about how to run the business may not have changed much since then. On his large, leather-topped desk (which is otherwise quite empty) is a computer print-out a couple of inches thick. This is delivered first thing on Monday mornings and contains the previous week's sales and margins for every product at each of the group's 800-plus stores. But is filling his head with thousands of profit margins really the best use of the chairman's time? 'I'd be no use at strategies if I didn't understand how the camcorder was selling,' he says. Doesn't such attention to detail suggest a reluctance to delegate? On the contrary, Kalms says, he is so good at letting the directors get on with their jobs that he has even moved out of the drab, Ealing headquarters into the more private Mayfair suite. 'I don't like living over the shop,' he says. Despite the large computer screen behind his desk, Kalms sticks to paper whenever possible. 'I can't use the computer,' he says, quite unabashed. 'Technology has passed me by. I'm much more comfortable looking up the tabs.' Neither does he know how to work any of the old cameras that are displayed in his glass cabinet. 'I'm one of the most untechnical people of all time, which gives me a good eye for which products are going to sell.' There are, however, two gadgets in the office that he has no problems working. A pair of identical brass temperature gauges in different parts of the room allow him to indulge his obsession with being too hot or too cold. 'At board meetings I'm up and down all the time to check on the air conditioning,' a sign of the fussy meticulousness that his underlings have sometimes found hard to bear. He likens being in his office to 'being in the nest or in the womb'. For Kalms, the effect is strengthened by a huge, grimy canvass by French artist Bernard Buffet - 'one of the best investments Dixons ever made' - showing a cold, bleak level crossing. 'I like the contrast with the warmth of the office,' he says. He has lots of pictures by the same painter at home. Kalms sees his office as a place in which to receive visitors - beyond two arches in his room there is a plush area with sofas and comfortable chairs. Serious work, he thinks, is better done at home in the evenings. He points to a fat document about the health of retailing: 'It's best to read that sort of thing in your slippers,' he says.</p>

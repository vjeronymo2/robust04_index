			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY 1990;  </P> <P> MATURING METROPOLIS LOOKS AHEAD;  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: ORANGE COUNTY IS COMING OF AGE ON THE EVE OF THE 1990S, BUT IT FACES  NEW RESPONSIBILITIES.  </P> <P> Orange County stands on the brink of the 1990s like an adolescent coping with  new-found size and muscle.  </P> <P> The county, more than ever, is bigger, brassier and bolder, the rich kid on the  block. No longer content to be a bedroom community, it has become an economic  force in national and foreign marketplaces, emerging as a leading center for  high-technology and biomedical research and design.  </P> <P> But at home the county is betwixt and between. Sociologists, politicians and  civic leaders say the '90s can be the decade when Orange County comes to terms  with its phenomenal growth and strides toward its prime.  </P> <P> "Everything in the '90s relates to maturing," Claudette Shaw, president of the  Laguna Art Museum, said. "We've been a promising, unruly adolescent, but it's  time to grow up."  </P> <P> However, traffic, homelessness, deteriorating roads and sewers, unaffordable  housing, trash and polluted air loom as stumbling blocks for a county viewed by  many as unwilling to grapple with the growing pains that are eroding the  quality of life.  </P> <P> The urban tensions that plague older metropolises will manifest themselves here  in the '90s as the county becomes more ethnically diverse, as the gap between  rich and poor widens, the population gets grayer and the last vestiges of  suburban life disappear, experts say. It is the price the county will pay for  its transformation from a string of independent towns to an urban center of  commerce, arts, finance, sports and cutting-edge research and scholarship.  </P> <P> "Orange County, once and for all, will finally become a great metropolis in its  own right, not just a suburban extension of Los Angeles," predicted UCLA  professor Allen Scott, a noted economic geographer who studies Orange County  trends and life styles. "It will be a dynamic place to live in the '90s."  </P> <P> For the 2.6 million people who will live, work and play here by the turn of the  century, it promises to be a decade of remarkable change -- toll roads opening,  the coming of professional basketball or hockey, an expanded arts scene,  increased political clout, new communities, revitalized older cities and  clusters of shiny new office towers. But there is a flip side to the future --  waiting lists, unaffordable housing, government regulations, ethnic friction  and traffic, traffic, traffic.  </P> <P> "It's lucky that Orange Countians like to drive and love their automobiles,  because they are going to spend a lot of time behind the wheel," said Jeremy  Anwyl, an Irvine-based automobile consultant. "Lots of people will probably  spend as much time in their cars as they do at home."  </P> <P> It's a depressing scenario, one that has increasing numbers of Orange Countians  daydreaming about less-congested ZIP codes. But Marty Elkins of Tustin isn't  ready to jump ship -- not yet anyway.  </P> <P> "It's a new decade. Let's think positive," said Elkins, a salesman. "Maybe  things will turn around. They can't get worse. Besides, I'm curious about how  things are going to turn out."  </P> <P> The prospects are enticing.  </P> <P> At long last, the $310-million expansion of John Wayne Airport will be finished  with its gleaming new passenger terminal, parking towers and even a proposed  monorail system to whisk business travelers to key employment centers. But even  before officials snip the ribbons on the stunning additions, the facility will  be outdated, unable to meet the county's soaring demand for air travel. So the  search will continue for a second regional airport, possibly in the canyons and  hills behind coastal San Clemente.  </P> <P> Sports fans can anticipate a new arena to lure a professional basketball or  hockey team, if Anaheim and Santa Ana -- acting like feuding cousins -- ever  decide which of them will build it.  </P> <P> Art lovers will be able to wander the halls of the Newport Harbor Art Museum's  new $50-million home -- a potential lightning rod for artisans who have long  complained about the dismal gallery scene locally.  </P> <P> The county will be more powerful politically as it gains a probable sixth seat  in Congress. A high-speed train, which some are nicknaming the "Gamblers'  Express," might link Anaheim with Las Vegas. Hikers and mountain bikers will  rejoice at the prospect of half a dozen new regional county parks spread across  19,000 acres of canyons, ridges and coastal wetlands.  </P> <P> But for each acre preserved, two will be plowed under.  </P> <P> Earthmovers and jackhammers will continue transforming South County ranchland  into housing tracts. Three, possibly four new cities may spring up in  Saddleback Valley and there is talk in the backcountry of forming a canyon  community to protect Modjeska, Silverado and Trabuco canyons from overzealous  developers.  </P> <P> Thousands of people will settle in whitewashed communities clustered along the  Foothill Tollway, the county's first toll road, which will link Tustin with  Rancho Santa Margarita and its "downtown of the future." Envisioned by planners  as the main shopping district for residents in the county's rapidly growing  eastern and southern foothills, the Town Center will join specialty stores,  offices, movie theaters, parks and a central library through a network of  pedestrian walkways and bike paths.  </P> <P> "It will be the kind of place where you would want to spend a Saturday," said  Donald Moe, a Santa Margarita Co. executive.  </P> <P> But while change and growth may be most striking in the south, planners point  with pride to rebuilding the downtowns -- and images -- of cities in older  corners of the county in the '90s. Huntington Beach expects to blossom into a  tourism and shopping mecca for the west county as it adds four major hotels to  the city's waterfront and a glitzy shopping pavilion at its rebuilt pier.  Capitalizing on its freeway-close access, Brea is expected to be a magnet for  relocating corporations and North County consumers flocking to rejuvenated  retail districts on Brea Boulevard and Imperial Highway.  </P> <P> Anaheim is bullish on plans for $4-billion worth of high-rise office  construction in the Platinum Triangle, a 200-acre swath of prime real estate at  the confluence of the Orange, Garden Grove and Santa Ana freeways.  </P> <P> Technological advances will give thousands of county workers the freedom to  boot up their workday from home or a neighborhood office rather than commuting  bumper to bumper to corporate headquarters. Telecommuting -- using personal  computers, fax machines and telephones -- will become an affordable option.  </P> <P> But the push-button advances of the '90s won't improve everything.  </P> <P> Count on waiting in line for everything from traffic signals to housing.  </P> <P> Securing a slip for a 35-foot sailboat in Newport Harbor may take five years.  There's no wait yet for Angel baseball season tickets, but should pitcher Mark  Langston, the team's newly acquired $16-million man, help bring club owner Gene  Autry a World Series, that could change. Several thousand people are reportedly  waiting for word about the first offering -- still two years away -- of  million-dollar homes and lots overlooking the Pacific in the ritzy Irvine Coast  development south of Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> The wait will also be long for affordable housing. In the midst of one of the  nation's wealthiest counties, where the median income is $41,181 -- and  climbing -- affordable housing for the middle- and low-income population will  have become just a pipe dream. Waiting up to three years for federally  subsidized housing in one county program is common today.  </P> <P> "We have 8,000 people on our waiting list, and it's growing," said Sandra  McClymonds, executive director of the Orange County Housing Authority. "And  there is no reason to believe that the demand will lessen."  </P> <P> Lines at soup kitchens and temporary shelters may also lengthen. The ranks of  the county's homeless, numbering between 5,000 and 10,000 today, could double  by the end of the decade when a median-priced home is expected to top $500,000.  Squeezed by some of the nation's highest living costs, a growing class of  disadvantaged -- the "underemployed" -- may swamp the already overwhelmed and  underfunded public agencies to seek assistance.  </P> <P> "A husband and wife, both working 40 hours a week, earning slightly above  minimum wage, with a family, can't survive now in Orange County," said Scott  Mather, chairman of the Orange County Homeless Task Force. "How can we expect  them to survive the '90s without some help?"  </P> <P> Part of the problem is the prevailing attitude in a county where spending and  consuming is often pursued with Olympic-like fervor, experts say. More  attention has been paid to accumulating wealth than sharing it, a mind-set  private planning consultant Al Bell hopes will end in the '90s.  </P> <P> "It will be a decade when we invest more of our energy and time in people,"  said Bell of the Planning Center, a Newport Beach-based firm. "This county must  -- and will -- confront the whole array of social issues that attend an  affluent community with immense depths of poverty. Contending with those issues  can be as leading-edge as designing a new housing development or computer parts  or roadway.  </P> <P> "That's part of growing up. That's part of our responsibility."  </P> <P> Government will reach into the lives of Orange Countians in new ways. New air  quality regulations may spell the end for drive-through windows at fast-food  outlets as idling autos are targeted as major polluters.  </P> <P> By the year 2000, all cities in California must divert 50% of their garbage  from existing landfills. That's a tall order for a county which annually  generates a hefty two tons of solid waste for every man, woman and child -- by  far the highest per-capita ratio of any county in the nation. Mandatory  curbside recycling -- currently a voluntary program in a half dozen cities --  will be in place countywide by the late '90s.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, our live-it-up, throw-it-away life style will give way to a more  frugal way of thinking," said Frank Bowerman, director and chief engineer of  the county's waste management program. "We have got to turn the corner and  confront this problem."  </P> <P> But government so far has been stumped by the transportation crisis. Don't look  for any quick fixes.  </P> <P> Average freeway speeds during rush hour are expected to drop from 25 m.p.h. to  18 m.p.h. during the '90s. Even more disturbing is Caltrans' prediction that  stop-and-go conditions during peak commute periods will triple, lasting up to  three hours.  </P> <P> Thus, traffic increasingly will dominate peoples' lives. Congestion will factor  into nearly every decision from where to live and work to where to shop and  recreate. The automobile will remain king of the road, despite promising  proposals to build light-rail transit or overhead monorails to transport  commuters. The number of registered vehicles in the county by 1999 could jump  by nearly half a million.  </P> <P> Opening a 7.3-mile portion of the Foothill Tollway in 1994 will deliver some  relief. So will the completion near the end of the decade of the county's  second toll road, the 15-mile-long San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor,  stretching from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Sections of the Santa Ana Freeway through Tustin, Santa Ana and Anaheim may  also be widened during the '90s. But transportation planners say it won't be  nearly enough, and that worries Bob Winslow, a Fullerton resident who commutes  50 miles a day to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I like what Orange County is becoming culturally. I enjoy the recreation  opportunities, having a football and baseball team close by and all the  amenities of a big city," he said. "But what scares me most is the threat to my  access, the fear that I won't be able to drive anywhere because of gridlock."  </P> <P> Coping with congestion will remain a full-time preoccupation. Cellular phones  in county cars and trucks will likely triple to 300,000 during the decade as  more and more motorists conduct business behind the wheel to make up for lost  office time. In addition, sales of high-quality, expensive car stereos are  expected to be brisk as drivers seek to drown out traffic.  </P> <P> "Orange County is one of the most lucrative car stereo markets in the world,"  smiled Jim Holland, a Huntington Beach stereo installer. "People spend $2,000  or $3,000 without batting an eye. They want to escape the traffic."  </P> <P> No wonder. It is going to be more crowded -- everywhere. Another 262,000 people  are expected to settle here by 1999.  </P> <P> Many of the new arrivals will speak different languages or come from foreign  lands. Minorities will make up 35% percent of the population by the turn of the  century. One out of five county residents will be Latino.  </P> <P> "The ethnic mix of Orange County will only accelerate," Cal State Fullerton  sociologist Myron Orleans said. "The salad bowl of race and culture that we are  becoming can be one of our strengths in the '90s. Minorities will bring a  cultural diversity that has been lacking in this county for so long."  </P> <P> But absorbing immigrants and minorities into mainstream Orange County won't be  easy.  </P> <P> Without extensive job and language training, steady, upwardly mobile employment  may be out of reach for many. Highly skilled labor will be in demand in the  '90s to fill the 250,000 new jobs in the county as the region remains a  manufacturing center of computer chips, medical equipment and aerospace parts.  Complicating the business equation is a predicted downturn in defense spending,  which will force many Orange County companies to retool and prompt workers to  learn trades or wind up unemployed.  </P> <P> But the challenges are not insurmountable, some argue.  </P> <P> "Educating the next generation is critical," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar of  the Latino community in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. "We are seeing in  the disappearance of the blue-collar job market in Orange County. And unless  the current generation of Latino children get educated, they will not find a  niche in this county. We need to wake up to what is happening."  </P> <P> The same may be said about county residents in general who complain in growing  numbers about density, crime and pollution, but so far have not solved the  problems.  </P> <P> Some, like Peter Morrison, a RAND Corp. demographer, are optimistic about the  '90s in Orange County. Unlike their neighbors in Los Angeles, Morrison  believes, Orange Countians will act before it is too late.  </P> <P> "Many of the people living in Orange County moved there because of the promise  of a better life, and they are unlikely to let it go without a fight," Morrison  said. "I think the '90s is a crossroads decade for the county -- a time when  people will fight back and recapture what they've worked so hard to create."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agenda for the 1990s  </P> <P> Today:  </P> <P> Orange County is growing up, but is it mature enough to handle the  responsibilities, problems  </P> <P> and power that come with  </P> <P> bigger size?

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Activities to support  and implement the "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the  Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country" have been  conducted vigorously within the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), an authoritative organization of  overseas citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  in the last one year or a little more since the programme was  laid down by the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song on April  6, 1993.    A statement of the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon  and 14 press statements by Chongnyon Chairman Han Tok-su and  personages of various strata supporting the 10-point programme  were released immediately after the programme was published.    Meetings to support and implement the 10-point programme  have  been held at 42 prefectural headquarters since the central  meeting of the Korean residents in Japan.    It was stressed in unison at the meetings that the 10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation is a common  reunification charter of the nation and a great political  programme which makes it possible to tide over the present  rigorous difficulties and achieve peace and reunification of the  country by the united efforts of the whole nation.    Rallies, study meetings, lectures and seminars were held  widely by organizations of Chongnyon and 4,173 cases of mass  rallies, street demonstrations, motorcade and bicycle parades  were staged.    324,122 Korean residents in Japan participated in the  signature campaign supporting the 10-point programme in only  three months.</p>

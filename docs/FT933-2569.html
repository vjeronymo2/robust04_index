			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Court deals blow to Japanese shareholders JAPAN'S shareholders' rights movement suffered a setback yesterday when the Tokyo District Court ruled that the directors of Nomura Securities were not required to reimburse the securities house for losses incurred in compensating favoured corporate clients for stock investment losses. The ruling, which comes amid a growing debate on shareholders' rights, followed an unusual damages claim by an individual investor, Mr Yoshinori Ikenaka of Osaka, who wanted the 14 directors to pay Nomura Y100m (Dollars 943,300) for approving Y362m in compensation to Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) for stock losses in 1990. Japanese courts are generally reluctant to set clear precedents, though the decision yesterday was welcomed by Japanese firms fearing a rush of new litigation after changes to the Commercial Code in June eased filing requirements for shareholder litigants. In the case of Nomura, Japan's biggest securities house, Judge Yoshihiro Katayama ruled that the former board did not necessarily act against shareholder interests in compensating TBS for its losses, as the board had wanted to secure the broker's long-term relationship with the broadcasting company. Judge Katayama said the decision to compensate did not involve a breach of the directors' powers of discretion when the circumstances of the period, in particular the market crash, were taken into account. He said shareholders had profited from business with TBS after it was compensated. But the judge said loss compensation by Japanese brokers, common after the crash, should be criticised as it undermined public confidence in the fairness of securities markets and was an apparent violation of the anti-monopoly law. Nomura said the court's decision reflected judicial awareness of the importance of long-term links between Japanese companies, though the broker suggested that shareholders' rights will not be hindered by the ruling. Japanese brokers have generally supported the campaign for improved shareholders' rights, believing that investor confidence in the stock market has been damaged by a series of broker scandals, including loss compensation and links to gangster groups. Earlier this month, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that six former executives of Mitsui Mining must pay Y100m in compensation to the company for manipulating its share price. After that decision, Japanese lawyers said the case appeared to be an exception. They said the stock manipulation was blatant in the Mitsui Mining case and the ruling would not necessarily influence other actions based on allegations that directors had been incompetent or negligent. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has imposed fines of Y5m each on three Japanese securities houses, Daiwa Securities, Yamaichi Securities and Universal Securities, Reuter reports. The exchange said it had fined Daiwa for its compensation of a client in May-July 1991. Daiwa made up for the client's investment losses worth Y130m. Earlier this year Yamaichi and Universal ran into trouble in connection with the illegal manipulation of shares.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gillian Tett report: "Car Industry Must Face Japanese </F> Challenge"]    [Text] Brussels -- Mr Martin Bangemann, EU [European  Union] industry commissioner, yesterday warned the European car  industry that Brussels would not protect it indefinitely from  Japanese competition.    He said there would be no change to the EU-Japan agreement  on  market access, signalling that the commitment to open the EU  market by the end of 1999 must stand.    But he held out the prospect of a substantial aid package to  help restructuring and hinted that he expected to see further  mergers along the lines of the Rover-BMW deal.    Unveiling a Commission strategy paper on the future of the  European car industry, Mr Bangemann said: "We are not advocating  mergers, (but) we do believe that not all the European car  industry have the necessary size to compete in the world market."    He urged European car makers to target emerging markets in  the Far East and Latin America for both sales and production.  The commission is pushing for better market access for EU car  exports in Japan, U.S., South Korea, East Europe and Turkey.    The agreement struck between Japan and the EU in July 1991  envisages the progressive opening of European markets to  Japanese imports by 2000, allowing Japanese exporters to  increase market share when the European market is growing.    The Commission report calls for measures to tackle the  structural weakness in the European car industry including:    1. Allocating EU funds for retraining workers, with up to  ECU4bn of EU funds potentially available.    2. Developing joint programmes of research and development,  with ECUl.3bn of funds likely to be earmarked between 1994 and  1998.    3. New measures to smooth the operation of the internal  market, such as streamlining the distribution system and  harmonising vehicle taxes.    4. Introducing a range of environmental standards, aimed at  promoting cleaner and more efficient cars.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: SETON HALL VS. MICHIGAN;  </P> <P> LONG ROAD ENDS TONIGHT;  </P> <P> WITH UNLIKELY MARCH OVER, MICHIGAN AND SETON HALL GET THE FINAL CALL  </P> <P> P.J. Carlesimo has been gone so long, so unexpectedly long, that he had to call  the doorman at his apartment building to have him take in the overflowing mail.  </P> <P> Seton Hall left South Orange, N.J., on March 14, and the Pirates have been on  the road since.  </P> <P> The days of March also held far more than could have been imagined for Steve  Fisher, the Michigan man who became coach just two days before the Wolverines'  first-round game. Now, the slow-speaking coach who describes himself as "plain  vanilla" is a victory away from becoming the first rookie coach to win a  national championship.  </P> <P> "Once again, yes, it's like a dream," Fisher said. "Don't wake me until  Tuesday."  </P> <P> One way or another, the road -- and one team's dream -- will end tonight when  Seton Hall plays Michigan for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  championship in the Kingdome.  </P> <P> One team will win its first NCAA championship, and one will go home with second  place. Michigan has played for the championship twice -- in 1965 and 1976 --  and lost both times. Seton Hall is in the NCAA final for the first time.  </P> <P> It is a game that will pit the overwhelming athleticism of a Michigan team that  has tended to underachieve against a Seton Hall team so balanced that its  leading scorer -- John Morton -- may be one of the lesser known starters.  </P> <P> It will pit Fisher, a folksy man who will have to wait until after the season  ends to learn if Athletic Director Bo Schembechler will hire him, against  Carlesimo, the quick wit with the New York accent born to say the words  basketball in the Garden, who swears that it wouldn't matter who coached these  teams.  </P> <P> While many people still press for an answer to the unanswerable question --  Would Michigan be here if Bill Frieder were still the coach? -- Carlesimo tends  to think he and Fisher are both nice guys, but that the teams are the thing.  </P> <P> "We're here because we have the best players in the country," Carlesimo said of  his own team. "I understand how overrated a head coach's role is. If I couldn't  coach tomorrow, my assistants could do the job just as well. I'm not belittling  the job Steve has done at all. To handle the pressure and do the things he's  done, that's been the hard part. The Xs and Os, anybody knew Fish could do  that. But they have great players. With Bill or with Steve, I think they'd be  here."  </P> <P> Last year's championship matched Kansas and Oklahoma, two Big Eight teams who  had seen each other play so much they were sick and tired of it. This year,  Michigan (29-7) plays Seton Hall (31-6), a school only two Michigan starters --  Rumeal Robinson and Mike Griffin -- could locate before the tournament began.  </P> <P> As late as midday Sunday, the players knew little more of each other than a few  names -- the Michigan players mostly knew Andrew Gaze and Ramon Ramos, and  Seton Hall players knew Glen Rice and Robinson, the point guard. But by the  time practices were over, they knew plenty.  </P> <P> The Michigan players had seen the beginning of Seton Hall's semifinal against  Duke Saturday at their hotel before they left for the Kingdome to play Illinois  in the second semifinal. Before they got on the bus, Seton Hall was down 18  points.  </P> <P> When they got to the Kingdome, Seton Hall was ahead. Michigan was impressed.  </P> <P> "I saw Seton Hall has a lot of class," Terry Mills said.  </P> <P> Seton Hall, after finishing showers and interviews, caught only the second half  of Michigan's game against Illinois, including Sean Higgins' game-winning  basket off an offensive rebound.  </P> <P> "I saw only the last part of the game," Gaze said. "That team can play."  </P> <P> Carlesimo looks at Michigan and sees a team that he calls "scary," especially  at forward, where Rice and Terry Mills play.  </P> <P> "I don't mind playing a team that's bigger than us if we're quicker, or quicker  than us if we're stronger," Carlesimo said. "The thing that's scary about  Michigan is the combination of all three -- size, strength and quickness --  they present. . . . They're very, very well coached, they play good defense,  they get the ball up and down the floor, they shoot the ball very well outside,  and they can be an awesome rebounding team. But that's the kind of team you're  going to play if you play for the national championship."  </P> <P> It is a game likely to present some charged matchups.  </P> <P> At point guard, Michigan's Robinson will go against Seton Hall's Gerald Greene,  who kept the Pirates in the game with his penetration against Duke.  </P> <P> Seton Hall will have to contend with Rice, who averages 25 points a game and  who gets a vote for player of the year from Fisher.  </P> <P> "He's been as good as any player in America, maybe better than any player in  America in the last five games," Fisher said.  </P> <P> Gaze, or perhaps John Morton, is likely to draw the defensive assignment on  Rice.  </P> <P> "I know I'll have my hands full," Gaze said.  </P> <P> Talented as it is, Michigan has not played this well all season.  </P> <P> "We've all heard that statement that we don't play hard all the time, that  Michigan doesn't play 40 minutes," Rice said. "Hopefully we can prove our  character is solid."  </P> <P> In the past, Higgins said, Michigan's abundance of athletic ability sometimes  hampered the team.  </P> <P> "When you play on a team with a bunch of All-Americans out of high school, you  find that you would wait for someone else to jump on the floor for a loose  ball, wait for someone else to do it," Higgins said. "Last year, we waited for  Gary Grant. This year a lot of us were waiting for Glen."  </P> <P> But long about the end of the season, and most notedly long about the beginning  of the tournament, Michigan started playing its best.  </P> <P> "In the past, for whatever reason, it's true, we have had sub-par performances  in the tournament," center Loy Vaught said. "Our main goal is to silence all  the critics. With one more win, I don't see how anybody can criticize us."  </P> <P> Seton Hall, by contrast, has no players with brilliant individual reputations  -- at least not outside of the Olympics.  </P> <P> "Because of the fact that our kids play unselfishly and because of the fact  that defense is a big part of our game and because of our depth, it hurts their  individual recognition," Carlesimo said.  </P> <P> It's a team that can play as well with Anthony Avent, Michael Cooper and Frantz  Volcy in off the bench, as it can with the starting lineup of Greene, Morton,  Ramos, Gaze and Daryll Walker.  </P> <P> And perhaps more than anything, it is a team that appreciates its good fortune.  </P> <P> "Any of the teams we've played in the past three or four games could be here,"  Carlesimo said. "Indiana, UNLV, Duke. . . . This tournament has become a  situation where 15, 20, maybe 25 teams have a legitimate chance when it starts  to win the whole thing. To win six games, you have to be very, very good and  very, very lucky."  </P> <P> INSIDE THE FINAL TWO  </P> <P> WHO: Seton Hall (31-6) vs. Michigan (29-7).  </P> <P> WHEN: Today, 6:10 p.m.  </P> <P> WHERE: Kingdome, Seattle  </P> <P> TV: Channel 2 and 8  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: Michigan's Rumeal Robinson is a master of his craft on and off the  basketball court.

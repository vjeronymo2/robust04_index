			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Hosokawa's star begins to fade as coalition looks vulnerable Support for the cabinet of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa has plummeted by 10 percentage points over the past month to 60 per cent, according to a survey yesterday by the Asahi Shimbun daily newspaper. Formerly, Mr Hosokawa was the most popular prime minister since the second world war. The survey's publication coincided with a fresh split in the Social Democrats, the largest party in the coalition, which appears to be preparing to divide into two parties with uncertain allegiances. In an attempt to restore flagging public confidence, Mr Hosokawa plans to announce tomorrow an outline plan to stimulate the economy, said government officials. An economic package was embarrassingly shelved earlier this month due to splits in the seven-party coalition and opposition from the conservative finance ministry. Mr Hosokawa also intends to apologise for failing his election pledge to pass plans to reform Japan's corruption-prone political system by the end of the year, said officials. Delaying tactics by the traditionalist wing of the opposition Liberal Democratic party forced Mr Hosokawa to extend the parliamentary session to January 29. Yesterday's poll confirms that the government's popularity is firmly in decline, first indicated in a survey two weeks ago. The change of fortunes occurred soon after the government outmanoeuvred the LDP last month to ram the political reform bills through the lower house. The LDP, which ran Japan for 38 years until Mr Hosokawa's arrival last summer, counter-attacked by impeding the plans in the upper house and by putting pressure on the government to switch its attention from reform to the economy. To make matters worse, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's powerful backroom negotiator, has temporarily taken a back seat. Associates say Mr Ozawa is recuperating from exhaustion and influenza, rather than plotting his next political move, as speculated by the popular press. A further sign of the coalition's fragility emerged yesterday with the formation of a 40-strong study group of moderate and right wing members of the Social Democratic Party, the coalition's largest and most troublesome member. Previously, study groups like this have been precursors to factions or new parties. This group, called the Democrats, is understood to be seeking members from other parties, including the LDP. The SDP's recent ability to overcome left wing members' opposition to opening the rice market indicates that it values power enough to control internal differences. But the study group is a sign that the coalition will not last long once it has achieved political reform, the only task on which its members more or less agree, believes Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia.</p>

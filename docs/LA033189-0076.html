			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> A chain of eight laundromats in the south San Francisco Bay Area has been told  that its laundry ad showing dirty undies isn't clean enough for the silver  screen. The proposed ad pictures an overflowing clothes hamper and soiled  undies on the floor, accompanied by the words: "Are you buying underwear to  avoid your laundromat?" Promoters of Oasis Laundries Inc. wanted to advertise  on 16 area movie screens operated by AMC theaters, a subsidiary of National  Cinema Network of Kansas City, Mo. The movie ad was to complement a billboard  campaign that has used the same picture for three months. Oasis was told that  the men's undershorts on the floor was the problem, and the ad could run if the  shorts were deleted. Oasis management found that "absolutely ridiculous" since  millions had already seen the picture on billboards. A spokesman for National  Cinema in Kansas City said the ad did not adhere to its G-rating, family fare  policy. AILEEN MacMINN  </P></p>

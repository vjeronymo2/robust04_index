According to a report by our correspondent: Following the  reports of the Hezbollah nation to the personnel of the  antinarcotics office of the Khomeynishahr law enforcement region  concerning the activities of narcotics trafficking gangs, the  law enforcement officials began surveillance of the activities  of the two above-mentioned gangs. In this connection, the  selling gang had specified a delivery place for the narcotics in  Esfahan. Since these two gangs were under surveillance by  officials, at the precise time of the delivery of the substance,  six professional smugglers with 40 1-kg sealed packages of opium  residue and 9 million rials in cash as well as two vehicles were  captured.    According to a report by the public relations office of the  Esfahan law enforcement zone, after the seizure of the above  substances, while weighing and examining them, the officials in  the antinarcotics office realized that grease had been  substituted for the opium residue packages. In their  confessions, the accused say that the substance was sold to them  recently by an experienced smuggler in the east of the country  as opium residue, and because they had bought narcotics from him  several times, they did not suspect it.    Based on this report, in the continuation of the examination  of this case, the officials identified the cheating smuggler,  who was active in one of the border cities in the east of the  country. After his arrest, he told the officials that he had  done so because he is deeply in debt.    It is interesting that a number of grease cans were  discovered from the hiding place of the cheating smuggler. On  the whole, four accused persons, considering their various past  records in the trafficking of narcotics and explicit  confessions, were sent to judicial authorities and condemned to  jail.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 25 Mar (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the people's assembly of the Srpska republic, this  evening sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali,  stressing that "a year ago the Srpska republic assembly passed a  decision that no foreign army can enter its territory without  the parliament's permission."    "Sending a Turkish military contingent to Bosnia would set a  precedent which the Security Council should not accept, and  should certainly not be the one to set it, because Turkey has  failed to keep the necessary neutrality during the civil war in  Bosnia, and it even openly sided with the Muslim side. In  addition, Turkey is a country whose centuries-long  occupation-style rule of this region is still alive in the  memory of the Serb nation," the letter stresses.    Deputies of the Srpska republic's people's assembly believe,  it is stated, that this decision is morally and humanly  impermissible, and that it would be counterproductive for the  peace process.    "The Srpska republic assembly charged me with warning you of  fatal consequences of that action," Krajisnik stresses in his  letter.</p>

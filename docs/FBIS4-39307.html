			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lilia Kuznetsova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- The testimony of eyewitnesses  and access to archive materials have thrown additional light on  the fate of American servicemen reported missing during World  War II on the territory of the Soviet Union, according to the  members of the joint Russian-American commission. The  commission, created to study the problem of American missing,  held a press-conference on Friday to discuss the results of its  latest plenary session.    Co-Chairman of the commission Dmitriy Volkogonov declared  that the group's work has reached a new level and taken on an  international character. The embassies of Great Britain,  Australia, and Italy appealed to the commission today to help  them learn more about their missing servicemen. Volkogonov said  the group's work was "very important evidence of the improvement  in relations between Russia and the USA."    Congressman Pete Peterson, co-chairman of the commission  from  the American side, noted that their work has been based  exclusively on facts and personal testimony. The "cold war"  group was able to uncover the remains of American pilot John  Robertson Dunham, who was shot down over the Soviet Union in  October 1952. New information about the pilots shot down in  April 1950 and September 1952 has also been gathered.    The commission's sub-group for the Korean war has been able  to get new information from Russian archives, and even the  intelligence archives were opened up to shed more light on the  Vietnam war.    The commission also noted that the American side has been  able to provide the Russians some additional clues concerning  Russian servicemen reported missing in Afghanistan.</p>

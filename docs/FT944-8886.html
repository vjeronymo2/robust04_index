			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: N American newsprint price surge continues Connecticut-based Champion International has kicked off this year's fourth round of newsprint price increases in North America. Citing unexpectedly strong worldwide demand, Champion said that it planned to raise prices by about 9 per cent, or USDollars 50 a tonne, on March 1. Other US and Canadian producers are likely to follow suit. The increase, a combination of a cut in discounts and an increase in list prices, would bring the east coast newsprint price to about Dollars 600 a tonne, compared with Dollars 420 at the beginning of this year. Buyers are likely to resist the increase. It could prove difficult to implement if predictions that the recent surge in demand may slacken in the first quarter of next year are borne out. For the time being however, producers appear to have the upper hand. Consumption by US daily newspapers climbed by about 5 per cent in the first nine months of this year. Stone Container, the Chicago-based company, has contributed to the scramble by cutting shipments from its Snowflake mill in Arizona, which is being converted to liner-board production. The squeeze on supplies in North America has been exacerbated by strong overseas demand, especially in the UK and south-east Asia. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian newsprint exports rose 15 per cent in the first nine months. The short-term outlook hinges on labour developments in British Columbia. Workers at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three pulp and paper mills earlier this week voted in favour of a strike if no settlement was reached in protracted contract negotiations. Tensions have been further inflamed by a dispute over MacMillan Bloedel's decision to seek bids from construction companies employing non-union labour.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wilma N. Yamzon] </F>   [Text] The admission of the killing of former rebel  official Leopoldo Mabilangan alias "Ka [Comrade] Hector," by a  leader of the Melito Glor Command of the New People's Army (NPA)  confirmed that the Netherlands-based National Democratic Front  (NDF) has lost its control over the communist movement in the  Philippines, political analysts said.    They added that not only did the pronouncement by NPA leader  Gregorio "Ka Roger" Rosal clear the government of any  involvement in the killing, but also showed that the Ramos  Administration is serious and sincere in pursuing a lasting  peace in the country.    The Melito Glor Command under "Ka Roger" claimed  responsibility for the assassination of "Ka Hector" over the  weekend, saying that the former NPA leader had "sinned against  the people."    But former NDF leader Satur Ocampo said the admission of the  killing must be checked first "before pointing an accusing  finger to the NPA."    At the same time, Senate President Edgardo Angara urged the  government to continue the investigation of the death of "Ka  Hector" to find the truth behind the assassination of Mabilangan.    Lawyer Jose Malvar Villegas, spokesman for Region 4  (Southern  Tagalog) of the Lakas-NUCD-UMDP [Lakas ng Bansa -- Power of the  Nation-National Union of Christian Democrats; UMDP -- expansion  unknown], said the success of Ka Hector in bringing back his  former comrades' confidence in the government through the  putting up of cooperatives showed the NPA's support is waning  among the people in Southern Tagalog region.    "The growth of cooperatives in Laguna, Batangas, and Quezon  through Ka Hector's initiative was a big blow to the communist  movement in those provinces," Villegas said.    He contended that if Mabilangan was killed because of his  "crimes against the people," he should have been slain even  before he surrendered to the government.    "But the fact that he was killed just now, indicated that Ka  Hector was assassinated because the NPA was alarmed by the  successful inroads he was making among the people and rebel  comrades through his cooperative movement in the provinces,"  Villegas said.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: One other choice for Remploy Sir, I was saddened by the statement by Remploy's chief executive that, while he had known about the UK government's intention to axe the priority scheme for companies employing disabled workers for more than a year, he had assumed that he had no choice but to accept the government's plan ('Remploy chief hits back at Portillo', August 24). Clearly one can criticise Mr Michael Portillo's action, as Mr Worthey is now doing. However, it is regrettable that the chief executive of Remploy should unquestioningly have accepted the words of the UK employment minister, without having recourse to the European Commission, at whose door the blame for withdrawal of the scheme is being laid. Had he done so, he might have learned that the German government is drafting a law based on the UK scheme, apparently with the European Commission's blessing. As many companies and organisations with a representation in Brussels can confirm, the very reason for having independent sources of information is that government and industry viewpoints on issues will inevitably diverge. While the easiest and most comfortable methods of keeping abreast of policies which affect British industry would be through UK government departments, it pays to remember that political expediency or opportunity may often direct ministers' policies and actions. For this reason, Mr Worthey's sad testament should be taken to heart, not only by Remploy's employees, but also by other British industry organisations not active in Brussels.

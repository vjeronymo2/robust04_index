			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Turkey and EC anti-subsidy proceedings Sir, You refer ('Turkey in dumping move against Pakistan', December 12), to the EC anti-subsidy proceeding against Turkish polyester fibres and yarns. The reference is incorrect and incomplete. First, the definitive resolution of the matter was in September 1991, so your reference to provisional duties in June 1991 was outdated. Secondly, of the 11 schemes investigated (and without prejudice to whether they all qualified as countervailable subsidies, which we deny), the Commission eventually identified only three - not eight - schemes requiring possible countervailing action. Third, many of these schemes had either been abolished during the investigation period or during the course of the proceeding, or did not apply to exports to the EC among others. This was done within the context of Turkey's general programme of modifying its industrial incentive schemes and phasing out those measures not consistent with its international obligations. Consequently, the case was settled by an undertaking between the Turkish government and the Commission. Izzet M. Sinan, Oppenheimer Wolff &amp; Donnelly, Box 31, 1050 Brussels, Belgium</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTIVIST POLICEMAN GRANTED DISABILITY  </P> <P> Calling self-styled activist Don Jackson "psychologically unfit" to return to  his job as a sergeant with the Hawthorne Police Department, city officials  announced Wednesday he will be granted a disability retirement.  </P> <P> The decision by City Manager R. Kenneth Jue comes more than two years after  Jackson, 31, was placed on temporary disability leave after his allegations of  racism against Hawthorne police.  </P> <P> Jackson gained national attention in January when a television camera crew  filmed him as he was apparently pushed through a plate glass window by a  policeman during a "sting" operation designed to uncover abuse in the Long  Beach Police Department.  </P> <P> His retirement will be retroactive to Feb. 3, the date of a psychiatrist's  report that recommended that he be removed from the force, said Doug Gates,  Hawthorne's employee relations officer.  </P> <P> Jackson will receive $2,120 a month, 50% of his sergeant's pay, from the state  Public Employees Retirement System, Gates said. Jackson had received $960 a  month in temporary disability pay.  </P> <P> "I'm very relieved," Jackson said Wednesday. "It's been a burden economically  as well as mentally."  </P></p>

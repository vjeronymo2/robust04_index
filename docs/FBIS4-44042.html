			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suleyman Demirel gave a dinner in honor of  Uzbek President Islam Karimov at Cankaya Mansion this evening.    In a speech at the dinner, President Demirel said that the  Turkish nation was elated when it heard of the independence of  its Uzbek brothers, with whom it has special historical,  cultural, language, and religious ties. He pointed out that  despite the differences between the two countries caused by long  years of separation and foreign influences, Turkey and  Uzbekistan share the same roots. He added that the two  countries share the same fairy tales, epics, legends, and  heroes. This is the foundation of our common legacy, he  stressed.    Demirel recalled that immediately after Uzbekistan gained  its  independence, cooperation between the two countries grew  significantly within a short time. He stressed that Turkey  considers it its political and moral responsibility to help  brotherly Uzbekistan in every field. He added: As before,  Turkey will continue to fulfill this responsibility on the basis  of [word indistinct] of two equal and sovereign states, and of  course, on the basis of noninterference in each other's domestic  affairs, mutual respect, and interest.    In turn, Uzbek President Karimov said that his country wants  to develop relations with Turkey in every field and that this  will benefit both countries. He pointed out that there are  extensive opportunities in his country in every field, adding  that Uzbekistan wants to benefit from Turkey's experience in  various spheres. Karimov added that commercial relations between  the two countries are developing with each passing day and that  close to 100 Turkish companies are active in Uzbekistan.    Karimov will leave Turkey tomorrow.</p>

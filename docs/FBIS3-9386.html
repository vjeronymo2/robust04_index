			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Dusan Zupan] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (TANJUG) -- A report from the  United Nations that the Security Council agrees to Turkey's  sending its troops to the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina unavoidably arouse associations on the  stories about a goat which is supposed to watch over the cabbage  and a wolf which is supposed to protect the sheep.    Such lack of sensitivity on the part of the U.N., which is  sending to Bosnia-Herzegovina troops whose government has long  since declared itself clearly on whose side it is, is simply  amazing. Turkey has assisted Bosnian Moslems from the first day  of their secession -- politically, militarily, financially,  morally. Turkish war correspondents, have publicly boasted in  their papers of having shot at and killed "infidels". If this  is so among reporters then what may one expect the Turkish  troops might do.    By adopting the stand that Turkey may send troops to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. has broken its own vow that former  occupying forces could not be among the U.N. peacekeeping force  in a respective country. Turks have been occupiers on the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina for full 500 years.    For the Bosnian Moslems, Turkey means incomparably more than  Russia does to the Serbs. Even the family of Bosnian Moslem  leader Alija Izetbegovic lives in Turkey. On the other side,  Russia has never been an occupying force on these territories,  nor has its troops impaled the Moslems here. However, as  regards the Serbs and Turks -- it is different story.    All in all, the U.N. decision, among many others which it  took under pressure, testifies about further moral degradation  of the world organization. Moral strength has always been its  mightiest weapon, now this too is lost.    If the Turks, nevertheless, arrive to Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the  only true balance might be achieved by calling on the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia to send its troops there too. Everything  else looks as poorly veiled hypocrisy the objective of which is  to threaten the lives of Serbs and their property, and this not  only in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

Determination of the Comparative Attractiveness of  Regions for Embarking on Banking Operations by the Index Method </H3> <H5>  1.1. General Approaches </H5>   In comparing conditions for banking operations in various  regions, we may distinguish three key factors that determine a  favorable outlook for embarking on banking operations within  them.    First, we should name a volume of financial flows  that should be sufficient for it to make sense for a banking  institution to be established to service them. However, the  volume of financial flows in and of itself indicates nothing:  Given an insignificant number of banking institutions, even  small gross flows may turn out to be sufficient to ensure the  prosperity of a new bank or branch.    This is why it is not the absolute volume but rather the  concentration of financial flows which is the most  important factor, i.e., the average volume of such flows per one  banking institution already existing in the region. The  significance of this factor is associated with the fact that the  banking institution being established will be able to operate  only if it succeeds in attracting a proportion of the clientele  of already existing banks and branches.    At present, a paradoxical situation is observed in Russia as  a consequence of the insufficient development of the banking  system and the attendant low level of competition: the larger  the bank, the greater the indifference with which it treats its  clients, and the more easily the latter "break away" from it.  Indeed, a small bank, as a rule, services its founders. It  hardly has clients besides these. The provision of highly  specialized services is the only point that may draw the  founders away from the bank they fully control, but both the  need for such services and the number of banks capable of  providing them are relatively small.    At the same time, a large bank virtually does not depend on  its depositors and does not strive to keep them at any price. As  a rule, relative indifference and comparatively high fees for  services result (of course, there are exceptions; however, the  headlong progress of banks that violate this rule goes precisely  to confirm that it is correct with regard to the banking system  of Russia as a whole). It would be fitting to recall here that,  having gained considerable authority, some of the largest  Russian banks mounted entire campaigns to get rid of small and,  therefore, less profitable clients by deliberately creating  unbearable conditions for servicing them.    As a result, the greater the concentration of financial  resources at the banking institutions of a given region, the  more amenable these resources are to reorientation toward new  banks and branches. The above rule is a general rule for all  market economies, although in less rigid form: High  concentration is inseparably linked to an entire complex of  phenomena which create prerequisites for the development of  successful competition. In the absence of this, any market  economy would be crushed by monopoly practices.    Going back to the banking system of Russia, we should stress  that the described indicators--the volume and concentration of  financial flows--do not reflect an entire complex of factors,  some of which, in principle, cannot be quantified. Crucial  factors, such as the level of development of infrastructure  (virtually the most significant factor for banking operations!),  the availability of skilled personnel, and the attitude of local  authorities can be taken into account only through a resultant  indicator testifying to their total, combined impact, rather  than directly.    The number of branches that have already been  created in the territory in question is such an indicator. The  latter makes no sense in the absence of accounting for the two  previous factors because it shows solely the propensities that  prevailed in the past without factoring in the economic  foundation on which these propensities rested. As a result, the  mistakes of the past will become self-sustaining: For example,  the extensive establishment of branches in a territory with  insignificant financial flows as a result of particular  subjective mistakes will create an illusion of extraordinary  attractiveness, despite the fact that these branches eke out a  pitiful existence.    The enumerated factors characterize either the operational  conditions that are external to the banking system (the volume  of financial flows and, in part, the number of branches), or the  quantitative aspect of the system's own development  (concentration of financial flows and, in part, the number of  branches). The qualitative aspect of development of the system,  i.e. the depth of specialization of the banking institutions and  the complexity of operations performed by them, are actually  left out of our field of vision.    To remedy this shortcoming, it would suffice to recall that,  as a rule, sophisticated specialized banking operations are not  associated with the immediate servicing of tangible flows.  Therefore, the proportion of operations associated with the  immediate servicing of tangible flows in the overall volume of  operations of banking establishments will indicate the level of  qualitative development of the banking system. We will  conventionally call this indicator "the proportion of  nonfinancial operations."    The above interconnected and interdependent factors which  determine the conditions for banking activities in various  regions make it possible to arrive at a generalized indicator of  attractiveness of a particular territory even on the basis of  existing imperfect statistics.  <H3>  1.2. Indexes of the Scale and Concentration of Financial  Flows, Level of Development of Branches, and Proportion of  Nonfinancial Operations </H3>   The greatest difficulties in undertaking the present effort  are associated with the absence, in principle, of information on  the strength of financial flows. Information on the size of  regional bank assets provided by the Central Bank of Russia is  suitable only with reservations because it applies to the assets  of banks registered in a given territory, regardless of where  they engage in operations.    Distortions caused by this are most vividly apparent in the  case of Moscow, to which the assets of former specialized and  sectoral banks that have kept a considerable chain of branches  and service territories quite far removed from Moscow are  attributed. With a view to getting rid of this shortcoming, the  size of bank assets has to be adjusted by taking into account a  number of indirect indicators that point up various components  of financial flows in the process of determining the index  of financial flows.    The index of concentration of financial flows,  which describes the difference between volume of the average  financial flows per one banking institution (bank or branch) in  the region in question and the average Russian level, was  determined in a similar manner.    The indexes of the number of branches and proportion of  nonfinancial operations were determined directly, by  comparing the number of branches registered in a given region  (or, respectively, the proportion of nonfinancial operations in  the total volume of operations of banking institutions in a  given region) with the average Russian level.    All the described indexes amount to deviations of the  relevant indicators from the average Russian level, which is  assumed to be 100 percent.  <H3>  1.3. Comparative Index of Attractiveness of Conditions for  Banking Operations </H3>   In working with the present publication, it is most  important  for the user to grasp the fact that, depending on the situation  of his bank and its development strategy determined by this  situation, the significance of some of the factors described  above may vary.    After all, the index of attractiveness of conditions for  banking operations as determined by us is subjective in nature:  It depends not only on conditions within the region, but also on  the potential of whoever wants to develop the region.    Only the indexes of the volume and concentration of  financial  flows amount to unequivocal indicators: A rise in them  unequivocally indicates easier banking expansion in the region  in question and, consequently, there is a direct correlation  between their value and the value of the resultant index.    However, we encounter the first exception right there.  Understandably, the comparatively low number of branches is  predicated on the effect of various counteracting  factors--difficult climatic and geographic conditions,  inadequately developed infrastructure, shortage of cadres,  paternalistic stance of the local authorities, and so on.    It is also understandable that, in principle, the negative  influence of any of these factors may be overcome by making  financial outlays. A bank that incurs such outlays and overcomes  the counteracting factors will gain an exceptionally favorable  position, virtually that of a monopoly in the region in  question. This is precisely the kind of situation about which  they say that "Paris is well worth a mass."    For a bank that is prepared to incur the aforementioned  outlays, it is the relatively small rather than the large number  of branches registered in the region that is the sign of  comparative attractiveness of the region (naturally, all other  conditions being equal).    The correlation between the index of the number of branches  and the comparative index of attractiveness of conditions for  banking operations is also inverse rather than direct.    The index of the proportion of nonfinancial operations,  which  describes the depth of specialization in the banking system and  thus the quality of its development, should also be considered  an "ambiguous" indicator.    On one hand, to most banks a high level of development of  the  banking system offers extensive potential for finding their own  "ecological niche" and enhances the attractiveness of a region.  For these banks, the correlation between the proportion of  nonfinancial operations and the resultant index is inverse.    On the other hand, banks that are capable of not just taking  advantage of the results of a high development of the banking  system but also of acting as locomotives of this development  will gain the greatest advantage precisely in the course of  penetrating regions with a low level of specialization of  banking institutions (of course, all other conditions being  equal). They have an opportunity to shape the banking system of  the region "to their specifications" from the very beginning and  to ensure their leading role in the region for a long time to  come.    In the present work, we proceed from the most typical case  whereby a bank establishing branches sets the goal of taking  advantage of already existing conditions for operations rather  than purposefully transforming them. Given this strategy of  establishing branches, the correlation between the indexes of  the volume and concentration of financial flows, as well as the  index of the number of branches, and the resultant comparative  index of attractiveness for banking operations is direct, and  between the index of the proportion of nonfinancial operations  and the resultant index--inverse.    Accordingly, the comparative index of attractiveness of  conditions for banking operations amounts to a geometric mean of  the first three indexes and a value inverse to the fourth  index.    However, we do not rule out the possibility that banks  subscribing to a different approach to the establishment of  branches will turn to the present work. We are including in  Table 1 provided below not only the resultant indicator but also  all the base indicators used to compute it in order to give such  banks an opportunity to modify the calculations made by us in  keeping with the needs of their organizations.    Therefore, the table in a way amounts to a construction set  proceeding from which each manager may independently calculate  various scenarios of policy concerning branches.    Table 1.

The higher the index of comparative conditions for banking operations, the more  favorable these conditions are, and the more promising the region under consideration is from  the point of view of establishing branches.   Note 2. As the table suggests, worse than average conditions for banking operations have  developed in most regions. The reason is found in the concentration of banks in Moscow, which  has caused a gap in the level of development of the banking system and, accordingly,  conditions for banking operations that have developed in these few areas and those in the  entire remaining territory of Russia.    <H5>  II. Regional Dynamics of Development of the Banking System </H5> <H3>  2.1. Quarterly Dynamics of the Comparative Index of  Attractiveness of Conditions for Banking Operations in the  Economic Regions of Russia </H3>   The assumption that the conditions for economic operations  in  various regions would gradually become uniform as market  relations develop was one of the cornerstones of the economic  reform. The development of many processes tracked by official  statistics in 1992 and 1993, in particular in the areas of price  setting and the incomes of the population, on the whole  confirmed this hypothesis, which made it possible to voice  suppositions about the broader extent of its applicability.    However, even calculations of the comparative index of  conditions for banking operations broken down by economic  regions, which level differences between individual territories  to a considerable degree, at the very least fail to support this.    This is visible to the naked eye in the table given below.  The use of the most basic statistical methods paints a more  detailed picture: The standard deviation from the mean value of  the index, which fell in the second quarter, grew in the first  and especially the third quarters, and as of 1 October  considerably exceeded the level at the beginning of the year.    At the same time, the attractiveness of conditions for  banking operations declined steadily, quarter after quarter, in  the Northern Region and (beginning with the second quarter) the  Central-Chernozem Region. Moscow and the Urals Region, in which  the comparative index exceeded the average Russian level, were  the most attractive from the point of view of embarking on  banking activities. Despite the overall downward trend, the  growth of this index was registered in Moscow and the Far East  during the first three quarters of 1993.    At the same time, the growth of differentiation in the  conditions for banking operations in the various regions  testifies to the emergence of both "financial centers" and  hopeless and unpromising "financial boondocks" in Russia. The  development is so uneven that the territories in question may be  adjacent within the framework of the same economic region.    As far as the government is concerned, this, like any  strengthening of disparities in the development of various  regions, testifies to the need to make new efforts aimed at  providing uniform conditions for economic operations and  preserving the territorial integrity of Russia.    As far as the commercial banks are concerned, an increase in  the disparity of the development of territories and regional  differentiation in conditions for banking operations means that  the need for preliminary estimates and for projecting such  conditions will increase (at any rate in the foreseeable  future), as will the "price of a mistake."

The higher the index of comparative conditions for banking operations,  the more favorable these conditions are, and the more promising the region  under consideration is from the point of view of establishing branches.   Note 2. The index of comparative conditions for banking operations as of 1  October 1993 is different from that given in Table 1 because in Table 2 the  results of calculations by simplified methods are given (since some of the  statistical information for previous periods turned out to be inaccessible).    <H3>  2.2. Quarterly Dynamics of the Assets of the Banking System  of Russia in Real Terms by Economic Region </H3>   Both enthusiasts who welcome the rapid development of the  banking system of Russia and individuals who talk profusely  about the excessive development of "speculative" capital or the  need to reduce the money supply in real terms in order to  restrict the growth of prices would benefit from learning about  a reduction in the assets of commercial banks in real terms  (adjusted for the level of inflation) in 1993.    As the table given below indicates, the reduction in  question  has proceeded in an extremely uneven manner in terms of both  time and territories. In one-third of the economic regions of  Russia--Northern, Northwestern, Volga, and North Caucasus--this  reduction, which is indicative of the retrogression of the local  banking system, is continuous and systematic in nature (which,  however, in and of itself does not necessarily rule out the  opportunity for the emergence of new financial centers in the  territories of some of these regions).    It is notable that, paradoxical as it might be, a  growth of assets in real terms was registered in 1993  during periods of high rates of inflation. In the  second quarter, when the growth of prices slowed down,  assets in real terms fell by almost one-fourth. The  dependence in question is an important illustration of the fact  that with inflation at an average level, business activity (of  which the value of assets in real terms is an indirect  indication) grows with a higher level of prices and drops with a  lower level. Therefore, moderate inflation acts, in a way, as a  "booster" of business activity under the described conditions.    With this in view, it is possible to conjecture that a  certain hardening of financial policy implemented in the fourth  quarter of 1993 will bring about yet another reduction in assets  in real terms. At the same time, an increase in the money supply  after the New Year, which was virtually unavoidable because of  the aggravation of the nonpayments problem and the growth of  social tensions, will most likely cause not only an acceleration  of the growth of prices but also a rise in business activity in  the first quarter of 1994. According to available estimates, by  1 April 1994 this rise may bring about a restoration of the  level of assets in real terms as of the beginning or even end of  the first quarter of 1993.    A comparison of data in the two provided tables shows that  the growth of assets in real terms compared to the previous  period, or the growth of the nominal assets of commercial bank  outpacing inflation, is accompanied by the reinforcement of  territorial differentiation in the conditions for banking  operations. This is due to the fact that financial centers  accumulate the bulk of the increment of monetary funds in real  terms or, in other words, business activity grows primarily in  financial centers that have considerably more developed  production and, particularly important, financial infrastructure  than other regions of the country.

Quarterly Dynamics of Assets of the Banking System of  Russia by Area </H3>   The indicator of dynamics of bank assets broken down by  economic region is only significant in forming a general  picture. A high degree of generalization ensures the clarity  which is necessary to this end, but also renders the use of this  indicator to solve specific problems virtually meaningless.  After all, each economic region includes territories with the  most varied conditions for banking operations; as has been shown  above, the development of market relations does not weaken but,  on the contrary, strengthens existing differentiation (at any  rate, at the present stage of development).    The dynamics of assets in real terms broken down by area are  of practical significance in working out the policy of banks  concerning branches. These dynamics complicate the perception of  the overall picture but make it possible to track changes in the  situation in each territory taken separately.    The assets of banks in real terms increased only in six  areas  out of the 77 observed, and in another eight areas the drop in  assets was smaller than the average Russian level. Therefore,  only in 14 areas out of 77 did conditions emerge which favored  the development of the banking system.    From among the rest, we should note 40 areas in which a  systematic fall in bank assets in real terms was registered  quarter after quarter. The distribution of these stagnant  territories among economic regions appears significant:    --in the Northern Region--four areas out of five (80  percent);    --in the Northwestern Region--two areas out of five (40  percent);    --in the Central Region--eight areas out of 13 (62 percent);    --in the Volga-Vyatka Region--three areas out of five (60  percent);    --in the Central-Chernozem Region--two areas out of five (40  percent);    --in the Volga Region--six areas out of eight (75 percent);    --in the Northern Caucasus Region--eight areas out of nine  (89 percent);    --in the Urals Region--four areas out of seven (57 percent);    --in the West Siberian Region--two areas out of seven (29  percent);    --in the East Siberian Region--one area out of six (17  percent);    --and finally in the Far Eastern Region--not one (out of  seven).    However, Voronezh Oblast, in which a genuine banking  disaster  occurred, stands out even against this background of depressed  development. Assets in real terms, which grew by a factor of 1.5  in the first quarter, dropped by a factor of more than five in  the following half of the year.  <H3>  2.4. Complementing the Comparative Index of Attractiveness  of Conditions for Banking Operations With the Indicator of the  Dynamics of Assets in Real Terms </H3>   The dynamics of bank assets in real terms give us an idea of  comparative conditions for the development of banking  institutions in the territories under review; in this capacity,  such dynamics may be taken into account in determining the  attractiveness of these territories for embarking on banking  operations in them.    The sharp quarterly fluctuations of bank assets in real  terms  which have been registered in many regions while the general  development trend was pronounced prompt us to use periods of  time longer than one quarter, looking to changes that occur over  at least three quarters rather than one.    In the table below, the standard comparative index of  attractiveness of conditions for banking operations is  complemented with the index of changes in bank assets in real  terms in the last three quarters.    The latter index introduces a dynamic component into the  analysis and, as a comparison of results shows, virtually makes  it possible to proceed in the course of analysis without  calculating the comparative indexes of attractiveness of  conditions for banking operations in the preceding periods  (because the inertia of the rest of its components is rather  high).    The index of changes in bank assets in real terms shows how  strong and dynamic local banks are. As a rule, considerable  reductions in assets in real terms testify to "outside"  expansion which is strangling local banks; in this case, a bank  penetrating the market will no longer have to compete with local  banks but with more aggressive and compounded [as published]  banks which are ahead of it. Only a very strong bank may try to  capture their market. For a majority, entering the "domestic  market" of local banks is within reach; even if the latter banks  are strong enough to carry out their own branch programs, their  attention is, as a rule, riveted to the regions of expansion and  is weakened with regard to the territories of their location.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

Certain Prospects for Development of the Banking System  of Russia </H3> <H3>  1994 Promises to Become the Year of the "Great Repartition"  of the Russian Market for Banking Services </H3>   For now, it will be a repartition solely among Russian  banks.    Extensive redistribution of clients among banks will  apparently become the most conspicuous direction of the  development of the banking sphere of Russia in 1994. A  tremendous number of large enterprises are still serviced by  cumbersome and comparatively inefficient structures such as  Rosselkhozbank [Russian Agricultural Bank], Promstroybank  [Industrial Construction Bank], as well as the banks of former  sectoral ministries which are in an intermediate position. As a  rule, settlements are slow at banks of this kind, fees for  services are high, and the scope of services provided is narrow.  However, the main point is that the "state-affiliated" banks  have preserved the noncommercial style of operation and  demonstrate no ability to change it.    Undoubtedly, as the market develops, inconveniences  associated with this situation will become increasingly  perceptible to clients, and will increasingly outweigh the sole  advantage of the structures in question--easier access to state  financing (including in the form of various preferential loans).  This will cause a considerable number of enterprises possessing  respectable financial resources to be "pushed" into the embrace  of genuinely commercial banks in the immediate future, even if  the banks are completely passive; this "push" is going to be  protracted and massive. Neither the modernization of the  present-day state-affiliated monsters nor the creation of their  own banks by enterprises will be able to restrict this process  in a major way.    For the purposes of a genuine conversion to commercial  operations, the "state-affiliated" banks are too closely  involved with the distribution of state resources. The issue of  attracting clients is not a life or death issue for them; to a  considerable degree, these banks (for example, Promstroybank)  associate their prospects with hopeless attempts to restore the  prereform past.    At present, the creation of new banks is increasingly  difficult. A shortage of skilled personnel with integrity,  mounting competition, and mainly the absence of guaranteed  profits will make seeking the services of already successfully  operating banks increasingly attractive compared to the creation  of a proprietary bank. Let us recall that the banking "boom" of  1992 and the first half of 1993 was due to a catastrophic  decline of the ruble against the dollar, as a result of which it  sufficed for a bank to acquire "self-growing" foreign exchange  assets to secure stable high profits. In the second half of 1993  the process of creation of banks was given a new impetus due to  quite a number of mostly trading companies reaching a new stage  of development. This impetus has virtually been depleted by now  because the number and, most importantly, financial resources of  large companies are already restricted by the market nearing  saturation.    This is why there are grounds to believe that 1994 will be  the last year of "explosive" growth in the number of banks. A  "critical mass" will finally be reached in that year, and the  further process of development in the banking system will most  likely take the path of increasing the number of branches.  Attacks on trust companies, which are beginning to usurp some  banking functions, as well as the unsuccessful struggle of the  Central Bank against small banks performing only an  insignificant proportion of banking operations, may be viewed as  early symptoms of the forthcoming sharp complication and  internal stratification of the banking system of Russia.    As has been said above, such complexity and stratification  will be accompanied by a mass repartition of the domestic market  of banking services. The capture of clients by aggressive  commercial banks from state-affiliated structures will be the  main content of this process in 1994. However, it is estimated  that the feast of Russian commercial "sharks" on the carcass of  the sickly whale of the state banking system will not last  long--no longer than 1.5 years. Later, foreign banks will break  into the Russian market, which are now being contained by the  absence of "threshold" stability rather than by state measures;  Russian banks that do not manage to ensure support from large  foreign structures, as Inkombank has, will experience major  difficulties.</p>

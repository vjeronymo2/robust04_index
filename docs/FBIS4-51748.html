			<p>BFN     [Text] On 30 April, Iranian President Akbar H. Rafsanjani  hosted a banquet in honor of President Le Duc Anh and his  entourage in Tehran.    In his speech at the banquet, President Rafsanjani stressed:  The Iranian people understand and admire the Vietnamese people  for their protracted and arduous struggle in the past. It  serves as a good example for the Iranian people. Indeed, the  Vietnamese people's determination and victory have greatly  encouraged other nations to continue their struggle. Vietnam  has won admiration and respect from countries throughout the  world. Today, like other nations, Iran highly appraises the  Vietnamese leaders' intelligence and creativity in carrying out  the national reconstruction program and in implementing the  renovation process.    We are convinced that Vietnam will continue to score ever  greater achievements. People in Third World countries have  taken Vietnam as a good example. I am convinced that through  cooperation in various fields, we will be able to strengthen  bilateral relations to meet the aspirations of our two peoples.    The current visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran by the  Vietnamese delegation will create a favorable condition for  further exchanges of experiences and views. I believe that if  we do not enhance our cooperation, best results will not be  attained in collaboration between the South-South and Third  World countries.    Following President Rafsanjani's speech, President Le Duc  Anh  delivered a reply statement.</p>

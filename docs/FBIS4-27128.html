			<p>BFN     [Text] An international conference on lifting the unjust  blockade on Iraq opened its meetings yesterday in the Malaysian  capital, Kuala Lumpur. The conference is organized by  governmental figures and organizations under the patronage of  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed.    Abdul Ghani bin Othman, the Malaysian minister of youth and  sports and representative of the Malaysian prime minister,  delivered a speech at the conference. He asserted that there  are no longer any justifications for the blockade, noting the  need for the international community and the United Nations to  work honestly to end the injustice done to Iraq.    The Malaysian prime minister's representative also conveyed  the prime minister's greetings to the leadership and patient,  steadfast people of Iraq.    Latif Nusayyif Jasim, the chairman of the [Iraqi]  Friendship,  Peace, and Solidarity Organization, gave a speech in which he  said that Iraq was chosen as a target of aggression for many  reasons, primarily because it represents the impregnable eastern  gate of the Arab nation. He added that Iraq enjoys significant  political, economic, and military weight and has a policy that  is independent from the Western octopus. This is in addition to  the fact that it champions the causes and aspirations of Third  World nations, and all other nations that care about their  independence and sovereignty.    He added that the reasons cited by the influential states at  the Security Council to maintain the unjust blockade against our  people are gone. Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations toward  these resolutions, particularly Resolution 687, Paragraph 22,  which stipulates that Iraq is free to export its oil and have  trade and commercial transactions and exchange goods with the  world.    Latif Nusayyif Jasim added that the UN Special Commission  has  corroborated the fact that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations.  He added that after Iraq implemented its commitments per  Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and in view of its cooperation  with UN committees, some permanent members of the Security  Council are now highlighting the need to lift this inhuman  blockade. In addition, there are thousands of governmental and  nongovernmental figures and organizations that call for ending  the suffering of the people of Iraq as a result of the blockade  that has persisted for far too long, since there are no longer  any justifications for it.</p>

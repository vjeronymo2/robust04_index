			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: The Tate puts on new clothes - William Packer questions the gallery's current rehang policy Early every year since 1990, the Tate has paraded itself, proud and elegant, in its new finery: which is not to suggest for one moment, pace the poor Emperor in the old story, that the exercise is become a charade and self-deceptive sham. The clothes are there all right, intriguing and fetching by turns. And if they should seem at times a trifle skimpy, and just a little more see-through than before, is that not but the very latest thing of modern fashion? The debate, of course, remains as hot and furious as ever, for one man's chic is another's frumpiness, or misjudgment, or active indecency. For my part I find a great deal to be said in favour of this year's rehang, as before. Nicholas Serota's great achievement as incoming director, as he was in 1990 when this rolling programme of rehanging began, was to reclaim and celebrate the Tate Gallery itself, as architecture at the service of art. We had simply forgotten how good a building the Tate really is at its fin-de-siecle heart, ample, generous and confident in its purposes. That first thrill of surprised recognition remains, undiminished. No matter that this time the sculpture halls contain Rodin at one end and the conceptual minimalism of Carl Andre and his friends, bricks and all, at the other. To move through from the bustle of the entrance lobby and out into that high, long, central nave is to experience and savour one of London's most particular architectural experiences. And while the feeling may not be sustained at quite such a pitch of magnificence, sustained it is in kind through the sequence of the older rooms, each one hung with exquisite consideration, quite as much for the room itself as for the work to be presented. Only with the drab functional walls of the 1970s extension does there come any sense of anti-climax, and even here it is hardly for want of effort on the part of the directorate. Every room is well presented within the terms it sets itself. Most rooms contain particular works, often unshown these many years, of remarkable interest and quality. Exception may be taken to the what of it, but surely not in any fairness to the way of its being shown. It is the irony of the situation that Mr Serota has now contrived for himself, that it is indeed quite as much the way as the what of it, for which, fairly or not, he stands generally rebuked. The nub is neatly put on his behalf, and with unconscious irony, by the sponsor, BP, in its introductory statement to the Brief Guide to these New Displays. 'From the outset, the purpose of our partnership with the Tate Gallery has been to enable many more people to see works of art which would otherwise remain in storage . . . the full range of both the national collection of British art from 1500 to the present day and of international 20th century art (has thus been) more fully exposed than ever before.' Up to a point, Lord Copper. The real issue is what the Tate is, or should be, or could be, and it has clearly been Mr Serota's intention from the outset to make no bones about the problems he faces. For the Tate as it is presently constituted is riven by stresses and contradictions of purpose and policy that are all but irreconcilable, and all to be addressed on evidently inadequate resources. That first rehang, in 1990, was quite as much a political as a curatorial statement, as though to say: here is a gallery into which we can only put so much, if we are to show things as they should be shown: and here is a collection with which we could do so much, if only . . . It is an argument with which I have a great deal of sympathy. The Tate has magnificent collections which are inadequately presented not by any professional dereliction or neglect, but simply because anything better is impossible. The wonder is that they are presented at all, let alone with the manifest care, imagination and commitment that are the character of this present 'inadequacy'. But how can the Tate hold at once the national collection of British art, that alone would more than fill the present site, and of the art of the modern period, into which the British contribution must be integrated, and of contemporary art, in all its forms, that must be monitored and collected on the wing? The point was well made, and made, and made, and is now made again - which is where sympathy begins, if not to fail, at least to moderate. For what was at the outset a fine and necessary demonstration begins now to seem indulgent. Whatever its strains and stresses, the Tate remains the repository of a collection and national resource that for three years now and at least one to come, has not been available to the public in any practical and permanent sense. What we have had instead has been an extended sequence of special exhibitions, beautifully chosen and arranged on all manner of themes, that is a wonderful bonus for the frequent and specialist visitor, but quite arbitrary for any newcomer. The historic British collection up to 1900 is now confined to the first nine rooms of 30. From room 10, the paintings spread ever fewer on the wall, to confound the argument that space is at a premium. Everywhere there are memorable and lovely things, a magnificent double portrait by Fantin-Latour in room 10, Cedric Morris's eggs in room 20. There were different delights last year and the year before, which I dearly wish were there still, and I shall regret it when this year's works, too, soon disappear. Last year I entered a plea, not for the reversal of the rehang policy, but rather for its moderation and gradual consolidation around a re-established core. No change there: and in again taking the general principle, I have had no space to treat the particular displays, splendid, controversial, infuriating as by turn they are. I hope to return at least to some of them in due course. The New Displays at the Tate Gallery are supported by British Petroleum</p>

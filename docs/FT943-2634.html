			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Vegetarian food 'terrorism' - Giles MacDonogh, a committed carnivore, leafs through some veggie cookbooks A couple of years ago I received a copy of a letter sent out to secondary school teachers by the Vegetarian Society. Its aim was to encourage teachers to get their pupils to give up meat. It struck me as being particularly pernicious; an attempt to set children against their parents. I do not doubt that similar letters have been sent to primary school teachers, who exercise considerable power when it comes to the infantile mind. Beside me is a pile of recently published books on vegetarian food. Two of the authors abandoned meat-eating in infancy. Rose Elliot (The Classic Vegetarian Cookbook, Dorling Kindersley, Pounds 14.99) saw her mother manhandle a fish when she was three, and never ate meat again. Peter Cox (Encyclopedia of Vegetarian Living. Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99) stopped at two. It is hardly a sign of precocity to hate meat as a child: 'I don't like that mummy,' is what they generally say. Left to their own devices children would subsist on sweets and crisps. Nor are they fond of greens. Even vegetarian parents are reduced to ruses to get their children to eat vegetables. Carnivorous parents do the same with meat. For Peter Cox vegetarianism has all the appearance of a particularly austere religious order. This self-abnegation is one of its least attractive characteristics - along with the sanctimonious tone adopted by some of its converts. Austere men are often dangerous: Cromwell, Robespierre, Mussolini and Hitler, for example. The first two derived no joy from food, the last two were vegetarians. Hitler's vegetarianism is supposed to have been influenced by his fondness for animals. 'The only two creatures who have remained loyal to me,' he sobbed in the Bunker, 'are Eva Braun and my (Alsatian) bitch Blondi.' That didn't prevent him from trying out the cyanide first on Blondi before using it on Eva and himself. Cox and Hitler share a trait: they both believe the future belongs to vegetarians. 'I have news for meat-eaters,' Hitler told his tablemates, 'in the future everyone will be vegetarian.' Cox is ready for this ugly comparison. He cites a number of vegetarian authors who deny Hitler's membership of the order. Hitler is supposed to have expressed a fondness for Bavarian sausages. This proves little: Hitler always said his favourite composer was Wagner, when in reality it was the Hungarian Lehar. He had to tend to his Germanic image and few Germans, then or now, would have understood a hater of sausages. Cox then cites a passage of Oswald Spengler and 'rests his case'. But Spengler hated the Nazis and wanted nothing to do with them. Cox agrees that vegetarianism is not a western tradition. There are plenty of vegetarian cultures around the world. I ate a Jain meal in India and positively enjoyed south Indian vegetarian food. But here in the west we neither worship nor despise animals, we simply eat them. Indeed, I wondered whether Cox loves animals as much as he says given his desire to turn cats and dogs into vegetarians. What vegetarians have failed to do so far is convincingly to adapt vegetarianism to the western tradition; to create a viable gastronomy. Rose Elliot might propose a gratin dauphinois, but for a Frenchman this is a dish requiring some slivers of rare lamb. It is not a meal in itself. For Judith Wills (Slim and Healthy Vegetarian, Conran Octopus, Pounds 16.99) vegetarianism is a means to an end: slimness. By slim she means more attractive. But giving up meat for vanity's sake is a double-edged sword: you become more attractive only to other vegetarians. It is pretty hard to tuck into a piece of meat with a vegetarian; it is a bit like having a drink with a teetotaller, or lighting up in front of a reformed smoker. Both Christine McFadden (New Vegetarian Food, Salamander, Pounds 12.99) and Annie Bell (Evergreen, Bantam, Pounds 16.99) are refreshingly unwilling to proselytise, and the latter laudably tells us that vegetarian food should be 'fresh, sensual and alive . . . Being a vegetarian should not automatically mean a denial of pleasurable foods, or an acceptance of unpalatable ones.' Sadly neither author gives us much to chew on; and Christine McFadden's language is unpalatable. For her 'minted', 'parsleyed' and 'herbed' are adjectives; and she confuses the adjective 'roast' with the past participle of the verb to roast: 'roasted'. Annie Somerville (Fields of Greens, Bantam, Pounds 17.99) reminds us that Californian vegetarianism is still inspired by the flower-power Buddhism of the 1960s. Which leaves the food terrorist Peter Cox. Not for nothing are his initials PC: vegetarianism is 'the world's healthiest, kindest and most environmentally-sound lifestyle'. Cox looks forward to the day when 'animal exploitation and slaughter are as obsolete as sending children up chimneys'. We meat-eaters have little to commend us: obese and unhealthy; cruel and insensitive, even our excrement smells nastier than vegetarian excrement. In Cox's view of history Adam and Eve only began to eat meat once they had left Paradise. He forgets they were expelled for eating an apple. You might look for a long time to find anything appetising in the pages of Cox. This is not a book about pleasure, nor does he care for the freedom of the individual to choose his own way. He tilts directly at one of our great claims to civilisation: the western table and the way it has evolved over the past 300 years. Cox suggests that as good primates we are not natural meat-eaters. But we are not good primates, else we would still be living in trees. We are sophisticated animals in both the good and the bad sense of the word. Western man lives to eat. Refreshingly few of us are reduced to eating to live.</p>

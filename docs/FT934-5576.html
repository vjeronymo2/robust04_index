			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (27): Standardisation, a two-edged sword - Consultant's critique / Polygram and DHL In a stable operating environment, standardisation offers benefits via economies of scale and reduced re-training. This is balanced by loss of flexibility. Standards can be applied to inputs, processes or outputs. For word processing, input standards would cover such things as the layout of documents, house styles and so on. Process standards would cover the software package used and output standards would apply to the file formats used. POLYGRAM has chosen to standardise processes and outputs by insisting on the use of Wordperfect only. Mr John Higgins, the group's director of information technology, claims that this gives massive savings. It could equally be argued that companies buying in the quantities claimed by Polygram can also obtain considerable discounts, providing similar scope for savings. A commitment to a single vendor has advantages but also carries risks. Once a supplier knows that a customer is locked in by an agreement, the balance of power shifts subtly. Many large companies deliberately avoid such agreements in order to keep vendors on their toes. In a changing software market, a commitment to a sole supplier can prevent a company from taking advantage of new software trends. Wordperfect was slow in coming outwith a Windows version of its software. Indeed, Microsoft was able to tempt away Wordperfect users by offering a migration path on to its Word for Windows package. Mr Higgins clearly believes in keeping tight control, though obviously this does impose extra costs of monitoring and verification. Staff entering Polygram who are already very familiar with a different package will need to be re-trained. DHL has a more flexible approach and does not appear to standardise as much. They admit that they lose some formatting when transferring documents via the Uniplex system. If the object is to increase connectivity, it is usually better to standardise on outputs - such as a standard file format, rather than the processes. Both companies could simply insist on a common file format (say, the Wordperfect format) which all packages must support to be approved. Most of the leading word processors can read each other's formats. It would be sensible to select one that all the software can use and then insist that everyone generates that format. Given that the aim is to produce readable documents, it might even be better to move the focus on to presentation. I have seen far too many documents that are poorly laid out or which contain spelling errors.</p>

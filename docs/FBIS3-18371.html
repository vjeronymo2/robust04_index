			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Wolfgang Gast report: "Border Eavesdrops for the Office"] </F>   [Text] Berlin -- The Federal Border Guard [BGS] is at  least to some extent an unknown quantity. This applies  particularly to the unit that bears the name "Communications  Group," which, it was recently revealed, has been cooperating  with the Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the  Constitution [BfV]. In the draft amendment to the BGS Law, the  government has admitted for the first time that the  Communications Group has been carrying out eavesdropping  operations for the Cologne-based bumblers as part of  "interagency assistance." This concerns a practice that is to  receive a new legal basis as a result of the amendment. One of  the justifications advanced in the government draft is that BGS  "support for the BfV in the field of communications technology"  is used in uncovering secret service communications activities  being conducted by other countries.    However, it is also of significance in the surveillance of  foreign terrorist groups. The BfV needs the BGS in order to  establish whether right- or left-wing extremists groups are  seeking "to intercept security agency radio communications and  identify frequencies." That is apparently only half the truth.    People who are well informed about the BGS report that their  eavesdropping operations are not confined to requests from the  BfV. The "Communications Group," which comes under the authority  of the Border Security Presidium West in Bonn, is also supposed  to conduct operations of its own -- it is also supposed to work  for the Federal German Intelligence Service. The results of the  operations are not only passed on to the appropriate services in  Pullach and Cologne, but are also used by the BGS itself. This  means that in practice, the BGS violates the separation of the  police and secret services, which is rooted in the constitution,  on almost on a daily basis.    Within the BGS itself, the "Communications Group" is  considered an autonomous unit. The technical facilities of the  group, which is based in Swisttal-Heimerzheim, are described as  being very modern and eavesdropping operations could be  conducted "as far as the Urals." The terse justification is  "border security operations." So, some questions remain open,  such as whether the BGS has recently started ensuring the  security of borders in the Urals.</p>

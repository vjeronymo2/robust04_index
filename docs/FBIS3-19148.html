			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jose-Antonio Ardanza, president of the </F> Spanish Basque Government, by Patrick Lopez in Paris; date not  given: "Ardanza: `The Regions Want More Power in Europe'"]    [Text] Jose-Antonio Ardanza, the president of the Spanish  Basque Government, is visiting Paris for the first time. He is  demanding a role for the regions in Europe, and wants to attract  French investors to his region.    [Lopez] On this first official visit you are surrounded by  ministers and businessmen. Is it not, however, a political  visit rather than an economic visit?    [Ardanza] This visit has three aims. The first is clearly  political, the second is economic, and our third aim is to  change the image of the Basque country. I tried to explain to  Rene Monory, the president of the French Senate, and to French  leaders the idea we have of our place in the Spanish state and  in Europe. I believe that, while we are close geographically,  the French political class does not really know us.    [Lopez] Are you not also trying to appear more European than  Spanish and trying to stress your importance in a Europe of the  regions, which is nonetheless a difficult exercise in France?    [Ardanza] Of course it is difficult (...). European  construction can only be achieved by abandoning some of the  sovereignty of the states. For the first time in its history,  this continent... is attempting a process of peaceful  unification. It is understandably slow (...). The dynamism  will be born within the states by the rise of regional movements  (...). I think that the regions deserve greater powers at the  European level.    [Lopez] Are you satisfied, as a Basque, with the stance  taken  by Madrid on the question of fishing rights in the context of  Norwegian entry into the European Union [EU]?    [Ardanza] It is normal that we should defend this sector of  activity which is important for us. In 1986, when we joined the  EC, we kept a low profile. Today, we have proved our respect of  democracy and our competence, and the Spanish Government has  been a driving force behind the European idea. Clearly, the  countries now applying for membership have some of the highest  incomes per inhabitant in the world and they fully intend,  through joining, to further improve their position. By  defending our fishing rights we want to put the brakes on the  implementation of a two-speed Europe with a rich north and an  increasingly poor south.    [Lopez] What were your plans when you came to Paris?    [Ardanza] What do we see on the geoeconomic level? In  addition to the north-south divide, is there not also an  East-West divide? Faced with development in the east, from  London to Lyons via the channel tunnel, and in the Mediterranean  from Genoa to Barcelona, the Atlantic fringe was going to be  marginalized. That is the purpose of our initiatives:  developing partnerships between the various regions of the  countries on this fringe, in particular to avoid having to take  a resigned attitude toward Brussels.    Second, France is our leading economic partner and we would  like to allay certain fears that your country's businessmen have  concerning the Basque country. The best recommendations come  from companies that have already set up in our region.    [Lopez] Is it to further attract them that you have granted  tax incentives?    [Ardanza] We have the same taxation powers as a state. In  the delicate industrial situation our region finds itself in, I  think it is quite normal to want to attract companies. We are  not the only ones using this type of incentive and I do not  think it is what people call fiscal dumping. It is also true  that the Basque state has always historically intervened in the  region's economy, but of course I would like the state to be as  least interventionist as possible. However, we have to  encourage companies to modernize by helping them financially and  sometimes by taking stakes in them.</p>

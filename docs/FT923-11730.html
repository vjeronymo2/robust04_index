			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Premium expected on GIO GIO Australia Holdings, the recently privatised insurance group, is expected to trade at a small premium when the shares are listed on the Australian stock exchange today. Brokers said GIO, formerly owned by the state government of New South Wales, would probably trade at a premium of about 20 cents to the flotation price of ADollars 2.40. Brokers had earlier suggested the shares would list at up to ADollars 2.90, but forecasts have been reduced in line with general weakness in the Australian market. The ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 890bn) flotation, the biggest privatisation in Australia, closed ADollars 1bn oversubscribed just 36 hours after it opened. More than 75 per cent of the 500m shares were sold to small investors in parcels of less than 5,000. GIO is expected to announce that it is to acquire SIO, formerly the state insurance office of Victoria, being sold by the state government. Southern Cross Airlines, which hopes to resurrect Compass Airlines next month, is expected to begin trading today at a discount to its flotation price of ADollars 0.50. The ADollars 50m Southern Cross flotation was 46 per cent undersubscribed, mainly because of worries about competition among airlines following deregulation of the domestic aviation market in October 1990. Compass, which has been acquired by Southern Cross, collapsed in December after losing a fare-cutting battle with government-owned Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia, owned by TNT and News Corporation. The relaunched Compass plans to concentrate on high frequency routes on Australia's eastern seaboard, initially using a fleet of five 142-seat MD-80 aircraft flying between six cities. Southern Cross has forecast a net loss of ADollars 7.75m for 1992-93, followed by a net profit of ADollars 13.23m in the following year.</p>

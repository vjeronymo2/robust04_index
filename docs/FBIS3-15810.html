			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic for Croatian </F> Radio from Moscow]    [Text] Mate Granic, vice president of the government of  the Republic of Croatia and minister for foreign affairs, met  his counterpart Andrey Kozyrev in the Russian capital this  afternoon. Following one hour of talks, the two ministers  addressed the media.    Kozyrev stressed that his country was in agreement with  other  international factors in its belief that the recent positive  climate surrounding the resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  crisis should be sustained. Minister Granic added that the  agenda of their talks included the Washington agreement and the  work of the expert commissions in Vienna.    He stressed that the negotiations ought to also include--in  addition to the Croats and Muslims--the third side, without  which it is impossible to reach a final solution either in  Bosnia-Herzegovina or in the entire region. According to  Granic, the interlocutors discussed the question of returning  Croatia's occupied areas under the full jurisdiction of our  state.    [Begin Granic recording] We regard the Russian Federation's  role as positive. We also appreciate Kozyrev's personal role,  as well as Mr. Churkin's, in these negotiations. We also expect  that negotiations with the third side will resume the moment the  present negotiations in Vienna are ended. [end record]    Replying to a number of questions raised by the media,  Russian Minister Kozyrev reiterated that his country has always  favored a global solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He also  expressed satisfaction with the fact that--following his talks  with Granic and earlier in talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina's Prime  Minister Silajdzic, who is also staying in Moscow--he has  received assurances that the Croatian-Muslim agreement is not to  the detriment of the third side.    He also said that no one was officially questioning the  internationally recognized borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia. The Russian minister noted that he had recently talked  to Radovan Karadzic about how to save the integrity of  Bosnia-Herzegovina under conditions of respect. It is the  peoples of that country who must decide on its state territory,  Kozyrev said.    Speaking about UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] role, he  added that Russia was in favor of continuing the mandate of the  blue helmets in the conflict areas. This can only be in support  of a political solution in the area of the former Yugoslavia.  Minister Granic endorsed this view by saying that within the  next few days Croatia would demand that the UN Security Council  reinforce the mandate of the blue helmets.    Following his talks with Minister Kozyrev, Granic went to a  working lunch with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special  envoy for the area of the former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin.</p>

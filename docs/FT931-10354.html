			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Merseyside will seek the same EC status as Corsica OFFICIALS from the five local authorities in Merseyside are pressing for the region to be made a special case for development by the European Commission because they say it is as economically weak as Corsica, Northern Ireland, the Scottish Highlands and Molise in southern Italy - and getting weaker. The officials want the EC to award the region with 'Objective 1' status so that it qualifies for large-scale investment of community funds over the next eight years. The money would be for economic development to counter 25 per cent male unemployment. Objective 1 status is reserved for the EC's weakest areas. These are defined as those that have a gross domestic product a head of only 75 per cent of the EC average over a three-year period. Merseyside's GDP a head fell to an average of 79 per cent of the EC average in 1989-90, the latest review period, from 86 per cent in the mid 1980s. The EC can award the status above the 75 per cent level in exceptional circumstances. This has already happened in Northern Ireland (currently at 76 per cent) and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (79 per cent). Although GDP a head in Merseyside is rising at present, the growth is at a slower rate than elsewhere in the community, hence the region is falling further behind. Almost one-third of manufacturing jobs in Merseyside were lost between 1979 and 1990. One in four men is now unemployed and overall employment is 70 per cent lower than the EC average and 50 per cent less than in the rest of the UK. Latest census data shows a 9 per cent drop in population between 1981 and 1991, against a rise of 2 per cent for the UK as a whole. Much of the migration away from the region is of skilled or adaptable younger people. The officials from the local authorities of Liverpool, Bootle, St Helens, Wirral and Sefton, say that forecasts for employment and population in the region to the end of the century suggest a greater decline than anywhere else in the UK. The situation is therefore projected to worsen. Objective 1 status is currently automatic for the whole of the Republic of Ireland (65 per cent), Portugal (55 per cent) and Greece (48 per cent). It also applies in Corsica and Molise - both 79 per cent - and Abruzzi, also in southern Italy, where regional GDP is 88 per cent of the EC average. The authority officials have made their case to the UK government, which is reviewing the amount of assistance given to the region. It is hoped that Merseyside's position will be considered by the EC's Council of Ministers in June.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Scheme to ease M25 congestion THE Department of Transport will spend Pounds 10m on experimental speed limits aimed at smoothing traffic flows on congested sections of the M25 London orbital motorway. The scheme will take about two years to set up. Indicators between junctions 11 and 15 will light up telling drivers to reduce their speeds to 60mph or 50mph in heavy traffic. The department says similar schemes in The Netherlands and Germany have eased traffic flows and cut accidents.</p>

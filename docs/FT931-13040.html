			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: BA A cosy chat and a cup of tea seem to have thawed the frosty relations between Mr Richard Branson and Sir Colin Marshall. Although Virgin may yet press ahead with a claim against BA for up to Pounds 20m in lost revenues, the airline appears keen to call an end to the time-consuming dispute. The alternative prospect of convoluted anti-trust legislation in the US has little appeal. BA may thus struggle through without much further embarrassment. Shareholders can then get back to worrying full-time about BA's sickly passenger figures.</p>

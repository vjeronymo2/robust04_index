			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Heavy load for directors  -In a Nutshell A recent surge of legislation has multiplied the responsibilities of directors and increased the chances that they will incur personal liability, says accountants firm Kidsons Impey. Acting with honesty and integrity may not be enough to ensure directors do not fall foul of civil and criminal law. In a 22-page booklet, Kidsons Impey sets out the responsibilities, looks at director's liabilities, how they should handle transactions with their companies and possible protective measures. Kidsons Impey says smaller company directors are most at risk when they do not have adequate financial information and stresses the need for up-to-date management accounts.

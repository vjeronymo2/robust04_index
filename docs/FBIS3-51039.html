Most Government Secretariat  officials, including outgoing Secretary Patrocinio Gonzalez  Garrido, were in attendance. Carpizo noted that given the  current situation in Mexico as well as the situation in the  months ahead, the values of dialogue, concord, and strict  enforcement of the law will guide and set the tone of his work.  He defined himself as a man who believes in the law, dialogue,  reason, truth, calmness, and firmness. The new official said he  is not a party man, explaining this is not the time for speeches  but for action. He indicated he is going to the Government  Secretariat not to renounce all the things he believes in but to  cooperate for the good of Mexico.    [Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish  at  1300 GMT on 11 January, in its "Good Morning From Mexico"  newscast, broadcasts a similar report that includes a recording  of Jorge Carpizo in which Carpizo states: "My only commitment is  with Mexico. I do not have a political party. I have accepted  this position with the sole objective of serving my country and  the president of the Republic. This is no time for speeches,  but for deeds. I am a man of principle and loyalty."]    Carpizo asked society and its political and social  organizations for their support. He stressed he would need it.  During an interview, he indicated he hoped society and the news  media will give him the time necessary to solve the problem in  Chiapas State.    Also, Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido said the president agreed  to his resignation. With a broken voice and watery eyes, he also  asked the Chiapas Congress to change the conditions of his leave  in order to withdraw from political activities following 42  years of service. His former aides stood up and gave Patrocinio  Gonzalez a long and hearty ovation. Eloy Cantu, the federal  government's official spokesman and Government Secretariat's  senior official in Chiapas, attended the ceremony.

His image as a human rights defender adds a  major element to his new post at this time.    In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the Chiapas Congress reaffirmed Elmar  Setzer Marseiller as acting governor. This happened after former  Government Secretary Gonzalez Garrido sent a letter to the  Chiapas Congress requesting an extension of his leave as Chiapas  governor. Diego Valadez took office as attorney general of the  Republic.    [Begin recording of second unidentified reporter] Diego  Valadez took office as attorney general in a ceremony attended  by almost all Attorney General's Office personnel. Jorge Carpizo  McGregor, the new government secretary, thanked the Attorney  General's Office officials for their cooperation and work, and  he asked them to give the same support to Valadez so he can  achieve his goals as head of the Attorney General's Office.    Valadez pledged to consolidate the efforts of the former  attorney general to defend human rights and to strengthen the  rule of law. Valadez has an extensive record, having held major  academic, government, and diplomatic posts. Previously, he held  the post of federal district attorney general. [end recording]</p>

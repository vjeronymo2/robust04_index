			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Rob Lowe, 24, denied in court records that he seduced a 16-year-old girl who  allegedly taped a sexual encounter with him, and the girl's father said his  "very modest" daughter never intended to blackmail Lowe for $2 million. Court  records unsealed Wednesday at the request of lawyers for the Atlanta  Journal-Constitution also indicate Lowe's lawyers tried to "reach a compromise  settlement" eight months after the alleged incident. The girl's mother filed  suit May 12 against the actor seeking unspecified civil damages for the alleged  seduction of her daughter, who turned 17 last month. Prosecutors are  investigating possible criminal charges against Lowe for exploiting a minor.  CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

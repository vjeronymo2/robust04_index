			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial government recently held an  executive meeting to call for stabilizing the prices of grain  and oil and guaranteeing market supply.    Liaoning Province reaped a bumper grain harvest in 1993,  having a large stock of paddy rice. However, affected by the  rise of grain prices in south China, and plus our province's  failure in adopting a timely macroeconomic regulation and  control measure, the prices of grain and oil, particularly the  prices of rice and soybean, began to fluctuate. The masses of  people showed strong reaction to this. In order to stabilize the  market prices, the provincial government executive meeting put  forward important measures for stabilizing grain and oil prices  and for guaranteeing market supply.    1. Regard the efforts in grasping grain and nonstaple foods  production as an important measure for guaranteeing supply and  stabilizing fluctuations and attend to this work realistically  and successfully. Prior to the end of this month, we must keep  the prices of grain and oil stable. The price of rice should be  reduced to below 1.7 yuan per kg; the cost of rice which is  lower than this price must not be raised. The price of soybean  must be controlled at below 7 yuan per kg, and the price of  first-grade white flour must be controlled at below 1.7 yuan per  kg.    2. Strengthen management over the grain market,  realistically  attend to the processing and delivery of rice, and guarantee  that the market will not run short of rice. Continued efforts  should be made to grasp the grain and oil purchasing work and  the purchase of grain for delivering to other localities so as  to have a sufficient source of grain. Grain Departments should  go deeply to grain depots and peasant households to conduct  investigation and study and try to find out the province's grain  reserve and the amount of grain in the hands of peasants as  quickly as possible in an effort to provide an accurate basis  for the overall regulation and control of grain. Financial and  banking departments should guarantee funds for grain purchase;  state grain shops should play a role as the main channel, sell  grain according to the price tag, and must not raise the grain  price.    3. Strengthen management over grain purchase to other  provinces. Grain departments should coordinate with relevant  departments to organize the export of rice in a unified manner.    4. Industrial, commercial, price, and grain departments  should maintain close coordination, strengthen supervision and  management over the grain market, prevent people from forcing up  the grain prices or engaging in hoarding and speculation, and  deal strict blows to manipulation of markets and other illegal  business activities.    The provincial government executive meeting stressed: All  localities, while strengthening management over the grain  markets and organizing supply, should conscientiously attend to  the nonstaple foods project, and guarantee an ample supply of  nonstaple foods. Regarding the problems emerged during market  supply, we must rapidly adopt measures and solve them, and  report the situation to the departments concerned as quickly as  possible.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PLAN TO REACH ETHNIC GROUPS  </P> <P> Other ethnic groups face language and cultural barriers in getting information  and treatment for Alzheimer's disease. But the local chapter of the Alzheimer's  Assn. is hoping a new ethnic-outreach program will change that.  </P> <P> "Many people are suffering because there is so little in terms of reaching  ethnic groups," says Maria P. Aranda, chairperson of the Los Angeles  Alzheimer's Assn.'s Multicultural Outreach Advisory Board. The board was  created this year in an effort to educate ethnic groups about Alzheimer's as  well as to involve the medical community, Aranda says. Nationally, about 15 of  the 210 Alzheimer's Assn.'s chapters have begun to focus on reaching ethnic  groups with information.  </P> <P> "Not only Latinos need information, but also the Asian communities -- Japanese  and Koreans -- Filipinos as well as Native-Americans and African-Americans. All  these communities have been asking for leadership and technical assistance in  Alzheimer's disease," Aranda says.  </P> <P> Seven years ago, Aranda, a licensed clinical social worker, formed a  Spanish-speaking Alzheimer's disease support group called Grupo Siempre Viva,  which meets monthly.  </P> <P> The support group, with the help of Calmecac Educational Services, a mental  health organization composed of Los Angeles-area Latino professionals, helped  produce a 40-page fotonovela, or illustrated booklet, and a 50-minute video  about a Latino family's struggle with Alzheimer's.  </P> <P> "As a Latina, I know what our community's needs are," says Aranda, a  psychiatric social worker for the Los Angeles County Department of Mental  Health. She also is a National Hispanic Council on Aging fellow at USC and  part-time staffer at the San Antonio Mental Health Center in Bell Gardens.  </P> <P> "But what the multicultural outreach board is trying to do is develop a plan of  action with community leaders and representatives to develop expertise in  multicultural communities regarding Alzheimer's disease and bring more  information into the homes of these communities," she says.  </P> <P> She adds that the board also will pay close attention to the issue of  care-givers: "Families need to come to terms with living with someone who has  memory impairment and other dementias. They need to hear the information  several times, not just once, because a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is so  final that the patient and their families need ongoing counseling."

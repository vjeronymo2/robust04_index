			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Sony coping with 12 headaches on VAT front in Europe Sir, For 'VAT headache' (Editorial, October 13) please substitute '12 VAT headaches'. Sony has 200 people throughout Europe trying to develop 12 reporting systems for VAT returns, European sales listings, and Intrastats based on primary legislation in four states, draft legislation in five states and no information at all in the remaining three (Italy, Belgium, Portugal) - and all before January 1 1993. Furthermore, we are told by our VAT advisers Price Waterhouse (London) that there are a number of anomalies and differences in the various legislations: EC free ports will be handled differently for VAT purposes (Southampton is inside the EC, Copenhagen is outside); Germany and France want regional data for Intrastats but the UK does not; and Spain does not currently allow non-residents to register for VAT at all. Even if we want to register some of our companies for VAT in the UK using a fiscal representative, the forms are not yet available. To say nothing about triangulation which accounts for 70 per cent of our European business and which will lead to registration of our reinvoicing companies just about everywhere. Even if the triangulation rules are simplified (to which France still objects), it will leave almost no time to put them into effect. Two further points. First, the EC Commission is not to blame for the complex legislation. Simplification of the current rules was proposed some time ago by the EC but rejected by some member states for fear of increased VAT evasion. The reason for today's 'uncomfortable compromise' is the poor consultation between European businesses, their elected representatives (both locally and in Brussels) and the VAT authorities, resulting in governments pursuing their own legislative interests rather than the interests of businesses they represent. The open dialogue between UK and Dutch customs and businesses provides two excellent European models in this respect. Second, we are advised that a VAT registration in Italy gives rise to a permanent establishment and therefore a corporation tax liability. This has been confirmed to us by representatives of the Italian government. Should we comply with EC law and pay higher corporate taxes in Italy or take account of Italian law and avoid VAT registration there altogether? Is it fair that on top of their other VAT obligations, European businesses should also be forced to restructure themselves in order to avoid conflicts between EC and local legislation?

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts surrender early gains after buyers fail to materialise UK government bonds shot up by more than one point immediately after yesterday's unexpected quarter point cut in bank base rates as traders scrambled to cover short positions. However, they lost their gains as hopes of follow-through buying failed to materialise. By the end of the afternoon long-dated gilts were around a  1/2 point lower but the shorter end showed gains of just under a  1/4 point. Analysts attributed the lack of buying interest to sterling's weakness, which put off international investors, and to the domestic political situation which had taken the gloss off the rate cut. Some feared that the recent political difficulties of the ruling Conservative government would hang over the market for some time. Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International, said yesterday's rate cut had also raised fears in the market that it might be the last in the UK's current interest rate cycle. However, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said he would be surprised if it this was the last rate cut, especially in view of comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, that future interest rate cuts were likely to be of a similar size to yesterday's  1/4 point cut. 'Yesterday's  1/4 point cut will do next to nothing to help the economy so it must be seen as part of a continuing package of rate cuts,' said Mr Bootle. In his view, the UK authorities must be keen to show the market that interest rates could come down in the UK despite last week's rise in US interest rates. Furthermore, the rate cut appeared to be justified by the Bank of England's favourable inflation report which was published yesterday. The March long gilt future on Liffe stood at the day's low of 116 towards the close of trading, down  1/2 point on the day and down from the day's best level of 117 23/32 . German government bonds and futures also gave up their gains yesterday as the odds stacked up against an early cut in German interest rates. The March bund future on Liffe fell 0.13 point to 98.91 in the late afternoon, down from the day's high of 99.37. Traders said the release yesterday of better-than-expected jobless data for January, the Bundesbank's decision to set a tender at an unchanged fixed rate of 6 per cent, and the D-Mark's weakness had led the market to believe that the Bundesbank would delay any interest rate reductions until March. The very long end of the market was also put under pressure by the government's decision to increase volume in the 6.25 per cent 2024 bund by DM3bn. The yield on the 30-year bund rose to 6.45 per cent from 6.38 per cent on Monday. Mr Andre de Silva, analyst at PaineWebber, noted that the 30-year bunds were now yielding 59 basis points more than 10-year bunds, which compared with spreads of 57 basis points in the Netherlands, 56 basis points in Italy and 54 basis points in France. French government bonds traded in a narrow range as the rate cut in the UK was offset by the Bundesbank's announcement of an unchanged repo tender. The March notional bond contract lost 0.38 point to 128.68 in the late afternoon, down from an intraday high of 128.94. Japanese government bonds and futures showed little change from their Tokyo levels in European trading hours as dealers digested the contents of the government's Y15,250bn package of tax cuts, government spending and loans, designed to pull the economy out of recession. The March future, which had risen just over a  1/2 point in Tokyo, traded around its Tokyo closing level of 114.30 in the afternoon in London. The yield on the benchmark JGB no 157 stood at 3.48 per cent in London, unchanged from its final level in Tokyo. Mr James Greener, analyst at Toyo Trust International, said that although the market impact of the fiscal package had been broadly neutral, a likely consequence would be larger and more frequent auctions by the Ministry of Finance. He expected the next Y600bn auction of four-year paper to be announced today with a coupon of 2.8 per cent. 'The market is likely to cope because there is plenty of cash on deposit but it needs to be teased out with a decent coupon,' Mr Greener said. Prices on short-dated US bonds held steady after the Treasury's auction of new three-year notes, but concern over inflation brought further weakness to the long end of the yield curve. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  23/32 lower at 97 7/16 , with the yield rising to 6.44 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note eased  1/32 to 99 3/16 , to yield 4.417 per cent. With no first-tier economic reports on offer, the market's sights were focused squarely on the Treasury's Dollars 40bn quarterly refunding operation, which began yesterday afternoon with the sale of Dollars 17bn in three-year securities. Traders had approached the auction with caution, in view of the Federal Reserve's decision last week to nudge up short-term interest rates for the first time in five years. In the event, demand for the Dollars 17bn issue proved adequate. Bonds were awarded at an averaged yield of 4.83 per cent, slightly above expectations. The inflation-sensitive long end fared poorly, however, posting moderate losses for the fourth consecutive session. With January producer price data due out Friday, the issuance of Dollars 11bn in new 30-year securities tomorrow was seen as an obstacle by many traders. The market was fearful the report would contain more bad news on inflation, which would undercut the value of the long bond. A Dollars 12bn auction of 10-year notes is scheduled for this afternoon.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Economic growth set to outstrip forecasts: Second quarter GDP up 1% on previous three months The UK economy grew more quickly than expected in the first two quarters of 1994, leading economists to predict that full-year growth will be well ahead of the Treasury's 2.75 per cent forecast. Figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show that gross domestic product in the second quarter was 1 per cent higher than in the previous three months, and 3.7 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993. Those figures compared with earlier estimates of 0.9 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. The buoyant news on economic growth was reinforced by a Gallup poll on the UK economy, compiled for the European Commission, which showed an increase in consumer confidence. The balance of those expecting an improvement in both their financial position, and in the economy, improved between July and August. However, some economists warned that the pace of economic growth, which is running faster than the UK's long-term trend, might prompt the Bank of England to push for a pre-emptive rise in interest rates, to head off inflationary pressures. Second-quarter growth was boosted by a strong performance from net exports, with an improving trade performance contributing more than half the GDP rise. Consumer spending was also ahead, although the pace of growth, at 0.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter, has slowed sharply from the second half of 1993, when quarterly growth was running at 1 per cent and above. 'This is the clearest sign we have had so far that the announcement of tax increases and their subsequent imposition has hit demand,' said Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg Securities. CSO figures also showed the slowest quarterly growth in income from employment since 1967, mainly because first-quarter income was boosted by the high level of bonus payments. A 0.3 per cent decline in investment in the second quarter was seen as disappointing, although economists said that year-on-year growth in fixed domestic capital formation was 6.4 per cent. The strength of GDP in the second quarter, combined with an upward revision to first-quarter growth from 0.7 per cent to 0.9 per cent, show that the UK economy is gaining momentum. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, calculates that, even if the economy were to be flat in the second half of this year, full-year growth would still reach 2.9 per cent, ahead of the Treasury's forecast. Growth in 1993 and 1994 has been boosted by the rapid expansion of the oil and gas sector. But even if this volatile element is excluded, GDP grew by 0.8 per cent between the first and second quarters and was 3 per cent ahead year-on-year. Apart from oil and gas, the strongest industrial sector in the second quarter was electricity and water supply. Transport and communications also grew strongly.

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Murdoch in talks on magazine sell-off MR RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation was believed to be close last night to selling its main group of US magazines in a deal worth around Dollars 650m. The likely purchaser is K-111, the publishing company controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the investment banking company and one of the most active takeover players in the US. Both sides insisted last night that no deal had been signed and that negotiations could last into next week. The magazines involved are expected to include titles such as Racing Form, Soap Opera Digest, Soap Opera Weekly, New Woman, New York, Seventeen and Automobile, but not TV Guide or Mirabella. If the deal is completed it will be the first big Murdoch disposal since the restructuring of most of News Corp's Dollars 7.6bn debt earlier this year. Shares in News Corp rose to an eight-month high of ADollars 9.86 in Sydney on the strength of a New York Times report that a deal had already been agreed. By next February News Corp must repay USDollars 800m to the banks, Dollars 600m to redeem a bridging loan, and Dollars 400m in three six-monthly instalments after that. When the refinancing agreement runs out in February 1994, Dollars 6bn falls due. The magazines have been up for sale for several months. Reed International, the British publishing group, expressed interest in some of the magazines but withdrew when Mr Murdoch said he was only interested in selling the package. K-111 is run by Mr William Reilly, former president of Macmillan. He was credited with turning the US publisher, now owned by Maxwell Communication Corporation, into a Dollars 1bn-a-year company. The plan apparently is to run the Murdoch magazines as a stand-alone consumer group, separate from its trade magazines but under the K-111 umbrella. The deal bring KKR back into the headlines. At the beginning of the week KKR's joint bid with Fleet/Norstar to acquire the assets of the failed Bank of New England received official approval. There have also been rumours that Murdoch magazines in the UK will also be sold as part of the current disposal programme to reduce debt. Mr Murdoch has also suggested that a big disposal in Australia is also imminent. The most likely candidate is News Corp's printing interests.</p>

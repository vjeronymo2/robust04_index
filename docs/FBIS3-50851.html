			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 8 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad and  Tobago's police commissioner, Jules Bernard, has issued a stern  warning to Muslim leader Yasin Abu Bakr [name as received],  whose followers staged a coup attempt here in 1990.    "I wish to advise all concerned that the police service, as  the state agency charged with the responsibility to maintain law  and order in the society, would take prompt and decisive action  to deal with any attempt to disrupt the peace, order and  tranquility of the society," Bernard said after Abu Bakr said  his group felt as "oppressed" as it had when it staged the  insurrection.    "It is important that all persons who may be inclined to  embark on a path of unconventional behaviour be warned that the  police would be vigilant and prepared to deal with any such  activities."    Bakr, during a news conference, expressed dissatisfaction  over the long time the court of appeal took in delivering the  judgment in the dispute over lands the Muslimeen claims at  Mucurapo in the northern township of St James.    The Muslim leader said his organisation had many options  open  to it regarding the land dispute with the government.    "We can't just starve to death and do nothing. The  government is treating us unjustly. We have many options and we  would not sit and do nothing. We will use the best option  available to us," he told reporters.    He said that the organisation was not doing anything to  create tension.    Abu Bakr added,"we are feeling oppressed and we would like  to  defend ourselves. "The same kind of oppression resulted in the  1990 insurrection."    The Muslimeen held parliamentarians hostage in 1990,  complaining of victimisation and economic hardships. Bakr and  113 followers who gave themselves up afterwards were freed in  1992 after a high court found that an amnesty which they  received from acting President Emmanuel Carter was valid.    Previous governments and the Muslimeen have been at  loggerheads over the ownership of the land, which eventually  ended up in the courts.    Bakr, at the news conference, also complained that the state  had failed to pay compension for the destruction of several  buildings on the Mucurapo lands which were gutted by fire,  shortly after the six-day siege of parliament.</p>

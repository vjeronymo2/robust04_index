			<p>CSO     [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI,  Director, Shozo Shimomura) announced on the 3rd that they have  developed a slightly enriched uranium fuel which generates the  same neutrons as 45% intermediately enriched uranium  fuel. It  is called a silicide fuel (silica uranium dispersed aluminum  alloy = 4.8 grams/cm[.sup]3[/] uranium density) with 20%  enrichment [.sup]235[/]U. The 26 day-operation of the JAERI's  Japan Material Test Reactor (JMTR) using the new fuel  reconfirmed its applicability. Up to now, above 90%  enriched  fuels have been used in test/research reactors, but, as a result  of the international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation, and in line  with nonproliferation policy, the world is moving toward reduced  enrichment of less than 20%. This latest research  achievement  is in line with this worldwide target, making the latest efforts  by the JMTR for slight enrichment 19th in the world, while  achieving the world's highest neutron flux  (4x10[.sup]14[/]/second/cm[.sup]2[/]). This accomplishment  will boost efforts for slight enrichment of fuels for test and  research reactors throughout the world.    JAERI has been working on the slight enrichment program  since  1977. In 1986, they developed a 45% enriched fuel through  converting a 93% enriched [.sup]235[/]U fuel to  intermediately enriched uranium fuel.    The newly developed fuel achieved 20% enrichment  based on  this first stage fuel development. The silicide fuel was formed  through compression of a mixture of uranium and silicon alloy  and aluminum powders. Aluminum alloy was used as a coating  material. Cadmium wire 0.3mm in diameter was placed on the side  of the fuel elements in order to control excess reactivity at  the onset of the operation.    [.sup]235[/]U of each fuel element indicates 310-410 grams  of intermediately enriched uranium fuel. JAERI had conducted  tests using 2 fuel elements from 24 October 1993 to 20 December  1993, reconfirming their applicability.    This time, 50 megawatts thermal output was achieved using  slightly enriched uranium fuels for all 27 fuel elements. JAERI  claims that the number of nuclear reactor operation  interruptions will be reduced by lengthening the past 12-day  continuous operation to 26 days.    Of all nuclear research reactors of above 1 megawatt output  worldwide, approximately 60 -- excluding those in the former  Soviet Union -- require slightly enriched fuels; 18 reactors  have been modified to use slightly enriched fuels. JAERI has  developed the world's first slightly enriched fuel with a high  neutron flux density, essential for materials testing.</p>

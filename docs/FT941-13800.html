			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / People: Cheung - leading light in Hong Kong The sudden death of Michael Gale understandably overshadowed another announcement Hongkong Telecommunications made last Wednesday - the appointment of Linus Cheung, 45, as the company's chief executive from May 1, writes Simon Holberton. Cheung (or, Cheung Wing Lam as he is known in the Chinese-language press) was, until his appointment, the most senior Hong Kong Chinese executive with Cathay Pacific, the Swire-controlled international airline based in Hong Kong. Earlier this month he had been made deputy managing director of Cathay with responsibility for the airline's worldwide commercial activities. Cheung's rise at Cathay - which, like most other British-owned companies in Hong Kong, is dominated by expatriate managers whom nice young girls would be happy to introduce to their mothers - is due in no small part to the business skills he displayed in developing Cathay's business in Taiwan. Former colleagues in business and government - Cheung did a two-year secondment at the Hong Kong government's policy unit, or 'think tank', in the late 1980s - describe him as a highly polished performer. Indeed, 'smooth' is an adjective most often used to describe him. He is 'totally user-friendly in a cosmopolitan world', in the words of one former colleague. 'He is a highly motivated almost restless commercial man with a genuine sense of social responsibility.' Cheung is a leading representative of the post-war 'Hong Kong generation' - born and brought up in Hong Kong, many of the brightest came to notice at Hong Kong University in the late 1960s and early 1970s. His contemporaries are now leading lights in local politics, the law and business. But with his appointment to the top of the pile at Hongkong Telecom Cheung can claim to have outshone them all.</p>

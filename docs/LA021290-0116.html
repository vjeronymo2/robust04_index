			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH SAYS HE IS BOUND BY SANCTIONS  </P> <P> President Bush said today he will not lift any sanctions against South Africa  -- despite the release of Nelson R. Mandela and other signs of moderation --  until Pretoria meets all conditions set by U.S. law.  </P> <P> "We can't do that," Bush said at a news conference when asked if he would  modify any economic curbs against South Africa on the basis of recent  liberalization.  </P> <P> "I'm bound by the law. What I do want to do is discuss these provisions with  Mr. Mandela and (South African President Frederik W.) de Klerk," Bush said.  </P> <P> Both have been invited to meet with Bush in Washington.  </P> <P> Bush acknowledged that he finds some sanctions counterproductive but noted that  under the U.S. law establishing sanctions in 1986, a number of specific  conditions must be met before sanctions can be changed or lifted.  </P> <P> They include the release of all political prisoners, the lifting of a state of  emergency, negotiation with the black majority, permission for blacks to live  and work where they please and freedom for political organizations.  </P> <P> Asked whether he would broker negotiations between Mandela and De Klerk similar  to those of former President Jimmy Carter in the Camp David Middle East  accords, he said he would if the two parties feel it would be "helpful."  </P> <P> However, he said, his brief telephone conversations with the two men indicated  to him that they could likely negotiate on their own.  </P> <P> Bush praised De Klerk for taking steps that "move South Africa down the road  toward racial equality."  </P> <P> "I think his coming here evidences that we see in him a new brand of  leadership," the President said of De Klerk.  </P> <P> On another subject, Bush rejected Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal  that U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe be cut to equal levels, saying that he  wants to get away from such direct "linkage" in the size of troop  concentrations.  </P> <P> Bush defended his proposal that the United States be allowed to keep a total of  225,000 troops in Europe while Moscow would be limited to 195,000, and rejected  Gorbachev's counterproposal that the numbers be equal.  </P> <P> "We're going to stay with our proposal because we don't see this linkage. . . .  We've got a big ocean between us and Western Europe," he said in explaining why  the United States should be allowed slightly higher troop levels.  </P> <P> In his State of the Union address, Bush proposed that the United States and  Soviet Union be limited to 195,000 troops in central Europe, but that the  United States be allowed to keep another 30,000 troops in other European  countries.  </P> <P> Moscow now has about 570,000 troops in Europe and the United States has about  305,000 troops on the Continent.  </P> <P> Bush opened the news conference with praise for talks by Secretary of State  James A. Baker III in Moscow last weekend with Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> He said Baker made "solid progress" on arms control issues that should lead to  a successful summit meeting between himself and Gorbachev in Washington in  June.  </P> <P> On a related issue, Bush took note of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's  weekend talks with Gorbachev and said a reunified Germany should be a member of  NATO.  </P></p>

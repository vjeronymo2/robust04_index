			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Pension benefits IN THE search for ways of scaling back the UK's bloated public expenditure plans, one part of exchequer spending which appears sacrosanct is that spent on state pensions. The Conservative election manifesto promises to increase state pensions in line with prices. Yet as today's report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies makes clear, the state pension is ripe for review. With 10 per cent of public expenditure going on the basic state pension, the wisdom of forever uprating this universal flat-rate benefit is questionable. Already the state pension is declining in importance. It now provides less than half the income of the 65 to 74 age-group. Income from occupational pensions and investments is rising, and personal pensions will add further to this in the future. The indexing of the pension to prices has reduced its relative value from 20 per cent of male average earnings in 1977 to 15 per cent today. If it continues to be revalued in line with prices, its value is likely to fall to just 7 per cent of average male earnings by 2050. One response would be to increase the pension by more than the rate of inflation to restore its value relative to earnings (as the Labour party promised to do at the last election). The IFS report points out that it would require substantial tax increases to fund such increases over the coming years as the proportion of the population over retirement age rises. More important, since not all pensioners need such increases, it would be a poorly targeted transfer of resources. The state pension remains important for many, especially older, pensioners who retired with little else by way of income. But for a growing minority of the wealthier pensioners, the state pension is a small and relatively insignificant part of their income. The alternative is to put any increase in the pensions bill entirely into benefits targeted on poorer pensioners. The government has already moved in this direction in the last Autumn Statement with increases above the rate of inflation in means-tested income support for pensioners. While there are problems in the take-up of means-tested benefits, more imaginative use could be made of Inland Revenue and social security records to encourage those needing such help to apply for it. Such a strategy would be within the spirit of the manifesto commitment, provided the overall pensions bill was increased in line with inflation. And it would begin a process of directing benefits to those who need them most in a way that would later permit a more fundamental review of pensions in the light of changes in the UK economy and society.</p>

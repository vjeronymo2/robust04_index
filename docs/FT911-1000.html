			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: Hobson's Choice - Sadler's Wells Birmingham Royal Ballet is making a return to its erstwhile nursery in Rosebery Avenue for the next two weeks. We shall be seeing new works from young choreographers - as we so happily have for the past 45 years with this company - and Tuesday night's showing of Hobson's Choice reasserted yet again the vital creative identity of the troupe. I am not a devotee of the piece, finding its unrelenting joviality altogether too much, but it is a product of the company's traditions, an undoubted success with the public, and it is performed with quite exceptional spirit and finesse. David Bintley's realisation of Harold Brighouse's play is affectionate, rather sentimental, and serves as excuse for every sort of theatrical trick. What sustains it in the theatre are the ebullient interpretations it has inspired from its cast, and the dancers' vivid response to every opportunity for fun. The humour is, shall we say, broad; it is the especial grace of the Birmingham artists that they never over-step the mark between wit and slapstick. Timing is impeccable, comedy has been brightly polished, so that Stephen Wicks as a gormless suitor armed with flowers can extract every last joke without coarseness, while the drunken Hobson's progress up a flight of stairs (a series of rushes and teeterings that demand impeccable planning) is done with blithe skill by Desmond Kelly. Casting on Tuesday night was the original, with the central trio of Karen Donovan as Maggie, Desmond Kelly as her father, Michael O'Hare as Will Mossop. Their roles are plainly very real to them, as they splendidly are to us, and - whatever reservations one may have about the piece - it is heart-lifting to see an ensemble as secure in understanding, alert in response, in communication of feeling and step. This is true of every member of the cast; the company playing has a warmth and a generosity that have been a characteristic of the troupe since it was a group of Miss de Valois' new young dancers who trod this same stage in 1946.</p>

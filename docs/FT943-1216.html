			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (10): Tool will aid team working - Case study Accountants Ernst &amp; Young are using Lotus Notes to support a move to a flatter organisational structure. They wanted a tool which would aid team working and provide better information on which to base decisions. Notes software serves three functions: It makes it easier for teams of workers to share information even if they are not at the same site. It simplifies the task of extracting information from the company's central systems, or adding it. It is being used to build a number of new databases. The system is partly implemented and Ernst &amp; Young is in the process of rolling it out to 2,000 of its partner-managers. Within the UK, people in Glasgow can see the same information as people in London. The firm is also beginning to use Notes internationally  - for example, in the US. 'There is a lot of opportunity to share information on clients across offices,' according to Mark Bushell, Lotus Notes Project Manager at Ernst &amp; Young. For example, staff must add meeting minutes to Notes, and these can be looked at by others in their team. Action points can be included in the meeting notes but these can only be seen by the people who are meant to carry them out. When any team members who have not attended a particular meeting next go into Notes, they will see a small meetings symbol (or icon). This will have a number on it to show them how many new documents there are in the database that they have not read. But if they are pressed for time, they can ask just to see the action points relating to themselves. 'The whole system is geared towards telling you what's new and telling you how to find it,' says Bushell. He believes the key to success is to make Notes part of users' daily routine. However, Notes can fail if a central department simply asks people to add information that is of no benefit to them. Notes can also be used to disguise the difficulty of other systems. Ernst &amp; Young has a big Oracle database containing client and contact information. 'It's not very easy to get data out of it, so we're providing access via Notes,' says Bushell. Users can update the database through Notes or even add additional comments directly into Notes. The new Oracle data and the comments in Notes can then be viewed together as if they were stored in one place. Lotus Notes can cost as little as Dollars 230 per person for volume purchases in the US, according to Bushell. But he says it usually costs a bit more in Britain. In addition, Ernst &amp; Young is using Infopump software from US-based Trinzic to link Notes to its existing databases. This costs about Dollars 20,000 a pump and a large organisation will probably need several. Achieving a return on this investment can take some time. Bushell says: 'It can take anything from two to six months before people get used to Notes. Once they do, they come to depend on it and benefits can include fewer meetings and better management of projects that involve several sites.'</p>

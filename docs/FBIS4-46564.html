Military Hardware"]    [Text] Veniamin Pavlovich Yefremov was born in 1926.  He came to the Scientific-Research Electro-Mechanical Institute  (NIEMI) in 1945, after completing the Moscow Communications  Tekhnikum. He completed the evening division of the Moscow  Electrical Engineering Institute of Communications without leave  from his job. He became the chief of a department in the field  in 1958, and has headed NIEMI since 1968.    V.P. Yefremov has been a General Designer since 1983.  Currently, while remaining General Designer, he has been heading  the Anteypromeksport concern, of which NIEMI is the lead  organization.    V.P. Yefremov was awarded the degree of doctor of  technical sciences in 1966; in 1986 he was elected a  corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and in  1992 an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences.    V.P. Yefremov is the principal designer of the Krug,  Osa, S-300V and Tor air-defense missile systems and a number of  upgrades for the ground forces PVO [air defense] troops.    V.P. Yefremov was awarded the title of Hero of  Socialist Labor, and has been awarded Lenin (1967) and State  (1984) prizes along with five medals for his contributions to  the cause of creating domestic arms.    [VPK] Veniamin Pavlovich, how do you personally assess the  air-defense missile weaponry developed by NIEMI?    [Yefremov] NIEMI is the leading enterprise in the field of  air-defense missile armaments for the ground forces. We have  developed four types of SAM systems--the Krug, Osa, S-300V and  Tor--each of which is an original. All of these systems have  been upgraded a number of times.    The first SAM system developed by request of the ground  forces was the Krug system. High mobility is a distinguishing  feature of that system. The deployment or shutdown time does not  exceed 20 minutes. This is provided for by the fact that all of  the SAM system gear is accommodated on highly mobile, tracked  self-propelled vehicles and are joined by radio links. This  system entered service with the ground forces in 1966. SAM  systems comparable in mobility were not being developed anywhere  at that time. The system replaced the S-75 SAM system with the  ground forces; its deployment time was several hours.    High mobility of a SAM system has much significance for the  ground forces. It also has great significance in supporting  combat operations with the employment of high-precision weaponry.    A second feature of the SAM system is autonomy. Its own  radar  set was created as part of the system for that purpose, for the  detection of airborne targets, and is also accommodated on a  tracked vehicle. The properties of mobility and autonomy are  manifested to an even greater extent in the second SAM system,  the Osa, which was developed at the institute. This is the first  SAM system in the world in which all of the elements are located  on a single self-propelled platform. It must be said that the  similar Mauler SAM system was being developed at the same time  in the United States, but its development was never completed.    The acquisition radar in the Osa SAM system operates while  on  the move and tracks the targets with autotracking, with the  launch of the SAMs taking place after a brief halt. The system  can advance with the battle formations of the troops, providing  defense for them against means of air attack (SVN). The Osa SAM  system entered service with the ground forces in 1972, but it  remains quite effective to this day.    The Tor SAM system was created to replace the Osa; the  entire  process of combat operations is performed in automated mode in  it. The launch of the SAMs is performed vertically from the body  of the self-propelled vehicle for the first time in a system of  this class, which makes it possible to reduce to a minimum the  operating time of the system and increase its effectiveness in  battle with airborne targets that appear unexpectedly. The  possibility of simultaneous firing on several airborne targets  was also made a reality in the Tor SAM system. Other types of  SAM systems in this class do not have that trait.    Finally, the S-300V SAM system entered service with the  ground forces in 1982. This is a multichannel SAM system, the  most powerful weapon in the ground forces today. It was  developed to fight not only aerodynamic targets, but first and  foremost operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles.  The S-300V surpasses the Patriot SAM system in this regard,  supporting not only a more powerful SAM with a highly effective  warhead, but also having a special acquisition radar as part of  the SAM system. Another advantage of the S-300V is its high  mobility. All of the combat elements are placed on highly  mobile, tracked self-propelled vehicles.    The high effectiveness of the Tor and S-300V systems was  demonstrated in the Oborona-92 exercises conducted in November  of 1992.

Investments are needed in order to maintain that  status, however. The loss of our leading position is threatened  otherwise.    [VPK] What shape is NIEMI in today? What is the personnel  situation?    [Yefremov] NIEMI, as many other defense enterprises, is  experiencing difficult times today. The main cause of that is  insufficient financing and a lack of clarity with regard to  state orders.    Some 1,500 specialists, roughly 25 percent, have left the  institute. There were three waves: first the specialists under  30 years of age left, then those 30--35, and then those 35-40.  Specialists of the highest grade remain, but their ages are 40  and up. There are very few young people. This means that the  principle of succession is being violated. If we are not able to  restore the principle of succession in 1993-94, then the  enterprise will lose its traditions, its style and, as they say,  its look. We are taking steps in three areas to keep that from  happening. The first area pertains to the selection of the  priority projects in the defense field. We have been able,  taking into account a series of organizational measures, to  raise the average pay at the enterprise. It is, however, still  markedly inferior to the pay at commercial structures. The  second area consists of selling models of our weapons aboard.  The third is the joint development of systems for civilian and  military purposes with foreign firms. The second and third  areas, in my opinion, could provide an opportunity to restore  the potential of the enterprise, bring back those who have left  and attract young personnel.    We have created the Anteypromeksport concern. It includes  virtually all of the enterprises that are active in the  development and series production of the types of SAM systems  that we have been talking about. We are hoping to be able to  resolve a number of urgent issues with the help of the concern.    [VPK] Can the necessary financial resources be obtained  through the conversion of some of the enterprise?    [Yefremov] Conversion does not only provide funds for most  defense enterprises, it requires considerable expenditures as  well. If you were to take, say, a tank plant, its conversion to  national-economic products would require the replacement of the  basic process equipment. Even the transition of an enterprise in  the radar field to, for example, microwave ovens entails  considerable technical difficulties. It must be taken into  account that the psychology of the designer and the industrial  engineer in the defense field is markedly different from the  psychology of an industrial engineer and a designer in the  production of national-economic goods. This is conditioned by  the different scope of production of the items and their  reliability, servicing and cost.    It is probably somewhat easier to implement conversion at  aviation enterprises, i.e. where dual-purpose  technology is used.    It must be kept in mind, however, that the nature of the  production of goods for the national economy and for defense  differs substantially.    The pursuit of conversion first requires a definition of the  principle of defensive sufficiency for the state, the military  doctrine and the required quality and quantity of armaments. The  enterprises have to be selected for the production of defensive  hardware proceeding from that, which should become the backbone  of the military-industrial complex and which would be expedient  to have under state ownership. The military-industrial complex  (VPK), in that case, would be subjected to the competition of  the market and the effects of individual entrepreneurial  structures to the least extent.    The remaining enterprises in the VPK are being converted to  the output of goods for national-economic purposes and, where  necessary and expedient, could take orders in defense fields as  well.    [VPK] What international exhibitions has the enterprise  taken  part in? What are the successes in the concluding of contracts?    [Yefremov] NIEMI has taken part in four international  exhibitions over the last two years. The Tor SAM system was  shown at Manila in 1991 and Le Bourget in 1992. The modern  ground forces air-defense weaponry, including the S-300V and Tor  SAM systems, was shown for the first time at the Mosaeroshow-92  at Zhukovskiy. We demonstrated only mock-ups of our systems and  showed films about them at the exhibition at Afiny.

American businessmen  wanted to buy two of the Tor SAM systems, but we did not agree  as we are trying to sell an entire lot at once.    Negotiations are continuing today on the procurement of our  SAM systems by various nations. Interest increased considerably  after the Oborona-92 exercise, at which representatives of  foreign military circles were present. The systems made a great  impression on them.    We will take part in an arms show at Abu Dhabi in 1993. A  firing of the Tor SAM system is being proposed there. I feel  that we will resolve the question of the sale of our systems  abroad in the first half of 1993, and will be able to rectify  the financial situation of the institute and the association.    [VPK] Talk is being heard that you are encountering a large  obstacle on the part of the government in trying to sell the  systems abroad.    [Yefremov] This is complex issue. The government, on the one  hand, is not impeding this trade. We are trying to sell  defensive weaponry, and there can be no moral condemnation from  that standpoint; the government even has a vested interest in  that trade. We received basic permission for the sale of the  S-300V system on 4 July 1992, and this question was resolved  even earlier for the Tor SAM system. A state monopoly, on the  other hand, exists in the trade for this good.    It seems to me that the prices should be coordinated among  the governmental bodies and the producers.    [VPK] What business relationships are taking shape between  you and American specialists and businessmen?    [Yefremov] The United States is displaying a great deal of  interest in our projects. As I mentioned already, we received a  proposal from U.S. businessmen for the sale of the Tor SAM  system. We have made several trips to the United States at the  invitation of various organizations, and taken part in various  seminars and discussions on theoretical issues. Specialists in  the United States are interested in what we think on a number of  scientific and technical problems. A group of our specialists is  now being sent to the United States, where they will discuss  questions of the employment of the Tor SAM system to fight  drug-trafficking groups and the design of phased antenna arrays  (FAR).    The Americans feel that we are underestimating the dangers  of  the drug trade, and our country will still be running into this.  It must be said, with regard to phased antenna arrays, that the  specialists are attracted by our engineering ideas, which make  it possible to create inexpensive FARs.    (The discussion took place in the middle of December. The  group has since returned, having conducted their talks  successfully.)    [VPK] What relationships link the institute with the PRC?    [Yefremov] Representatives of the PRC are also displaying a  great deal of interest in our hardware. The Chinese Republic  wants to re-equip its army, and is seeking a solution to that  issue. The air-defense weaponry of the PRC army is by and large  obsolete, but China is still not able to procure modern weaponry  in large quantities abroad; it is thus trying to find another  solution to the problem. There is a desire, in particular, to  develop their own SAM systems with the participation of foreign  specialists.    Our institute has received a proposal to take part in such  projects. Negotiations are currently underway.    [VPK] The defense industry in the Soviet Union, as the rest  of the national economy, was structured according to the sector  principle, and was consolidated around the Military-Industrial  Commission under the Presidium of the Council of Ministers. What  do you see as the principles for the organization of the defense  industry and the management of the defense complex under  contemporary conditions?    [Yefremov] The sector structure of the defense industry  (electronics, electrical engineering, aviation, nuclear etc.)  headed by the Military-Industrial Commission, in my opinion, was  the most efficient. Highly skilled personnel and technologies in  this area were concentrated in the defense industry, on the one  hand, and the presence of the commission made it possible, on  the other, to organize interaction among the sectors. The  planned management of the economy made it possible, by and  large, for USSR Gosplan to organize all sectors of the national  economy and formulate targets for five years. The monitoring  bodies of the government evaluated the activity of the sectors  and the largest enterprises for the fulfillment of the five-year  plan. This system, of course, required a certain quantity of  highly skilled bureaucrats. There were, however, both a target  and government bodies seeking its attainment. The leading  capitalist countries borrowed from us the idea of planning the  development of their economy, especially in the military realm.  A program for the development of more than twenty new types of  dual-purpose technology, for instance, has been planned and  approved at the Congressional level. The SDI program in the  United States is a vivid example of planning in the military  realm.    The structures for the planning and management of the  defense  industry were destroyed during the so-called times of  restructuring and democracy, and the Ministry of Industry that  was created proved to be a monster that was unable to do  anything.    A Committee for the Defense Industry has now been created,  which it seems to me will unite the former sector ministries and  the military-industrial commission.    The idea is not a new one, but it could be asserted in  advance that this is a positive step compared to the existing  situation. Planning and strict monitoring of the fulfillment of  plans on the part of government bodies should undoubtedly exist.  An army still exists, and a defense complex in industry and the  bodies for managing it should also exist, i.e. the  army and the defense complex of industry are inseparable.

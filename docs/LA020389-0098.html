			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SAXMAN FREEMAN IS A TREAT, MAN  </P> <P> "Chico Freeman Live at Ronnie Scott's," airing on the Bravo cable channel  Saturday at 8 p.m. and Feb. 10 at 7 p.m., is much more than its deceptive title  implies.  </P> <P> The saxophonist is almost never shown with the London nightclub as a setting.  At various points he may be sitting on a tree branch playing soprano sax, or  blanketed in clouds of smoke, or walking away from his own image in a  double-exposure scene shot in black-and-white.  </P> <P> When Freeman plays a tremolo, two alternating camera angles vibrate wildly in  sympathy. When he uses multiphonics, there are multiple images to match. One  sequence has him playing bass clarinet, with close-ups of his eye and other odd  shots while he voice-overs a story about a dream, and another about his idol  Eric Dolphy.  </P> <P> Visual values aside, Freeman covers a broad musical span, from basic blues to  funk to modal and avant garde, mostly on tenor saxophone. His personality comes  across vividly as he talks about music as politics, later telling an anecdote  about a black man at the gates of heaven.  </P> <P> Freeman leaves a quartet worthy of him, with admirable work by Kenny Barron on  piano, Freddie Waits on drums and Santti Debriano on bass. Most of the  compositions are his own, reflecting the range of his talent and tastes.  </P> <P> It is a rare pleasure to hear so much first-rate jazz presented with  imagination, at no cost to the musical values. Directors Stephen Cleary and  Robert Lemkin deserve the credit. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

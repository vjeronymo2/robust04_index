			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Significant challenges face carriers wishing to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international networks using their own direct services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They need:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Substantial access not only to key hub cities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overseas, but also through and beyond them to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous other cities, mostly in third countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This type of access is not readily obtainable in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's bilateral system of negotiating air rights,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since governments can only exchange access rights to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own countries and cannot, between themselves,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliver access to third countries, thus requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> piecemeal negotiating efforts to build the necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> package of rights;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Access to a large number of gates and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takeoff/landing slots, frequently at some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> world's most congested airports. It may become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasingly difficult for carriers to gain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective, direct access to certain airport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, including some in the United States;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Considerable financial resources to establish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sustain commercially successful overseas hub systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The ability to obtain infrastructure and establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market presence in a new region quickly. Existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign investment laws can effectively preclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines from entering new markets in one of the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient means available: merger or acquisition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some carriers are taking on these challenges directly and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are striving to develop their own global systems of direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service. Other carriers have chosen to side-step the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obstacles, turning instead to a new network-building technique:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-border marketing alliances that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> link traffic flows between established hub-and-spoke systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in key cities of the Western Hemisphere, Europe and Asia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of these alliances involve cross ownership, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others do not. Under this strategy, the linking of hubs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires indirect market access through code-sharing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other cooperative marketing arrangements. Although code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sharing has become a widely-used marketing device for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines and is currently the most prevalent form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial arrangement, further evolution of the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its regulatory environment may lead to new marketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices that could supplement or supplant code sharing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code sharing and other cooperative marketing arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can provide a cost-efficient way for carriers to enter new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets, expand their systems and obtain additional flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traffic to support their other operations by using existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities and scheduled operations. Because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperative arrangements can give the airline partners new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or additional access to more markets, the partners will gain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traffic, some stimulated by the new service, and some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverted from incumbents. In this way, cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements can enhance the competitive positions of both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partners in such a relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increased international code-sharing and other cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangements can benefit consumers by increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international service options and enhancing competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between carriers, particularly for traffic to or from cities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behind major gateways. By stimulating traffic, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased competition and service options should expand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall international market and increase overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for the aviation industry. U.S. airlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be major beneficiaries of this expansion and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concomitant increased service opportunities, given their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive advantages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, code sharing should also enhance domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition. Many international passengers traveling to or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from U.S. interior cities use domestic services for some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of their international journey. Code sharing should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase competition among domestic carriers to carry those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passengers on the domestic segment of their international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> journey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although we expect the expansion of cooperative arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be largely beneficial, there may be some negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects. The greater traffic access of participants may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give them considerable competitive muscle, and we may need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to watch for harmful effects on competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Global systems and the growing use of code sharing may put  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant competitive pressure on carriers whose strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not include participation in such systems or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> code-sharing alliances, or whose options to participate may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be limited due to the lack of potential partners. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers will have to develop other commercial responses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compete effectively. We expect these pressures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responses to lead to a restructuring of service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines, similar to the U.S. domestic experience in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1980s. Overall, cities and consumers will probably enjoy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved service and access to the international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation system, although some cities may have fewer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or less convenient service options in some markets than they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have today. Similarly, although some airlines will grow and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prosper, others will not. Overall, this evolution should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand the level and quality of international air service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code-sharing arrangements are designed to address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference of passengers and shippers for on-line service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from beginning to end through coordinated scheduling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baggage- and cargo-handling, and other elements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single-carrier service. However, innovative service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, such as code sharing, can only respond to consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences accurately, and thereby enable the marketplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to function efficiently, if consumers make choices based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

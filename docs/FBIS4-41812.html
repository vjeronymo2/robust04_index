			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS: "Aircraft Carrier Varyag Will </F> Not Be Scrapped"]    [Text] Reports appearing in the press that a decision has  already been made to recycle the Varyag are untrue.    The most acceptable and advantageous option for deciding the  aircraft carrier's future is to sell it in its present condition  (68-percent finished), according to Ivan Vinnik, deputy general  director of the Black Sea Shipbuilding Plant. Another possible  option for using Varyag is to remove everything possible from it  and to sell its hull for use as a cruiser or other vessel. We  will not break up the Varyag out of morale considerations, Ivan  Vinnik stressed.</p>

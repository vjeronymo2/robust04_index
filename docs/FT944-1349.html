			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Le Monde moves with the times Le Monde, one of France's best-known daily newspapers, is to turn itself into a conventional company and bring in substantial outside investment in the latest example of the sector's attempts to stave off losses, writes Andrew Jack in Paris. The restructuring, which was approved by shareholders earlier this week, is designed to inject FFr220m (Pounds 26.15m) in new capital and will overhaul the complex old-fashioned corporate legal structure put in place to preserve the paper's editorial independence. Le Monde, which has become a French institution since its creation just 50 years ago, celebrated its anniversary on Monday with facsimiles of earlier editions, demonstrating just how little the basic design and logo has altered. That will all change in January, under a new format introduced as part of the restructuring plan in preparation since autumn 1993. Mrs Anne Chaussebourg, a senior executive, said yesterday the new editorial approach represented 'a strong innovation, not a revolution' with greater emphasis on business and international economic stories. The liberal-leaning paper has generated many enemies in the French establishment over the years, including President Francois Mitterrand who recently said he no longer read it. The new plan will see the paper available for sale an hour earlier in Paris. Mrs Chaussebourg said the aim was to boost sales by at least 5 per cent by the end of 1995, by which time Le Monde should have broken even before becoming profitable from 1996. This year it made losses of about FFr20m. Earlier this week, Liberation, another Paris-based daily newspaper, announced a recapitalisation of FFr75m.</p>

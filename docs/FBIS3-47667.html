			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- An income tax cut will  stimulate the economy even if a consumption tax hike is included  in the same tax reform law for later implementation, a  government advisory tax panel said Friday [14 January].    "A tax cut might have been ineffective last year, but would  be effective this year" with the economy "starting to show signs  of hitting bottom," Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission  told reporters.    Against this backdrop, he reiterated that a tax hike would  not undermine consumption, and the government and politicians  should clearly state "a consumption tax hike and its timing" in  the same law to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds to fund  the tax cut.    But the rate of the new consumption tax, currently at 3  percent, does not necessarily have to be mentioned because the  situation changes, said the head of the advisory panel to the  prime minister.    Referring to opinions that an economic recovery with the tax  cut will lead to increased tax revenues, Kato said such a  scenario has already proved wrong in the United States under the  administration of President Ronald Reagan.    "Bridge bonds are for repayment in the short term, and it's  irresponsible... to borrow without any scheme for paying back,"  Kato said.    "Politicians may not win votes with a consumption tax  hike...  but those who correct public views instead of just following  them are the true politicians," he said.    Kato stressed that "last-minute" spending can be expected  before a sales tax hike as in the case of China. The panel is to  study the Chinese case, he added.    The argument that a tax hike would dampen consumption is  "absolutely a fiction" especially in Japan where savings are  still high compared with other countries, Kato said.    As for signs of the economy hitting bottom, he cited  recovering spending mainly on housing resulting from lower land  prices, the impact of the yen's appreciation changing favorably  for Japanese companies, and an expected increase in automobile  purchases from the tax cut.    He also said the bribery scandals involving general  contractors that have stymied progress in public works are near  settlement, and the agreement on multilateral trade talks may  lead to lower prices.    Meanwhile, a senior tax panel member told reporters the  panel  cannot support any issuance of deficit-covering bonds and wants  the government to carry out the tax cut and hike in a single  package.    But the panel, which resumed to discuss fiscal 1994 tax  reform on Friday after suspension since mid-December, confirmed  its stance of "leaving the decision to the government and the  coalition parties," he told reporters after the meeting.    The member said the panel decided to discuss such reforms as  methods to increase liquidity in the land market and corrections  of unfair levy systems on nonprofit institutions, he said.    As for a new timetable, he said members will meet on Tuesday  and Friday next week, and hold meetings almost every day from  the following week.</p>

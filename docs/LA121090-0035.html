			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JACK CLARK RIPS PADRE MANAGER  </P> <P> First baseman Jack Clark, the man they call the Ripper, decided over the  weekend he will leave the San Diego Padre organization in style, unleashing a  vicious verbal attack on Manager Greg Riddoch.  </P> <P> Clark accuses Riddoch of being responsible for many of the organization's 31  firings over the past 10 weeks, of back-stabbing everyone in his path, of being  an incompetent manager and an evil person.  </P> <P> He also promises revenge.  </P> <P> "When he gets off his high horse, and gets fired, there'll be nobody to protect  him," Clark said. "That's when he better start looking over his shoulder where  there will be a lot of people looking for him. They want a piece of him.  </P> <P> "You make your bed, you lay in it, and if that's the way you want it, you die  in it.  </P> <P> "Payback's a dog."  </P> <P> Riddoch, spending the weekend in Sterling, Colo., was surprised to learn of  Clark's comments.  </P> <P> "It's very disappointing to hear," Riddoch said Sunday, "and it's very, very  unfair. The hard part to accept is that we've spent so much time together, and  I considered us friends. But now all of a sudden, I'm supposed to be different,  I'm conniving, I'm sneaky.  </P> <P> "It just doesn't wash with me. But I'm not going to stoop to his level and get  into a verbal war.  </P> <P> "All this does is just make you work harder to prove you're a good solid  person. I'll put my reputation, and whatever I do, on the line."  </P> <P> Clark, one of 16 players who were granted new-look free agency, insists that  his anger toward Riddoch is not because the Padres no longer are interested in  signing him. Instead, he says, it is because of the way he believes Riddoch's  personality changed once he was promoted from first-base coach to manager at  the All-Star break.  </P> <P> "Riddoch, my God, there's not enough things I can say about that guy," Clark  said from his Danville, Calif., home.  </P> <P> But Clark tried anyway.  </P> <P> "He's a bad, bad man," Clark said, "and he's sneaky. He's a snake. Well, not  just a snake, but a s-s-s-n-n-n-a-ke.  </P> <P> "The crazy thing is that I thought he was a good guy, but once he became  manager, he turned out to be one of the biggest all-time snakes I've ever seen.  He'll stab anyone in the back to get to the top.  </P> <P> "I tell you, he and (Padre chairman) Tom Werner are a great combo. They deserve  each other. They're perfect together."  </P> <P> Clark accuses Riddoch of being the man behind many of the club's firings, and  says that he also is responsible for the firing of Jack McKeon as general  manager.  </P> <P> "He's back-stabbing everyone on his way to the top," Clark said. "Who do you  think did all of those firings? Who do you think got the trainers fired? Who do  you think got the coaches fired? Who do you think got McKeon and everyone  upstairs fired?  </P> <P> "Joe McIlvaine, come on, he doesn't even know these people.  </P> <P> "It was our little buddy, Greggy.  </P> <P> "You couldn't believe the stuff I've found out about the last couple of months.  I got information from upper-echelon people in the organization, too. These  were the people that were sitting in on the meetings, the ones where Riddoch  was cutting my head off, along with just about everyone else he could think of.  </P> <P> "What he didn't realize was that the people who got fired are talking now.  These people are singing. I know what he told to Tom Werner, the way he buried  me, because someone else was in that room, too. I heard everything, and the way  he's doing the same to three-quarters of the players on the team.  </P> <P> "Our little friend, the psychologist, is doing a number on us."  </P> <P> This is why, Clark says, that he soon will begin making phone calls. The  critical comments that Riddoch made in private meetings with management that  were relayed to Clark will be disseminated to the players.  </P> <P> "I'm going to call Benito Santiago, Ed Whitson, Bruce Hurst, and all the guys  that he's been calling bums," Clark said. "I'm going to make sure everyone  understands his little game with him. I'm going to tell them what he's been  saying about them.  </P> <P> "He's been sugar-coating everyone on top all right, and then blood-sucking you  on the other side.  </P> <P> "Is this a guy you really want to play for?"  </P> <P> Clark, who also was quietly critical of Riddoch's managerial skills during the  season, along with several veterans, also decided to air his views on this  subject.  </P> <P> "The guy is an absolute joke," Clark said. "He's so overmatched, and the sad  thing is, the whole team knows he's in over his head.  </P> <P> "The thing that tees me off is that we did so much to help him, especially at  the start when he was a nervous wreck. He asked for all our help, telling us to  take care of the young guys. But the more we watched him, we knew this guy  didn't have a clue on what he was doing.  </P> <P> "The guys on the team have to keep their mouths shut, but everyone in baseball  knows what a lousy manager he is. They laugh at us.  </P> <P> "Watch, it'll be the same this year. He'll have these kindergarten tactics,  he'll use all his psychology crap, and he'll try to bully the young players  with them.  </P> <P> "What it is, is that he's got this little-man syndrome, like we're supposed to  kneel down in front of him like he's God. But the guy is useless, totally  useless.  </P> <P> "His best job would be as a minor league coordinator, but for him to manage a  big-league club is an absolute joke. I feel sorry for everyone who has to stay  there."  </P> <P> Clark, actually, still remains a member of the Padres himself. Although he is a  free agent, and is expected to receive serious bids from several clubs such as  the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies, Clark belongs contractually to  the Padres. If he were to receive no offers, the Padres still would have Clark  under contract, which would be determined by an arbitration hearing.  </P> <P> But once the Padres made the four-player trade Wednesday with the Toronto Blue  Jays to acquire first baseman Fred McGriff and shortstop Tony Fernandez, they  no longer needed his services.  </P> <P> "Don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter because of the trades or the players they  let go," Clark said. "I think Fred McGriff and Fernandez are fabulous players.  I think it was a good move by Joe McIlvaine to get guys like that. I respect a  man for having the guts to pull off a trade like that.  </P> <P> "But they're going backwards with a guy like Riddoch, and the sooner off they  realize it, the better off they'll be."  </P></p>

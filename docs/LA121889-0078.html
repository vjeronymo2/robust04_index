			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: PAN-CARIBBEAN SOUND FROM THE SYSTEM BAND  </P> <P> The System Band didn't need to warm up the audience at the Music Machine on  Saturday. Thirty seconds into the 13-piece Haitian group's set, a steady stream  of couples was en route to the dance floor, setting the tone for the second  night of the New York-based band's local debut.  </P> <P> The Haitian compas style became something of a Pan-Caribbean sound in the  System Band's hands. The keyboard melodies frequently recalled the steel drums  of Trinidad, the 4/4 bass drum and loping bass pulse brought zouk to mind --  not surprisingly since compas was a big early influence on zouk. But the horn  parts and overall ambience of the music had a pronounced Latin tinge, although  a more rounded sound than the sharp, angular lines of, say, salsa.  </P> <P> The group's focus on the dancers and the spirit of the moment -- be it  reflected in on-stage clowning, ebullient dance steps or a middle-of-the-road  lounge touch -- enabled the System Band to weather the set's rough edges and  ragged patches. And the Formula One's potent opening set indicated that the  local compas unit has arrived as a pretty formidable force in its own right.DON  SNOWDEN  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Employer located in City X seeks experienced mechanical engineers. In City X, the prevailing wage for such engineers is $49,500 annually. In setting the salaries of U.S. workers, employer pays its nonsupervisory mechanical engineers with 5 to 10 years of experience between $50,000 and $75,000 per year, using defined pay scale ``steps'' tied to experience. Employer hires engineers A, B, and C, who each have five years of experience and similar qualifications and will perform substantially the same nonsupervisory job duties. Engineer A is from Japan, where he/she earns the equivalent of $80,000 per year. Engineer B is from France and had been earning the equivalent of $50,000 per year. Engineer C is from India and had been earning the equivalent of $20,000 per year. Employer pays Engineer A $80,000 per year, Engineer B $50,000, and Engineer C $20,000 as the employer has had a long-established system of maintaining the home-country pay levels of temporary foreign workers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The INA requires that the employer pay the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at least the actual wage or the prevailing wage, whichever is greater, but there is no prohibition against paying an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant a greater wage. Therefore, Engineer A may lawfully be paid the $80,000 per year. Engineer B's salary of $50,000 is acceptable, since this is the employer's actual wage for an engineer with Engineer B's experience and duties. Engineer C's salary, however, at a rate of $20,000 per year, is unacceptable under the law, even given the employer's ``long-established `home country' system,'' since $20,000 would be below both the actual wage and the prevailing wage. The latter situation is an example of an illegitimate business factor,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a system to maintain salary parity with peers in the country of origin, which yields a wage below the required wage levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

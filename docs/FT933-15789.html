			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Carmakers see sustained recovery as sales rise 11% THE UK motor industry finally acknowledged yesterday that 'clear recovery' is under way in the UK car market, after reporting a strong rise in new car registrations during June. The 11.07 per cent year-on-year increase was the eighth rise in the past 10 months and has convinced the industry that dealers, manufacturers and importers are moving out of one of the steepest car sales slumps on record. The June increase has lifted registrations for the first half of the year by 9.14 per cent, with most of the industry expecting a further acceleration in the second half of the year. Mr Roger King, public affairs director of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which published yesterday's figures, said: 'The recovery of the new car market, which has been seen in all but three of the last 15 months, is now clearly established.' The UK statistics were released on the day that figures from the Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers' Association indicated a deepening of the sales crisis in other large EC markets. The EAMA estimates that sales fell in Italy by 30 per cent last month, by 24 per cent in Germany, 21 per cent in Spain and Italy, and by lesser amounts in other markets except Greece - which saw a 60 per cent fall. The UK is alone among 17 west European states in recording sales growth. Sales in the EC overall were 17.5 per cent down in the first half of the year. The gathering gloom on the Continent is dampening some of the buoyancy of UK-based manufacturers, whose production gains - based on a rising UK market and a larger share for domestic producers  - are increasingly offset by the downturn elsewhere in the EC. Even so, UK car output in the first five months of this year was 9.1 per cent ahead of the same 1992 period, at 608,169, with May output the highest for that month in 16 years. UK-based producers took a 45.52 per cent share of the market last month, up from 43.48 per cent a year ago, and 45.91 per cent in the first half of the year against 44.85 per cent in the same period of 1992.

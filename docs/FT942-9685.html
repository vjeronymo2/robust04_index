			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Two-tier county systems proposed The Local Government Commission is proposing that a two-tier system of counties and districts should continue in parts of three counties - Hampshire, Kent and Leicestershire - in conflict with the government's preference for all-purpose unitary authorities. In Hampshire, the favoured option is to make Portsmouth and Southampton unitary, while leaving the two-tier system intact for the rest of the county. In Kent, mergers between Gravesham and Dartford, and between Rochester and Gillingham, would create unitaries with the rest of the county staying two-tier, while in Leicestershire, Rutland and Leicester city would become unitary. In the other counties covered - Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Lancashire, Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire - unitary options are preferred, although there is a wide range of structures in each.</p>

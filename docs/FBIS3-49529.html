			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a public communique, the Kosova Democratic  Alliance [LDK] Presidency condemns the application of a tax of  10 German marks [DM] to cross the border. The communique states  that, starting 1 January 1994, another extraordinary obstacle  was added. For every exit, even to Macedonia, the Serbian  authorities want travelers to pay a tax of DM10 per person and  DM30 per vehicle. Another measure, completely contrary to the  elementary rights of free circulation, was added to the  infuriated regime of crossing the border. With this, the  communication between Albanians of Kosova and Macedonia and  those of diaspora were reduced to a minimum. Thus, a vital  interest is infringed and the Albanian population is practically  placed under an almost complete isolation in the eyes of the  European powers and the international public.    The LDK presidency strongly protests all these limitations  and asks that such measures be immediately abolished. The  presidency hopes that its request will encounter understanding  by the international public and will enjoy support in its demand  for immediately invalidating all obstacles of free circulation,  the communique says.</p>

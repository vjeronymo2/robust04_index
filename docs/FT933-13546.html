			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Major declines to rule out extension of VAT MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday declined to rule out further extending the scope of value added tax, as he put improving Britain's competitiveness firmly at the heart of the government's economic strategy. Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record programme, the prime minister said the government had no current plans to extend VAT to items such as newspapers and children's clothes, but it would be 'unwise . . . to rule anything absolutely definitively in or absolutely definitively out'. Speaking just two days after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, admitted a further extension in the scope of VAT was a possibility, Mr Major said the government would reassess the position after it had taken 'more action' on public expenditure. Mr Clarke said during a visit to Christchurch, Dorset, that the government might again broaden the VAT base if the acceleration in the economic recovery did not make significant inroads in the government's borrowing requirement. The introduction of VAT on domestic heating, announced in the Budget in spite of past statements that the government had no plans to make such a move, has become a potent issue in the constituency where the Conservatives are this month attempting to stave off a demoralising by-election defeat. Mr Major used yesterday's interview to trumpet the government's recent record in cutting inflation and interest rates and in engineering 'astounding' growth in manufacturing productivity. But with key export markets such as Germany and France moving into recession, it was crucial that UK competitiveness was improved further. Britain was securing a larger share of a smaller European market, the prime minister said. This underlined the 'absolute imperative' for Britain to remain competitive - 'and that means relatively low wage increases'. He said low pay rises ought to be popular with the unemployed because they made it more likely that they would be 'priced back into jobs'. One of the effects of the recession, he said, was to have 'stripped the masking tape' from some of the country's strategic problems, making them more evident. Britain needed to expand, widen and deepen the industrial base and it needed to examine the long-term difficulties it faced in funding all the social expenditure it wanted to carry out. Reflecting on a difficult year which has seen his personal popularity slump, Mr Major said politics had been through a silly and sleazy period.</p>

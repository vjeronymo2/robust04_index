			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEROES OR VILLAINS IN FRACAS ON BUS?  </P> <P> A transient who threatened to stab an RTD bus driver was critically injured  Monday after the driver and at least two passengers overpowered him and pinned  him down in the bus' stairwell until police arrived, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A man police identified as John Bonwell, 41, was rushed to the Hospital of the  Good Samaritan and treated for cardiac arrest possibly brought on by  strangulation, said hospital spokeswoman, Ellen Brenner.  </P> <P> "He was definitely strangled," said Brenner on Tuesday, adding that Bonwell had  also suffered a puncture wound above his left eye. "He's in about as critical  condition as you can get. I don't know if he's going to make it through the  night or the week."  </P> <P> Police did not arrest Bonwell and still are investigating what happened on the  Route 20 bus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manhandling a Possibility  </P> <P> Detective Frank Bishop of the Wilshire division said it is "not beyond the  realm of possibility that the guy was manhandled. But the only thing we have  right now is that this guy (attempted to) attack the driver . . . and he (the  driver) was trying to hold him down."  </P> <P> According to police and RTD officials, the attack occurred shortly after 4 p.m.  Monday when RTD driver Don Smith stopped to unload passengers from his crowded  bus at Wilton Place and Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> He was about to drive off when Bonwell appeared "and started pounding on the  doors," Bishop said. After Smith let him on, Bonwell "was acting kind of crazy,  yelling and screaming at the bus driver and using a lot of profanity. The  driver felt he was going to do something. . . . The guy had said, 'I'm going to  cut you.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Driver Stops Bus  </P> <P> Bishop said Smith pulled over at Western Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, four  blocks from where Bonwell had boarded, and opened the doors of the bus. At that  moment, witnesses told police that Bonwell was distracted by a passenger who  moved away from him, and Smith, seeing that the suspect was holding a folding  knife, stood up and grabbed Bonwell's arm.  </P> <P> Then "the fight was on," Bishop said. The two men wrestled with each other, and  Bonwell knocked Smith into the bus' stairwell. Smith was able to overpower the  suspect, getting on top of him, and "he just held him down," Bishop said.  </P> <P> The driver of a bus behind Smith's apparently saw the altercation and notified  a dispatcher, Bishop said. The dispatcher than notified police.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Smith had been joined by at least two unidentified male  passengers who helped hold Bonwell down.  </P> <P> Although the four or five passengers police were able to interview after the  incident gave no indication that Bonwell had been beaten or strangled, Bishop  said Bonwell "apparently was in an unconscious state or close to it at the time  he was handcuffed."  </P> <P> "Maybe one of the people did handle the man by the neck," said Bishop, who  added that hospital officials had not told police the extent of Bonwell's  injuries. "I don't have any report that happened, but we're actively  interviewing anybody we can get a hold of."  </P> <P> RTD spokesman Greg Davy said it is not the agency's policy "to encourage a  passenger to become involved in an altercation. There are all kinds of  liability problems with the likelihood that the passenger could be hurt."  </P></p>

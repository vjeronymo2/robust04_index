			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEOS TRY TO BRIDGE A WIDE CULTURAL GAP;  </P> <P> RACE RELATIONS: THE TWO PRODUCTIONS ARE AIMED AT INSTILLING POLICE WITH  FEELINGS OF RESPECT AND SENSITIVITY WHEN DEALING WITH LATINO AND SOUTHEAST  ASIAN RESIDENTS.  </P> <P> One young Latino chases another through a parking lot and slams him against the  trunk of a car.  </P> <P> "Chill out! Chill out!" the youth under attack pleads. But the fight goes on  and both combatants fall to the ground.  </P> <P> "Cut!" the director barks, and the two men break apart and smile. An  appreciative audience of extras and crew applauds.  </P> <P> Though the seconds-long fight scene took hours to produce, it will not find its  way into a Hollywood movie or an episode of MacGyver.  </P> <P> Instead, it will become part of a training video for police officers in Orange  County. The fight between the two young men -- which in the film occurs at a  family party -- sets up the entrance of two police officers who demonstrate how  to close down the rowdy affair without inciting the guests to more violence.  </P> <P> Through such examples, the Orange County Human Relations Commission and Santa  Ana Police Department -- which co-produced the film -- hope to show police  officers that a better understanding of culturally and ethnically sensitive  situations can make their jobs easier and boost their image in minority  communities.  </P> <P> One of the videos is aimed at raising police officers' awareness of Latino  culture and another will deal with the Vietnamese community.  </P> <P> Editing has begun on the Latino video, which recently finished shooting with a  mix of professional and amateur actors at locales around Orange County -- from  a Santa Ana burger stand to the surf and sands at Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The script for the video, to be called "Common Ground," was written by Jose  Cruz Gonzalez of the Hispanic Playwrights Project at South Coast Repertory. One  of its main points is that Latinos, like police officers, place a high degree  of importance on being treated with respect.  </P> <P> The script calls for an "Adam-12" type format in which a pair of actors playing  police officers are seen in re-enactments of actual incidents. The incidents  were chosen to show how recognition of cultural differences can defuse  potential confrontations and improve the image of police in the Latino  community.  </P> <P> In one scene, for instance, the senior officer agrees to honor the request of a  suspected wife-beater who wants to be handcuffed outside his house and out of  sight of his children.  </P> <P> "It doesn't hurt to take a minute and explain what we're doing. Besides, maybe  next time his kids see one of us they won't be afraid," the actor/officer  explains to his partner.  </P> <P> In the party scene, officers respond to a complaint about noise at a  quinceanera, a traditional Mexican-debut celebration marking a girl's 15th  birthday.  </P> <P> Aware that a fight between two youths has just occurred outside, the officers  take the girl's father out of earshot from the others and explain that the  party is out of control. They courteously ask him to tell everyone to go home.  </P> <P> "Respect," the officer later tells his partner. "That's all it takes."  </P> <P> The project has received an outpouring of support and donations from Latino  groups and businesses, police departments and corporate donors, according to  Vicki Plevin, who is co-producing the videos for the Human Relations  Commission.  </P> <P> Volunteer Extras  </P> <P> Scores of extras from Orange County community groups like Manos Unidas, Spanish  for "hands united," dressed up for the crowd and ballroom scenes.  </P> <P> Jay Palomino of Westminster, vice president of Manos Unidas, said the group's  members felt their participation was important to help make officers more aware  of cultural differences. In times past, "they didn't have the ethnic  sensitivity they should have," he said.  </P> <P> One incident that outraged Westminster's Latino community was the July, 1988,  shooting of 18-year-old Frank Martinez in his back yard during a birthday  celebration for his mother. Police maintained that Martinez and an angry mob  attacked three officers who were at the home to question Martinez's brother  about a neighborhood gang incident. Martinez's family, however, has claimed  that police shot the unarmed youth as he tried to rise from the ground and  flee.  </P> <P> The Orange County Grand Jury decided not to indict any of the officers involved  in the shooting, but the family has filed a $110-million lawsuit against the  Westminster Police Department, alleging violations of civil rights.  </P> <P> Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Human Relations Commission, said the  video project was approved in hopes of improving understanding between police  and Latinos.  </P> <P> "It is very desirable among (police) departments to build better relationships  in the Hispanic community," Kennedy said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Police Officer Kevin Brown served as technical adviser on the  project, making sure that the two actors looked, talked and appeared like real  officers. Among other things, he made sure that they carried their flashlights  in their left hands in case they needed to reach for their guns in a hurry. And  he showed them how to carry billy clubs on their laps in a patrol car.  </P> <P> Plevin said the project is also receiving technical help from police  departments in Westminster, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, San  Clemente and Fullerton, and from the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> The videos, which are being produced on a $10,000 budget, are intended  primarily to be shown to police officers at roll calls before they head out on  daily patrol, Plevin said. The project has received donations, both monetary  and in-kind, valued at thousands of dollars more.  </P></p>

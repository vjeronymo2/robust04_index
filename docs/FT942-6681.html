			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Building the right portfolio - The ingredients for investment success Imagine an investment portfolio made up of shares in emerging stock markets, European privatisation stocks, small companies, and securities producing an ultra-high income. That is roughly the portfolio you would have if you had put money into a cross-section of the latest unit and investment trust launches. It is an exceedingly high risk mixture. It is also very unlike the portfolio you would have if your money was managed by the private client department of most leading fund management firms, which usually work on a fairly conventional asset allocation model. In other words, they first divide your money between cash, bonds and equities; then they divide the equity money between the major stock markets or economic blocs. Many firms have more than one type of model, since clients differ. An income-orientated investor would, for example, probably have more bonds and a small or non-existent stake in emerging markets. But all the firms emphasise that any prototype will be modified to suit the specific needs, attitudes and existing portfolios of individual customers. There are minor variations both in what the firms think clients want and how they aim to achieve it. GAM (Global Asset Management) argues that the first priority for most of its clients is to avoid losing money; they would also like long-term capital growth roughly in line with that of equities, but that objective comes second. Kleinwort's prime objective is to maintain the real (inflation-adjusted) value of the clients' assets. Its 'benchmarks' (see table) show how portfolios for various types of investor would be split if stock markets were expected to be relatively stable both in themselves and in relation to each other. In practice, tactical considerations mean that the actual portfolios often are very different from the benchmarks. Take, for example, its most aggressive portfolio: the benchmark version is 20 per cent bonds and 80 per cent equities. And the equities are half in the UK, with the remainder equally split between Europe, the US, Japan and south-east Asia. Today, that portfolio has no bonds and is nearly 98 per cent invested in equities, with the UK and emerging markets getting most of the extra. Markets as turbulent as the current ones can cause some fairly radical rethinks. Early in March, for example, the more dynamic BZW portfolio model had 12 per cent in each of the US, Europe and Japan. This week the actual allocation had 6 per cent in the US, nothing in the other two, and over a third in bonds and cash. Generally, there is a fair consensus on where to put investors' money. Our asset allocation table shows the latest snapshot from a range of different fund managers*. We stipulated that we were interested in portfolio splits suitable for a client resident in the UK with at least Pounds 250,000 to invest. Where managers have several basic models, we have picked the most comparable. These are middle of the road portfolios, aiming for moderate growth and suitable for someone willing to take some risk: too cautious for a 35-year-old with no worries but too risky for many older investors approaching retirement. How helpful, though, are these models to the investor who manages his own money? They can be useful if handled with care, but there are several points to bear in mind when using them as a yardstick: They are blueprints only. The fund managers all emphasise that they have several clients whose portfolios are very different from the models because their needs, objectives and characters do not fit the stereotype. And factors such as potential gains tax liabilities can complicate the situation. Many investors find themselves effectively locked into most of their existing holdings because a major overhaul would land them with an enormous gains tax bill. In such cases, any model portfolio is simply a target to work towards at your own pace. These portfolios assume that you have at least Pounds 250,000 with no obvious claims on it. If you have known future commitments, such as school fees or a mortgage to pay off, you need to allocate specific resources to meet those liabilities. They assume that you can afford to take at least a three to five year view; they are not suitable if you might need your money back before that. This caveat applies even to the cash in some portfolios. Make sure you have enough of that cash elsewhere for your everyday needs. They are, deliberately, broad brush. Several of our fund manager sample, for example, are particularly enthusiastic about shares in smaller companies, but we have not subdivided the totals. Choosing the right shares can matter as much to the success of your portfolio as choosing the right areas in which to invest. Indeed, some of the most successful investors are pure stock-pickers. If you still want to run a portfolio spread as widely as our models, how do you do it? As we have pointed out, active dealing normally should be avoided. The costs of buying and selling a share (see page VIII) are likely to amount to nearly 5 per cent for a UK blue chip and more for a small company, most foreign shares and for many unit trusts. Indeed, Warren Buffett, the American investment guru, urges you to think of dealing costs as an extra tax on your profits. The obvious implication is that it is self-defeating to fine-tune your portfolio too often. Start with a broad idea of the overall shape, knowing that you cannot afford to change it in response to every minor market movement. Should you invest directly in individual shares, or through unit and investment trusts? This is an open question as far as the UK portion of your portfolio is concerned. If you have the time, knowledge and inclination, direct investment is probably more fun. An alternative is to put most of your money into a cost-effective index-tracking fund (page III, Weekend FT , April 30) and run a much smaller portfolio of shares for your own amusement. When it comes to investing overseas, most people will sensibly opt for funds. * Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Mercury Asset Management, Williams de Broe, Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, and Global Asset Management.  ------------------------------------------------- POSSIBLE PORTFOLIO BENCHMARKS (%)  ------------------------------------------------- Asset type          Growth     Balanced     Income  ------------------------------------------------- Index-linked gilts      20           15          - Conventional gilts       -           10         30 UK Equities             40           45         50 Overseas Equities       40           30         20  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Kleinwort Benson Private Client Management  -------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------ PRIVATE CLIENT ASSET ALLOCATION (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Asset type       BZW      MAM   WmsdeBroe   Kleinwort     GAM  ------------------------------------------------------------ Cash            16.2        3        3.75           -      15 Bonds             20        9        3.75           7     2.4  Conventional     10        6           -         4.2       -  Index-linked     10        3        3.75         2.8       -  Other             -        -           -           -     2.4 Equities        63.8       88        92.5          93    82.6  UK             47.7       63        67.5        58.8      16  US              6.1        6           5         8.9       6  Europe            -        9         7.5         8.1    30.6  Japan             -        4           5         7.5      15  Other            10        6         7.5         9.7      15  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Fund management houses.

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UN seeks a way out for Kabul diplomats UNITED NATIONS officials were yesterday in contact with leaders of Afghanistan's two warring factions in an effort to ensure the safe evacuation of western diplomats from Kabul. Rockets have damaged the French and Turkish embassies and two Russian embassy staff were killed by rockets last week. However, it was not immediately clear if a temporary ceasefire could be arranged two weeks after intense fighting broke out between forces loyal to hardline dissident leader Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and president Burhanuddin Rabbani. Fighting was less intense overnight following a sustained rocket attack on Kabul which caused hundreds of casualties. Government troops killed 70 Hezb fighters and injured 120 in the southern Bini Hisar district and destroyed two rocket batteries, Kabul Radio said. At least 100,000 people are thought to have left the city in search of shelter and food, western diplomats say. Life has been severely disrupted because of damage to water and electricity supplies, and large-scale food shortages. Hospitals are severely short of medical supplies. Mr Hekmatyar has demanded the expulsion of Uzbek militiamen led by Gen Rashid Dostum, as a prerequisite for peace. Gen Dostum was previously a close ally of former communist-backed President Najibullah, who fell from power in April this year. However, Gen Dostum has assumed a key role in the new mujahideen government, after changing sides to support Ahmed Shah Masood, the new mujahideen defence minister. This week, the Pakistani government stepped up pressure on Mr Hekmatyar by cutting supplies in an effort to force him to seek a peaceful resolution. But he has vowed to fight on. Some officials believe that his fighters, who now occupy strategically important ground on the hills outside Kabul, may have to move when winter snowfalls begin. President Rabbani was yesterday reported to have appealed to Iran for badly-needed fuel supplies and other aid. 'He (Rabbani) hoped Iran would provide the Afghan people with more relief supplies, especially oil products, at this critical period,' the Iranian News Agency said. Iran was a supporter of the Moslem mujahideen guerrilla groups which toppled the Soviet-installed government. Last week Mr Rafsanjani told Mr Ustad Farid, since sacked as Afghanistan's interim prime minister, that Iran was ready to help its neighbour but reconstruction aid could only be made when calm returned to the country. A mujahideen peace mission has met Mr Masood and plans a round of talks with Mr Hekmatyar today, Reuter adds. The 15-man team sent by Governor Abdul Qadeer of neighbouring Nangarhar province arrived in Kabul on Tuesday to try to negotiate a ceasefire. Diplomats said they were not optimistic about a ceasefire, noting that several had been agreed and broken between Mr Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami and the government.</p>

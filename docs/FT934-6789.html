			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: James Cropper A full order book and improved margins helped James Cropper, the Cumbria-based paper and board maker, report interim profits almost doubled at Pounds 1.14m pre-tax, against Pounds 595,000. There was an added benefit from lower interest rates as finance charges for the half year ended September 25 fell from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 631,000. Turnover was Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 20.3m). Earnings per share were 9p (4.8p); the interim dividend is raised to 1.1p (0.975p) to reflect the company's confidence that the poor trading conditions of recent years have abated. Directors stressed, however, that it should not be taken as an indication of the level for the full year.</p>

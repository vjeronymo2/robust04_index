			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Treuhand in barter deal with Russians The Treuhand privatisation agency and a banking consortium led by Dresdner Bank yesterday secured contracts worth DM800m (Pounds 315m) as part of a barter deal between eastern German manufacturers and authorities in Perm, Russia. More than 40 Treuhand-run east German enterprises will export construction and mining equipment and machine tools to industries in Perm. The goods will be partly financed by chemicals, raw materials and timber products from the region. The barter contract, part of which will also be backed by Hermes, Germany's export credit guarantee agency, is an attempt by the Treuhand to save the remaining manufacturing base of eastern Germany through rebuilding markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. These markets collapsed after German unification and the demise of Comecon, the socialist countries' trading bloc. This contract is the second this month. The Treuhand and Deutsche Bank arranged a DM1bn barter and financing package for the export of east German manufactured goods to the Tyumen region of Russia. The latest contract signals a cautious return to Russia by Hermes, which last August said it would not be extending guarantees for 1994. The first deliveries, signed for yesterday by Mr Hans Georg Pohl, a Treuhand official, and Mr Gennadij Igumnow, responsible for Perm's industrial development, will start early in the new year.</p>

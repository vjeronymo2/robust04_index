			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report BASE METAL prices generally edged off their lows in the afternoon at the London Metal Exchange and most markets closed steadier. An exception was TIN, which closed at Dollars 5,745 a tonne for delivery in three months, down Dollars 90 on the day. Dealers blamed that on early liquidation sales but added that selling pressure slackened as the day wore on and prices steadied a little in after-hours trading. COPPER prices moved up in the afternoon but still ended slightly lower on the day. Dealers said the market had proved unable to break through resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 2,200 a tonne. ZINC prices matched the trend in copper with cash metal closing unchanged on the day. Resistance was likely beyond Dollars 1,070 a tonne for three months metal, Dollars 3.50 above yesterday's close, traders thought. The NICKEL market was quiet with the three months price ending Dollars 25 down at Dollars 5,827.50 a tonne following an initial mark-down on another increase in LME warehouse stocks.

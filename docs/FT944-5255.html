			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Coopers' effort to delay probe opens in court Regulators will be watching closely today as a judicial review opens in the High Court which could have long-term implications for supervision in UK financial affairs. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's biggest accountancy firm, is seeking to stall a wide-ranging investigation into its audit of the failed Maxwell business empire. The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's most senior regulatory body, is seeking to carry out the investigation. The judicial review, which is set to last three days before Mr Justice Henry and Mr Justice Kay, begins today and judgment is likely to be deferred. The action follows a judgment in April this year in favour of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, over its audit of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. That ruling meant that the JDS inquiry would have to wait until criminal and civil actions involving BCCI were at an end - which is unlikely before the year 2000. The ruling in the BCCI case was based on the highly complex and unusual nature of the bank's collapse. Coopers' argument is that its JDS case should not go ahead because any hearings would be prejudicial to civil or criminal actions which might follow over the Maxwell affair. The firm will also claim that an adverse JDS ruling could have catastrophic consequences and place an intolerable burden on its partners and staff. The scheme, which is operated by the UK's chartered and certified accountancy bodies, only investigates matters of the most serious public interest. If the JDS loses in the High Court there is every reason to believe it will lodge an appeal to establish a definitive judgment on the issue. Professional and government regulators will be watching the case carefully to see if they are to be barred from taking action in cases where civil or criminal legal action is pending. And if the JDS were to lose an appeal it is likely a fundamental reform of accountancy regulation would be considered. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has already set up a working party on the future of regulation.</p>

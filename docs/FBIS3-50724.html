And the primary goal, of  course, is to preserve the accomplishments attained over these  years. However, abroad, in Florida specifically, there are those  who have plans that differ from these changes. What is the  alternative they advocate?    [Sexto] I could answer with a cliche, a standard phrase, or  slogan and say that Cuba has no other alternative but socialism;  but it seems to me that this is not the time for jaded phrases,  slogans, or cliches. I believe it is time for arguments, for  thinking, for meditation. Evidently, speaking clearly, Cuba has  no other alternative, but then something curious happens. The  changes taking place today in Cuba, changes aimed at reversing  the crisis we are experiencing today, aimed at perfecting the  economic means of our society, are seem by some as a form of  frustration. In other words, some people, including honest  Cubans, believe that everything being done in Cuba -- tourism,  investments by foreign companies, hard currency  decriminalization -- are measures that forcibly lead to  capitalism.    This is, of course, an opinion that in certain cases I  understand, because it is shaped by a very agonizing or  desperate view of the situation. Others, of course, believe that  these changes, this path, frees them from any commitments, and  they are very opportunistically moving to the opposite path to  take free shots at the Revolution which yesterday gave them  everything, including an opportunity to develop their talents,  potential, and raise and educate a family without major  problems. Both opinions, however, are wrong. Cuba is not headed  toward capitalism. That would be silly because it would mean  opposing ourselves. Cuba is engaged in a hard, burdensome  struggle to overcome this objective period. This is an objective  period of economic crisis designed to preserve this whole  project which for 35 years has shaped the lives of Cubans.    [Roque] All this is being done to reinsert Cuba in the world  of today, from which it cannot remain apart.    [Sexto] Exactly. I believe that at the beginning of the  special period Carlos Lage said in an interview that Cuba is  making a socialist opening to a capitalist world. I believe that  everything should be seem from this perspective, which is a very  broad vision, a vision that has to be flexible because it is  subjected one way or another to the demands of a reality that  changes very frequently and is at present very hostile. Cuba, of  course, has to have the flexibility required to adapt to the  emergencies of the times.    [Roque] These are paths we cannot relinquish.    We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the enemies  of the Revolution.    [Sexto] Something curious happens: While certain highly  concerned Cubans fear that Cuba might be moving toward  capitalism, fear that the Communist Party of Cuba, the  Revolution, the Cuban social project might end up being a  capitalist society, others, at home and abroad, are thinking  about pushing Cuba toward capitalism.    [Roque] What are the alternatives they advocate?    [Sexto] We cannot speak of alternatives, we have to speak of  an alternative. For example, what would be the program of a  counterrevolutionary government in Cuba?    [Roque] I can imagine it.    [Sexto] I believe that any intelligent Cuban knows what the  alternative is. I took the time to research the information,  read magazines, read cables, and I made a synopsis of the  alternative that a counterrevolutionary government might offer  the Cuban people, who they claim are greatly burdened.    [Roque] For example, there is the Cuban American National  Foundation [CANF].    [Sexto] The CANF is the most powerful lobby in the United  States. It is the most powerful for the simple reason that it  has the most money and because until recently it enjoyed  absolute support from U.S. administrations. It is a  counterrevolutionary association created by businessmen. That is  enough to make one apprehensive, for one to begin to worry. It  is a group made up of businessmen that advocates an alternative  for Cuba.    [Roque] These businessmen, of course, make monthly  contributions to the foundation.    [Sexto] That group had up to a few years ago approximately  50,000 contributors, of course, businessmen. A few years back it  had a membership of 276,000 people. All these figures should be  taken with a grain of salt. There is no doubt that these figures  may have been altered, there is no doubt that the CANF leaders  might be saying that they have more supporters than what they  have in reality. You know that Miami politics are a little  extreme.    [Roque] Coming back to the issue: the alternative of the  Miami-based CNAF.    [Sexto] What does the chairman of this organization,  millionaire Jorge Mas Canosa, advocate? Mas Canosa believes that  poverty ends with private ownership. We would have to ask him if  he became rich sharing his money with the poor. That is the  first question I would ask Mas Canosa. Mas Canosa believes that  economic progress is only attained with a free market. We would  have to ask Mas Canosa if the good life for 30 or 40 percent of  the population in exchange for the poverty, pain, and misery of  the other 60 or 70 percent could be called economic progress. Is  it economic progress maintaining balanced budgets at the expense  of the pain of the hungry, working majorities. I believe that  all this is highly debatable. For the CANF and its president,  the economic progress of Cuba can only be attained by becoming  dependent on the United States. Of course, for a smart Cuban,  all this is highly suspicious. I believe that we would have to  say: Hey buddy, don't bother to defend me. What kind of an  option is that? You are giving me the rock and the hard place  option.    [Roque] We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the  enemies of the Revolution. When I said alternatives, it is  because we are going to refer not only to the one advocated by  the CNAF but also to that of other groups which are not that far  from that idea.    [Sexto] A few Sundays ago, the JUVENTUD REBELDE newspaper  published an interview by journalist Luis Baez with a  counterrevolutionary pundit named Tony Cuesta, whose crimes I  believe everyone is familiar with. I believe that he recently  passed away due to a heart attack. The interview was conducted  when Cuesta was released from prison. He was jailed following an  infiltration. A grenade had exploded in his hand; the  Revolution's doctors saved his life. He served a few years in  jail, was later released, and returned to Miami. In that  interview, which was published many years after it took place,  Tony Cuesta said that the great problem of the counterrevolution  had been that it did not have an ideology, that the lack of an  ideology had disunited them and that that had been their  disadvantage in confronting the Cuban Revolution, which is a  tightly knitt group of ideas, a highly cohesive political body.    I, of course, do not share this opinion. I believe that the  Cuban counterrevolution does have an ideology. Its failure  against the Cuban social project, the Revolution, is due to the  fact that that ideology suffers much in a comparison with ours.  It is not the lack of an ideology. Therefore, those groups have  an ideology -- in this case a bourgeoisie ideology, a capitalist  ideology. Anyhow, all these groups hostile to the Cuban  Revolution hope for a return of capitalism in Cuba, of  capitalism with its entire structures and laws.    [Roque] And therefore their platforms.    [Sexto] And therefore their platforms with some minor  differences. For example, a few months ago I read an article by  Carlos Alberto Montaner, the leader of the so-called Cuban  Liberal Union, the heir of the liberals whot fled in disarray.  He said in the articles published in the Miami NUEVO EL HERALD  that Cuba, under a different regime, under different  circumstances should never hope for economic development, that  that was an idealistic chimera. He goes on to say that Cuba  should forget its hope to develop the sugar industry because, in  the end, sugar is worth nine cents, that it was better for Cuba  to grow flowers, that Cuba would become wealthy selling flowers  to Florida, of course, if the United States were to allow Cuba  to export its flowers to Florida. More or less, you can see the  ideas advocated by these men.    [Roque] That is his alternative.    [Sexto] That is his alternative. It seem laughable coming  from a man with pretensions of being an intellectual.    [Roque] There also are platforms or alternatives advocated  by dissidents at home.    [Sexto] I believe that the so-called dissidents at home....  [changes thought] I find it hard to use the term dissident. I  fully agree with Silvio Rodriguez [Cuban singer], when he says  that we have let them steal that word from us. A dissident is he  who disagrees. A revolutionary can disagree with something he  thinks is not right. That is a revolutionary attitude. We have  lost the word dissident, and I find it hard to refer to  dissidents within Cuba. I do not believe they are dissidents at  home.    [Roque] They are counterrevolutionaries.    [Sexto] They are counterrevolutionaries. What alternative do  they advocate for Cuba? The same as Mas Canosa: dependency on  the United States; a return to capitalism. And in the political  arena: freedom and democracy. This is even the motto of the  CANF. We could think that the Cuban who today lives in Miami,  mostly controlled by the influence of the powerful CANF, lacks  the liberty to even express himself. We have spoken in this  program about the Americas Watch investigation that concluded  that freedom of speech in Miami is fully suppressed by the  prevailing counterrevolutionary thinking. What freedom can we  speak of? What democracy? We would have to ask Mas Canosa if in  the future parliament he wants to organize in Cuba, the  communist will be represented.    [Roque] Summarizing: There is a congruence among all these  platforms, those abroad and those at home.    [Sexto] The alternative advocated by the counterrevolution  is  capitalism. The alternative advocated by the Cuban Revolution is  socialism. There is no other alternative. All Cubans have to  agree. All Cubans should think with national awareness. Cuba is  only saved through the Revolution's options. There is no other  way.    [Roque] Start thinking.</p>

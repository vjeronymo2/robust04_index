			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> TRASH CLEANUP TO MARK EARTH DAY  </P> <P> With Earth Day coming up on Sunday, Ventura City Councilman Gary Tuttle figures  it is time for city residents to stop talking trash and start walking or  running with it.  </P> <P> At 6 p.m. today, the public is invited to the Harbortown Hotel parking lot at  1050 Schooner Drive.  </P> <P> From there, volunteers will work their way over to the Channel Islands National  Park Headquarters, picking up garbage as they go.  </P> <P> About 50 people are expected to participate in the Twilight Trash Bash, which  is sponsored by the city and by the Inside Track store, which Tuttle owns.  </P> <P> "It's easy to talk about doing something about the environment, but people are  too busy taking care of their own needs," said Tuttle, who is an avid runner.  "This will give people what they need for fitness, and it will also help clean  up at the same time."  </P> <P> Tuttle suggested possible courses that people can follow either by walking or  running and scooping up trash. The most direct route is 1 1/2 miles from start  to finish. Another route is about three miles long and goes past a city  sewage-treatment plant.  </P> <P> "Over by the entrance of the plant, it's a mess," he said. "That's where most  of the people will be concentrating."  </P> <P> Participants will be supplied with trash bags, but Tuttle recommends that they  bring work gloves. Prizes will be awarded to the holder of the ugliest and most  unusual trash.  </P> <P> "It's got to be the grungiest, the piece that's been out there the longest,"  said Tuttle. "I really don't know what I'll be looking for. I'll have to play  it by ear, but I'll know it when I see it." LEO SMITH  </P></p>

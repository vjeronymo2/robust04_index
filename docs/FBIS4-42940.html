			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yavuz Baydar in New York] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The report issued by the UN  secretary general yesterday on the extension of the UNFICYP [UN  Forces in Cyprus] mandate triggered harsh reaction both from  Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC].  Ambassador Inal Batu, Turkey's permanent representative to the  United Nations, described this new report as a text by the UN  secretary general that ignores the wishes of the Turkish side on  the island.    Osman Ertug, TRNC representative in New York, said that the  report pours salt on the wounds. Turkish Cypriot officials say  that the report, like the previous one, is politically oriented,  whereas it should have been primarily a technical report.    Ertug said: In our view, the fact that the accusation  concerning the lack of political will is directed -- even though  only by implication -- against the Turkish Cypriot side  constitutes the most dangerous factor in the report.</p>

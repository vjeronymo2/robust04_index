			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ONLY GET ONE BLOW ON THAT WHISTLE;  </P> <P> THE PENTAGONISTS;  </P> <P> AN INSIDER'S VIEW OF WASTE, MISMANAGEMENT, AND FRAUD IN DEFENSE SPENDING BY A.  ERNEST FITZGERALD (HOUGHTON-MIFFLIN: $19.95; 316 PP.; ILLUSTRATED);  </P> <P> THE WHISTLE BLOWERS;  </P> <P> EXPOSING CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY BY PENINA MIGDAL GLAZER AND  MYRON PERETZ GLAZER (BASIC BOOKS: $19.95; 286 PP.)  </P> <P> Ernest Fitzgerald, the original Pentagon whistle-blower, has written an  important new book, "The Pentagonists." But its importance does not lie in the  "exposes" that it contains. Instead it lies in the fact that it unintentionally  provides valuable insights into how unreliable a guide former whistle-blowers  can be to events beyond their initial revelations.  </P> <P> The reason is simple: Whistle-blowing is the modern equivalent of the ancient  custom of falling on one's sword, and, like that ancient custom, it is a  one-shot operation. Common sense tells us that once an employee goes public and  embarrasses his superiors with exposes of wrongdoing, he has committed  institutional suicide. No matter what the courts or whistle-blower protection  laws say, you can count on it that a whistle-blower will never again be given  access to insider information. That's true no less in private industry,  newspapers, television or even public service organizations than in the  Pentagon. In fact, government institutions may provide the most benign  whistle-blower climate of all.  </P> <P> As Smith College Prof. Myron Peretz Glazer and Hampshire College Dean Penina  Migdal Glazer point out in their new book, "The Whistle-Blowers: Exposing  Corruption in Government &amp; Industry," "of the sixty-four whistle-blowers  studied, twenty were able to hold on to their positions; of these, all worked  in the public sector."  </P> <P> All this by way of introduction to Fitzgerald's "insider" view of "waste,  mismanagement and fraud in defense spending." Fitzgerald may be many things,  but he has not been a Pentagon insider for at least 20 years. Hired in 1965  during the Johnson Administration as a civilian cost accountant for the Air  Force, Fitzgerald's enduring claim to fame is that in testimony before Sen.  William Proxmire's Joint Economic Committee in 1968 and 1969 he "blew the  whistle" on the cost overruns of Lockheed's C-5A military transport plane.  </P> <P> What really enshrined him as whistle-blower supreme, however, was the fact that  in 1970 then-President Richard Nixon personally ordered him fired. As  Fitzgerald details in the first third of his book, after a long court battle he  was reinstated in 1973 but demoted to a lesser job. After another long court  battle he settled the suit in 1982 in return for "full reinstatement" and  payment of legal fees. The effect of this long battle, Fitzgerald admits, is  that he had lost his objectivity: "I had come to view the opposition as  incredibly powerful, corrupt and dishonest," he writes. And a touch of paranoia  crept in as well. He uncovered something "that most Americans are scarcely  aware of."  </P> <P> Like those who explain all of the ills of American society as the fault of the  evil Trilateralists or of the Council on Foreign Relations, Fitzgerald  discovered the even more insidious "Pentagonists." "In other banana republics,"  he writes, "the military comes to power with a sudden coup and the installation  of a junta. Here it is different. Power in America is not a matter of  controlling the police forces and the media. America runs on money. And the  military has quietly come to vast economic power by taking vast amounts of the  federal income for itself."  </P> <P> Wow! It's common knowledge that America's gold reserve (what there is left of  it) is stored at Ft. Knox, Ky., but one assumed that it was still under the  control of the Treasury Department. If the military is indeed "taking vast  amounts of the federal income for itself," Fitzgerald is offering an expose of  the first magnitude.  </P> <P> But, having raised this issue, Fitzgerald then abandons it. Instead, for the  next three chapters he turns to a subject he evidently considers even more  crucial . . . how he was personally savaged, not only by "Richard the Wicked"  and "Gerald the Banal" but also by "Jimmy the Good." As he puts it, "The Jimmy  Carter debacle seduced, corrupted and destroyed the ethical authority of the  liberal Establishment" (that is, it refused to listen to Fitzgerald). He  doesn't give Reagan (who also refused to listen to him) any higher marks,  especially after his campaign to be appointed comptroller of the United States  went down the tube. And, not surprisingly, as the former president of the  National Taxpayer's Union from 1971 to 1973, Fitzgerald was not happy with the  defense spending of the Reagan years.  </P> <P> The majority of the second half of his book is devoted to second-hand reporting  on that spending -- familiar tales of overpriced hammers, toilet seats, plastic  stool caps, coffee pots, etc. Lacking from his accounts, however, is an  explanation of the defective procurement and pricing regulations that allowed  these scandals to occur.  </P> <P> After an attack on the Packard Commission (he sees it as a White House plot  orchestrated by Adm. John Poindexter) and an attack on Administration efforts  to plug leaks (according to the Glazers he won the Cavallo award in May 1988  for, among other things, refusing to sign the new security form pledging not to  reveal classified or classifiable information), as well as an obviously  tacked-on chapter on the unfolding Pentagon procurement scandal, Fitzgerald  concludes with a simple-minded account of a conspiracy by the "Pentagonists"  and the "Corporate State" to take over the country.  </P> <P> Like many so-called insider accounts, Fitzgerald's gets so carried away with  its author's own vendetta that it misses the complexities of the real world. In  "Wild Blue Yonder," a hard-hitting Defense Department expose reviewed in these  pages last April, Nick Kotz emphasized that "the military-industrial complex is  not a conspiracy imposed on this country, but a community of interests,  backgrounds, professions and ideologies." That is a problem that Fitzgerald's  rancorous and self-serving analysis does not begin to address.  </P></p>

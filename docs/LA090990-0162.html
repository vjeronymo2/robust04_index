			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING;  </P> <P> VETERINARY RESEARCHER CLAIMS BREAKTHROUGH IN BLEEDING  </P> <P> A Silver Springs, Md., veterinary researcher claims to have isolated an  abnormality of the red blood cells that he believes to be the cause not only of  exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage in racehorses but of other  exercise-induced maladies common in the equine athlete. He also claims to have  developed drugs that will correct the problem.  </P> <P> According to Dr. John H. Boucher, there is evidence that the red blood cell  disease echinocytosis is the root of a number of "exertional diseases" found in  most thoroughbreds, pulmonary hemorrhage (commonly known as "bleeding")  foremost among them. Echinocytosis, he claims, develops spontaneously when  horses exercise intensely and is linked to muscle and orthopedic disease,  exercise intolerance and equine sudden death. His research, Boucher claims, has  led to the conclusion that a myriad of exertional diseases result from a single  cause.  </P> <P> The occurrence of echinocytosis is marked by the spontaneous production of a  large number of abnormal red blood cells called echinocytes. These are rigid  cells that clump together, rupturing small blood vessels through which they  have difficulty flowing, thereby disrupting the entire circulatory system.  </P> <P> Echinocytes and their relationship to tissue ischemia and abnormal pulmonary  hemodynamics may be the missing link in understanding the origin of diseases  associated with exercise, Boucher claims. Horses are the only species known to  suffer disease as a result of exercise, Boucher said.  </P> <P> "I believe that the quality of blood flow to tissues of exercising horses is  important, if not the key, to exertional diseases. An estimated 50 percent of  horses that start into training never make it to the racetrack, but become  discards due to exertional diseases or injury. Healthy thoroughbreds should be  capable of racing about every 10-14 days. But not so, because of inevitable  injuries and diseases associated with exercise."  </P> <P> Studies undertaken in 1988 at Canterbury Downs by University of Minnesota  researchers determined the blood of thoroughbreds to be three to four times  more viscous immediately after a race than at rest. They also determined the  cellular component of blood volume is 58-percent higher after exercise. Rigid  red blood cells more than doubled by the end of a race.  </P> <P> Boucher's company, Rheotech Labs, is developing therapeutic drugs known as  hemorrheologic agents, which would correct the echinocyte problem by  normalizing blood flow. These are being tested on horses at the University of  Minnesota. Boucher envisions the drugs as replacements for current methods of  treatment, particularly for furosemide (Lasix), which recent studies claim is  not effective in treatment of pulmonary hemorrhage and acts as a  performance-enhancing agent. Lasix, while prohibited for racing use in New  York, is legal and widely used elsewhere.  </P> <P> The drugs being developed by Boucher's firm, he claims, have no effect upon  performance beyond normalizing blood flow. Boucher says these drugs also lack  the power to mask the presence of other drugs, which is among the most  controversial properties attributed to Lasix, a powerful diuretic.  </P> <P> Boucher's research is a great distance and a substantial amount of  developmental funding short of being approved by the Federal Drug  Administration and eventually reaching the marketplace. It is further still  from approval for racing purposes.  </P> <P> "If (bleeding) or any of the other exertional diseases that plague and abuse  racehorses can be conquered, then the entire racing industry would gain,"  Boucher said. "The gain would result from eliminating the needless loss of  horses to disease, injury and death. That economic devastation drains trainers,  horse owners and racetrack management."  </P></p>

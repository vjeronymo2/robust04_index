			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC DROPS ROCK HUDSON MINISERIES;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: PRODUCERS AND WRITER OF 'AUTHORIZED' STORY SAY THE NETWORK IS  BASING ITS DECISION ON LACKLUSTER RATINGS FROM AN EARLIER ABC MOVIE.  </P> <P> The critically panned version of Rock Hudson's life as related in a two-hour  ABC movie last January may suffice as his television biography of record. NBC  has decided to drop its plans for a four-hour "authorized" miniseries that has  been in development for about a year and a half.  </P> <P> The decision has angered the producers and writer, who charge that NBC was  reacting to the lackluster ratings for the ABC movie rather than to the quality  of their script.  </P> <P> NBC denied the allegation. Tony Masucci, NBC senior vice president for movies  and miniseries, said through a spokeswoman that, "We felt it (the script)  didn't work well enough conceptually or dramatically to warrant further  development for a four-hour miniseries." He added that he was hoping for a  script "as big and compelling as the man."  </P> <P> The NBC spokeswoman pointed out that it's not unusual for a network to drop  such projects, noting that "70% of the shows in development never get made."  </P> <P> Carmen Culver, who wrote the script for the Hudson miniseries and was to have  co-produced it with Stan Margulies, with whom she had teamed on "The Thorn  Birds," called Masucci's explanation "a very strange response" inasmuch as he  never conveyed that reaction to her. Nor had Margulies or co-executive producer  Ken Kaufman been advised of any script problems.  </P> <P> Margulies, who won Emmys as the producer of "Roots" and "Roots: The Next  Generations," told on Friday that NBC claimed it was not a ratings decision,  shot back that "if the network says today is Friday, would you not want to  check the calendar?"  </P> <P> "I think what it comes down to in television, the determining factor, is who is  first," Margulies said. "First is more important than accuracy, the  well-written script, a quality production -- and I think that's what done us  in. We were second. I mean, I saw the ABC project and, apart from any questions  of taste -- which we don't have time to go into -- (there's) the question of  accuracy. I was just appalled at their interpretation of things that I know to  be otherwise.  </P> <P> "Now that is not the issue. They were on the air. They had the benefit of a  Rock Hudson audience and NBC, despite their protestations, looked at the  ratings and obviously felt if the first Rock Hudson project only did that, the  second one will not do as well."  </P> <P> The ABC movie, which aired Jan. 8, was knocked by many critics, attracted only  a so-so 24% of the audience and suffered some advertiser defections because of  concern over the depiction of Hudson's homosexuality. The actor had kept that  part of his life hidden from the public until the end -- when his AIDS was  revealed. He died in 1985 at age 58.  </P> <P> The movie was produced by Konigsberg/Sanitsky Co., written by Dennis Turner and  directed by John Nicolella. Major sources for the script were court records on  a civil suit brought against Hudson by his former lover, Marc Christian, and a  book by his former wife, Phyllis Gates. (Christian sued the Hudson estate and  Hudson's longtime secretary, Mark Miller, for emotional stress and won $5.5  million.)  </P> <P> At the center of the movie was a supposed plot by Hudson and Miller to keep the  actor's AIDS a secret from Christian. Miller told Christian in the movie that  Hudson was afflicted with anorexia. Miller has accused the movie of malicious  lies.  </P> <P> Culver's script for NBC was based on the authorized biography by Sara Davidson,  "Rock Hudson: His Story," and considerable research and interviews through the  cooperation of the Hudson estate.  </P> <P> "ABC decides to do a version dealing with two figures who occupied, I figured  out, four years of Rock's life, both with enormous axes to grind," she said.  </P> <P> Margulies said that the script was first turned into the network in August and  "it was the considered opinion of Ken (Kaufman, president of Patchett-Kaufman  Entertainment), Carmen and myself that the network notes (on proposed changes  it wanted) were about as few in number that any of us had experienced."  </P> <P> The word filtered down shortly thereafter that ABC was well into its Rock  Hudson movie and their project went "into limbo," Margulies said.  </P> <P> Kaufman said that Culver had written "a spectacular screenplay" but that NBC  made "a rational kind of networky decision which says, 'OK, the picture went  on, it's the same subject matter, it did a 24 share (considered "average"),  we're going to put a lot of money into a miniseries, should we make essentially  the same movie?' "  </P> <P> Margulies said that he'll meet with Kaufman to discuss the possibility of  selling the script to another network or cable channel.  </P> <P> "There was great foreign interest in this project and maybe if that base is  still there, we can find a way," he said. He maintained that "Rock Hudson was  the No. 1 international film star for eight consecutive years and, truly, one  skimpy two-hour movie did not mine the depths of that audience (for a Hudson  story)."  </P> <P> Kaufman agreed. "I think the movie should still be made that illuminates his  life the way it should be illuminated." I think someday it'll get made. I have  a lot of confidence in that."  </P></p>

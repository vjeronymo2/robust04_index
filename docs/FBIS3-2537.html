			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Economic development  and reform are the most important issues attracting attention  from deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),  according to a brief survey made by XINHUA just before the  opening of the current NPC session today.    The 2,800-plus deputies from all corners of China converged  in the Great Hall of the People a half hour before the opening.  When XINHUA reporters made a survey among 50 deputies, 30  considered economic development and reform the most important  issue.    In a government work report delivered today, Premier Li Peng  devoted the longest parts to the principles governing China's  economic work and arrangements to ensure substantial progress of  the economic restructuring. Therefore, what the deputies are  concerned about coincides with the priority of the government  work.    Other issues the deputies are interested in include the  reform of the state-owned enterprises, protection of peasants'  interests, development of ethnic minority areas, prices and  social order.    Though they touch upon many issues of common concern,  deputies from different regions, industries and circles pay  attention to different specific issues. For instance,  entrepreneur deputies, without exception, focus on establishment  of a modern enterprise system -- an important part of the  economic reform this year; and peasant deputies generally stress  development of rural economy and protection of peasants'  interests.    Four mayors surveyed said that they will try their best to  handle well relations among reform, development and stability.  This shows that the local executives pay more attention to the  overall situation.    Yue Qifeng, governor of Liaoning Province, said what he is  concerned most is to invigorate the state-owned enterprises.  Liaoning is China's leading heavy-industrial center with 1,200  big and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.    Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan provincial committee of  the Chinese Communist Party, said he concentrates his attention  to boosting peasants' income, as Sichuan is the biggest  agricultural province in China.    Li Yukun, deputy director of the Rugao Silk Carpet Factory  in  Jiangsu Province, said he is interested in reform of the foreign  trade system because his factory manufactures carpets for export.    Gesang Quje, a Tibetan and living Buddha from Qinghai  Province, voiced his hope for prosperity of ethnic minority  areas and stable state religious policy.    Zhang Shan, the Barcelona Olympic skeet champion, and Song  Shixiong, a noted Chinese sports commentator, concentrate their  attention on development of China's sports and physical culture.    As China will carry out an all-round economic reform and  make  breakthroughs in key fields this year, the interests structure  will be further readjusted. Therefore, people are concerned  with various major reform measures raised by the Chinese  Government, from different perspectives. The deputies will  earnestly deliberate the government work report, air their views  and put forward suggestions at the current session.</p>

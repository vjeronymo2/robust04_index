			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: VW changes down Doubtless Volkswagen derives a certain comfort from the hard luck stories of others in the European car industry. Daimler-Benz, Ford and Peugeot also had tales of woe yesterday. Yet VW's troubles run deeper than the cycle. They also present an opportunity for Mr Ferdinand Piech, who is to take charge in January. Volkswagen's largest problem is that its main Wolfsburg plant is both inefficient and expensive to run. It has tried to get round this - and simultaneously to exploit growing markets in eastern and southern Europe - by expanding abroad. But diluting its German costs in this way was never more than half a solution. High fixed domestic costs meant that lower capacity use in a downturn would feed through to the bottom line with brutal rapidity. It is thus no surprise that Volkswagen itself is talking openly of cutting its DM11 dividend, and that some believe the payout may have to be omitted altogether before things finally improve. Pessimists argue that the presence on the supervisory board of such luminaries as the Lower Saxony state president and Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the metalworkers' union, will only complicate the task of rationalisation. But Mr Piech's performance in charge of Audi shows he is made of stern stuff - and he was chosen by the supervisory board in preference to the less hawkish Mr Daniel Goeudevert, another top executive. The latest profit warning may be designed at least in part to prepare the political ground for some rigorous cost-trimming soon after he enters office. VW is certainly making a meal of it. Its estimate of a 20 per cent decline in the German car market next year is markedly more pessimistic than the consensus. Were Mr Piech to begin with an onslaught on costs, the slide in VW's share price which has seen it shed 43 per cent since May might yet be arrested. Until then, the downside risk remains considerable.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhal Sela'] </F>   [Text] The Palestinian center at East Jerusalem's Orient  House will remain the center of all political and diplomatic  activities. As has been the custom to date, all diplomatic and  political meetings with official Palestinian figures will  continue being arranged through the responsible Orient House  figures. This arrangement is not an organizational procedure  but rather a measure designed to emphasize Jerusalem's place in  the Palestinians' political doctrine and to reiterate the need  to discuss the status of Jerusalem in due time.    Remarks in this spirit were made yesterday by Faysal  al-Husayni at a special meeting with Jerusalem-based foreign  consuls held at Orient House.    Al-Husayni told the consuls who attended the meeting that  according to the Palestinian procedures, all of their activities  or those of official envoys from their countries will be  arranged through the Palestinian center in East Jerusalem.  Formal contacts will be always held in Jerusalem. Visits to  the self-rule territory will be coordinated through and with the  Jerusalem office.    DAVAR has been informed by al-Husayni's office that the  consuls voiced their approval of the arrangement.</p>

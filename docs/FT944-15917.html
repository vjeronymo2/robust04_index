			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Travel: A big-sky identity - Sarah Anderson considers the fierce pride of Montana's people The highway patrol officer was apologetic. He had stopped me for speeding, the needle of my speedometer having shot off the end of the dial. 'That will be a Dollars 5 fine,' he said. This was Montana - big-sky country - where car licence plates have a series of inverted V's followed by a long straight line: mountains in the west and then miles and miles of flat, flat land. The Rocky mountains in west Montana are brown and arid in summer, with sprinklings of coniferous trees on their parched slopes - odd in a region where rivers and creeks, full of trout, criss-cross the landscape. This western part of Montana is experiencing a cultural clash. This is not a new experience. The original inhabitants, the native indians, were appalled by the trappers, traders, buffalo hunters and prospectors who descended on them. In turn, these mountain men were horrified by the arrival of missionaries, settlers and ranchers, while the ranchers saw the next influx  -sheep herders and settled farmers - as . . . appalling. But whereas the cultural clashes of the past came in waves from the east, this time the incomers are mostly from the west, from California. As a result, the frontier is turning back on itself, and the latest newcomers are not popular. As a resident of Bowman told me: 'If I find out someone's from somewhere far away, I am rude to them. I get annoyed and angry. I feel they were in their place and it got ruined. Now they are coming to my place to ruin it.' His views are not unusual, as the messages on T-shirts imply: 'Montana Sucks: Now go Home and Tell Your Friends', and 'Beautify Montana: put a Californian on a Bus'. A notice on the way into Livingston, a small town in the west, shows how the residents have even resorted to irony to express their feelings: 'Have you hugged a tourist today?' The changes are both rapid and radical, and the cappuccino cowboys and Lycra-clad mountain bikers with their 'ranchettes' and trophy homes are sneered at. But the old economy, which depended on ranching as well as the now-finished industries of logging and mining, could no longer sustain the population. Montana's new economy is based on property and recreation, and although the newcomers are turning the old Wild West into the Virtual West - a term used by William Kittredge to describe the practice of turning simple land into safe, watered, walled, stuccoed interpretations of the old west - a new west had to emerge. And the newcomers, many from Hollywood, do have money. It would be easy to romanticise the past, but far better that it should be appreciated for what it was, with all its shortcomings. In western culture, which is both environmentally aware and travel crazy, urban dwellers tend to go to the wilderness to search for 'great places and sacred places' in order to get a quick high and to try and capture a sense of the violent past. However, as the frontier turns back on itself, so the violence changes from being predominantly rural to predominantly urban. The cities are the new wild places. The fragile landscape desperately needs help, but the environmentalists have not provided all the answers. There is deep suspicion of those who do not live in the west but like to dictate what they believe should happen there. The harsh and spartan life endured by the original pioneers created an individualistic, independent and tough breed of people whose descendants are now pivotal figures on the extreme right. Neo-Nazism and the Ku Klux Klan have strongholds in Montana. Both movements appear to be growing because people fear losing control of their lives. Jobs and traditional uses of land are both threatened, and it is important that newcomers recognise that the locals need to earn a living. As the editor of High Country News says: 'God, who wants a place with nothing but a bunch of yuppies running around?'</p>

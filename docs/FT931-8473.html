			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Deficit reduction package puzzles analysts - Defence Spending PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package includes substantial savings on defence spending over the next five years, but military analysts are puzzled by the details of the defence budget plan. Mr Clinton proposes a steady decline in defence budget authority from Dollars 274.3bn (Pounds 193.1bn) in the current fiscal year to Dollars 263.7bn in 1994 and Dollars 248.4bn in 1997, rising again to Dollars 254.2bn in 1998. Over the five years from 1994 to 1998, this plan would cut a cumulative total of Dollars 127bn from the defence budget projections of former President George Bush. But the Bush spending plan, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, does not recognise additional expenses of over Dollars 35bn in potential weapons systems overruns, Dollars 12bn resulting from Congress delaying programme cancellations, Dollars 5.4bn for industrial conversion and Dollars 24.5bn for cleaning up hazardous waste on defence property. It also assumes Dollars 53bn in management savings, most of which the GAO says may not be achieved. With little time to produce a complete budget proposal, Mr Les Aspin, the new secretary of defence, appears to have done exactly what he used to complain about when he was chairman of the House of Representatives armed services committee. Instead of building a US defence plan from the bottom up, he has simply cut from the existing pattern, in effect asking each service to come up with a specified amount of savings, rather than radically reviewing each branch's size and roles. This approach, which remains to be fleshed out with details of the specific weapons programmes that are to be cut, seems likely to reduce the US armed forces to around 1.4m people, 200,000 less than projected under the Bush plan. Some outside groups that have proposed a more fundamental reassessment of the structure of the US armed forces believe this year's budget is a timid first step. 'This is the first chance of a new administration coming in after the end of the Cold War to make real changes, and they are not even attempting it; they are tinkering around the edges,' said Mr Marcus Corbin, a budget analyst at the Centre for Defence Information, a defence policy group founded by retired military officers. With more time, Mr Aspin may prepare a more root and branch review for next year's budget, but some wonder whether the administration will by then have lost momentum and missed the chance for substantial defence revisions.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Institutions interested in property investments BRITISH institutional investors are showing more interest in domestic property investment than at any time in the last three years, according to a new survey. The Smith New Court/Gallup Survey of Fund Managers for June showed that 22 per cent of those surveyed planned to increase their holdings of UK property, the highest level since the survey began in July 1990. Last month, 12 per cent said they intended to make UK property investments and in February, none was prepared to make such a move. The survey, conducted on June 7th and 8th, covered 95 institutions with Pounds 661bn under management. A balance of 6 per cent of managers planned to increase their holdings of UK equities, down from 18 per cent in May and the lowest level for planned investment in British shares this year. In other asset categories, fund managers were less enthusiastic about foreign equities than a month ago, with a balance of only 6 per cent planning to increase European exposures, 9 per cent raising Japanese weightings and 24 per cent increasing investments in other areas. In May, the weightings were 13, 24 and 28 per cent respectively. There has been an increase in the popularity of index-linked gilts since March. In the June poll, a balance of 8 per cent planned to raise investments in that sector, up from 1 per cent in March.</p>

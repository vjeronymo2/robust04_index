			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Book Reivew: Look back in longing Changing Fortunes: The world's money and the threat to American leadership By Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten Times Books New York. Dollars 25 The lightness of touch Mr Paul Volcker achieves in his account of the beginning of the Third World debt crisis perfectly captures the flavour of this delightful book. 'The crisis landed on our doorstep - or, more literally for me, at a fishing ranch in Wyoming - early in the week of August 9. That morning, I had great difficulty catching anything. That afternoon, I was visited by the chairman of the Continental Illinois Bank, who flew out to tell me the bank was in so much trouble that it would need Federal Reserve support. The next day my office called to tell me Mexico was about out of money, so I headed back to Washington almost fishless.' In several decades of public service, Mr Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Mr Toyoo Gyohten, a former top official at Japan's Ministry of Finance, participated in nearly every important episode in international monetary policy. They have produced a wry, deftly understated account of momentous events, unblemished by any trace of pomposity. The book grew out of series of seminars at Princeton University and obviously benefited from the editing skills of Mr Lawrence Malkin, a senior correspondent at the International Herald Tribune. It is organised as a series of paired essays. The pattern is for Mr Volcker to provide a lengthy US perspective on an important episode - such as his battle against inflation in the early 1980s. Mr Gyohten then provides a shorter, but often surprisingly pithy, account of the same events as seen from Tokyo. As monetary history, the effect is unique: a full, rich stereo sound in place of the usual mono reproduction. Perhaps the book's greatest virtue is its ability to put events in a long perspective. Changing Fortunes opens in the 1950s long before Japan is perceived as any kind of economic threat. Mr Gyohten enters the story as an impoverished graduate student at Princeton trying to survive on one ham-and-lettuce sandwich a day. By the end, the tables are almost completely turned. It is American, rather than Japanese, goods that are seen as cheap and shoddy. It is the US, rather than Japan, that is running big external deficits. It is the US, rather than Japan, that is dependent on the goodwill of foreign investors. Mr Gyohten, once supplicant, has become a courteous paymaster. Mr Volcker's account of events is tinged with a kind of sadness or resignation. He explains how, for the first decade or so of his career, he took both American pre-eminence and the Bretton Woods international monetary system for granted. 'It's hard now, after all the changes in exchange rates and disturbances in financial markets, to recapture the strength of the emotional and intellectual commitment to the international stability of the dollar and the fixed gold price,' he writes. One of the book's highlights is a vivid account of the collapse of Bretton Woods during the Nixon presidency. Mr Volcker, then a Treasury under-secretary, reported to John 'Typhoon' Connally, Mr Nixon's strong-minded Texan Treasury Secretary. Mr Volcker recounts how he feared the suspension of gold convertibility and devaluation of the dollar would be seen as a humiliation for the US. In the event he learned 'a good lesson about what masterful politicians can do.' Like Churchill after Dunkirk, Nixon and Connally managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In the US at least, the emergency package was seen as a triumph and a fresh start. Twenty years later, Mr Volcker remains nostalgic for the stability of Bretton Woods. 'The monetary system has not been put back together in a way that really seems to satisfy anyone. And somehow we are still complaining about unfair military, aid and trade burdens.' The book offers a fascinating account of the Plaza and Louvre exchange rate accords of the mid and late 1980s. But it is clear that neither author has much respect for these half-hearted attempts to co-ordinate policies. Mr Gyohten criticises Mr James Baker, then US Treasury Secretary, for aggressively pushing policies that were in the US rather than the global interest. 'I am forced to argue that the pattern of policymaking did corrupt the fundamental long-term relationship between Japan and the United States,' he writes. Mr Volcker is a little more circumspect, but he too criticises the US for being 'incapable of matching our action to our analysis'. Both emphasise the failure to back exchange rate pronouncements with concrete budget, trade or structural policies. Changing Fortunes ends on a somewhat pessimistic note. It was no accident, the authors argue, that the breakdown of Bretton Woods led to weaker growth, higher inflation and an increase in protectionist pressures. Yet while praising the regional exchange rate stability achieved through the EMS, they have little confidence that another era of global stability can be established. The main reason is the immaturity of the world's biggest economy: lacking a firm commitment to either price stability or budgetary balance, the US is incapable of providing the necessary leadership. How frustrating for officials such as Mr Volcker who retain memories of brighter times.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Tax-free gold barred - Payments in Kind / The Budget and You Employees can no longer look forward to a gold bar in their Christmas stockings. The government has closed a loophole which exempted payments in commodities from the National Insurance net. The Department of Social Security (which is responsible for NI) has been fighting a cat-and-mouse battle with employers and their accountants for some years. The key element was that payments-in-kind were exempted from NI; with no upper limit on employers' NI, there was every incentive for companies to find unusual ways of paying staff. Every time, the DSS blocked an NI avoidance scheme, such as gilts or unit trusts, some bright accountant thought of a new one. The last change in regulations, which referred to 'financial securities', turned the focus to commodities. Gold bars were the most common option, with the gold being held in Hong Kong or Switzerland, to avoid VAT. By arrangement with a bullion dealer, the employee quickly turned the gold into cash. Other commodities used have included coffee beans, giving employees the choice between Gold Blend and gold bars. 'These schemes were becoming fairly widespread, especially in the City,' said David Rothenburg of accountants Blick Rothenburg. 'I don't think anyone believed it was going to be allowed to continue.' The new regulations ensure that gold bullion, other tradable assets (principally commodities), and vouchers representing them, are brought into the NI net. The regulations achieve this by introducing a liability for NI contributions on 'any payment made in the form of a beneficial interest in any asset capable of being sold on a recognised investment exchange or the London Bullion Market.' The Inland Revenue is also cracking down on commodity schemes, which have been used to avoid the Pay as You Earn system. The advantage of commodity payments was that, while employees were still liable to tax, they had to pay it much later than under the PAYE system. The Revenue proposes to make employees account for PAYE tax when they pay their staff in marketable assets or 'with assets which are not immediately marketable, but where the employer arranges for the employee to convert them into cash.' PAYE will also be applied to vouchers and credit tokens which are used to provide these assets. The Revenue regulations will come into effect after Royal Assent to the Finance Bill. The NI rules came into effect at midnight on Budget day. It is not clear whether the cat and mouse game can continue. According to Caroline Garnham, tax and trusts specialist at solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons, 'any loopholes will depend on the legislation. Until one sees the legislation, one can't see where the loopholes will be.' However the DSS said it would 'continue to monitor closely any new schemes designed to circumvent liability for NICs. This will include cases where employers introduce convoluted remuneration packages which have no discernible advantage other than a limitation of NI liability.'</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (14): A unitised home for ready cash  -Money market funds MONEY MARKET funds are fast emerging as a potential alternative to building societies as a home for savers' cash holdings. A money market fund pools together the deposits of savers and invests them in the short-term debt of banks and other institutions. The depositor has units in the fund, which rise in value as interest is accumulated. Since a money market fund does not need a vast branch network, it should have lower costs than most building societies. Thus it should always be able to offer a competitive return close to the level of base rates. One or two building societies will nearly always be offering accounts which beat money market rates at any time. But all too often, such returns are 'special offers' which apply only in the short term; rates fall again once sufficient deposits have been attracted. Safety. Can a money market fund reduce your capital? There are two obvious forms of risk. The first is that the institution offering the fund could go bust. Here the investor has rather better protection than the building society depositor. Most money market funds - the ones classed as unit trusts - are covered by the Investors Compensation Scheme. The investor therefore has 100 per cent cover on his first Pounds 30,000 deposit and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000 - a maximum protection of Pounds 48,000. Contrast that with the building society depositor, whose maximum compensation is limited to 80 per cent of his first Pounds 20,000 deposit - a maximum therefore of Pounds 16,000. The second level of risk with a money market fund is the possibility that the fund will invest in a bank or other institution which goes bust. Here, funds can offer two forms of comfort. First, they only invest in banks with good credit ratings - and would therefore steer clear of the likes of BCCI. Second, the fund will have many holdings - so even a disaster at one bank will have little impact. Perhaps the best reassurance for British investors is that money market funds are widespread in the US, where bank failures are commonplace, and yet problems for fund holders are virtually unknown. Flexibility How can investors get their money out of a fund? Most operate on a postal basis; investors must redeem units in the fund and this will take a week or so. However, two funds offer easier access. Fidelity gives a chequebook to those who invest Pounds 5,000 in its fund. Cheques can then be used to pay for substantial items such as holidays, though payments must be for a minimum of Pounds 250. M&amp;G's recently launched Treasury fund (which invests in Treasury bills) also offers a chequing facility, but this only allows the investor to transfer money into a bank or building society account. Tax Interest accumulates within the fund net of basic-rate tax. Non-taxpayers will have to reclaim the tax from the Inland Revenue; higher-rate taxpayers will face an additional charge. Most money market funds credit the interest in the form of an increasing unit price. Assume that you had bought 1,000 units at 100p in a fund which yielded 5 per cent net. After a year, the unit price should have grown to 105p, making your 1,000 units worth Pounds 1,050. Fidelity operates a slightly different system. The unit price stays the same, at 100p; interest is used to buy more units. So if you had 1,000 units at 100p, and the fund yielded 5 per cent net, then, after one year, you would have 1,050 units at 100p. Charges The manager's charges obviously have an important effect on investor returns. Most money market unit trusts have no initial charge and a small annual fee (Fidelity's is 0.5 per cent, M&amp;G's is 0.6 per cent). Returns quoted in the press are net of this charge, so what you see is what you get. Performance According to Finstat, the best money market fund over the three years to January 1, was Smith &amp; Williamson Cash with a return of 30.2 per cent. The average for the sector over that period was 27.8 per cent. Over 1992, the best performer was Lazard Money Market, with a return of 7 per cent.</p>

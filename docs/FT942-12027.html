			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): French skies are opened up The European Commission's ruling last Wednesday that France must allow competition on several routes from Orly airport to the south of France raises the prospect of more convenient, and cheaper, travel to French destinations. The Commission said that France must immediately open a route from London Heathrow to Orly and must allow TAT European airlines  - 49 per cent owned by British Airways - to compete with Air Inter, Air France's domestic subsidiary, on the Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles routes after a six month grace period. British Airways hopes to start services between Heathrow and Orly in June. Since most domestic French flights operate from Orly, it would provide access to a valuable hub for French holiday and business destinations.</p>

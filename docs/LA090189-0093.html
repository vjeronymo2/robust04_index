			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY FINDS DEPRESSION NOT A CANCER CAUSE  </P> <P> Undermining a popular belief that depression can play a role in the development  of cancer, a 10-year federal study has found that people who experience  depression are no more likely than others to come down with the disease.  </P> <P> The finding, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.,  contradicts a centuries-old hypothesis that has attracted new interest in  recent years amid a growing curiosity about psychological factors in disease.  </P> <P> "These findings should diminish any concern that people have about (depression)  being an important factor" in cancer, said Bernard Fox, a professor of  psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine and an expert in the  field.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Biologic Processes  </P> <P> "Overall, people should pay more attention to the biologic processes that  stimulate cancer," Fox said. "For example, by not eating too much fat . . .  stopping smoking . . . or avoiding carcinogens like radon and (chemicals) in  the workplace."  </P> <P> The findings, by researchers at the National Institute on Aging, run counter to  those of a now-famous study published in 1981 that found that men with evidence  of a high rate of depression were twice as likely as others to develop or die  of cancer.  </P> <P> Since that time, other researchers have reached conflicting conclusions. But  specialists in the field say there is a widely held belief among the public  that depression can somehow contribute to the onset of cancer.  </P> <P> "There is a danger, which is that people feel responsible for being sick," said  George Kaplan of the California Department of Health Services. ". . . I don't  think it's particularly useful to have people feel . . . that they are  responsible for this disease."  </P> <P> "I think that we have to question whether it's a given that states of mental  distress cause cancer," said David K. Wellisch, professor of medical psychology  at UCLA School of Medicine. "Many people think that's a given. This (study)  reminds us that it's not."  </P> <P> The federal study looked only at the onset of cancer, not at survival among  those already diagnosed with the disease. Researchers like Wellisch believe  depression can play a critical role in accelerating the death of cancer  patients.  </P> <P> "I see that as life-threatening and life-limiting," Wellisch said, "because the  patient who is depressed and who has cancer is . . . less prone to be able to  cope with treatment and as a result faces greater risk of mortality."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stanford Findings  </P> <P> One recent study, reported in May by researchers at Stanford University, found  that breast cancer patients who got emotional and social support through group  therapy survived up to twice as long as patients on medical treatment alone.  </P> <P> In the current study, the federal researchers tracked 6,403 men and women who  had taken part in a federal health and nutrition study in the early 1970s. All  had been examined using two standard psychological tests to gauge mental health  and depression, and their hospital records were obtained.  </P> <P> Of those participants who appeared to suffer repeatedly from depression, 11%  were diagnosed with cancer or died of it during the 10-year period of the  depression study. Of those considered not depressed, 10% were diagnosed or  died.  </P> <P> The difference between 10% and 11% is not considered statistically significant.  </P> <P> "I think it's pretty clear from our results that people who are experiencing  symptoms of depression need not be concerned that their symptoms are a risk for  cancer," said Alan B. Zonderman, an author of the study and a psychologist at  the National Institute on Aging.  </P> <P> "My feeling is that the load of evidence is consistent with either no real  relationship or a very weak one," said Fox of Boston University School of  Medicine, who wrote an accompanying editorial published in the journal.  </P> <P> Suspicions of links between depression and cancer have existed at least since  Galen, the 2nd-Century Greek physician and writer, researchers say. More  recently, they received some support from observations and studies of people  with serious psychiatric disorders.  </P> <P> The 1981 study, which involved 2,020 men employed by the Western Electric Co.  in Chicago, stimulated new interest in the subject. Since that time, several  studies have appeared to contradict the 1981 finding while others have  partially supported it.  </P> <P> "There has been tremendous interest in that (1981) study," said Kaplan, chief  of California's human population laboratory and the author of a contradictory  study. Kaplan attributed that interest in part to the new field of so-called  psychoneuroimmunology.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nature of Field  </P> <P> Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of links between psychological states and  the brain and the immune system. Researchers are exploring whether  psychological conditions like bereavement can influence immune system  functioning and one's ability to ward off disease.  </P> <P> Why the studies have reached conflicting conclusions is unclear, researchers  say. The answer may lie in methods used to measure depression. Different  researchers have used different standardized tests, some of which may be  insufficiently precise, researchers say.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Shekelle, author of the 1981 study, said in a telephone interview  Thursday that while his study supported the suggestion that depression "might  promote the development and spread" of cancer, he never intended to assert it  was a cause of the disease.  </P></p>

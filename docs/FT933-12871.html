			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Arts body may face 10% cut in funding MR PETER BROOKE, the national heritage secretary, yesterday asked the Arts Council to report on how it would cope with a cut of 10 per cent or Pounds 700,000 in its administration costs. But he said he did not intend to press it to adopt radical streamlining proposals made in a Pounds 60,000 government-commissioned review by Price Waterhouse, the management consultants. Mr Brooke reaffirmed in a Commons statement the 'arm's-length principle' for arts funding, saying the government's role was to set the council's 'legal, financial and institutional framework'. He said: 'It is not for the government to seek to intervene in matters of artistic judgment, although there can be occasions when ministers can properly act as a conduit for public and political opinion.' MPs were told the council had until October to review its range of activities. Mr Brooke added that the council's membership would be cut from 20 to 16. In the spring Mr Brooke asked Price Waterhouse to review the workings of the council. It came up with three options, saving Pounds 429,000, Pounds 847,000 or Pounds 2.2m. Mr Anthony Everitt, the council's secretary-general, said the announcement was good news and 'a victory for common sense'.</p>

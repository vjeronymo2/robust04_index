This is a successful session of  historical significance. The "Decision of the CPC Central  Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a  Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted at the session  specifies -- in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress -- the goals and  basic principles for restructuring the economy set by the 14th  CPC National Congress, further expands those goals and  principles in some areas, and formulates the overall plan for  the establishment of a socialist market economic structure.  This is our program of action ao restructure the economy in the  nineties. It will surely exert a major and far-reaching impact  on China's reform, opening, and socialist modernization drive.    I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to bring  up some points with regard to the current situation, the  implementation of the "decision," and ways to build up the party  and exercise effective party leadership.  <H5>  I. On the Current Situation </H5>   Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important  speeches in early 1992 and the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress, we have opened up a new situation in work in  all sectors over the past year. The economy is growing  vigorously, fresh progress has been made in implementing  measures of reform and opening up aimed at establishing a  socialist market economic system, and new achievements have been  scored in all other undertakings. Today, the country enjoys  economic development, political stability, national unity, and  social progress. The overall situation is decidedly good.    This year, the economy has maintained its momentum of fast  growth on top of the breakneck growth recorded in 1992. The  gross national product grew by 13.3 percent in the first three  quarters. It is expected that this high growth rate will be  maintained for the whole year. Industrial production by  enterprises at the village level or higher is expected to grow  by about 21 percent. A comparatively good harvest has been  reported in the agricultural sector. As for some prominent  contradictions and problems that have emerged in the course of  the breakneck economic growth, the CPC Central Committee and  State Council have taken a slew of measures to solve them.  Particularly the measures we have taken since June to strengthen  and improve macroeconomic regulation and control and to rectify  order in the banking and other economic sectors have -- thanks  to the common efforts of all quarters over the past few months  -- have yielded positive results. The situation in the banking  sector is stabilizing. The overheated development in real  estate and development zones as well as the excessive growth in  investment have been brought under control. The construction of  key state projects has picked up speed and inflation has, more  or less, been brought under control. Prices in the foreign  exchange swap market have decreased and have basically returned  to normal. By and large, no IOU's were issued in procuring  agricultural and sideline products harvested in the summer;  funds for autumn-harvested crops have been allocated. Prices of  major capital goods including steel products have come down  again. The situation in terms of state revenues and  expenditures has improved somewhat. Income has continued to  increase in both urban and rural areas. The economy as a whole  is developing in a sound manner. Facts have borne out that the  measures taken by the CPC Central Committee and State Council to  strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control are  absolutely correct and necessary. Judging from the current  trends, we will still be able to maintain a rather fast economic  growth rate and bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816  6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy.    Reform and opening up have picked up pace noticeably this  year. Many major reform measures are either being carried out or  will soon be promulgated. This year, we have seized the  opportunity and taken big steps in implementing price reforms by  freeing the prices of many industrial capital goods. Over 90  percent of the counties (cities) have lifted price controls over  grain procurement and procurement and selling prices. The  degree of the application of market prices has, on the whole,  risen continuously. Opening up to the outside world has  continued to develop both in scope and in depth, and there has  been a new upsurge in foreign investment in China. One of the  main characteristics for strengthening and improving  macroeconomic regulation and control is the idea of solving the  contradictions and problems in the march forward by deepening  reforms and by employing mostly economic and legal means  supplemented, certainly, with the necessary administrative  means. Practice has shown that this approach is successful.  This has provided us with valuable experience, showing us that  the fundamental way to solve the deep-seated problems in  economic and social development lies in deepening reform.    The present social and political situation in the country  is also good. This year has seen the transition from the old  leading bodies to the new, following the smooth change of terms  in people's congresses, governments, and committees for the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the  central as well as local levels, and the convening of national  congresses, one after another, for mass organizations such as  the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation,  and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. New progress has  been made in building a socialist democracy and legal system  with the formulation of some major laws and regulations.  Propaganda and ideological work have been strengthened. The  central authorities have paid attention to promoting clean  administration and the anticorruption struggle, with the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Council  having made specific arrangements which are currently being  implemented in earnest by various localities and departments.  Even closer ties have been forged between the party and the  masses following the investigation and handling of some serious  and major cases and the checking of some malpractice. The  social and economic order has been maintained, thanks to the  further strengthening of the comprehensive management of public  security, the prompt defeat of domestic and foreign hostile  forces' plots to create disturbances, and the proper handling of  some emergencies.    Generally speaking, developments and changes in the  international situation also are favorable to us. The world  will likely enjoy a relatively long period of peace following  the end of the confrontation between the East and the West. The  further improvement of our nation's relations with neighboring  countries, in particular, is conducive to creating peaceful  surroundings and an international environment favorable to  economic construction. A worldwide economic structural  readjustment would help us attract foreign investment and  technology. The Asia-Pacific region's growing influence on the  world also is favorable to us.    In short, the present domestic and international situation  is  comparatively favorable, and we really are facing a great  opportunity for reform and development. There are not many  historical opportunities like this. We must seize the favorable  opportunity; quicken the pace of reform, opening up to the  outside world, and modernization; and further enhance our  composite national strength. It was based exactly on this  consideration that the Central Committee Political Bureau had  suggested that the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee make a decision on the issue of establishing a  socialist market economic system, seek a common understanding  and uniform steps throughout the party, vigorously deepen  reform, and promote economic development. We believe that our  nation's reform, opening up to the outside world, and  modernization will take on a new aspect after this plenary  session.  <H3>  II. Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the  "Decision" </H3>   Since the 14th CPC National Congress determined the goal of  establishing a socialist market economic system, comrades from  different quarters have hoped for a further step forward in  formulating a more complete and systematic argument on the  socialist market economic system to facilitate the better  organization and advancement of the reform of the economic  structure. We all noticed that while market mechanisms are  playing an increasingly important role in our economic life, the  sluggishness of reform in certain fields has adversely affected  the establishment of a new system and the healthy development of  the national economy. We have made breakthroughs and  accumulated experience in reforms in various fields over the  past decade or so, and we also have conditions ready for  bringing about the overall advancement of the reform. We now  need to formulate an overall plan and to stress standardization  in our system and policies. Although the basic framework  outlined by the decision of this plenary session for the  socialist market economic system still needs to be examined and  continuously improved in practice, its existence can enhance our  ability to anticipate the kind of guidance needed for the reform  work and make the reform even more fruitful.    The "decision" is rich and all-embracing in its contents,  with all 50 of its articles being of great significance. Here I  would like to present a few opinions on implementing the  guidelines of the "decision":    1. Correctly handle the relations between reform  and development. With fairly favorable conditions at home  and abroad and with China's great potential for economic  development, it is possible to maintain a comparatively high  growth rate for a long period. It is necessary for us to focus  on economic development, seize the current favorable  opportunities, and concentrate our efforts on improving the  economic situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is absolutely correct  when he says that "development is the last word" and "the final  resolution of the problems lies in developing the economy." We  should follow the guiding spirit of the plenary meeting and  waste no time in introducing various already-prepared reform  measures so as to create a favorable structure and conditions  for the economy. In arranging economic work, it is necessary to  pay attention to creating a pliable environment for reform. New  thinking is also needed for development, which should truly be  directed at focusing on economic performance rather than on the  same old road of extensive management which indiscriminately  seeks greater output value and expands the extent of investment.  The state can become rich and strong and the people's  livelihood can be improved only when production is improved and  more wealth is created. The experience of many years tell us  that we should pay attention to two major things at all times:  strengthening the role of agriculture as the foundation of the  national economy, and improving state-owned large- and  medium-sized enterprises. As for agricultural problems, the CPC  Central Committee has already convened a meeting and formulated  general and specific policies. It is imperative to  conscientiously organize people to carry out these policies to  ensure the stable development of agriculture and the overall  rural economy. From now time, more efforts should be made to  improve state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises. The  reinvigoration of China's economy depends mainly on state-owned  large- and medium- sized enterprises. Many problems now facing  us can be solved by deepening reforms. The reform of  state-owned large- and medium- sized enterprises is a key and  difficult point in China's efforts to reform its economic  structure. The "decision" has been a big step forward in the  thinking about reforming enterprises because it has  distinctively pointed out the problems of building a modern  enterprise system. The "decision" summarizes the basic  characteristics of the modern enterprise system and points out  the orientation for the reform of enterprises. It is imperative  to thoroughly deepen the reform of enterprises in accordance  with the requirements of the "decision" so as to truly improve  state-owned enterprises and to enable it to play a guiding and  backbone role in economic development. This is not only an  important economic issue which affects the development of the  national economy as a whole but also an important political  issue which affects the destiny of socialism. We should work  hard to resolve this issue.    2. Correctly handle the relations between  strengthening macrocontrol and developing the role of the  market. A socialist market economy is integrated with the  basic system of socialism. The establishment of a socialist  market economy seeks to enable the market to play a fundamental  role in the allocation of resources, under the state's  macrocontrol. The macrocontrol of the state and the role of the  market mechanism, both of which are essential requirements of  the socialist market economic structure, are integrated,  mutually supplementary, and mutually promoting. To change the  traditional planned economic system, it is necessary to  emphasize the importance of fully permitting the market's  fundamental role in allocating resources. If we fail to do so,  there will be no socialist market economy. But, we should also  see the negative aspects of spontaneity, rashness, and  sluggishness existing in the market. Such weaknesses and  inadequacies need to be amended and overcome by the state's  macroguidance and -control of market activities. In today's  world, there is not a single country whose economy is not under  the government's control. Being a socialist country, China  should do a good job and have better conditions for doing so in  macroeconomic regulation and control. The current problems are:  The market is not completely permitted to play its role in many  respects, and there exist the phenomena of unbridled development  and a chaotic economic order in the market. We should actively  cultivate and develop the market system, continue to carry out  the reform of the price and commodity circulation system,  develop the factors of production market, and improve and  strengthen the control, management, and supervision of the  market. Practices in 1993 also show that to establish a  socialist market economic structure, it is necessary to work  hard both in giving full play to the role of market mechanisms  and in strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. The  key points of the work for each period may be different.  According to various actual conditions, sometimes more emphasis  will be placed on the role of the market and sometimes on the  macrocontrol by the state. But, while emphasizing one aspect, we  must not neglect or pay no attention to the other side.    3. We must give equal emphasis to two fronts and do  well in both. In the course of implementing reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive, we must consistently  persist in the principle of giving equal emphasis to two fronts  and doing well in both. Having learned a profound lesson in  this regard, we must never repeat the mistake of emphasizing one  to the neglect of the other.    At a time when everyone is focusing on promoting reform and  opening up and developing the economy, we must not overlook the  promotion of spiritual civilization. Emphasizing the principles  and tasks of promoting socialist spiritual civilization, the  "decision" sets out some requirements, particularly in pointing  out that under a socialist market economy, we should actively  propagate the need to persist in a correct outlook on life and a  civilized, healthy style of life and work to promote public and  professional ethics. All these remarks have specific aims. It  is a fact of life that money worship, extreme individualism,  decadent life-styles, and other social evils are spreading, some  of which have developed to quite a serious extent. We must take  resolute steps to combat them. We must unequivocally encourage  what is right, overcome what is evil, and promote in the whole  society a good social climate that is eminently healthy,  progressive, and positive. We must carry forward our fine  national culture and traditions, learn from the fruits of all  advanced foreign civilizations and, however, never mistake their  dregs for their best parts.    Comrade Mao Zedong spoke this famous dictum: "The  unification of the state, the unity of the people, and the  solidarity of the nationalities in the country -- these are the  fundamental guarantees of the success of our cause." Without  political unity and stability, we will not be able to accomplish  anything. Generally speaking, the situation today is good. We  must be prepared for danger in times of peace and never lower  our guard or become careless. We must strengthen judicial,  procuratorial, and public security work and improve all facets  of public security, strengthen the legal system, step up law  enforcement, and punish according to the law all sorts of  crimes. We must correctly handle the contradictions within the  people and promptly remove all destabilizing factors to  consolidate the political situation characterized by stability  and unity. We must conscientiously carry out the party's  policies on nationalities and religion and extensively carry out  education featuring Marxist views on nationalities and religion.    Continued efforts should be made to carry out the fight  against corruption. Building a clean government and combating  corruption constitute essential conditions for the establishment  of the socialist market economic structure. These also have a  great bearing on the destiny of the ongoing reform and on the  destiny of the party and the country. The Central Committee's  line, principles, and policies for the anticorruption struggle  are clear and specific, and they enjoy the heartfelt support of  the vast ranks of cadres and people. The focal points of this  struggle are leading party and government organs,  law-enforcement departments, and economic administrative  departments, as well as the investigation and prosecution of  major cases. Party members, high- and middle- ranking cadres in  particular, must heighten their awareness and set a good example  by being honest and observing discipline. As for those corrupt  elements, we must punish them in accordance with state laws and  party discipline, no matter who they are. We must not tolerate  or abet their wrongdoing. The fight against corruption is a  long-term and arduous task and should be carried out with  unremitting effort. We must see to it that the targets set by  the Central Committee for the different periods of this struggle  are attained.    4. Fully mobilize all positive factors and bring  the initiatives of all sides into play. Whether in the  past revolutionary war or during the current reform, opening,  and modernization construction, only by closely relying on the  broad mass of cadres and the masses, by fully bringing into play  the initiatives of all sides, and by pooling the wisdom and  efforts of everyone can we expect to achieve success. We have  always stressed the need to bring into play the initiatives of  both the central government and local governments. The  "decision," by giving full consideration to our country's actual  conditions and to work in localities, formulated the direction  and principles of the reforms of the fiscal, taxation, and  financial systems. The purpose of employing a tax-sharing  system, of a rational division of jurisdiction between the  central and local governments, and of determining the  revenue-expense ratio between the central and local governments  in a rational manner is to straighten out the economic  relationship and to standardize economic activities.  Strengthening the central bank's regulatory and supervisory  functions over the currency, separating policy-related financing  from commercial financing, and attaining a unified exchange rate  constitute a major reform of the financial system which involves  readjusting the relationship between the interests of the  central government and those of localities. A reform of fiscal,  taxation, and financial structures is required to develop a  socialist market economy, which is not only compatible with  accepted international practices but which also takes into  account China's characteristics and reality. By so doing, it  will be conducive to giving play to the initiatives of the  central government and that of localities, to doing an even  better job of economic construction, and to attaining  coordinated socioeconomic development. When dealing with the  relationship between the central government and localities, the  central government should give consideration to localities'  difficulties. As for localities, they should establish the  concept of the national interest. Whereas the national interest  should take care of local interests, local interests should  subordinate themselves to the national interest. The fact that  a consensus over the reform plan for fiscal, taxation, and  financial structures has been reached through discussion and  coordination shows that everyone has taken the national interest  into consideration and that everyone upholds the concept of the  national interest. We should fully understand the far-reaching  significance of the reform, and with one heart and one mind and  with joint efforts, we should accomplish the reform tasks.    Our country is a vast country. Economic development in  various regions is rather imbalanced. Because there are  historical reasons for the regional imbalances, it will take  time to narrow these gaps. The policy and principles of the  party and the state are to bring two initiatives into play: the  initiative of the economically developed regions and that of the  less developed regions. Our basic principle in this respect is  clear. It is advisable for economically developed regions to  fully make use of their own advantageous conditions and existing  foundation to achieve even faster development, to rapidly raise  the economy to new heights, to help promote development in  less-developed regions, and to make an even greater contribution  to the country's modernization undertaking. To gradually  realize the goal of common prosperity, the state has adopted  policies to vigorously support economic development in  less-developed regions of central and western China. With the  deepening of reform and the expansion of reform, regions in  central and western China have gradually improved their  conditions for developing the economy. Through their own  efforts and with the state's support, it is completely possible  that they can gradually accelerate the pace of development by  fully bringing into play their advantages, including natural  resources and other advantages.    When dealing with the relationship between the state,  enterprises, and staff members and workers, it is necessary to  bring initiatives into play. Within the enterprises, it is  necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of the party  organization, of management personnel, and of all staff members  and workers. Among the people, it is necessary to bring into  play the initiatives of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and  people from various circles. It is necessary to enhance national  unity and to bring into play the initiatives of all  nationalities in the nation. We should develop the enthusiasm  of trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, women's  federations, and other mass organizations, as well as democratic  parties. Mobilizing the initiatives of the broad mass of cadres  and the masses depends on deepening reform and perfecting  various systems; and it is also necessary to rely on ideological  and political work to exploit our political advantages.    All in all, our principle is to give full play to the  initiatives of all sides, to mobilize all positive factors, to  turn negative factors into positive ones, and to devote all our  energy to the great undertaking of socialist modernization  construction. By so doing, our reform, opening, and economic  construction will be provided with the broadest and deepest mass  foundation and will keep on developing with great vigor.  <H3>  III. On Strengthening Party Building and the Leadership of  the Party </H3>   Establishing a socialist market economic structure and  accelerating the pace of modernization are great historical  tasks in the new period. To lead this unprecedented pioneering  work and to achieve success, our party must effectively  strengthen its own ideology, organization, and work style.    1. It is necessary to strengthen the party's  ideological construction and to arm the whole party with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. A party, a nation and a country,  especially a big party like ours and a country composed of  people of 56 different nationalities with a population of more  than 1 billion, must have correct theoretical guidance and  powerful spiritual support. Now we are in the midst of a  profound social change in the course of reform, opening up, and  modernization, and great changes are taking place in social  relations and the social and economic outlooks. To assume the  historical responsibility for leading this great change, our  party must have correct theoretical guidance and powerful  spiritual support. Otherwise, the whole party and the whole  country cannot have strong rallying power, will lack unity as  did the old China, and cannot have great strength. Ideological  construction is the foundation for improving our organization  and work style. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics has brought forward and  developed Mao Zedong Thought, and it is contemporary Marxism in  China [dang dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yu -- 3981 0108 0022  0948 4104 7456 0344 0674 0031 5030]. We must use this theory to  arm the whole party, the whole Army, and people of all  nationalities of our country. The party Central Committee has  made a decision about studying the third volume of the "Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping," and so comrades of the whole party,  especially leading cadres at and above the county level, must  conscientiously study it in light of actual conditions. We  should carry forward the Marxist study style of combining theory  with practice, seriously study the original works, have a good  grasp of their essence, and implement the guidelines in line  with the actual situation of various departments and localities.  You comrades here are members and alternate members of the CPC  Central Committee and responsible comrades of the party,  government, Army, and masses organizations, and so you must take  the lead in studying well the book to increase your political,  ideological, and leadership quality and to enhance your  consciousness of firmly implementing the party's basic line.  This is a matter of fundamental importance to successfully  promote reform, opening up and the modernization drive.    2. It is necessary to strengthen the building of the  party organizationally. The strength of the party lies in  the unity of the party and in good organization and strict  discipline. To strengthen the party's organizational  construction, we have to do many things. Here I only want to  stress three points. First, it is imperative to firmly  implement the party's principle of democratic centralism. Only  by adhering to the principle of democratic centralism can we  unify our understanding and steps. Party organizations at  various levels must consciously place the interests of the party  and state at the top spot; their local interests must be  subordinated to the interests of the whole; their immediate  interests must be subordinated to long- term interests; and they  must take the overall situation into consideration, guarantee  the implementation of various principles and policies of the  party Central Committee, and maintain a high degree of unity  politically, organizationally, and in their actions. The  practices of not carrying out orders and not banning things  which should be banned are extremely unfavorable to our cause  and will not be tolerated by party discipline. Second, it is  necessary to enhance the building of the party's grassroots  organizations. Party's grassroots organizations are the party's  foundation. Only with a solid foundation can the entire party  be assured of having powerful fighting strength, can it  withstand the test of any upheavals. Implementing the  "decision" requires the joint efforts of all levels of party  organizations. Grass-roots party organizations are also  required to carry out hard and meticulous work and help  translate the party's decision into the action of the masses.  It is necessary to make great determination to build the  party's grassroots organizations into a fighting force that will  unite and lead the masses to realize the party's goals. Third,  it is necessary to enhance the building of all levels of leading  bodies. The key lies in following the principle of making the  contingent of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age,  better educated, and professionally more competent, and in  selecting and promoting cadres who meet the requirements of  being able and having political integrity. To help our party  organizations retain vigor and vitality, it is necessary to  promote those cadres, particularly young and middle-aged cadres,  who are loyal to the cause of the party, who vigorously promote  reform, opening, and modernization construction, to all levels  of leading posts.    3. Enhance investigation and study; improve work style  and way of thinking. Time is advancing. The situation is  evolving. New situations and new problems keep coming up. All  levels of leading organs and leading cadres should strive to  improve leadership styles and methods so as to keep up with the  pace of the times. It is necessary to treat this matter from  the high plane of improving the quality of leadership and  governing [zhi zheng 1013 2398]. With so much work to do, all  levels of party's leading cadres, senior-level cadres in  particular, should comprehensively implement the guidelines set  forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and the decision adopted  at the present plenary session, improve their ability to master  the overall situation, and arrange work in all respects. Since  next year will be a very important year to promote reform and  the tasks will be very arduous and demanding, we must properly  handle the relationship between reform, development, and  stability, and strive to maintain a stable political environment  and a sound economic environment. All levels of leaders should  not only know well their advantageous conditions and seize  opportunities for development, but also forsee well  contradictions and difficulties in the course of progress and do  a good job in a down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to  correctly grasp and handle well major theoretical and practical  problems, to persist in materialist dialectics, avoid  one-sidedness and metaphysics, remove interference, and always  and unwaveringly adhere to party's basic line. We should go  deep down to the front line of reform and construction; conduct  serious investigation and study; discover problems in a timely  manner; proceed from reality; work creatively; constantly sum up  experiences; and be good at utilizing experiences created by the  masses to guide their progress. The CPC Central Committee has  on many occasions called on all levels of leading cadres to step  up investigation and study. It will be impossible to perform  well a leader's duty if he or she makes light of investigation  and study, if he or she does not understand well their work, if  he or she is blind to reality. If we can squeeze a little bit  more time for studying, cut back time spent on socializing, do a  little more investigation and study, refrain from acting  subjectively, do more concrete things, and stop making empty  speeches, then we will be able to greatly raise our leadership  level.    Comrades!    Our country is now in a very important historical period.  The burden on our shoulders is onerous. We carry enormous  responsibilities. We should, in a spirit of bearing a high  sense of responsibility toward the party, the state, and the  Chinese nation, always and steadfastly follow Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and party's basic line; hold fast to the central  task of the economic construction; unwaveringly develop a  socialist market economy, socialist democratic politics, and  socialist spiritual civilization; emancipate the mind; seek  truth from facts; work with one heart and one mind; display a  pioneering and enterprising spirit; rely on our own efforts;  build an enterprise through arduous effort; and strive to build  our country into a rich, strong, democratic, civilized, and  modern socialist country!</p>

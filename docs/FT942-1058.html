			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: An inter-galactic goal I am enjoying the World Cup. Soccer is the world's game, and will be one of the first cultural activities mankind establishes on foreign planets once we embark on space colonisation. Many astronomers believe that the galaxies teem with intelligent life. Some astronomers believe that colonisation must be well under way in many galaxies, including our own. As stars wax and wane, people migrate towards the galactic core, in search of fresh worlds, and discover that the galaxies are veined by refugee and trade routes streaming inwards, towards concentrations of civilised life. I like that theory. I believe it to be true, which leads me to imagine that somewhere close to the centre of our own galaxy - perhaps at this moment - a variety of beings are competing in the Milky Way World Cup of soccer-playing planets. Given the distances, and the problems with travel - strikes by signallers, the congestion at stellar intersections - I doubt whether the Milky Way World Cup is staged at intervals shorter than 10,000 light years. But it must be fun when it happens. Imagine the advances in tactics and the improvements in training methods that must be displayed at this galactic soccer festival once every 10,000 light years. From that perspective, our own World Cup is a primitive thing indeed, ruggedly prehistoric, played by coarse creatures barely out of the slime stage, evolutionarily speaking, though much further up the scale of soccer-playing life, it has to be admitted, than the creatures from countries that failed to qualify - many of whom, unfortunately, are at a pre-language stage and do not use utensils to cut meat. I am lucky that I can watch the World Cup undistracted by distaff chattering. I am watching the World Cup on the smaller of our two television sets, in a corner of the dining room, while Miss Lee, my executive assistant, is ensconced in the sitting room, which she chooses to call the green room, watching Wimbledon, or films about surfies. She watches nothing else. She is contemptuous of soccer - except, that is, for a handful of Latin American players whose careers she monitors with wistful devotion. I bumped into her the other evening. She said: 'Hello, Michael. How is Valderrama doing? Is he juicing things up?' I said: 'Carlos Valderrama, who plays for Colombia? What a big girl's-blouse. All that ridiculous hair, and what does it add up to? Nothing whatsoever. Colombia are finished. They haven't won a point. What a load of rubbish.' 'How about Etcheverry, that nice Bolivian? I imagine he's surging.' 'I'm afraid that Etcheverry kicked a German and was shown the red card, so it's goodnight to him.' 'Caniggia of Argentina?' Miss Lee looked distracted. 'Surely he's prospering, thrusting into the penalty area, banging home the goals.' 'Claudio Caniggia is another girl's-blouse.' 'So tell me about yourself, Michael. How are you doing? I recall that among a series of half-baked forecasts you made at the start of the year, you predicted that in the final of the World Cup Norway would beat Brazil 3-1.' 'Did I?' 'It was New Year's Day. I remember sitting in the green room on New Year's Day and perusing, for want of something better, a series of forecasts you made for 1994, of which Norway to beat Brazil 3-1 in the final of the World Cup was possibly the most eccentric. 'You sounded highly disturbed. You predicted, for example, that the FT-SE 100 would top-out at 3,660 before Easter and then fall like a stone in September or October, and that the gold price would finish 1994 above Dollars 500 an ounce.' 'And so it could, if the Chinese masses get their dander up and buy gold heavily. They love their gold, those Chinese masses. An extra ounce per Chinese household per calendar year would send the gold price soaring.' 'You also said that John Major would resign.' 'And so he will, Miss Lee. Just as Norway will beat Brazil in the World Cup final. You'd like Norway. There's Sigurd Rushfeldt and Jan Aage Fjortoft and Jahn Ivar Jakobsen . . .' I looked up. Miss Lee had vanished. I was talking to myself. I returned to the dining room, to my glistening screen, which brings me weird stories from places far away.</p>

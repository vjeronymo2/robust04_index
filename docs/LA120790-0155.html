			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Emergency medicine -- A Nov. 19 article about tensions between two specialties  involved in the care of trauma patients at County-USC Medical Center  erroneously reported that emergency medicine was recognized with its own  specialty board examinations only a year ago. In fact, the American Board of  Emergency Medicine has been empowered to certify doctors as emergency medicine  specialists for 10 years. New powers granted a year ago governed examinations  certifying expertise in subspecialties of emergency medicine.  </P></p>

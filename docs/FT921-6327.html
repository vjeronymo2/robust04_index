			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Profits sighted as Nelson's silver sold: Saleroom A PAIR of candlesticks shaped like telescopes made in 1801 for Lord Nelson sold for Pounds 22,000, double their estimate, at Sotheby's yesterday. They are weighted at the bottom for use on board ship and carry the initials N and B, for Lord Nelson and his other title, Duke of Bronte. The candlesticks were part of an auction of silver which did extremely well, totalling Pounds 864,479 in the morning session with 7 per cent unsold. London dealers were particularly interested in about 100 lots of silver acquired early in the 19th century by Thomas John, 2nd Baron Newborough, and sold yesterday by his descendants. The auction totalled Pounds 640,629 with nearly every item sold. When, in 1823, Lord Newborough came of age, he went on a spending spree and bought silver plate from London's finest goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, and Green, Ward, Green and Ward. London dealer Koopman paid Pounds 79,200 for a pair of silver soup tureens, one made by Paul Storr and the other by Benjamin Smith to designs supplied by Rundells. He also paid Pounds 60,500 for an oval silver-gilt tray from Rundells. Meanwhile, in Monaco on Wednesday, Sotheby's held an exceptionally successful auction of 18th century French furniture from the collection of the Schlumberger family, best known for its oil-drilling interests. The sale totalled FFr29.12m (Pounds 2.97m) with just 1 per cent unsold. A pair of Louis XVI console tables - made by Jacques Dubois around 1770 and originally sold to the Russian Count Stroganov - went for Pounds 906,585, comfortably above forecast. The Soviet government had disposed of them in 1931 when it was raising money from arts sales. A Louis XVI commode, the combined work of Weisweiler and Riesener, realised Pounds 402,338, and a console table with a gilt bronze mask of Apollo, by Riesener alone, doubled its estimate at Pounds 339,969.</p>

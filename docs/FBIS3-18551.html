All this was noted by Alternate Minister of National  Economy, Ioannis Papandoniou, speaking yesterday at the opening  of the Panhellenic Industrial Conference called  "Competitiveness, Development, Employment."    The session, which continues today and was organised by SEV  (the Federation of Greek Industries) and regional federations,  was well represented by delegates from all sectors of the state,  business, and labour.    One of the major measures the government has decided on is  the flotation of minority holdings in the big public  corporations, which will be floated on the Athens Sofokleous  Street stock exchange. This will provide a boon for state  finances, while ensuring reformation of the corporations  themselves.    Papandoniou stressed that things need not necessarily be in  such a mess, and attributed the state of affairs to past errors  in financial policy, the high cost of capital, widespread tax  evasion, and high inflation.    Unemployment is high, especially in certain areas of the  country, while overall figures for Greece are around 10 percent.  The government, said Papandoniou, intends to crack down on the  ballooning public debt, the servicing of which swallows 16  percent of GNP. Another major problem is inflation, which the  government intends to bring down to the European Union (EU)  average by 1996.    This is an extremely optimistic target, as Greek inflation  was running at 11.2 percent for consumer goods and services in  January, while the corresponding EU average is 3.4 percent.    The deputy minister explained that recovery could be  approached through strict adherence to the 1994 budget, and  reform of the tax system.    Mr Papandoniou delivered the opening speech in place of  ailing [Finance] Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas. Bank of Greece  Governor Ioannis Boutos will deliver the closing address this  evening.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 5 YEARS ADDED TO DRUG TERM  </P> <P> Former Oakland drug dealer Rudy Henderson has been sentenced to 25 years in  prison, five years more than recommended by the U.S. attorney's office in a  plea-bargaining agreement. An angry Henderson had tried to change his plea, but  U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel rejected the request. "One can't have  one's cake and eat it too," she said. Henderson, 40, and eight co-defendants  pleaded guilty Jan. 27 to several drug conspiracy charges in exchange for  dismissal of other charges. Henderson pleaded guilty to possessing for sale  seven kilograms of cocaine and evasion of $115,000 in taxes. He was to be  sentenced to 20 years in prison and also agreed to forfeit his $1-million  mansion in Sonoma County. Patel sentenced him to 20 years in prison for the  drug charge and five more years to be served consecutively for tax evasion.  </P></p>

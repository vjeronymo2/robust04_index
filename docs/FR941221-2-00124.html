			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (Act) requires the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce (depending on jurisdiction) to determine whether species are endangered or threatened. In defining ``species,'' the Act as originally passed included, ``*&blank;*&blank;* any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants and any other group of fish or wildlife of the same species or smaller taxa in common spatial arrangement that interbreed when mature.'' In 1978, the Act was amended so that the definition read ``*&blank;*&blank;* any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants, and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.'' This change restricted application of this portion of the definition to vertebrates. The authority to list a ``species'' as endangered or threatened is thus not restricted to species as recognized in formal taxonomic terms, but extends to subspecies, and for vertebrate taxa, to distinct population segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Secretary must ``*&blank;*&blank;* determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species'' (section 4(a)(1)), it is important that the term ``distinct population segment'' be interpreted in a clear and consistent fashion. Furthermore, Congress has instructed the Secretary to exercise this authority with regard to distinct population segments ``*&blank;*&blank;* sparingly and only when the biological evidence indicates that such action is warranted.'' (Senate Report 151, 96th Congress, 1st Session). The Services have used this authority relatively rarely; of nearly 300 native vertebrate species listed under the Act, only about 20 are given separate status as distinct population segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important in light of the Act's requirement to use the best available scientific information in determining the status of species that this interpretation follow sound biological principles. Any interpretation adopted should also be aimed at carrying out the purposes of the Act (i.e., ``*&blank;*&blank;* to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and conventions set forth in subsection (a) of this section'' (section 2(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available scientific information provides little specific enlightenment in interpreting the phrase ``distinct population segment.'' This term is not commonly used in scientific discourse, although ``population'' is an important term in a variety of contexts. For instance, a population may be circumscribed by a set of experimental conditions, or it may approximate an ideal natural group of organisms with approximately equal breeding opportunities among its members, or it may refer to a loosely bounded, regionally distributed collection of organisms. In all cases, the organisms in a population are members of a single species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has developed a Policy on the Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act (56 FR 58612&hyph;58618; November 20, 1991). The policy applies only to species of salmonids native to the Pacific Ocean. Under this policy, a stock of Pacific salmon is considered a distinct population segment if it represents an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) of a biological species. A stock must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) It must be substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It must represent an important component in the evolutionary legacy of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document proposes an interpretation of the term ``distinct population segment'' for the purposes of listing, delisting, and reclassifying vertebrates by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NMFS. It is consistent with the policy on Pacific salmon, but more broadly applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following principles would, if adopted, guide the Services' listing, delisting and reclassification of distinct population segments of vertebrate species. Any proposed or final rule affecting status determination for a distinct population segment would clearly analyze the action in light of these guiding principles. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Dartford ferry terminal to close MAERSK, the Danish shipping line, is to close its dedicated roll-on roll-off terminal at Dartford, Kent, next month, less than two years after it took over as operator. The company blamed the recession for the closure, which will cost 134 jobs. Maersk said it would honour its three-year lease agreement with Blue Circle Industries, the cement and property company, due to end in June 1993. Blue Circle is considering developing the Pounds 4m port as a terminal for hydrofoil services to and from the Continent.</p>

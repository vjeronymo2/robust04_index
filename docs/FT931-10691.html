			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Books: Imperial distortions CULTURE AND IMPERIALISM by Edward W Said Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20,444 pages FIFTEEN years ago Professor Edward Said, a Palestinian based at Columbia, published a fashionable, even influential, book called Orientalism. In Culture and Imperialism he develops and broadens some of the themes of that book so as to analyse, with references galore to literature and in particular to the Western novel, the relationship between the imperial powers and their dependencies. 'Without empire . . .' he writes with typical assurance, 'there is no European novel as we know it . . . The novel, as a cultural artefact of bourgeois society, and imperialism are unthinkable without each other . . .' Which, if you think about it, is not really true. Said starts early with an example of his approach: in Mansfield Park (which one might have thought was a pre-imperial book) he declares that Sir Thomas Bertram's plantation in Antigua is central to Jane Austen's conception of metropolitan England's peace and stability. Is that insight helpful? I suspect not. He goes on, of course, to discuss writers more apparently imperial in setting and concerns: Kipling, Verdi (for Aida), Conrad and, in due course, Forster, Yeats, Camus, Achebe, Malraux, CLR James, Fanon, and so on. Said is careful to claim that he responds to his chosen novels first and foremost as valued products of the creative imagination: only then, he says, does he set them in the imperial context and without condemning them for that colonial connection. But there is something depressingly limiting about this political view of the greatest literature: the 'darkness' whose heart was explored by Conrad, for instance, is surely diminished if it is interpreted merely in terms of a non-European society resisting imperialism. Take Kim as a better example, to which the professor devotes a long section. I recall him describing Kim in an earlier publication as 'a profoundly embarrassing novel'. It is good to find that he may have changed his mind: he now seems to admit that Kim is one of the greatest novels of our age - it is an astonishingly under-esteemed book, perhaps because it can be foolishly filed on the children's shelves - but it is also alarming to discover the limits of Said's response. Kipling, we are assured, 'assumes a basically uncontested empire'; the Lama is placed 'within the protective orbit of British rule in India' (see the Lahore Curator giving him those symbolic spectacles]); Kim is a 'liminal' figure whose role is to help maintain the bonds of society; at the moment of his crisis - 'And what is Kim?' - he goes through 'a ceremony of reappropriation, Britain . . . taking hold once again in India' and so achieves the 'function of being a Sahib in colonial India'. This sort of acado-speak nonsense sublimely misses the point, which is that we are attending Kim's re-birth, as even the younger readers will have noticed. The boy and the old man have simultaneously come close to death and are now about to achieve their separate quests - the passage to manhood and the confronting of death, the two great journeys in all our lives, and nothing to do with being a Sahib. This politico-historical approach to a masterpiece is so inadequate that it distorts and diminishes it, and it is an approach which is too typical of the rest of the book: you can imagine what Said does with the young Marlow's admission in Heart of Darkness that he always wanted to fill in the blank spaces on the map, or Mr Gould blowing up his own mine in Nostromo. It is true, of course, that the novel of the 19th and early 20th centuries contains frequent references to the fact of empire. Said focuses on Britain, and to a lesser extent France and America, and is justified in arguing that the empire is always there, like the servants, undiscussed, in a great house. In the earlier period he grants that the empire is available to the novelist but not always central; after the mid-19th century it becomes a principal subject of attention. He is also right to argue that the careful study of cultural imperialism can help us 'draw conclusions that enrich and sharpen our reading of major cultural texts . . .' But there's too little pleasure, stimulus, excitement, for the lay as opposed to the academic reader. The professor's tendency to repeat himself is the least of the problems. Too often, reading Said is like climbing a sand dune. For all the exotic location, it is surprisingly exhausting; you are constantly slipping back and when at last you get to the top, you find you have expended enough energy to get you up a real mountain, only to find that this isn't a mountain and that the view is disappointing.</p>

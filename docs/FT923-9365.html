			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US criticism over chips sales worries Japan THE Japanese government and electronics industry expressed disappointment yesterday at the US trade representative's finding that there has not been 'sufficient progress' in foreign penetration of Japan's semiconductor market. Japan's Electronic Industries Association (EIAJ), insisted that the review of last year's US-Japan semiconductor pact had overlooked 'significant' expansion of foreign suppliers' market share since the first semiconductor pact was signed in 1986. Japan is concerned that the review's finding will be a starting point for punitive action against the country's electronics industry, and that the US administration will come under pressure to take action during the presidential election campaign. Under a new semiconductor pact concluded last year, the Japanese government set a target of 20 per cent foreign share by the end of this year. During the first quarter this year, however, that share was only 14.6 per cent and is believed to have fallen since. Japanese government and industry representatives blame the slowing of the domestic economy; the US chip industry insists Japan has failed to honour the agreement. The US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said yesterday that 'if maintaining a closed chip market were an Olympic sport, Japan would be the undisputed gold medal winner'. It warned that Japan had to make an 'all-out, strenuous effort' if it wanted to 'avoid further confrontation'. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said it would intensify its calls on users to purchase more foreign chips. However, Japanese companies had already tried to do so. After a bilateral meeting in June, Japanese users said they would give foreign chip makers access to previously confidential procurement information. Miti, for its part, is encouraging Japanese companies to employ foreign producers at the design stage of new products. However, the largest Japanese chip users are also producers, and an executive at a leading electronics company said the downturn in the semiconductor and consumer electronics markets had led his company to reduce outside sourcing - Japanese and foreign.</p>

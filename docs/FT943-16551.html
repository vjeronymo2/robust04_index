			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waving the flag, surely? Sir, I read with interest and enjoyment the article, 'Celebrating rites of passage' (June 25), by Jurek Martin on the recent graduation ceremonies at Harvard. I also had a daughter graduating from Harvard. My eyes are certainly older than those of Mr Martin, but it was surely not dollar bills being waved by graduates of Harvard Business School, including my daughter, but small flags representing the many nationalities of the school's students. They were waving them cheerily but not, I think, greedily, although one of the school newspapers circulated at the ceremonies reported that many of the graduates expect salaries (including bonuses) of Dollars 100,000 in their first year after graduation.

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A new policy framework THE BRUTAL exit of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism was a watershed in the history of Mr John Major's government. On the far side lay a determined government pursuing a clear, if increasingly costly, goal. On this side lies a government trying to prevent a series of retreats from turning into a rout. The unfolding disaster can be halted, but only if the government enunciates a new framework for economic policy. That is what it must provide, both for the country and for itself. Lowering interest rates is not enough. In the absence of a credible framework, even easing that can be justified on its merits would be dangerous. The two interest rate cuts that have occurred since sterling left the ERM have already been judged, reasonably, to be the ploy of petrified politicians, with each cut expected to be the harbinger of another. Once a British government is judged to be engaged in a monetary U-turn, the currency is likely to be dumped, the bonds that the government has to sell in huge numbers are likely to be spurned, unreasonable wage demands are likely to be conceded and efforts to cut costs are likely to be slackened. In short, everything that has been so painfully gained may be lost. Yet the obvious alternative - retaining relatively high nominal interest rates - has grown more implausible with each piece of bad economic news. An early return to the ERM might seem to be one way of keeping interest rates up. But it would not prove workable. This is not just because other member countries might prefer not to have the pound back; nor simply because return to the ERM would create a political uproar; nor because interest rates would tend to rise above German levels once more, even though the UK needs still lower interest rates; nor just because the credibility of the ERM has been dented. It is for all these reasons together. Investors will doubt the desire of the authorities to defend a new parity. They will test it. And it will fail. Such a failure would further damage both the UK's relations with its continental partners and the credibility of its economic policies. Above all, the UK needs the flexibility to lower interest rates. But it will also need to be able to raise them again. This implies the exercise of judgment, precisely what policymakers have shown themselves to lack. This is why the government must offer more than lower interest rates. It needs a policy package. Thorough investigation First, it is not good enough for the authorities to pretend that sterling was put into the ERM at the right time and the right rate; that the right policy decisions were taken; and that it was forced to leave by unforeseeable events. What is needed, instead, is a thorough investigation into the decisions associated with the UK's membership of the ERM. How can British government improve if the reasons for failure are not even investigated? More important, the dominance over British government of the notion that the Treasury knows best must be ended. What is needed is an independent central bank, with a properly qualified board of directors, dedicated to the achievement of price stability, subject only to a specific override from the government. What is also needed is discussion of the Treasury's fiscal proposals well before the budget and an explicit balancing of expenditure against revenue. These are not utopian suggestions. The government should have realised by now that to be responsible for everything is to be blamed for everything. Once the British government loses credibility, all economic policy becomes tainted. But German and US experience shows that this need not happen, if monetary policy is independently managed. As a first step, the Treasury should put forward a detailed monthly analysis of monetary policy, as does the Bundesbank. The Bank of England should publish its own views independently, thus ending the pretence that all right-thinking people must agree. This would at least throw some light on the cosy coterie of officials and ministers. These institutional changes are important because the persistent failure of British policies is only partly the failure of a country. It is also the failure of a system of power without transparency or adequate responsibility. Without such changes sharply lower interest rates are bound to look like cutting and running. With such changes, bold policies can be contemplated. What should these policies consist of? On monetary policy, the chancellor should lower base rates to 6 per cent now. He can justify this decision by reference to the monetary policies that have had to be adopted by other countries plagued by excessive levels of private debt. He can also justify the decision by reference to the length and severity of the present recession and the need to give a boost to confidence. The alternative to a single cut is a series of smaller ones. That would make less sense since the consequences of each cut cannot be known until long after the next one has been made. Rates should be set, instead, at what seems a reasonable level. Thereafter, the authorities must be prepared to wait and see. For a country that is in recession, but has a significant inflation problem, a base rate that gives positive real rates before tax looks like a reasonable starting point. With rates of interest down to 6 per cent, increases in interest rates will become credible once more. Such increases could well be needed if sterling were to collapse, wage inflation were to stop falling before it has reached about 4 per cent, or long-term rates of interest were to rise sharply once more. Pay is particularly important. A country that has had a substantial devaluation, but does not orient policy towards the control of pay inflation, is doomed to a self-defeating wage-price spiral. Lower interest rates A cut in interest rates to 6 per cent does not preclude return to the ERM and may even make it easier. Over the next year or so, rates of interest in continental Europe are likely to fall. A year from now rates may even have converged. But by then the UK economy should have started to recover. If rates of interest are expected to converge in future, the sterling exchange rate should also retrace some of the ground it may lose now. The change in monetary policy should be presented as an attempt to rebalance economic policy. The ERM imposed a high exchange rate, an excessively tight monetary policy and an unsustainably loose fiscal policy. That needs to be corrected. The chancellor should, therefore, simultaneously announce a start towards elimination of the structural deficit, partly via tax increases. One option, in the context of sharply lower short-term interest rates, would be the reduction or even elimination of mortgage interest relief, worth some Pounds 6bn. Meanwhile, properly evaluated infrastructure projects should be carried through. These are self-limiting expenditures that must be justifiable in present circumstances. And expenditure restraint should focus on pay rather than jobs in the public sector or on welfare benefits. The danger is that any such package will be viewed as another inflationary U-turn. The government should, therefore, finance as much of its borrowing requirement as possible through index-linked securities. It should also commit itself to raising interest rates once more if inflation stops falling. It must eschew targets for real activity. There is no good alternative to rebalancing monetary and fiscal policy, combined with a commitment to institutional change. Merely squeezing the economy until inflation is first eliminated will cause unacceptable damage to the economy. But going for growth at all costs would repeat all the mistakes of the past. It is better to organise a retreat than to flee, to seize control over events than respond to them. The ERM policy has failed. The gradualist policy is proving untenable. The government should act across the board, since a piecemeal approach would not work. And it should act now.</p>

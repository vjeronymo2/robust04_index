			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Lords to hear test Sunday trading case FIVE LAW LORDS agreed yesterday to hear legal arguments from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the attorney-general, in a critical test appeal on Sunday trading, in spite of opposition from the retailer directly involved in the case. The appeal, brought by Kirklees Borough Council, West Yorkshire, seeks to overturn an appeal court judgment in April which made Sunday trading restrictions in England and Wales virtually unenforceable and led to the current Sunday opening by supermarket chains. In the Lords appeal, which began yesterday, the attorney-general intervened on the side of local authorities attempting to restore their ability to enforce the Sunday trading laws pending a conclusive ruling from the European Court. Mr Andrew Collins QC, representing Wickes Building Supplies, the DIY retailer, accused Sir Patrick of 'muddling' his legal and political roles. The attorney-general had not chosen to take the case over as he could have done, and had indicated in the Commons that enforcement of the laws was a matter not for him but for the local authorities. In his legal role it was appropriate that the attorney-general should assist the law lords, but in his political role he had 'no business' supporting Kirklees. Mr Stuart Isaacs, QC for Kirklees, said the Court of Appeal ruling last year had emasculated the Sunday trading law. Local authorities were in a cleft stick, with retailers saying the law could not be enforced, and pressure groups insisting that it must be. The appeal, expected to last four days, is the second in a year to reach the Lords concerning the alleged incompatibility of the Sunday trading laws in England and Wales with the provision of European Community law on the free movement of goods. The previous case was referred to the European Court in May. A hearing has yet to be fixed and a ruling is unlikely before the end of the year.</p>

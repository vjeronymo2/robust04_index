			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: 1993 will be a hard act to follow - International Falling interest rates, rallying bond markets, yield-hungry investors and further liberalisation of regulatory constraints helped make 1993 the best ever year for the Eurobond market. The volume of new issues rose to a record level of nearly Dollars 400bn in 1993, up 45 per cent on the previous year, according to Euromoney Bondware, and many securities houses and investment banks posted record profits on the fixed income side of their business. The number of borrowers from emerging markets increased substantially as investors became more willing to take on lower-rated debt in return for additional yield and in the hope of realising capital gains as the creditworthiness of these borrowers improves. Latin American issuers more than doubled their borrowing to Dollars 45.7bn and South East Asian issuance rose by nearly 20 per cent to Dollars 50.4bn. At the other end of the spectrum, sovereign borrowers stepped up their activity in order to plug widening deficits resulting from the prolonged economic slowdown or to replenish foreign currency reserves in the wake of a series of currency crises. The dividing line between Eurobonds, international and domestic bonds - and between bonds and medium-term notes - became increasingly irrelevant, as international investors broadened their horizons to take advantage of opportunities, wherever they appeared. The 'global' bond became more widely used. Last year saw the first D-Mark denominated global bond, as well as the first global offerings for emerging market borrowers. Most currency sectors showed strong growth. In Europe, only the Ecu market moved in the other direction, with a drop in volume from Dollars 21.7bn to Dollars 7.1bn. The search for higher yields encouraged investors to lengthen the duration of portfolios. The proportion of new issues maturing in 10 years rose to 26 per cent and 11 per cent were even longer-dated. While the fixed-rate sector of the market remained predominant, expectations that US interest rates are bottoming out encouraged interest in the floating-rate note market, which represented 17 per cent of new deals. The growth of the Eurobond market across a broad range of currency sectors favoured the large US houses, which have tried to developed trading and sales across the whole spectrum of currencies. Goldman Sachs displaced Deutsche Bank as the top bookrunner in 1993. Other Wall Street firms which performed well last year were Morgan Stanley in third place, up from a poor 16th in 1992, Lehman Brothers which rose from 14th to 6th and Salomon Brothers, which recovered from 13th to 8th place. Against the trend, J. P. Morgan dropped from 5th to 10th place. The Japanese securities houses, which dominated the league tables in the late 1980s, lost further ground, with Nomura managing only 7th position, down from 2nd, and Nikko and Daiwa falling to 13th and 14th respectively. Although the sterling market recorded the fastest growth of any currency sector last year, the highest ranking for a UK house was 17th position for S. G. Warburg, up from 19th the previous year. The recovery of investor interest in floating-rate notes allowed Kidder Peabody to edge back into the top 20, up from 23rd last year. While the market is expected to remain active in 1994, dealers do not expect a frenzy of activity in the first few weeks of the year, as there was at the start of 1993. Tight swap spreads are likely to limit arbitrage opportunities. Further, as interest rates stop falling later in the year, the climate for heavy issuance could become less favourable. The Eurobond market has grown steadily throughout its 30-year history, posting record volume in many years, but 1993 could prove a hard act to follow.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP EUROBOND LEAD MANAGERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1993                        1992 Manager            Dollars  Rank   %  Issues   Dollars  Rank  %  Issues                      Bn                          Bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldman Sachs        26.86   1   6.72   95    14.22      4   5.15   56 Deutsche Bank        25.08   2   6.27   76    21.83      1   7.91   73 Morgan Stanley       18.42   3   4.61   79     6.26     16   2.27   29 CSFB/Credit Suisse   18.16   4   4.54   80    16.74      3   6.07   69 Merrill Lynch        18.02   5   4.51   89    12.22      6   4.43   57 Lehman Brothers      17.45   6   4.36   83     6.59     14   2.39   49 Nomura               16.88   7   4.22   67    19.60      2   7.10   86 Salomon Brothers     16.72   8   4.18   60     6.74     13   2.44   30 Paribas              13.79   9   3.45   56    12.05      7   4.37   45 JP Morgan            12.22   10  3.06   55    12.69      5   4.60   41 Industry totals    *399.85        100 1975    275.91          100 1363  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Preliminary Figures - Full credit to book runner  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Bondware  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROBOND ISSUES BY CURRENCY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993                    Total     No. of  1992     Total     No. of Rank Currency          raised     issues  Rank    raised     issues                    (Dollars bn)                (Dollars bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1    USDollars          153.11      791   1      103.33       515 2    D-Mark              53.11      150   3       33.18       142 3    Yen                 44.11      274   2       34.34       161 4    Sterling            43.68      201   4       22.81        99 5    FFr                 39.33      147   5       22.73       107 6    CDollars            29.41      167   7       16.04        89 7    Guilder             12.67       60   9        7.44        46 8    Lira                11.70       82   8        7.83        37 9    Ecu                  7.17       21   6       21.71        84 10   ADollars             3.52       42   10       4.95        56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Bondware  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

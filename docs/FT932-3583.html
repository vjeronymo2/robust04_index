			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Mediators step up Bosnian peace initiative LORD Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Geneva yesterday as part of renewed diplomatic efforts to end the slaughter in the former Yugoslav republic, agencies report. The talks coincided with reports that Serb rockets flattened a temporary hospital, killing more than 50 patients and medical staff, in the blockaded east Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. The death toll, if independently confirmed, would be one of the worst in a single incident in the 14-month war between Bosnia's Moslem, Croat and Serb communities. Officials of the Moslem-led Bosnian government said it had urged Mr Izetbegovic to return home immediately from Geneva to underline the gravity of the crisis in the enclave. The talks, a day after the mediators met Croat leaders, focused on the growing conflict between the Moslem-led government and its former Croat allies. Lord Owen said that one of the main aims of the talks was to alleviate fighting between Moslems and Croats 'but the essential task is still the overall peace settlement'. Shortly after the discussions, Moslem, Croat and Serb members of Bosnia's presidency gathered at the UN's European headquarters for a special session to discuss temporary power-sharing arrangements. Lord Owen wanted the presidency - comprising President Izetbegovic and two other Moslem representatives, two Croats and two Serbs - to consider delegating more authority to a so-called co-ordinating body as a prelude to an interim government. Late yesterday Sarajevo radio, monitored by the BBC, said the presidency had ordered an immediate end to fighting between its forces and Croats. The radio quoted the presidency order as saying: 'All conflicts between units of the army of Bosnia-Hercegovina and the formations of the Croatian defence council must stop immediately.' It added that Moslem-led government army commander Rasim Delic and Bosnian Croat army chief Milivoj Petkovic would be responsible for implementing the truce. UN commanders called a meeting of Serb, Croat and Moslem army chiefs to take place at Sarajevo airport tomorrow to discuss a lasting ceasefire. Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg hope to gather leaders of all the Bosnian factions, as well as Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, for talks in Geneva on Wednesday. From the battlefront, Sarajevo's Moslem-controlled radio said there were no survivors of the direct hit on the temporary hospital building in Gorazde and added: 'Pieces of human bodies are mixed with cement, broken boards, bricks and mortar.' Fifteen people were reported killed yesterday before the hospital was hit. About 60,000 inhabitants and refugees are trapped in Gorazde, which Serbs are attacking in defiance of its designation as a UN safe area. Meanwhile, Sarajevo had one of its worst bouts of shelling in weeks as gunners around the city ignored a warning by the commander of UN troops in Bosnia that the country was sliding towards anarchy. On Saturday General Philippe Morillon threatened to pull out the 9,000-strong UN Protection Force under his command if local political and military leaders did not commit themselves firmly to the faltering peace process.</p>

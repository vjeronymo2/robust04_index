			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Observer: Ruding's exit When it comes to near misses on the world finance jobs circuit, Onno Ruding's record is hard to match. He has been angling for a high international post since deciding not to seek a third term as Dutch finance minister in 1989. Much to his chagrin, he lost out to Jacques Attali in the race to head the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last year - a reminder of his failure to beat another Frenchman, Michel Camdessus, to the top job at the IMF in 1986. The 52-year-old Dutchman is currently chairman of the Netherlands Christian Federation of Employers, a three-day-a-week post which leaves him plenty of time for non-executive directorships and advisory jobs at not only Citicorp but Philips, Unilever, Nationale-Nederlanden and the Robeco investment group. However, this clutch of assignments hardly adds up to the international job the lanky Ruding was looking for. His failure to land top posts in international bodies (as opposed to private-sector institutions) may be partly due to inept lobbying by the Dutch government. He was a competent finance minister, and is probably best remembered for holding the line against increased public spending in the Netherlands between 1982 to 1987, in a bid to put the state's financial house in order. But whether his type of financial rectitude is enough to turn the tide at Citicorp, where he is expected to take a leading role, is a different question. Observer can only wish him well.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Dutch leaders in search for three-party coalition Dutch politicians yesterday began the search for a viable government coalition after an inconclusive general election split the vote among the country's four main parties. The election robbed the ruling Christian Democrats (CDA) and Labour party of their majority in parliament, making a three-party coalition inevitable and breaking a 13-year tradition of two-party rule. The ruling coalition captured just 71 seats, short of the 76 needed for a governing majority in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. In the 1989 election, the two parties won a combined 103 seats. Despite a sharp decline in support, Labour emerged as the largest single party, with 37 seats, three seats ahead of the CDA, which has traditionally dominated Dutch politics. Two smaller parties, the right-wing Liberals and D66, a left-of-centre party, posted sharp gains, to 31 and 24 seats respectively. The four parties are most divided on social security. Labour, which will try to secure the prime minister's job for its leader, Mr Wim Kok, the finance minister, is against any far-reaching reform of the welfare system. At the other end of the spectrum, the Liberals want to cut unemployment and other benefits to 60 per cent of the minimum wage. The challenge now facing the four parties is to form a three-party coalition. In the meantime, the government of prime minister Ruud Lubbers will remain in office in a caretaker's role. Although the Netherlands has always been ruled by coalitions in recent times, a prolonged period of uncertainty could affect financial markets, though initial reactions yesterday were muted. Queen Beatrix will hold meetings with senior politicians tomorrow. She will then ask one of the party leaders to try to form a coalition. If the parties are too far apart, she can also take the interim step of naming an elder statesman from one of the parties to act as a go-between in party negotiations.</p>

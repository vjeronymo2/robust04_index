			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Management: Time comes to mind corporate Ps and Qs - Andrew Jack explains why ethical codes are increasing in popularity among British companies The idea of ethics in business might raise wry smiles from sceptics, but a growing number of companies is embracing the idea  - at least on paper. A survey* of 164 leading British companies published earlier this week showed that 29 per cent had a written ethical code last year, compared with 18 per cent in 1987. The codes tend to cover areas such as obligations to employees, customers and shareholders, and responsibilities to suppliers and the community. The Co-operative Bank courted publicity with its announcement this month that it would not do business with organisations involved in a series of activities. Many companies have been quietly developing policies over a number of years, including Esso, sponsor of the report, which has had an ethical code since 1977. In the US, by contrast, one study last year suggested that 84 per cent of companies have written codes. Stanley Kiaer, director of the Institute of Business Ethics, a corporate think-tank which produced the British survey, argues there are at least three reasons why ethical codes are becoming more widespread in Britain. Companies are recognising the need to be seen by their shareholders to be ethical; they are responding to pressure from graduate recruits who are eager to discover a prospective employer's attitudes; and also to peer pressure from competitors, as a growing number embrace ethical policies. 'I think good practice always advances by a mixture of altruism and self-interest,' Kiaer says. 'But if it results in a more ethical stance, the motive doesn't matter.' What is of more concern, however, is how seriously companies really take these issues. Without a deep-seated commitment beyond self-interest, what is the likelihood that they will abandon the ethical bandwagon as a new fad emerges? Unless the policies are spelt out in some depth, with a clear strategy for ensuring they are implemented and enforced, they may be all but useless. John Drummond, director of Integrity Works, part of Communication Works, a London-based consultancy, argues that the 'de-layering' of modern organisations and the greater delegation of decision-making means that many more employees are being confronted by ethical choices than ever before. Yet the survey found that only about two-thirds of the British companies with a code went into sufficient detail on policies, examples and action to be taken to make them achievable. Only a very small number demonstrated any means of evaluating how effective their policies were in practice. Lord Laing, president of the Institute, launched a code as chairman of United Biscuits in 1987. He made it a requirement that the company's auditors informed the board if they detected anything which infringed the ethical policy. But that is a rare exception. British subsidiaries of North American companies tend to take the subject most seriously. Unisys, for example, has a full-time corporate ethics officer with a small staff, responsible for monitoring and enforcement, and a widespread training programme. Each year, all managers and staff involved in buying or selling are asked to sign a pledge that they have honoured the ethical code, and to disclose any breaches. There is also an ethical hotline for all employees. Even with these precautions, Chris Cherkas, director of human resources for Unisys in the UK, concedes: 'It's very difficult to say what an ethical code of practice has prevented. But its existence may have stopped things happening.' Ronald Berenbeim of the Conference Board, a New York-based business research service, who has researched business ethics in the US over a number of years, says there are at least three steps to developing an effective corporate ethical policy. The drafting of the code should be participatory, including all levels of employees in discussions to gain an understanding of the corporate culture and values. Everyone should receive a copy of the code and be involved in discussions on its meaning and implementation. Any breaches in the code should be reported and discussed internally, so that staff are aware that it is, as he says, 'a living document'. Given that organisations and values constantly change, Berenbeim then adds a fourth point. 'When all that is done,' he says, 'after about three years, companies should probably start the process all over again'. *Business ethics and company codes. Pounds 15.

			<p>BFN     [Text] By 2 May 1994, the Tra Vinh Provincial Post and  Telegraph Service had completed a digitized telecommunication  network in the province that covers eight districts and towns  and 75 villages, including Hoa Minh and Long Hoa villages in the  Ban Dong estuary area.    The province has leased nearly 2,300 telephones, over 2.5  times higher than the number of phones at the time the province  was separated from the former province. Nearly 600 of these  telephones -- nearly 25 percent of the total -- have been  installed in remote areas and areas occupied by ethnic Khmer  compatriots.    Tra Vinh is the first province to have 100 percent of its  villages and districts covered by a digitized telecommunication  network. The Tra Vinh Post and Telegraph Service plans to  install about 5,000 to 5,500 more telephones by the end of this  year, including 800 to 1,200 sets to be leased to rural areas.</p>

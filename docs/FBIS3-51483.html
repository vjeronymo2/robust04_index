On Sunday, 16 January, the last day of the conference, the  participants will raise the situation of human rights in Haiti,  the social crisis, the crisis of the refugees, as well as the  contribution of the parties to the restoration of democracy.  The invited speaker is Jeremie Bishop Willy Romelus, considered  a close supporter of President Aristide.    The closing of the Miami international conference is planned  for Sunday night with a speech by President-in-exile  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: After the payroll FOREIGN exchange dealers will focus their attention on this week's US economic indicators, following a remarkable employment report released last Friday, writes James Blitz. The non-farm payroll report showed a rise of 365,000 in February, against market expectations of, at best, 150,000. This has led dealers to think that the US economy is showing signs of maintaining its recovery from recession. Some analysts were reluctant at the weekend to set too much store by this latest figure, because around 90 per cent of the rise reflects an increase in people doing part-time jobs. The market will therefore look for further indications of an upturn in the US economy in Thursday's retail sales figure for February. The market is expecting a monthly rise of around 0.3 per cent. Friday's University of Michigan survey of consumer confidence will also be screened closely. Currency trading in the European exchange rate mechanism should be calmer this week, following the Bundesbank's surprise cut in its repo rate on Friday. However, dealers will closely scrutinise the latest stage of the solidarity talks in Germany, the successful conclusion of which is seen as an important requirement for an aggressive easing of policy. On Thursday and Friday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet the heads of Germany's regions for talks on how to reduce the German budget deficit. The solidarity pact is unlikely to be completed for some time yet. But a successful agreement on how to divide up the cost of developing the eastern part of the country between the government and the regions could encourage the Bundesbank council to ease its official interest rates when it next meets on March 18.</p>

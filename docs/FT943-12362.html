			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / MPs weigh cost of saving Swans The cost to the taxpayer of saving Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, would be less than letting the company go under, local MPs said yesterday in a letter to the prime minister, the defence secretary and the chief secretary to the Treasury. Labour MPs Mr Steve Byers, who represents Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, whose constituency is Newcastle East, say that the saving to the government from providing the company with a two-year core programme of work - the main demand made by the only potential bidder for Swans as a going concern - would be Pounds 62.6m. This comprises Pounds 15.6m in lost tax and increased benefits should Swans' remaining 870 employees be made redundant; a Pounds 40m cost to the Treasury in capital allowances and business rates relief if a Tyneside Enterprise Zone were created; and a Pounds 7m European Community Intervention Fund subsidy if an ocean survey vessel contract were offered to Swans and classed as a merchant ship. The MPs' letter is intended to back the arguments which Cherbourg patrol-boat builder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie will air today at a meeting in London with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister. CMN, the sole prospective bidder, has said it would only buy Swans, which has been in receivership since May last year, if the British government guaranteed two years' work for the yard, worth about Pounds 50m, to underpin its operations while export orders were sought for the yard. The response of the ministers to Mr Iskandar Safa, head of CMN's Paris-based parent company Soffia, should indicate the survival prospects for Swan Hunter. Yesterday Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team, said receivers Price Waterhouse suggested in weekend discussions that it might accept deferred payment for Swan Hunter should Mr Safa decide to proceed with the bid. Mr Henderson declined to say what percentage might be deferred, or for how long, but welcomed the proposal. He added that the receivers were seeking about Pounds 10m for the company - which is more than Mr Safa wished to pay. But he believes that any gap between the two sides could be bridged.</p>

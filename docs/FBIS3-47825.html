			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pak Ui-chun: "Policy Adjustments by </F> Unification-Related Ministers Attracts Interest"]    [Text] Since new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok  replaced the progresively-inclined former Deputy Prime Minister  and Unification Minister Han Wan-sang, who served for a short  period of time, the issue of harmony within the government's  unification- affairs team has emerged as a matter of people's  interest. Under circumstances in which North-South dialogue,  including working-level contact for the exchange of special  envoys between the North and the South, is expected to be  resumed soon, remarkable differences in the natures of  unification-related ministers have been revealed, particularly,  between Deputy Prime Minister Yi and Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu in many aspects.    Since he assumed the post of deputy prime minister--overseer  of unification policies--Yi brought up the North Korean human  rights issue, which is considered to be the most sensitive issue  for North Korea. Following this, on 11 January, during his  visit to the administration office for the five North Korean  provinces in Kugidong, Seoul, he stressed that "in order to  achieve the reunification we desire, North Korea must also  change," and that he would not hold dialogue merely as a matter  of formality.    In a recent interview with a daily newspaper, he said that  "for North and South of Korea to reconcile substantially and  advance toward reunification, holding a substantive meeting is  important. This is what has prompted my recent remarks that the  time for us to choose words only to please North Korea are now  gone." His remarks clearly hark back to remarks made in the era  of North-South confrontational diplomacy clearly, and clearly  display his disposition. His remarks can also be interpreted to  be a signal that he will implement different policies from those  of his predecessor who stressed an "appeasement policy" in a bid  to induce North Korea to open up.    An expert in North Korean affairs pointed out: Deputy Prime  Minister Yi consistently makes improvisatory, expedient remarks  instead of providing concrete principles by which we should  abide. Such remarks are not helpful to future North-South  relations.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han, who is in fact exclusively  handing the North Korean nuclear issue that has emerged as the  core of North-South problems, was denounced by North Korea  sometime ago for his hardline remarks against the North.  However, his position has always been one of emphasizing  "dialogue," and has thus avoided making remarks that would  irritate North Korea.    In an article entitled "Foreign Minister Han and the North  Korean Nuclear Issue," THE NEW YORK TIMES of the United States  recently wrote that "Minister Han regards North Korea not as a  sworn enemy but as a capricious, sometime unpredictable, and  violent partner and sometimes, as an old relative. Thus, he is  full of confidence in dealing with North Korea with a sense of  humor and negotiations to the last." This article adequately  portrays his nature.    The two also seem to differ on their standpoint on North  Korea which is the underlying consciousness to resolving the  North Korean problem.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi was involved in the working-level  contacts for sending and receiving relief materials between  North and South Korea in 1984, and attended the 10th full-dress  meeting of North-South Red Cross talks in December 1985 as a  senior delegate to the Red Cross talks. As a result, he seems  to be keenly aware that North Korea is chiefly responsible for  the fact that meetings were held only for the sake of talks  between the North and the South and that there was no  substantive improvement in North-South relations.    Therefore, although he does not make remarks openly, Deputy  Prime Minister Yi, like many other conservatives, seems to  firmly believe that North Koreans are not to be trusted and that  a great number of problems exist in North Korea. On the other  hand, Minister Han has said: While North Korea uses tactics of  driving the situation to an extreme on one hand, it also appears  to use reason in handling issues overall. However, there are  differences in views between upper-level and lower-level  officials which is a factor undermining such reason. This  factor is being reflected in negotiation conditions and  attitudes in actual negotiations.    Minister Han's such view on North Korea reflects a position  and will to understand North Korea and to overcome such  problems. Thus, his view, in general, is similar to that of  former Deputy Prime Minister Han, with only a slight difference.  However, there is a great distance between the views of  Minister Han and new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. This  somewhat progressive viewpoint of Minister Han did not attract  much attention as it was shadowed by former Deputy Prime  Minister Han's remarks, which served as a shield.    However, with no Deputy Prime Minister Han, Foreign Minister  Han should now attempt to stand alone, because at a glance, no  one else amongst the unification-related ministers seems to be  more progressive than himself.</p>

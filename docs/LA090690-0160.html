			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK PLANS MEDIA DISTRICT GROWTH CURBS  </P> <P> After five years of study and debate, Burbank city officials Wednesday outlined  a plan to control growth in the city's Media District, fast emerging as one of  the country's largest centers of entertainment-oriented industries.  </P> <P> City and studio officials called the Media District Specific Plan one of the  most restrictive in Southern California. But homeowners complained that it does  not do enough to control the encroachment of commercial and industrial  development into their neighborhoods -- resurrecting the disagreements that  have kept the plan tied up in hearings since the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Home to the Disney, Warner Brothers and NBC studios, the Media District grew  largely uncontrolled during the early 1980s, transforming an area often  referred to sarcastically as "Beautiful Downtown Burbank."  </P> <P> The district's glass and steel high-rise office buildings each day attract  about 20,000 people employed by the studios and other entertainment businesses  that straddle the Ventura Freeway in southwest Burbank.  </P> <P> But the growth has been felt by residents of nearby neighborhoods. They say  their quiet, tree-lined streets have become virtual freeways during rush hour  and tall buildings have decimated the country-like atmosphere of  upper-middle-class neighborhoods such as Toluca Lake and the Burbank Rancho.  </P> <P> "During the early 1980s, there was a tremendous influx of high-density,  high-rise office buildings," City Manager Robert (Bud) Ovrom said. "Quite  frankly, not enough thought was given to the cumulative effects of all those  buildings combined."  </P> <P> If approved by the City Council later this fall, the Media District Specific  Plan will become the blueprint for future development on the 557 acres in the  southwest corner of Burbank. The plan imposes height limits, density  restrictions and design standards on new construction and seeks to protect  nearby residential neighborhoods from commercial and industrial intrusion. It  encourages the use of alternate transportation and requires companies to cut  back by 38% the auto traffic they generate over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, the plan encourages enough growth to keep the Media  District an attractive location for studios and other entertainment-oriented  industries.  </P> <P> Faced with the departure of the Lockheed Corp. to Georgia, city officials have  tried to make Burbank more attractive to business, a sore point with some  homeowners.  </P> <P> Many residents interviewed Wednesday complained that the plan actually would  increase traffic to gridlock levels and destroy the neighborhoods of  single-family homes that surround the area. "It is really a placebo to make  everyone feel good," homeowner Robert Olson said.  </P> <P> City and studio officials acknowledged that the plan, hammered out during five  years of hearings, is less than perfect.  </P> <P> "It's the best plan we could hope for because no one is ecstatic about it,"  said Jack O'Neill, vice president of real estate and facilities planning for  NBC.  </P> <P> The plan seeks to unite the different elements of the district, which is  bisected by the Ventura Freeway and lies roughly between Buena Vista Street and  Clybourn Avenue.  </P> <P> Pedestrian traffic will be encouraged throughout the district with the  construction of plazas. City planners especially want to maintain heavy  pedestrian use of Riverside Drive.  </P> <P> The plan imposes a height limit of 205 feet on projects that get conditional  use permits. Other buildings would be limited to 35 feet.  </P> <P> Studios also will be affected, but some officials said Wednesday that the  plan's publication will allow them to proceed with projects that have been put  on hold. Alan Epstein, vice president of the Disney Development Co., said all  Disney projects in Burbank have been delayed for the last five years as the  company waited to find out what restrictions the plan would impose. O'Neill  said NBC has delayed development of its 800,000 square-foot NBC Plaza project  for at least a year.  </P></p>

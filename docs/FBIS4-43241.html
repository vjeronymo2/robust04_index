			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "ank.": "German Trade Union Federation Calls For </F> Change in Economic Policy"]    [Text] Berlin, 13 June -- With the annual report of the  presidium, the 15th federal congress of the German Trade Union  Federation (DGB) was opened in Berlin on 13 June. Deputy DGB  Chairperson Ursula Engelen-Kefer, who also presented the report  on behalf of the late chairman, Heinz-Werner Meyer, called for a  "change in economic policy" of the Federal Government. She said  full employment had to become the main goal again. The number  of unemployed this year would increase to half a million this  year, the deputy chairperson predicted. In view of these  figures, there was no reason for the government to "demonstrate  official euphoria" about economic recovery. Mrs. Engelen-Kefer  called such an optimistic assessment an "obvious tactical  preelection maneuver." She added that politicians only started  talking about economic recovery when the new pay settlements,  which had been described everywhere as moderate, were concluded.    According to Mrs. Engelen-Kefer, the DGB is seeing the  social  welfare state in danger. Following the defeat of real  socialism, the threshold at which people are reluctant to attack  core elements of the social market economy had decreased. The  DGB official mentioned as examples the abolition of bad water  allowances for construction workers, the introduction of private  employment offices, and the admission of sub-standard wages.  She blamed the Federal Government's "reckless privatization  campaign" for this development. Neither regulation nor  deregulation should become a dogma. By the Federal Government's  "campaign" for more part-time employment, the government had  also recognized now that shorter, not longer, working hours  would be a means to combat unemployment. However, most employees  were hardly able to renounce a substantial part of their incomes  in connection with part-time work. Nor would the DGB accept an  increase in part-time employment conditions that did not  envisage any social insurance, said Mrs. Engelen-Kefer.    At the DGB congress, a reform of German trade unions will be  the most important topic. Mrs. Engelen-Kefer told the 600 trade  union delegates that it was urgently necessary to strengthen the  DGB's competence. However, she also warned them about getting  involved in a crisis scenario. The trade unions should defend  themselves against a "public campaign." She said: "Neither do  we have a mass exodus of members, nor are we a toothless tiger."  Mrs. Engelen- Kefer disputed a DGB budget deficit. However,  she admitted there were "financial problems" and an "alarming"  decline in the number of members by 1.5 million since 1992.  Presidium member Teitzel, who is in charge of finances, also  disputed a DGB budget deficit. He said the budget of the  current year was balanced, and there was no need to draw on  trade union assets. The profit and loss account of last year  was balanced and would show a "minor surplus."    CDU politician Fink, who is also a deputy DGB chairman,  called for "work for all." According to Fink, the pay  settlements this year have shown that trade unions not only  talked about, but also practiced, solidarity. However, Fink  warned about always presenting the United States as a model for  a functioning labor market. He said that in the United States,  many workers' incomes were below the poverty line.  International change would only be decided by the importance a  country gave education and research, said Fink with reference to  U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.    This Tuesday [14 June], the DGB congress will select a  successor to Heinz-Werner Meyer. The only candidate is IG  Metall Metal Workers Union Presidium member Dieter Schulte.  Mrs. Engelen-Kefer is once again running candidate for deputy  chairperson. There will be no other deputy in the future. Fink  is not running. He said it should still be possible in a unity  trade union to be an employee, a trade unionist, and a member of  the Christian Democratic Union. The Association of Christian  Democratic Employees (CDA) will, in the future, presumably only  be represented in the DGB Presidium by Mrs. Goerner. The  Presidium will be reduced from eight to five members.</p>

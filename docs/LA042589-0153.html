			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH LAUDS DRUG FIGHT IN SPEECH AT SEIZED HIDEAWAY  </P> <P> Underscoring a major theme of his Administration, President Bush traveled to a  former drug smuggling hideaway in Orange County today to hand law enforcement  officials more than $4 million in cash to aid their battle against drug  trafficking.  </P> <P> "Rancho del Rio has been reclaimed," Bush said in a speech to an  invitation-only audience of 1,300 guests at the remote canyon ranch east of San  Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Referring to the ranch, Bush said, "This operation had commercial packing  equipment, underground storage vaults, large vans with hidden compartments, jet  aircraft and ocean-going vessels.  </P> <P> "Once a warehouse of death, now it is a source of hope."  </P> <P> Authorities have alleged that the ranch, a luxurious canyon hideaway, was once  used as a transit point for thousands of pounds of marijuana and hundreds of  pounds of cocaine.  </P> <P> The President said the ranch will become an international training center for  narcotics enforcement. He said it will serve as a reminder to drug traffickers  that "your money won't help you. In fact, we're going to use it against you."  </P> <P> Bush described Orange County as "one of the largest and toughest drug markets  in the country." Despite that reputation, local law enforcement officials have  refused to give up the fight and have become an example "of hope, determination  and the American spirit," the President said.  </P> <P> Bush pointed to Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates and the Rev. Robert  Schuller as leaders of the local effort to combat drugs.  </P> <P> The President, noting the power and influence of Hollywood, called upon the  entertainment industry to take a bigger role in the war on drugs. He said the  entertainment industry has done much, but "you can do more. You must do more."  </P> <P> Bush arrived at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station at 11:30 a.m. aboard Air Force  One. He had spent the morning in the San Francisco Bay Area touring a Ford  Motor Co. aerospace plant.  </P> <P> Five minutes after his arrival at El Toro, Bush boarded a small Marine  helicopter for the 20-minute flight to the isolated ranch, which is accessible  only by air or a four-mile dirt road. The ranch is near the junction of Orange,  San Diego and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> Bush was to spend 90 minutes at the ranch, touring the hideaway, having lunch  with drug enforcement officials and agents, and then speaking to the invited  guests.  </P></p>

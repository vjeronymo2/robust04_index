			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Complaint system in schools 'woeful' THE ARRANGEMENTS for parents to make complaints about their children's schools are 'woefully inadequate', the National Consumer Council says in a report published today. The council says that the Parent's Charter has done little to help parents who want to complain - and the government's new white paper on opting out might make it even harder for some. The government-funded council calls for the existing 'bewildering array' of formal and informal complaints systems to be replaced by a simple, well-publicised system for complaints in every school and local education authority. Lady Wilcox, who chairs the council, said: 'The government takes the view that it should be the job of the school governors to deal with complaints. Our research shows that few governors are yet trained to handle complaints and, so far, they tend not to override the decisions of the headteacher.' The council says any new system should cover schools that have opted out of local education authority control. Parents of children at such schools must take up complaints with the Department for Education, 'which has a poor track record of dealing with parents' complaints'. It says pupils aged 16 and over should be allowed to use such a system. It urges the government to find ways of helping younger children to complain. The remit of the local-government ombudsman should be extended to cover complaints about maladministration of internal school matters. When things go wrong at school.

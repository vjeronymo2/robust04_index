			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Sterling nervous on worries about VAT vote today The pound traded steadily yesterday ahead of this evening's closely contested parliamentary vote on the increase in value added tax on fuel, writes Philip Gawith. Analysts warned, however, that it was vulnerable to a heavy sell-off if the government were defeated. Interest rate markets were nervous, with short sterling contracts losing ground across the board. The March contract fell 13 basis points to close in London at 92.66, down from 92.79. Sterling lost nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark in afternoon trade and finished at DM2.4542, from Friday's DM2.461. Against the dollar it was barely changed at Dollars 1.5591, from Dollars 1.5598. Activity was generally quiet, with one analyst saying that it had 'the feel of the first pre-Christmas trading day'. In Europe the main movement came from the Spanish peseta, which weakened to close at Pta83.86 against the D-Mark, from Pta83.42. Analysts said UK markets continued to be dominated by political factors. Today the focus is on whether the government will prevail in a vote on value added tax. This follows anxieties last week about whether a vote on European Union finance would pass, and a possible leadership challenge to the UK prime minister. Mr Peter Luxton, analyst at MMS, commented: 'Sterling is being affected by the two 'Ps' - politics and policy.' He said markets were worrying about a further loss of face for the government, as well as the possibility that a setback on VAT might leave a Pounds 1.5bn revenue hole in the 1995-96 budget. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said the key determinant for sterling until the year's end would be tomorrow's monthly monetary meeting, rather than politics. On a trade weighted basis the dollar has now appreciated 4.5 per cent from a recent low of 60.6 on October 25, and 5.5 per cent against the D-Mark. One factor buoying the currency is that US short-term rates have finally risen above those in Germany, giving investors an incentive to hold US assets. The interest rate argument could yet move further in the dollar's favour if German rates are cut. Yesterday Mr Gerd Haeusler, a Bundesbank board member, told a meeting in Frankfurt that he personally believed another rate reduction was possible, if inflation pressures eased further and money supply stayed under control. Explaining the Bundesbank's policy, of persisting with a fixed rate repo in its weekly money market operations, Mr Haeusler said a variable rate tender could be difficult in times of volatility or uncertainty; 'this is particularly true near to a real or supposed turnaround in interest rates'. Mr Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London, said: 'The Bundesbank has not made up its mind about what to do yet.' He said it would stick to a fixed repo until it was evident that a variable repo would not necessarily take short rates higher. A further factor affecting the dollar were rumours that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, would resign. Mr Bentsen later said the rumours were 'premature', but traders said his departure would have little impact on the dollar. Sentiment towards the dollar clearly continues to improve. Salomon Brothers has forecast the US currency rising to Y108 in the coming months, while some bold spirits see it moving as far as DM2.20 by end-1995. A meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels decided that they need take no action to alter the fluctuation bands in the exchange rate mechanism. 'The European Monetary Institute considers it is desirable to continue with the present arrangements. There will be no judgment on that,' said Mr Lamberto Dini, Italian treasury minister, after the meeting. Later, Mr Dini said the Italian government had not yet needed to decide whether it should rejoin the ERM. One currency that will be joining the ERM is the Austrian schilling, when Austria becomes an EU member on January 1. Traders said this would have little effect on the schilling as it is virtually fixed to the D-Mark. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 205m late assistance, and Pounds 750m assistance at established rates, after forecasting a daily shortage of Pounds 1.1bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Vitor Malheiros: "PoSat-1's Photo Album"; </F> photographs mentioned in the text have not been reproduced;  introductory paragraph in boldface as published]]    [Text] The two video cameras carried by PoSat have  already sent several hundred images back to earth, although only  on an experimental basis for the time being. The (black and  white) images are still being used only to fine-tune the  programs, but the regions photographed are already  recognizable.    As far as the scientists responsible for PoSat-1 are  concerned, the photographs illustrating this page are not even  worth publishing. They are images obtained during the process of  fine-tuning the two video cameras carried on the Portuguese  satellite, and they are still a long way from providing the  quality that it will be possible to achieve within a few weeks.  But they do provide at least a sample of the capabilities of the  instruments carried by the Portuguese satellite--even though it  has not been possible so far to obtain the images of Portuguese  territory that everyone is waiting for.    "We have not yet managed to obtain any image of Portugal  because of the poor weather conditions," we were told by Miguel  Leitmann of the National Institute of Engineering and Industrial  Technology (INETI). "Every time we have used the cameras over  Portugal, the only thing we have picked up is clouds."    But the difficulties inherent in obtaining images by  satellite are far from being just a matter of atmospheric  conditions. In fact, to obtain a good image with the two video  cameras on PoSat--they are used not to film pictures but to  obtain photographs--it is necessary above all to calibrate them  to adapt them to the features of the desired image and thus  obtain the maximum amount of information. Like commercial video  cameras, the two on-board cameras--a wide-angle camera and one  with a narrow angle--have electronic sensors to capture light.  And it is the signals picked up by those sensors which, after  being processed by the on-board computers, give rise to the  images shown above. But just as a photographer has to first  choose which film speed he will use, so it is also necessary in  this case to adjust the kind of processing that is being used in  order to obtain the best possible contrast. That is one of the  jobs to which the PoSat team has been devoting itself.    That calibration process is, however, relatively slow  because  it depends on the type of image captured: The way the camera is  adjusted to obtain an image of the green Amazon Region is  completely different from that used to photograph the white  Antarctic or that used to photograph the sea. And again, the  process can be compared point by point to what a photographer  does to take a photograph (choice of film and choice of filters,  shutter speed, and lens aperture), the only difference being  that in the case of satellites, it is all done after the fact by  a computer program that manipulates the data captured by the  cameras.    To be sure that the image processing programs they are using  are the most appropriate, the members of the PoSat team have  been trying at the moment to obtain images whose optical  characteristics are well known (sea, ice, forest, and desert) so  that they can use those images to calibrate the cameras--like  natural "sighting instruments." And only when all that is done  do they expect to obtain images of good enough quality for use  in managing natural resources or studying the dispersion of  pollutants.    Another difficulty still being posed by PoSat is its  movement. At the present time, the satellite is still swinging  like a pendulum and covering an angle of about 9 degrees, and it  is moving in a rotating motion. This means that it is still  impossible--for the time being--to know exactly where the  satellite is pointing, with the result that arduous searching in  atlases is required to locate precisely the areas that were  photographed. The fact is that because of the way PoSat-1  currently moves, the center of the images it captures may be  anywhere within a circle having a 120-km diameter. If we add to  that the fact that the camera with the narrowest angle covers an  area measuring 160 km square (the wide angle covers almost an  entire continent), it is easy to see the difficulty of  determining location.    In the images we show here, the difficulty of determining  location is increased by the fact that the regions photographed  are distorted in relation to the image we are accustomed to  seeing on maps. The reason is that many of the images were  captured while the satellite was "looking to the side."    But all those difficulties are expected to diminish when the  satellite starts using two of its position-finding and  attitude-indicating systems: the GPS [Global Positioning System]  receiver (which makes it possible to determine PoSat-1's  position relative to a system of satellites going by the name of  Global Positioning System) and the star sensor (which will make  it possible to determine the direction the satellite is facing).  When that happens, it will be possible to order the satellite to  take a picture while pointing at a given site instead of doing  so, as now, by determining which region of the sky the satellite  is in.</p>

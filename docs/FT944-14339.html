			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Board pay rises 'at 6.1%': Slowdown seen in rate of increases for company directors Average pay rises for company directors are running at almost three times the rate of inflation, a report says today. The report by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, the pay and benefits consultants, says the average pay increase for directors in the past 12 months was 6.1 per cent. The biggest pay increases, of 9.2 per cent on average, were awarded to deputy chief executives. Chief executives did not appear to fare as well, with their average salary increasing 5.1 per cent from Pounds 91,779 a year to Pounds 96,484 a year. Divisional managing directors did better, with rises of more than 8 per cent. The survey, following an earlier report by Bacon &amp; Woodrow which put annual directors' pay increases at 8.5 per cent, is further evidence that executive pay rises have been running well ahead of average earnings. The underlying average earnings rate in August was 3.75 per cent. The upward trend in pay increases appears to have been stemmed in the past three months, however. Mr Andy Christie, the company's remuneration consulting director, said: 'For the first time in nearly five years we are seeing a fluctuation in the market where in one quarter the salaries are marginally up and in the next they are dipping down again.' The report says that the average increase for all executives was 5 per cent. It adds that the highest average pay rises, of 5.2 per cent, were to executives based in the midlands and the north of England. The lowest average increases were 2.7 per cent to executives in Wales and the south-west. The incidence of performance-related bonuses has risen this year. Almost half of the executives surveyed were receiving bonuses for achieving performance targets compared with just over 44 per cent at the time of the last report in June. The way that bonuses are being paid is changing. Mr Christie said: 'Team working is the most popular basis for these schemes while individual performance, seen to be a more divisive measure, is now the least favoured.' Trends in executive benefits packages show that health screening is on the increase, now offered by 70 per cent of companies surveyed. Paid paternity leave is being offered by a third of the companies. More companies are offering cash alternatives to company cars but take up rates are less than 1 per cent at senior levels.

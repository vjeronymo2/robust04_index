			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (12): Rivals gathering strength - Motor industry The drama of Volvo's failed plan to merge with France's Renault and - earlier - the launch of a new car billed as a make-or-break model for Saab has evoked much worried concern in Sweden this year about the future of the country's motor industry. A close look behind the headlines suggests, however, that both Volvo and Saab are in positions of gathering strength, at least in the short to medium term. In contrast to the formidable structural problems facing such European giants as Volkswagen, Fiat and Mercedes, both Swedish companies have already been through a painful process of rationalisation and are beginning to reap the benefits. 'I think both Saab and Volvo are in rather good industrial shape at the moment,' was the somewhat surprising remark of a Volvo car company executive in the aftermath of the Renault merger collapse. Not that there is any complacency in the two western cities of Gothenburg and Trollhaten, where Volvo and Saab have their respective headquarters and main plants. In the long term, a big question mark hangs over Volvo's strategy now that the merger with Renault is off. Volvo readily acknowledges that it needs a partner to ensure its long-term stability in a world motor industry carrying heavy overcapacity. It is worried that Renault will gradually reverse out of their three-year-old alliance after the snub of rejection delivered by Volvo senior management and its shareholders. Saab Automobile, which is jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Sweden's Saab-Scania group, also has a long way to go to prove its long-term viability after five successive years of losses and tumbling sales. But for the time being the graph is pointing up for both the long-time rivals, despite the toughest recession for years in the wider European market and especially at home, where annual car sales have plummeted from 340,000 in 1988 to about 125,000 this year. Indeed, a surge back into profits at Volvo in recent months was one of the factors cited by those who opposed the merger with Renault, which has suffered sharp reverses in profitability this year. In the first nine months, the Volvo group reported a SKr2bn improvement in operating profits, swinging from a SKr1.52bn loss in the same period in 1992 to a Skr445m profit. Both the car and truck divisions were profitable, with the long-running trend of falling unit sales shifted back to growth, albeit very small. Car sales were up to 229,400 from 228,900. In the car operations, Volvo attributes a good deal of this turnaround to a tough programme of restructuring. In response to mounting losses in the early 1990s, Volvo is shutting two of its three Swedish plants and by 1995 will have cut 15,000 staff from the workforce. Meanwhile, efficiency has been sharply improved, with the number of hours taken to make a vehicle tumbling from 70 to 40. At Saab, which ran up losses totalling SKr10bn over the past four years, there is a similar story. Losses are down sharply this year and the company expects to return to the black in 1994 for the first time since 1988. If so, it will be the result of a severe restructuring that required the injection of SKr8bn in new capital from GM and Saab-Scania. Production has been concentrated in three plants and the workforce halved to about 7,300. Production time for the new 900 model, launched in July, is down to about 30 hours compared with figures as high as 110 hours a few years ago. Sales, which have slumped from 109,500 in 1989 to 75,000 this year, have begun to turn around. The company projects sales of the 9000 and 900 to total 87,000 next year, ahead of the break-even level of 80,000. Both Saab and Volvo, which export the big majority of their cars, are benefiting strongly from the windfall effects of a 30 per cent fall in the value of the Swedish krona since last year. Both have narrow model ranges limited to the middle and upper market tiers. Their traditional competitive advantages of safety and environmental friendliness are fast being caught up by their competitors. Volvo has taken a dangerous leap in the dark by tearing up the Renault merger plan. The two rivals still have to prove that Sweden can be a competitive location for vehicle making in the long term. But the progress they have made in 1993 has at least set them up with a chance of success.</p>

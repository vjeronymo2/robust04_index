			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tunnel fight will not be skimped Sir, I am a little surprised that you should publish Michael Thompson-Noel's gratuitous insults aimed at the people of Kent in 'Tunnel of Sighs' (Hawks &amp; Handsaws, January 29). I may or may not be a 'selfish and common sort', but I see no reason 'to shut up' in the present circumstances. Presumably he feels that the common yokels of Kent should touch their straw-ridden forelocks to Mr Major, and probably indeed to Mr Thompson-Noel if he ever leaves the city (or cocktail-belt?) to widen his 'experience'. He may be an expert on macro-engineering, but has he given any thought to our present problems? The 'venomous anger' had long since abated with the route fixed in the corridor already ruined by the M20, and huge sums paid in compensation. Now a few Ashford councillors, without consultation, have produced a new route which devastates an entirely new corridor through one of the most beautiful areas of Kent, including this village which is considered so idyllic that the 'Darling Buds of May cricket match' was filmed here] The new route has some merit in taking the new line to the new station, but would never have been suggested if our penny-pinching government had not refused to tunnel from the original route, on the grounds that it would cost Pounds 60m, a paltry sum compared with the Channel tunnel cost. I agree with Mr T-N, this is a great project, comparable to the Great Wall of China in the time it will take to complete, so why wreck it by economising? I am sure Appius Claudius did not skimp on his paving stones. I suspect that the people of Kent will fight for this tunnel in spite of the views of Mr T-N, who would evidently be delighted if Mr Major resuscitated the Fourth Legion and sent it to Little Chart.

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Rugby Group After CRH last week and Rugby yesterday the market might well ask itself how many other UK building material companies will manage to increase first half profits in 1992. The answer is probably one at most. Rugby's 10 per cent advance at the pre-tax level is undeniably a good performance in the current climate, though even more encouraging yesterday was the group's assertion that it is suitably structured for today's conditions. Further capacity and cost cuts are all too painfully inevitable elsewhere in the sector. It is nevertheless the overseas tail (36 per cent of the profits total and rising) which is now conspicuously wagging the Rugby dog. In spite of adverse currency movements - which knocked more than Pounds 600,000 off profits in translation - Australia, the US, and the European joinery businesses all turned in better results than a year ago. Combined with a higher return on Rugby's cash balances - which are broadly unchanged from the end year level - this more than offset lower contributions from the UK joinery and metal products divisions. The impact of rigid cost controls is best seen in cement where operating margins in the six months were 16.3 per cent, against 13.5 per cent in last year's second half. With Rugby budgeting for a further 5 per cent decline in UK cement volumes in 1993, the importance of its overseas interests is merely underlined. The shares, up 9p yesterday at 169p, look fairly rated for the moment on the market yield of 5.1 per cent and a forward earnings multiple (given full year profits of say Pounds 58m) of 12.6. Ultimately they may do better if the company uses its strong balance sheet to make a shrewd acquisition or two.</p>

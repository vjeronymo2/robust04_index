			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> BENGALS BAR REPORTERS FROM PRACTICE FIELD  </P> <P> City police turned reporters away from the Cincinnati Bengals' practice complex  today after the team, preparing to play Jan. 22 in the Super Bowl, abruptly  canceled a scheduled news conference with coach Sam Wyche.  </P> <P> Wyche decided to cancel the meeting with reporters because he needed the time  to prepare for the Super Bowl game against the San Francisco 49ers, said Allan  Heim, the Bengals' director of public relations. The Bengals had previously  issued a media advisory to reporters in which the NFL team said Wyche would be  available at specified times every day this week.  </P> <P> Two police officers stopped reporters at the gate of the Bengals' Spinney Field  training complex to say the facility was closed to the press.  </P> <P> Wyche had already spent some time Monday and Tuesday with reporters and will be  available to them Thursday and Friday, so he decided to cancel today's session.  </P></p>

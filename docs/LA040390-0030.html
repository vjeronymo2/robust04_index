			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPPORTS NURSE IN ENGLISH-ONLY SUIT;  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS: THE FEDERAL EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AGENCY SEEKS TO JOIN FILIPINA'S  CLAIM THAT A POMONA HOSPITAL BARS SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGES AT WORK.  </P> <P> The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Monday it is seeking  to join the civil rights lawsuit of a Filipina nurse who has accused a Pomona  hospital of requiring nurses to speak only English at work.  </P> <P> After a preliminary investigation, the commission filed a motion Monday to  intervene in the suit filed last July by Adelaida (Aida) Dimaranan, a nurse for  12 years at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center.  </P> <P> "We are trying to send the message that English-only rules are very important  to the commission, especially when they tread upon the rights of employees,"  said EEOC attorney Robert T. Olmos, who filed the motion in U.S. District Court  in Los Angeles. Such rules "create an atmosphere of inferiority, isolation and  intimidation based on national origin."  </P> <P> Dimaranan contends that the hospital has an informal English-only policy that  prevents Filipina nurses in the maternity and child services ward from speaking  their native Tagalog while on breaks, in the cafeteria or on the telephone.  </P> <P> Hospital officials, however, say they have no such policy and point to a letter  the hospital president, Robert W. Burwell, sent to employees saying they could  speak other languages on the job if doing so did not disrupt patient care.  </P> <P> Laura Elek, a hospital spokeswoman, said she was "puzzled" by the EEOC's  action.  </P> <P> "We have said all along that people can speak whatever language they're  comfortable with," Elek said. "We have continually expressed that we view the  multilingual skills as an asset."  </P> <P> The nonprofit, 399-bed hospital serves an ethnically mixed neighborhood of  Latinos, blacks and Anglos in north Pomona. About 100 of its 2,100 employees  are Filipino, Elek said. According to Dimaranan, about half of the 14 maternity  nurses working the evening shift are Filipina.  </P> <P> Dimaranan's attorneys argue that the president's letter was vaguely worded and  has not prevented supervisors from exercising subtle discrimination so nurses  will be reluctant to speak anything but English.  </P> <P> The letter, dated March 24, 1989, does not specify the conditions under which  employees may speak languages other than English, and makes no mention of how  the policy is enforced.  </P> <P> "As long as it's not written down, sometimes they'll enforce it, sometimes it's  not enforced," said Kathryn K. Imahara, an attorney with the Asian Pacific  American Legal Center, which, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of  Southern California, is representing Dimaranan.  </P> <P> In the lawsuit, Dimaranan, 46, of Rowland Heights, claims that two supervisors  in the maternity unit told her and other nurses that the speaking of Tagalog  was forbidden "at any time or any place." The supervisors did not explain why  the policy was necessary or tell them what disciplinary actions would be taken  if Tagalog was used in the workplace, she says.  </P> <P> Dimaranan said the warning came in 1988 after another nurse overheard her  talking to her mother in Tagalog over the telephone, and reported Dimaranan to  the head nurse.  </P> <P> In a complaint filed with the EEOC last September, Dimaranan accused the  hospital of demoting her in retaliation for filing the lawsuit. She was  transferred from assistant head nurse of the maternity unit to a staff position  in the emergency ward.  </P> <P> Elek said Dimaranan was reassigned "because her technical skills would be  better utilized. This is actually a case of one employee's performance, not  discrimination or retaliation."  </P> <P> If the EEOC's motion to join the lawsuit is granted in federal court, the  commission would be allowed to conduct depositions and to present witnesses  during the trial.  </P> <P> Federal labor codes allow employers to establish English-only language policies  when they can show that the rule is justified in the normal course of doing  business. The employer must inform workers of the circumstances under which  they must use only English, and the consequences of violating the policy.  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wray raises Carlisle interest Mr Nigel Wray, executive chairman of Burford Holdings, the property group, is set to become non-executive chairman of Carlisle Group after he increases his interest in the property services company. The move accompanied a warning that 1993 pre-tax losses were expected to rise from Pounds 947,000 to Pounds 2.85m. Under a planned cash raising Mr Wray, and companies and trusts in which he has an interest, will acquire between 39.82 per cent and 54.76 per cent of Carlisle. The requirement to make a full offer has been waived by the Takeover Panel. Mr Wray, who at present has a 10.2 per cent holding, is subscribing for 27.3m shares at 11p to raise a net Pounds 2.71m. He will replace as chairman Mr Jonathan Harris, who will become deputy chairman and chief executive. The company is also seeking to raise up to Pounds 3.04m through a rights issue of 27.7m shares at 11p on a 1-for-1 basis. The offer is not underwritten but undertakings have been received to take up 32.95 per cent. The shares rose 3p to close at 36 1/2 p. The new shares will have a nominal value of 10p. It is proposed to split the existing 25p shares into one 10p and one 15p deferred. The total proceeds will be used to buy the head leasehold interest in Carlisle's London headquarters for Pounds 2.35m from Mr Jonathan Harris and his brother Richard. The balance will go for working capital. The company said that the money was needed to ensure it reached the critical mass required to progress as a listed company. Losses are expected to rise because of an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.75m relating to the closure of its Hirshfields offshoot during the year allowing the company to concentrate on its Pepper Angliss &amp; Yarwood operation. As part of the planned changes Mr Jonathan Harris and Mr Clifford Toye, director responsible for property services, will take pay cuts in exchange for an issue of warrants. It is also proposed to offset the deficit on the profit and loss account by cancelling the deferred shares, cancelling the capital redemption reserve and reduction of the share premium account.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Service is stressed for mail sell-off The government yesterday outlined a new regulatory framework for a privatised Post Office. Its main function would be to guarantee services rather than to stimulate competition. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and industry minister, said the DTI expected to win backbench support for privatisation with a regulatory structure aimed at strengthening rural services and the uniform letter delivery. At the centre of the regime would be a director-general for postal services with a statutory obligation to ensure that the public was provided with a comprehensive level of services. Mr McLoughlin told a conference in London: 'There would be a legal requirement for Royal Mail to carry out these services and on the regulator to ensure they do so. 'This would represent a far greater level of protection for the Royal Mail's customers than exists at present.' In contrast to the role of some of the utility regulators, competition would be a secondary issue for the regulator of a privatised Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division. The need for 'some increased competition' was a secondary function. Mr McLoughlin warned, however, that the DTI had little confidence in those who argued for 'free competition' that would allow the most efficient operator to exploit economies of scale. He said more competition would ensue from reducing the Post Office's monopoly on letters costing less than Pounds 1 to send and extending the range of discounts to customers who pre-sorted their mail. The DTI hopes to publish its green paper setting out the options for change in the next fortnight. Mr McLoughlin said a partial or 100 per cent sale of shares in the Royal Mail and Parcelforce 'represents the best way forward'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was recently forced to give the option of commercialisation in the public sector greater emphasis in the green paper. Mr McLoughlin questioned this option, asking how the government could prevent a public-sector Post Office from exploiting its letter monopoly or from cross-subsidising its products. Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, said he was 'deeply sceptical' that the option of more commercialisation in the public sector would work. He warned that the only way to protect services to customers was by radical change.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / ALAN DROOZ;  </P> <P> A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD: LIONS TO BE TESTED EARLY  </P> <P> The Loyola Marymount basketball team had better learn to make itself at home on  the road, because it appears the Lions will be building up frequent flyer miles  for the holidays.  </P> <P> By the time 1991 arrives, the Lions and Coach Paul Westhead will have traveled  from Maui to Norman, Okla., to Atlanta and Baton Rouge, La., with quick  in-state trips up to Santa Barbara and Stockton included as well.  </P> <P> In fact, with only one date to be filled, the Lions do not expect to play an  official home game before Christmas.  </P> <P> The Lions' schedule of 11 consecutive road games, which features several  attractive matchups, opens at the Maui Classic, where they will play three  games Nov. 23-25. The eight-team field includes national powers Syracuse and  Indiana, who are expected to be seeded 1-2. After Thanksgiving, Loyola will  play in the UC Irvine tournament along with Bradley, Idaho State and the host  Anteaters on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. Then it will travel to Westwood Dec. 2 to play  UCLA.  </P> <P> During the next two weeks, the Lions travel to UC Santa Barbara and play a home  exhibition game against Athletes in Action. On Dec. 15, the Lions travel to  Norman, Okla., for a televised game against the equally run-loving Oklahoma  Sooners. Then it's on to Louisiana State on Dec. 20 and Georgia Tech on Dec. 22  -- both teams figure to be in the top 20 -- before returning to California for  a brief Christmas break. On Dec. 27, the Lions play at at University of the  Pacific.  </P> <P> Seven consecutive home games begin on Dec. 29 when the Lions play St. Joseph's  of Philadelphia, Westhead's alma mater. On New Year's Eve, Loyola plays LaSalle  and on Jan. 5, U.S. International visits. Loyola and Oklahoma have set  virtually every NCAA scoring record against USIU in the past two years.  Westmont College, the only non-Division I opponent on the schedule, visits in  the last nonconference tuneup.  </P> <P> West Coast Conference play starts Jan. 11 with the Lions playing Santa Clara.  Then comes San Diego and Pepperdine. The traditional home-and-away week with  archrival Pepperdine comes early, at Loyola on Jan. 16 and the Jan. 19 game at  Malibu.  </P> <P> The season concludes with the WCC tournament, March 2-4, at Santa Clara, where  the Lions will be shooting for their fourth consecutive tournament title and  the WCC's automatic berth into the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> At least six of Loyola's games are scheduled to be televised.  </P> <P> A new feature this season in conference play will be men's and women's  doubleheaders, with the women's game usually preceding the men's game.  </P> <P> It might be the off-season, but Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave  Yanai is managing to stay busy. Yanai returned from the U.S. Olympic Festival  in Minneapolis, where he was an assistant for the West team, and this week he's  scouting summer leagues and tournament games and running his basketball camp at  the school.  </P> <P> Although the West team went 1-3 in Minnesota, its losses were so close that it  actually had a positive scoring differential. And, Yanai is glad to report, "I  would say Western basketball is alive and well. I thought we had some very fine  players, I would say some of the (college) coaches who are getting these  players are very lucky."  </P> <P> Yanai said he enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the Festival camp, which  allowed players and coaches from all the sports to mingle.  </P> <P> "It was an interesting opportunity to see a variety of other sports and other  athletes, and see the kind of dedication those other athletes go through to get  here" he said. "Sometimes we get caught up in our own sports and kind of forget  the others that are going on. I also enjoyed getting a chance to meet coaches  from the other sports, informally, in the village and at meals. That's the kind  of atmosphere they try to create."  </P> <P> Yanai, who is one of the nation's most respected Division II coaches, also  liked talking basketball with the festival's other coaches. "It's good to have  a chance to exchange basketball ideas and experiences," he said. "We had a lot  of nice talks about basketball. We all got along well. It was a nice  experience."  </P> <P> Yanai will be closing in on his 200th career victory when the Toros' season  opens in the fall, and has high hopes for a strong team thanks to a solid core  of veterans and a strong recruiting class.  </P> <P> "We should be pretty good if the old coach doesn't screw them up," he said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles can't seem to get enough of recent Loyola Marymount graduate and  Clipper first-round draft choice Bo Kimble. The County Board of Supervisors  declared Tuesday "Bo Kimble Day" and presented him with a plaque.  </P> <P> As Kimble watched, the supervisors cited him "not only for his accomplishments  on the court, but for providing a positive role model for Los Angeles' youth."  </P> <P> A month ago, Loyola Marymount Athletic Director Brian Quinn said that baseball  Coach Chris Smith had such a good staff, he feared it would be difficult to  keep it intact. Quinn's premonitions were correct. In the past few weeks, Rick  Ragazzo took a job scouting for the San Francisco Giants, Bill Geivett is  expected to take an assistant coaching position at another school and Dave Kato  has decided to teach school.  </P> <P> That wipes out the coaching staff of Smith, who is hurriedly conducting  interviews. And the sudden turnover might not be over: Smith, who has led the  Lions to NCAA regional appearances in his two seasons at Loyola, said that if  contacted he would consider the head coaching opening at Cal State Fullerton,  although he said this week he hasn't actively pursued it. "You'd have to be  interested," he said.  </P> <P> The good news for the Lions was that they came out of last month's pro draft  unscathed. None of their eligible juniors -- notably outfielders Rick  Mediavilla and Tim Williams -- left school and none of Smith's top recruits  signed contracts.  </P> <P> "We didn't get hurt at all," Smith said. "We saved all our freshmen. We'll  return seven starters and some guys with pitching experience."  </P> <P> Now he's back recruiting -- a coaching staff.  </P> <P> College Notes  </P> <P> Carin Jennings, the former Palos Verdes High and UC Santa Barbara soccer  All-American, was a member of the North squad that won the U.S. Olympic  Festival title last weekend. She is also a member of the women's national team  that is in training for next year's first Women's World Cup. Jennings, who  graduated from Palos Verdes in 1983, holds the CIF girls' record of 226 career  goals. At Santa Barbara, she became the first women to score 100 goals,  finishing with an NCAA record 102. Santa Barbara retired her jersey in 1988. .  . . Bruce Meyers is the new sports information director at Loyola Marymount. He  was previously an assistant at Nevada Las Vegas. . . . Loyola baseball players  Joe Ciccarella and Chris Gomez, playing for a touring U.S. junior national  team, each homered in a 15-0 victory over Nicaragua. Ciccarella's blast was a  grand slam.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(fiz)": "The Aviation Industry Manufacturers </F> Are Establishing an Association"]    [Text] Prague--A total of 22 of the most important  aircraft hardware manufacturers met in Prague yesterday for  preparatory talks on establishing the Association of Aviation  Industry Manufacturers. The Association's Preparatory Committee  was elected within the framework of yesterday's talks. During  the course of the next two to three weeks, it should draft all  of the materials for the constituent general assembly.    According to Miroslav Petru, the president of the  Avia-Hamilton Standard Aviation company, who was one of the  initiators of this event, the association will endeavor to  improve the economic conditions for our aircraft hardware  manufacturers. In his opinion, the aircraft industry is the  leader in industrial production, and the overall expansion of  industrial output depends on its favorable economic development.  According to him, the association's establishment could lead to  an improvement in the position of our aviation industry and thus  support the development of this branch, which, by its  state-of-the-art technology, sets the tone for the other  branches of industrial production. Petru also said that the  association will lobby for specific government assistance but  gave no further details on this issue. He merely said that  specific support for the aviation industry as the flagship of  the economy is simply a matter of course in such economically  developed countries as, for example, the United States and Great  Britain.</p>

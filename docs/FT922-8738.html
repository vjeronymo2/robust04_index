			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television It would be a rare year that produced another drama serial as good as Anglo Saxon Attitudes, and since the relationships within this splendid Angus Wilson story are pretty tangled it is advisable to watch carefully from the beginning (8.30 ITV). Such dedication will be rewarded. This excellent adaptation by Andrew Davies works on all levels: among the backbiting historians, the homosexual demi-monde of 1950s London, and above all in telling the odd, and yet in so many ways recognisable, story of the Middleton family. Richard Johnson gives the best performance I have seen from him as the upstanding yet imperfect patriarch around whom so much revolves. In Assignment the estimable Michael Charlton returns to his native Australia to investigate the national identity crisis (if that is what it is) exemplified by Prime Minister Paul Keating's notorious comments about Australia and Britain (7.45 BBC2). BBC1's drama Boys From The Bush, which returns for a second series, is also set in Australia where some pretty far-fetched and/or farcical stories are built around a tin-pot detective agency (9.30 BBC1).</p>

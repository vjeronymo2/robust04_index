			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho Solis said today that the Mexican Government has  affirmed its decision to respect the cease-fire in the conflict  in the southeastern Chiapas State and maintains its commitment  to a political solution in favor of peace.    "We still do not have the final (peace) agreements, but the  decision to respect the cease-fire has been affirmed, and we  maintain the commitment to seek a political solution in favor of  peace," Camacho said after meeting with Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari.    On Sunday, Camacho Solis stated the government's position  with regard to an announcement made by the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) that the first phase of the dialogue for  peace is over.    The EZLN also called for a national dialogue with the  participation of the country's "progressive and independent"  sectors and announced that it will not prevent the holding of  general elections on 21 August "in territories under its  control."    The armed group, which forcefully occupied several towns in  the State of Chiapas on 1 January, also unilaterally extended an  offensive cease-fire and thanked the peace commissioner for his  efforts to find a political conflict to the conflict.    Camacho announced during a news conference that the  government agreed to maintain invariably a 12 January decision  that the Mexican Army establish a unilateral cease-fire for all  armed offensive actions (...) unless attacked.    He added that patrols and relief operations will continue to  be carried out at the southern border and that measures will be  maintained in view of the possible mobilization of weapons and  explosives within the region of conflict. This measure seeks to  prevent other groups in the area from arming themselves and  provoking confrontations among communities and organizations, he  said.    Camacho added that the solutions the government offered to  the problems of justice and development, which are contained in  the 32 commitments of the dialogue in San Cristobal, will be  applied to other (?communities), which are not involved in the  conflict, because they are fair.    Likewise, he said the state government will strengthen the  dialogue and negotiation mechanisms in the areas under its  control, and that, regarding the EZLN topics, he will request  the participation of San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who is  the mediator.    The commissioner pointed out that the EZLN insists on his  intention to be recognized as a militant force, which is not  possible under any circumstance, "because it would undermine  national sovereignty and the integrity of our territory." He  added that "this would lead to interference by international  forces in a Mexican domestic matter."    Governor of Chiapas Javier Lopez Moreno also announced  tonight that he will be responsible for fulfilling the 32  commitments reached with the EZLN in the peace talks and that  Commissioner Camacho Solis will only intervene in the "delicate"  cases.</p>

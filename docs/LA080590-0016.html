			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HYPE IS HYPE, BUT THIS IS PLAIN CREEPY  </P> <P> I'm amazed I haven't seen anything in print yet about the latest gimmick being  used by unscrupulous producers to promote their movies. I saw plenty about the  excess of the Dick Tracy promotions but nothing about the movie  "Arachnophobia."  </P> <P> I know that the makers of "Arachnophobia" are at fault, because who else could  train hundreds of spiders to invade my home?  </P> <P> I first noticed them right after the first ads for the movie came out. They  came into my house, onto my walls, into my cupboards -- everywhere! I lost  count of how many times I've seen a spider come running across the floor aiming  straight for a pair of empty shoes. And the time a spider crawled up my shower  curtain while I was taking a shower, his three-inch body made a silhouette that  would do Hitchcock proud.  </P> <P> OK already, I'm going to the movie! Honest! I'll see it twice -- I'll even skip  bargain nights and pay full price. Just call off the spiders. Please?  </P> <P> JOHN SWITZER  </P> <P> Goleta  </P></p>

			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / International Company News: Dutch electronics group pauses for thought - The gloom at Philips has been deepened by the delayed launch of DCC The top managers at Philips face a formidable task when they return from their summer holidays this week to announce the Dutch electronics group's first-half results on Thursday. They will be at pains to bolster investors' confidence in the group, as they report a substantial drop in the second-quarter figures and a less-than-rosy outlook for the rest of the year. News last week that the group would delay the launch of its digital compact cassette (DCC), an important new consumer product, due to manufacturing problems, dealt a blow to its reputation, which had already suffered a number of dents recently. Over the last two months Philips's shares plunged after it surprised the market with a profits warning. This was followed by the resignation of two leading figures responsible for the development of compact disc-interactive (CD-I) and high definition television (HDTV), two of three products Philips is counting on to lead the recovery of its consumer electronics business. The decision by Tandy, a leading US consumer electronics retailer, to stop manufacturing CD-I machines added to concerns that the product is not doing well in the US, where it has been on sale since last autumn. Philips's delay in launching DCC means that of the three products it is staking its future on, the one which had seemed most likely to gain quick market acceptance, is facing problems. The move has damaged confidence in the group, which had been buoyed because DCC was being brought to market well ahead of its potential rival: Minidisc, to be launched by Sony. Additionally, the announcement that DCC would only be sold in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Germany, rather than throughout Europe, appeared to show flagging confidence in the product's prospects. Without more information, however, it is difficult for investors to assess the extent of the manufacturing problems causing DCC's postponement, or determine how soon it will be sold worldwide. Philips says the problems are minor and that the machines will be available 'well before the Christmas selling season'. Perhaps the worst outcome of the recent events has been to undermine Philips's reassurances, so that its share price has fallen nearly 37 per cent from Fl 38 on June 16 to Fl 24 at the end of last week. 'There is a feeling that it is a company that is just failing to deliver what it promises,' one analyst commented. While Philips is not alone in suffering depressed consumer demand, a continuing difficult outlook and worse than expected results, it is particularly vulnerable to investors' disappointment, because they see it as a bellwether of Europe's ambitions in consumer electronics. There are also growing doubts over the three products Philips has positioned as its main profit earners and over whether they will be able to deliver the profits necessary to ensure its future health. Philips is venturing into unknown territory with CD-I. The success of this product depends on the appeal to consumers of the software, but the availability of software titles has been disappointing in both the US and UK. The future of HDTV, and its precursor, wide-screen TV, has been under a cloud as broadcasters have remained reluctant to commit themselves to agreed formats, and as efforts to develop digital television, a further technological advance, both in the US and Europe have gained momentum. Meanwhile, there are doubts whether DCC will be a big enough success to lift consumer demand overall. The world-wide market for recordable digital sound equipment over the next five years is estimated by Nomura Research Institute, to total a little as Dollars 7bn. Mr Miles Saltiel of Nomura, says: 'Even assuming Philips gets a third of that, it doesn't represent a big enough market to rectify Philips's problems.' The most positive defence that Philips can make is that it is too early to judge the success of the three products. New products invariably take time to win acceptance. It took compact discs five years to reach 5 per cent penetration of the European market, while video cassette recorders took seven years to reach that level. Given these timescales, at least one of Philips's new products could become the big success it desperately needs. However, the pressing question for Philips in the short term is whether investors are prepared to give it the time it needs. As one analyst says, whether Philips succeeds in winning back investor confidence depends largely on how it conducts itself at the meeting when it reports the first-half results. The task for top managers is to convince investors that everything is under control and the outlook is not as bad as it seems. They are unlikely to be relishing their role.</p>

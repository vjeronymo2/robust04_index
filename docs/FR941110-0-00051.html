			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not met all requirements and neither find that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the following procedures would apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If both HCFA and the State find that a facility's participation should be terminated, the State's timing of any termination (as specified in proposed &sect;431.153(c)) would control so long as the termination date does not occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding to terminate (&sect;488.234(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If HCFA, but not the State finds that a facility's participation should be terminated, HCFA's decision to terminate would prevail and HCFA would permit continuation of payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination, not to exceed 6 months from the last day of survey (&sect;488.234(b)(l)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If the State, but not HCFA finds that a facility's participation should be terminated, the State's decision to terminate and the timing of the termination (as specified in proposed section 431.153(c)) would control (&sect;488.234(b)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If HCFA or the State, but not both, would impose one or more remedies that are additional or alternative to termination, the additional or alternative remedies would also be applied (&sect;488.234(d)(l)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If both HFCA and the State would impose one or more remedies that are additional or alternative to termination, only the additional or alternative remedies of HCFA would apply (&sect;488.234(d)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Termination of Provider Agreements and Discontinuation of FFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At &sect;488.238, we said that termination of the provider agreement would end payment to the facility and any alternative remedy. We proposed that HCFA and the State may terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fails to correct deficiencies within the specified time;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fails to submit a plan of correction within the time specified by HCFA; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We said that HCFA and the State would terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility with immediate and serious threat deficiencies refuses temporary management, if that remedy is offered by HCFA or the Medicaid agency. In addition, we proposed that, before terminating a provider agreement, HCFA does and the State must notify the facility and the public_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;At least 2 and not more than 4 calendar days before termination for a facility with immediate and serious threat deficiencies; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;At least 15 calendar days before termination for a facility with non-immediate and serious threat deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current termination notification requirement at &sect;489.53(c)(1) requires HCFA to give notice to any provider at least 15 days before the actual effective date of a termination of a provider agreement, irrespective of whether the situation poses an immediate and serious threat, except in the case of Medicare SNFs. Section 489.53(c)(2) provides that SNFs with deficiencies that pose an immediate and serious threat are entitled to notice of the termination at least 2 days before the effective date of the termination of the provider agreement. Since the existing regulations do not discriminate between immediate and serious and nonimmediate and serious threat situations except in the case of Medicare SNFs, we proposed to amend &sect;489.53(c)(2) to require at least 2 and not more than 4 calendar days notice to all providers of a termination action involving an immediate and serious threat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

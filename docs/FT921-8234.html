			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Bonn 'cannot afford' to host conference GERMANY'S withdrawal as host to a UN conference shows that Bonn is at its financial limits after helping the former Soviet bloc, a government spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. Bonn has backed away from hosting the 1993 UN Human Rights Conference in Berlin after deciding it could not afford the estimated cost of DM100m (Dollars 62.8m). 'We wanted to make clear. . . that we have reached a certain upper limit of our financial ability. That applies too to an amount like DM100m,' the official said. 'It may be a good thing the world sees that Germany is not in a position to play along in all financial matters,' he added.</p>

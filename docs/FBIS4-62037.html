			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] says  that if the DPRK replaces nuclear fuel rods without the  participation of international inspectors and does not allow the  analysis of the radioactive waste [pangsa pegimul], it will  refer the nuclear issue to a special meeting of the UN Security  Council. Station commentator Valeriy Surikov writes as follows:    The DPRK's announcement of its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty in March 1993 rapidly deteriorated  relations between Pyongyang and the IAEA. Since then, Pyongyang  has not completely permitted the international inspection of the  nuclear sites suspected of nuclear weapons development.    The DPRK is expected to replace fuel rods in one of its  nuclear reactors early in May and had requested the IAEA to  dispatch its experts to watch the process. However, the IAEA  did not accede to the request. The IAEA notes that if it is not  allowed to analyze the radioactive waste, watching the process  of fuel rod replacement will not produce a desired effect.    With the analysis of the radioactive waste, the IAEA can  assess if the North is developing nuclear weapons, they say.  Thus, a new conflict broke out between Pyongyang and the IAEA.    Pyongyang informed the IAEA that it would replace the fuel  rods of the reactor without the participation of the  international inspectors. In the meantime, the IAEA warned  Pyongyang that it is prepared to resolve the nuclear issue by  the convocation of a special meeting of the UN Security Council.    It is not unpredictable where such a conflict will lead. The  United Nations can apply economic sanctions against the DPRK.  The United States and the ROK have long demanded such  sanctions. However, there still is a chance to resolve the issue  through diplomatic efforts. All the countries concerned should  continue their efforts for the adoption of a reasonable  decision. It should not be forgotten that the tactic of talk,  rather than the tactic of pressure, is more desirable.</p>

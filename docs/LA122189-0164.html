			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> COMPROMISE STRUCK ON SENATE ELECTION  </P> <P> State election officials have cleared the way for Assemblyman Gil Ferguson  (R-Newport Beach), to run for a coveted state Senate seat in a special  election. Striking a compromise between warring Republican candidates, Gov.  George Deukmejian set Feb. 6 for the primary election and April 10 for the  general election to replace state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights)  who resigned Friday. Ferguson was assured a spot in the primary when election  officials ruled that he had narrowly met a 30-day residency requirement when he  moved to Laguna Beach last month to be eligible to run. The announcement sets  the stage for a brief and intense seven-week Republican primary battle among  Ferguson, Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), and Brea Councilman Ron Isles in  a sprawling, strongly Republican district that runs from Laguna Beach north  into southern Los Angeles County.  </P></p>

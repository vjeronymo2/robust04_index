			<p>BFN     [Text] London, Apr. 14, IRNA -- The American secretary of  state, Warren Christopher, will resign by the end of this year  and barring upsets, is expected to be replaced by his deputy,  Strobe Talbott, say White House sources quoted by THE  ECONOMIST's Foreign Report here.    U.S. foreign policy under Christopher was said to have been  undynamic and a disappointment to the White House. The  perception was that the previous republican administration would  probably have been tougher and assertive if it remained in  power. Foreign Report said that President Clinton had been  unwillingly drawn into foreign policy issues instead of being  allowed to concentrate on domestic affairs.    Some issues had been delegated to Vice President Al Gore  rather than Christopher and more recently, the secretary of  defense, Bill Perry, seemed to have been making the running on  foreign policy.    Whether Talbott, the former Washington bureau chief of TIME  magazine and long-standing friend of Clinton, makes American  foreign policy, the weekly intelligence publication said,  remained to be seen.    Although the deputy secretary of state knows Washington well  and is a student of relations with Russia, he has held no  personal experience of high office before.</p>

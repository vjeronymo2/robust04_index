He said the reason for his position is that decisions have  recently been taken in the government "in a way in which I took  no part and with which I categorically disagreed." Yegor Gaydar  gave just two examples: the signing of an Interbank agreement  uniting the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, and also the  government's decision to construct a new building for parliament  (the provisional cost of which is nearly $500 million).    "I cannot simultaneously be in the government and also in  the  opposition. I cannot be responsible for the reforms without  being able to avert actions like those that have been mentioned  here and without having the necessary levers to consistently  pursue an economic policy of whose correctness I am convinced,"  Yegor Gaydar said. "Therefore, I deeply regret that I am forced  to decline the post of first deputy prime minister that has been  offered me."</p>

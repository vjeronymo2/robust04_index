			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE FUNDS EXPECTED TO AVERT CUTS, HEALTH CHIEF GATES SAYS  </P> <P> Health Director Robert Gates told the Board of Supervisors on Monday that he is  optimistic Los Angeles County will receive enough money from the $2.5-billion  state surplus to avert long-threatened cuts in health services.  </P> <P> But while providing enough money to salvage needed programs, Gates said, the  surplus may not prove enough of a bonus to ensure pay raises for all employees  -- and layoffs still loom as a possibility.  </P> <P> About 100 people concerned about the threatened cuts -- despite the surplus --  turned out at the Hall of Administration to urge the supervisors to supplement  any state aid with county funds to reduce the long waits for services at  clinics and hospitals.  </P> <P> The long lines, speakers told the board, often discourage patients from seeking  care until they must receive treatment in the emergency room at higher expense.  </P> <P> The supervisors' hearing, required by state law, was scheduled before state  officials last month announced that there would be an unexpected surplus in  California's own revenues that could be used to help local governments and  schools.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials earlier had proposed $55.7 million in health cuts  -- including closing dozens of pediatric facilities, outpatient health centers  and family planning clinics and reducing services at hospitals.  </P> <P> 'I'm quite optimistic that we won't have to make those curtailments," Gates  told the supervisors Monday.  </P> <P> Gates said he expects the county to receive an additional $123 million in state  aid. The additional amount, in excess of the $55.7 million, will be used to  help pay for salary raises for employees and cost increases for supplies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Be Insufficient  </P> <P> The additional aid, however, may not be enough to cover pay raises for all  employees, possibly necessitating layoffs, Gates added.  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn opened the five-hour hearing by urging people in the  audience to "go to Sacramento" to lobby state officials for more money for the  county.  </P> <P> "Thanks for speaking," Hahn said before anyone in the audience went to the  microphone. "But we don't have any money in the county."  </P> <P> Several speakers said they have been lobbying state officials. But they  contended that county officials could find money in the proposed $9.2-billion  county budget to improve the health care system.  </P> <P> They complained that funding for health services has declined since 1980, when  a conservative majority came to power on the board and began redirecting funds  from social services to law enforcement.  </P> <P> According to Gates, funding for health care has been reduced from 16.8% of the  county's total funding in the 1980-81 fiscal year to 8% in 1989-90.  </P> <P> 'Even if there are no cuts . . . it is very important that the county address  the existing problems," said Melinda Bird, an attorney at the Western Center  for Law and Poverty.  </P> <P> Bird told supervisors that critically ill patients spend up to five days "on  gurneys in hallways" waiting for admission to intensive-care units.  </P> <P> She also presented the board with what she said were sworn declarations from  more than 40 county doctors and nurses attesting to "preventable" patient  deaths and "unnecessary" suffering they have witnessed due to overcrowded,  underfunded county health facilities.  </P> <P> Legal Aid attorneys announced last week that they would present the affidavits  to the board.  </P> <P> In an interview, Gates said that sometimes "people aren't where they ought to  be in our system . . . . I think there are compromises (but) we think not to  the point of seriously affecting patient care."  </P> <P> Conservative Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Pete Schabarum were absent Monday.  Schabarum had other commitments, according to an aide who declined to be more  specific. Antonovich was in Switzerland attending an international conference  on refugee relief.  </P> <P> But conservative Supervisor Deane Dana said that health services "still takes a  tremendous part of our budget," accounting for $1.9 billion of the proposed  $9.2-billion spending program.  </P> <P> "We have no other areas to cut back," he said. "What do they want us to do --  close down the libraries?"  </P> <P> Supervisors will continue public hearings through Friday. Budget deliberations  will begin July 19.  </P></p>

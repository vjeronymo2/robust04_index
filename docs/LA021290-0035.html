			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN HITTERS GANG UP ON CS NORTHRIDGE, 18-3  </P> <P> "Hitting," Cal Lutheran baseball Coach Rich Hill said, "is contagious."  </P> <P> If that's true, then CLU has apparently been hit by a plague of epidemic  proportion because Sunday the Kingsmen battered Cal State Northridge, 18-3, in  a nonconference baseball game at CSUN.  </P> <P> That outbreak comes on the heels of a 23-1 season-opening win over Whittier. In  two games, CLU has scored 41 runs and collected 34 hits, not bad for a team  that finished last in the seven-team NAIA District 3 in hitting last season.  </P> <P> CLU (2-0) did most of its damage Sunday in a 12-run fifth inning, sending 16  men to the plate. Eight of them got hits, including Leonard Matsumoto, who hit  the first pitch of the inning for a home run.  </P> <P> Matsumoto finished with two home runs, two walks and four runs scored before  leaving in the eighth inning. Peter Washington, a junior transfer from College  of the Canyons, also had a big day with two doubles and a single in five trips.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen started quickly when Dave Leonhardt, the second batter of the  game, lofted a home run to the opposite field off CSUN starter Monte Jones  (0-1). Three walks and a double later, Jones was lifted in favor of Eric  Spellman, who yielding a run-scoring single before ending the inning with CLU  ahead, 4-0.  </P> <P> After the 12-run fifth, the Kingsmen scored twice more in the sixth, then  cleared their bench.  </P> <P> CSUN (3-4), held to seven hits by four CLU pitchers, scored single runs in the  third, sixth and seventh innings, the middle score coming on a Scott Sharts  home run.  </P> <P> CLU starter Craig Anderson (1-0) got the win.  </P></p>

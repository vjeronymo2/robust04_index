			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Magana from "The Newscast" newscast] </F>   [Text] This Friday, Kirio Waldo Salgado, president of the  Liberty and Democracy Institute, announced his opposition to the  package of constitutional reforms that the Legislative Assembly  is expected to pass within the next few hours. Salgado contends  the amendments are being promoted as a result of pressure from  abroad.    Salgado, a political analyst, announced his support for the  president of the Supreme Court of Justice, who has already  voiced his opposition to the constitutional reforms about to be  passed by the Legislative Assembly. The reforms call for  partial changes to the functions and characteristics of  governmental bodies such as the Supreme Court of Justice.    [Begin Salgado recording] The Legislative Assembly is about  to make the same mistake it made in 1991. Hastily, and because  of international pressure, it plans to reform laws -- our  Constitution -- while disregarding Salvadoran interests. It  will yield to foreign pressure and play the game of the  hegemonic power that governs us. [end recording]    Salgado argues that the deputies are making mistakes by  heeding guidelines from the United Nations, hastily approving  reforms, and ignoring the true needs of the people.    [Begin Salgado recording] I think it is the Salvadorans who  must make our decisions, whether good or bad. The problem in El  Salvador is that we have to live with decisions adopted not by  the Salvadoran people but by a foreign embassy. [end recording]    Salgado has been a bitter critic of the U.S.-promoted  constitutional reforms that will completely change El Salvador's  justice system.</p>

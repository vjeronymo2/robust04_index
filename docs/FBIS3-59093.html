At the beginning of the meeting, Weizman said that he chose  to pay his first official visit abroad to Turkey and he is very  pleased about it. Weizman pointed out that there are many  common points between the two countries -- both governed by a  parliamentary democracy -- and noted that secularism is one  them. He said that there have been occasional ups and downs in  the Middle East peace process, adding that we have now reached a  hopeful phase. Turkey is a great country which could  significantly contribute to this process, Weizman stressed.    In his statement, Cindoruk declared that Weizman's positive  thoughts reconfirm his peaceful character. Cindoruk welcomed  the steps taken for a lasting peace in the region, in response  to the desire for peace. Cindoruk expressed the hope that the  area, which turned into an illegal entity, will in the future  become a region of tranquillity, in which democracy -- the  concept of a state -- and border discipline prevail. He said  that ending terrorism -- which is an extension of the Cold War  -- in this region will constitute a very important step in  securing world and regional peace. Like all democratic  parliaments in the world, the TGNA is waiting for and supports  the implementation of the recent declaration of principles,  Cindoruk remarked. He also expressed his conviction that  archaic methods, which are difficult to explain or comprehend,  will never be utilized in this region again.    Later, the talks between the two delegations continued in  camera.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Salomon loses M&amp;A man to Perella boutique Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique, announced yesterday that Mr Fred Seegal had joined the firm as co-president. He had been joint head of domestic corporate finance at Salomon Brothers. Mr Seegal's appointment - the latest in a series of defections by top Wall Street investment bankers working in the booming mergers and acquisitions business - is Wasserstein Perella's first significant hiring since co-founder Mr Joseph Perella left the firm last July. After the departure of Mr Perella - who has since moved to Morgan Stanley - the firm quickly lost another senior executive when its president, Mr Charles Ward, went to First Boston. Mr Bruce Wasserstein, the current chairman, and founder of the advisory boutique with Mr Perella and two other First Boston executives in 1988, has been running the firm on his own since then. Mr Seegal, who worked at Lehman Brothers before joining Salomon in 1990, is a specialist in advising companies in the media, telecommunications and entertainment industries. However, it is likely he has been hired as much for his management skills as for his experience in the advisory and financing business. He will share the responsibility for managing Wasserstein Perella with Mr Wasserstein. Mr Gary Parr, head of the financial institutions business, is the firm's other co-president. Mr Seegal arrives at a crucial juncture for Wasserstein Perella, which has seen its position in the highly-competitive M&amp;A business slip badly.</p>

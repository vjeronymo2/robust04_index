			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith faces uphill struggle to reform union links ABOUT 50 per cent of the total votes at the Labour party's annual conference are now pitted against the plan by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to modernise his party's links with trade unions. Yesterday three of the largest unions, the GMB general union, Nupe, the public-service union, and the NCU telecommunications union, all voted at their annual conferences against Mr Smith's plans for one-member-one-vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates. Other big unions, holding their congresses in the next few weeks, are expected to take similar stances in what is emerging as a bitter battle between the big unions and the 'modernisers' in the Labour party. Several options for reform have been suggested by the unions and there is likely to be a tense negotiation within the movement for a compromise. Mr John Edmonds, general-secretary of the GMB, said: 'The party faces two very unattractive options. The first is that the issue goes to the conference in the autumn, and the way that the votes seem to be going indicates the party leader's proposals will go down. The second is we have an unseemly public row that rattles on for weeks.' Previously seen as a staunch supporter of Mr Smith, who is sponsored by the GMB, Mr Edmonds has started a bandwagon which is set to roll until the party's annual conference in the autumn. A leading moderate who has been happy to portray the GMB as a 'loyalist' union, this is the first time he has fallen out so strongly with Labour in public. Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, meeting in Scarborough, said his union's proposal was not one-member-one-vote and not the block vote, but something that could be a bridge between the two through a register of Labour party supporters. The GMB's proposal is similar. It recommended yesterday that a reformed electoral college be set up for the next round of elections of parliamentary candidates as a transition towards the use of a register of people who paid the political levy to the party. A vote against one-member-one-vote will mean that there is no procedure for the next round of candidate selections, which is due to start in January - hence Mr Smith's desire to persuade the party conference to back his plans. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, later issued a statement saying that yesterday's vote by the GMB 'exposes the sham of John Smith's Labour party. 'The next few months will show that the Labour party is still a wholly-owned subsidiary of the trade union movement.'</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Falling demand cuts Blue Circle to Pounds 42.7m FIRST HALF pre-tax profits of Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, fell by a quarter, from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 42.7m, as demand for building materials continued to fall faster than companies could cut costs, writes Andrew Taylor. Profits from UK cement, concrete and aggregates during the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 12.3m. The company said that, despite rationalisation, UK cement plants were still working at only 75 per cent capacity. The fall in profits would have been greater but for stronger performances from the US, Chile and Aalborg in Denmark. Profits from domestic products, bathrooms, boilers and radiators, were only slightly lower at Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 23.4m). The group, as it promised in June when it raised Pounds 241m in a rights issue, is maintaining the interim dividend at 3.75p although this is uncovered by earnings of 3.5p (6.2p) in the first half. The rights issue cash, which cost shareholders 200p a share, has been used to buy Celsius, the French manufacturer of domestic heating products. Yesterday Blue Circle's share price was unchanged at 134p. The effect of the Celsius purchase will be to reduce the proportion of the group's domestic products sold in the UK from 80 per cent to 60 per cent, said Mr Jim McColgan, Blue Circle's chief executive. He said that worldwide turnover from cement and domestic products rose from Pounds 530.8 to Pounds 539.7m in the first half. This was despite a 10 per cent fall in UK cement volumes. In the US cement, concrete and aggregate profits rose from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.9m, helped by higher volumes and previous cost-cutting. In Chile, cement profits rose from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 9.4m. Unfortunately, there was no sign of any recovery in UK markets for either cement or domestic products, according to the chief executive. Volume sales of home products had fallen by 6 per cent in the first half. The success of the sector was closely tied to the fortunes of the housing market, said Mr McColgan. About 60 per cent of bathroom sales were prompted by people moving home. Net debt at the end of June stood at Pounds 190m compared with Pounds 306m at the end of December. Lower interest paid on UK cash deposits however meant that overall interest charges rose slightly from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 12.6m. Gearing at the half year, if Pounds 90m of convertible bonds is included as debt, was 27 per cent. COMMENT The current over-capacity in Blue Circle's cement operations is worrying and points to further plant closures and redundancies unless sales pick up - which is unlikely. Cement volumes are expected to decline by about 8 per cent this year. The outlook for domestic products also looks uninspiring given the importance of a healthy housing market to sales. Many continental European markets also are suffering, although not as much as in the UK. Profits of Pounds 105m pre-tax would put the group on a prospective p/e of about 15 times. The shares are at best a hold in the current nervous climate.</p>

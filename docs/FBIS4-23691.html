			<p>BFN     [Text] In Zaire, the new parliament, the High Council of  the Republic - Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] this afternoon  initiated the process for the election of a new prime minister.  Herve de Guelinck reports:    [Guelinck] The HCR-PT has accepted the candidature of seven  candidates for the post of prime minister. Etienne Tshisekedi,  the opposition leader and the prime minister elected in August  1992 by the sovereign national conference, is no longer in the  race: He still sees himself as the elected prime minister and  not as a candidate. Among the seven candidates which have been  accepted are three former prime ministers, including Kengo Wa  Dondo, who has a reputation for being a good manager and who  would be likely to restore the trust of international monetary  institutions. According to our information, the introduction of  the candidates started this afternoon although there is not yet  a quorum of two-thirds of councillors; some 40 are reported to  be missing.    It must be pointed that Etienne Tshisekedi's friends  consider  this election process illegal and are keeping away from the  session. If there is a quorum of two-thirds this afternoon, a  vote will be held. Otherwise, it will be necessary to wait  until tomorrow because the presence of two-thirds will no longer  be necessary tomorrow in accordance with the internal  regulations.    It must be pointed out that neither the chairman of the  HCR-PT, Mgr Monsengwo, nor the deputy chairman representing the  opposition, Social-Christian Joseph Ileo, are present in  Kinshasa. This is why the HCR-PT office is currently dominated  by President Mobutu's allies, which may account for the fact  that, in spite of a lot of criticism, the HCR-PT is intent on  going forward, even if this means forcing through the election  of the prime minister.</p>

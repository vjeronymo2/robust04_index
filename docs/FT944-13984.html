			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Terms of Arnault restructure win regulator approval French market regulators yesterday approved the terms of a revised offer for the restructuring of Mr Bernard Arnault's French luxury goods and retailing empire, writes Andrew Jack in Paris. The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV) said the offer to shareholders from Arnault &amp; Associates would be open from today until November 23, under improved terms made public on Wednesday last week. Arnault initially offered minority shareholders of Financiere Agache one share in LVMH and one share in Dior, the fashion group. It offered Au Bon Marche shareholders five Dior shares and two LVMH shares for each four shares they held. Agache and Au Bon Marche are part of the LVMH empire, which spans luggage, Cognac and champagne. Arnault &amp; Associates, an LVMH subsidiary, is one company through which Mr Arnault controls the group. Its revised offer changed the terms for Agache shareholders, proposing nine Dior and nine LVMH shares for every eight shares they held. The Au Bon Marche offer is unchanged. Separately, LVMH confirmed it had paid FFr120m (Dollars 22m) for a 19.8 per cent stake in Fininfo, a subsidiary of Altus Finance, the loss-making financial group controlled by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank.</p>

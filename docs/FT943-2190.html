			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Markets fall amid fears over deficit - Poll result 'the worst possible' Fears that Sweden's new Social Democratic government would not be strong enough to push through tough spending cuts yesterday alarmed financial markets which marked shares lower and bond yields higher. The main disappointment was the weak electoral showing by the Liberal party which initially seemed to rule it out as a potential coalition partner for the Social Democrats. The market believes Liberal influence would strengthen the government's resolve to push through strong measures to tackle Sweden's yawning budget deficit, which last year ran at 13 per cent of gross national product, and fast-rising debt. 'This is the worst possible scenario,' said Mr Christian Diebitsch, analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London. 'We have a weak left-wing government which isn't strong enough to implement spending cuts on its own and a Liberal party which isn't strong enough to support them.' He said the market was looking for a budget strengthening package of between SKr100bn and SKr150bn (Dollars 13.5bn and Dollars 20.2bn), compared with the SKr61bn package outlined by the Social Democrats before the election. The market's early reaction was clearly negative, as long-term interest rates rose, share prices tumbled and the krona weakened. A rally later in the day brought a strengthening of the Swedish currency, as it became clear that a Social Democratic-Liberal coalition had not been ruled out by prime minister-designate Ingvar Carlsson. But it was not enough to wipe out the bond and share losses. The general stock exchange index closed 0.38 percentage points lower at 1,424.9 while the yield on the benchmark five-year bond closed 14 points higher at 10.86. Analysts said the market would not relax until the government produced a tough financial package with clear strategic objectives. Mr James McKay, economist with Kidder Peabody in London, said: 'The election has failed to clear the political air, with the bond and currency markets likely to remain nervous until the government's deficit-cutting credentials are established.' Worry about Sweden's shaky public finances means the Swedish ten-year bond yield is already four hundred basis points higher than its German equivalent. The increase has weakened the Swedish krona and led to a reduction in growth forecasts for 1995. Mr Carlsson said yesterday his party would not come out with an economic package before it formally assumed power in early October. But he pledged to seek early implementation of a decision to tighten Sweden's budget-making process.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Akzo turns in 4.7% decline to Fl 192.2m LOWER earnings in specialty chemicals and coatings helped push down first-quarter net profit at Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, by 4.7 per cent to Fl 192.2m (Dollars 98.6m), writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Operating profit showed a steeper decline, falling by nearly 21 per cent to Fl 296.6m from Fl 375.2m. However, this decline was largely cushioned by a substantial reduction in financing charges to Fl 67.7m from Fl 113.6m in the 1990 first quarter. The company blamed the fall in operating profit mainly on its activities in Brazil, which had enjoyed a particularly good first quarter in 1990 and which had not been able to match these results in 1991. Akzo, the first big Dutch company to release results for early 1991, said in February that first-quarter results would be lower. But the 4.7 per cent decline compared well with the 30 per cent fall in 1990.</p>

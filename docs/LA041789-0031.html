			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> To everything there is a season and three early members of the 1960s folk-rock  group the Byrds have filed a lawsuit to stop the group's original drummer,  Michael Clarke, from using the band's name in ventures that don't include the  other original band members. Former band members Roger McGuinn, David Crosby  and Chris Hillman filed the lawsuit in Tampa federal court on Friday. The three  performed a series of concerts in Los Angeles this year to try to solidify  their right to the band's name. Clarke applied three months ago for exclusive  rights to use the name and plans to tour as the Byrds, featuring Michael  Clarke, his agent said. Named as defendants are Clarke, Artists International  Management Inc. of Boca Raton and agent Steve Green. The lawsuit accuses Clarke  and his associates of false advertising, unfair competition and deceptive trade  practices. "Their intent is obviously to stop Michael from earning a living,"  Green said. "We think the whole thing stinks a mile high -- make that eight  miles high."ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig  </P></p>

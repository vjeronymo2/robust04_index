			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: EX-UCI STUDENT'S BOOK BECOMING A MOVIE  </P> <P> Marti Leimbach's critically acclaimed first novel, "Dying Young," is being  turned into a movie starring Julia Roberts.  </P> <P> The film, now in production in Mendocino, is scheduled to be released next  summer.  </P> <P> Leimbach, who lives in London, began writing the novel as a student in UC  Irvine's graduate Program in Writing in 1987. It's about a love triangle  involving a young woman, a terminally ill young man and another man whose  vitality attracts her.  </P> <P> The novel, published earlier this year, earned the 26-year-old writer nearly  $500,000, including a $150,000 advance from Doubleday, and the sale of foreign  rights and motion picture rights.  </P> <P> The film, with a screenplay by Richard Friedenberg, is being made by 20th  Century-Fox in association with Fogwood Films (Sally Field's production  company). It also stars Campbell Scott, Colleen Dewhurst and Ellen Burstyn.  </P> <P> UCI professor Donald Heiney, who teaches the fiction-writing workshop, says  other former graduate students have sold the film rights to their novels --  including Michael Chabon ("The Mysteries of Pittsburgh") -- but none have gone  into production.  </P> <P> As far as Heiney knows, "Dying Young" will be the first feature movie to be  made from a graduate's work.  </P> <P> Teacher Honored: Former Orange Coast College writing instructor Pat Kubis has  been honored by the Fictionaires, the Orange County writers workshop group.  </P> <P> Kubis is credited with founding the group 25 years ago when members of her  writing class expressed an interest in continuing their meetings after the  class ended. Kubis suggested they organize their own group and meet regularly  at a member's home.  </P> <P> The group now numbers about 30 members and includes some of the county's  best-known writers, including T. Jefferson Parker, Donald Stanwood, Jackie  Hyman and Terry Black.  </P> <P> Kubis, who lives in Canyon Lake in Riverside County, was presented with a  plaque at the Fictionaires' annual Christmas party last weekend.  </P></p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover: symptom of a questionable trend Sir, BMW's takeover of Rover has again raised the question of foreign acquisitions of UK companies. Since 1988, foreign companies have made a total of 986 acquisitions in the UK valued at about Pounds 50bn. Such acquisitions account for almost half of the total value of all cross-border acquisitions in the European Union in recent years. The list of British companies externally acquired includes Beecham, Midland Bank, Rowntree, Jaguar, STS, Pearl Group, Yorkshire Bank, Metal Box Packaging and RTZ Chemicals. Equally important, a large number of small and medium-sized British companies has been externally acquired. While 'green-field' foreign direct investment in the UK has generally been welcomed for its positive effects on the British economy, the economic impact of inward acquisitions is less clear. A recent study by SIBU examined post-acquisition change in a sample of 73 British companies externally acquired since 1985. The study highlighted a mix of both positive and negative effects of external acquisitions. Positive effects included increased capital and R&amp;D expenditure post-acquisition, the transfer of innovative management practices and increased exports. The most significant negative effects included substantial employment losses as a result of post-acquisition rationalisation and integration, and the transfer of decision-making out of the UK. There were significant variations in the impact of acquisition by nationality of acquirer. Generally, UK acquisitions by non-EU companies have had a more favourable (less negative) effect than acquisitions by EU-based firms. These differences were related to the initial motivations behind the acquisition. For non-EU based companies, UK acquisitions have acted as an important channel for establishing market share in the single market. Such acquisitions driven by product/market expansion have positive effects if the UK operation is given an important role to play in the overall global/regional strategy of the new parent company. This is less likely in the case of UK acquisitions by EU-based companies which are more cost-efficiency driven. Such deals will be accompanied by post-acquisition rationalisation and big job losses. The UK government has adopted a laisser-faire approach to foreign takeovers of British companies. Given the scale of the phenomenon and evidence of negative impact, this liberal approach should now be questioned. J.

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (2): A non-nuclear park - New Industrial Sites The concrete blocks of Trawsfynydd nuclear power station in Gwynedd are in gaunt contrast to the surrounding beauty of Snowdonia national park. Its closure, announced in July last year, has threatened an equally gaunt future for its workforce, and for local young people who have lost a potential place to work. Wales has had to come to terms with the rundown in its traditional industries. In Gwynedd, for example, over 15,000 people used to be employed in slate quarries; today there are only 300. It is ironic that as recent an industry as nuclear electricity should create similar difficulties. The power station was the largest local employer, with 600 staff at its peak, but by 1997 only 50 will remain for site security. Like the heavy industries, Trawsfynydd will leave a legacy for generations - Nuclear Electric is expected shortly to announce its decommissioning strategy. While there will not be the need, as in south Wales, to repair land dereliction, what has to be ensured is that incoming industries do not damage Gwynedd's spectacular environment. Few nowadays would expect a power station to be built in a national park. A strategy for regeneration has been devised by South Gwynedd Partnership, which includes the county and district councils and development agencies. The region qualifies for European structural funds and has assisted area status; the partnership is also bidding for an enterprise zone and funding under the Welsh Office's strategic development scheme. The Development Board for Rural Wales, one of the partners, is creating a landscaped 29-acre Snowdonia business park and, making a virtue out of necessity, says the power station closure provides 'a major opportunity for employers seeking reliable and responsible staff'. There are different challenges in the northern part of Gwynedd, where the dualling of the A55 road has improved the link with the M56 and Manchester airport. The Welsh Office is giving strategic priority to extending the A55 across Anglesey to Holyhead, with its ferry services to Ireland. Taking advantage of the improved route are two new business parks near Bangor established by the Welsh Development Agency. Glyn Rhonwy, with 135 acres at the foot of Snowdon, has attracted the American company Euro/DPC, which makes medical diagnostic kits. Parc Menai, with 75 wooded acres, is described by National Westminster Bank, which has a business centre there, as having 'excellent communications and a superb setting.' On Parc Menai is Snowdonia Business Innovation Centre, which provides advice and support for the commercial development of new products and technology. One current project is to develop a commercial kiln for converting slate into lightweight aggregate. Dr Tom Parry Jones, inventor of the breathalyser, is chairman of the centre, which is a member of the European network of over 100 Bics. Also based at Parc Menai is Mr Hugh Edwin, the county council's media development officer, a post which reflects a thriving film industry in north-west Wales. His office can access the British Film Commission's national database for finding locations. Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Sir Anthony Hopkins are all filming in Gwynedd this year. The making of television programmes for S4C, the Welsh language channel, has stimulated the local industry which includes Barcud, a production facilities company which has purpose-built studios in Caernarfon. In South Wales, Cardiff Bay and its barrage have drawn most attention in the rejuvenation of land for commerce and industry. But the capital is not alone in having ambitious plans. Nearby Newport awaits a decision after a public inquiry into a proposed barrage across the river Usk. While the scheme has met with vigorous opposition because of its possible effect on river life, the intention is similarly to provide a better environment for business in a decayed dockland area. The rundown docklands at Barry, south- west of Cardiff, are also being redeveloped by a partnership of the WDA and Associated British Ports. In March, a parallel partnership - of Vale of Glamorgan borough council, South Glamorgan county council and the WDA - launched Barry Action. This project is to improve the town centre, upgrade communications, smarten the area's appeal for tourism and aid job creation. Swansea, the second city of Wales, already has its own barrage, across the river Tawe, and has developed a maritime quarter around a 600-berth marina. To promote the commercial possibilities, the city hosted presentations including one at London's Ritz Hotel. 'If you do things to lift your profile, you get the City of London saying, 'What's going on there'?' says Mr Michael Burns, economic development officer at Swansea Centre for Trade &amp; Industry. The city will come into further prominence next year as host of the UK year of literature and writing. The derelict Victorian Guildhall is being restored to create a national centre of literature due to open in March. By then, the city will be benefiting from completion of the 'missing link' of the M4 - the new business opportunities are to be marketed next month at Swansea Bay industry week. In the next stage of the city's redevelopment plans, a joint venture of the city and WDA is putting in the infrastructure for Swansea Vale, which will become a suburb of 470 acres next to the motorway. About a quarter of the land will be for industrial and commercial use, and there is space for 1,800 homes and a golf course. Further along the coast, and also gaining from the motorway completion, is Llanelli, where the borough council and WDA have an impressive, well- advanced regeneration programme. The town suffered when Duport steelworks closed in 1981 and 1,200 jobs were lost. The two main aims of the partnership are to regenerate 750 acres of disused industrial land along the coast - two centuries of industrial waste and dozens of derelict sheds and factories have had to be cleared  - and to upgrade the town centre. Over the past four years, the seashore stretch has been transformed, with three lakes and a wildfowl and wetland centre. A 'coastal village' and business parks are being created. In the town, a Pounds 20m shopping complex, developed by Monarch Properties, is due to open in 1996. 'In short,' the partnership confidently states, 'Llanelli means business.'</p>

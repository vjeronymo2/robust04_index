			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / London Zoo out of danger LONDON ZOO is no longer in danger of closure, it announced yesterday. The zoo, run by the Zoological Society of London at Regent's Park, says it was now on the point of breaking even. A campaign to save the zoo was launched last April after it warned that losses of Pounds 2m a year could force it to close. Fifty-nine jobs were lost in a cost-cutting exercise, and animal numbers were reduced through transfers to other zoos. A fund-raising campaign has so far collected Pounds 2m from the public, which will be put towards future projects.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Subtle Moves Toward Separating Human Rights </F> From MFN Status"]    [Text] Since Warren Christopher's China visit, a debate  has started among U.S. officials handling economic and foreign  affairs. U.S. officials have thus had a pragmatic change on the  most-favored-nation [MFN] question. This change is related to  the idea within U.S. financial and political circles which  favors separating the human rights issue from the MFN question.    The United States' foreign policy today pays more and more  attention to developing its economic interests. Today, as Asia  has become the world's fastest growing economic region, the  United States is attaching still more importance to  participating in Asia's economic activities. China is the  largest market in Asia as well as the country with the fastest  growing economy. U.S. businessmen have always been opposed to  lumping the human rights issue with granting MFN to China. If  China's MFN status is canceled, U.S. businessmen will lose the  large market of China. U.S. policy appears to be very  contradictory. The United States hopes to gain China's markets  while wanting to force China to make concessions on the human  rights issue so that the political changes it desires will occur  in China. It hopes that China's economy will continuously  develop so China can import more U.S. merchandise, while fearing  the rise of a powerful China. Under the control of this  contradictory psychology, the United States vacillates in its  policy, does not know whether it is appropriate to advance or  retreat, and has incorrectly judged and handled the situation of  Sino-U.S. relations.    Prior to every June, the United States would, as a rule, use  the MFN question as a big stick to threaten China with.  However, the United States would convince itself that China had  already met its requirements and that it had conformed to the  conditions for granting MFN trading status. There are two  weaknesses in repeating this practice every year. First, the  world sees from this that the United States does not have a  standard for human rights. The fact that the United States  never uses human rights diplomacy against U.S.-sponsored  dictatorships reflects that this practice is merely a means of  power politics. Second, when it is repeated many times, this  means of blackmail becomes ineffective.    Therefore, even Washington officials and Congressmen do not  feel it is advantageous to repeat the MFN question every year.  Some suggest settling the MFN question once and for all,  because if this question remains unsettled for a single day, it  will be impossible for U.S. businesses to make large-scale  investments in China, and this will ultimately harm long-term  U.S. interests gained by opening up China's market.    U.S. Secretary of State Christopher recently wrote an  article in THE WASHINGTON POST in which he defended U.S. policy  readjustments and refuted hawks who demanded he cancel his  scheduled 11-14 March visit to China. Christopher stated: "The  visit is a must for our decision on whether or not to renew  China's MFN status before 3 June." He noted that China has  already made some progress with regard to the human rights  issue. The executive order issued by Clinton last year on  extending China's MFN status was aimed at resolving two major  problems: banning the export of prison labor products to the  United States, and lifting emigration restrictions. He contended  that he had scored achievements on both issues during his recent  visit to China.    Assistant Secretary of State Lord had previously advocated a  tough stance on the human rights issue. However, at a recent  congressional hearing, he appeared optimistic about the issue,  saying that he believed China "absolutely has the ability and  measures to win" MFN status. He emphasized that China had  already done an excellent job in putting an end to exports of  prison labor products and lifting emigration restrictions. He  proposed that China should try to "make significant progress" in  five aspects, saying: So long as China makes continued efforts  in this connection, the United States will be ready to establish  more constructive relations with China at any time. The United  States hopes that MFN will soon cease to be a controversial  issue affecting the U.S. policy toward China.    To gradually disentangle the human rights issue from the  central theme of MFN is no doubt a pragmatic move. As the  United States has time and again emphasized that it has no  intention whatsoever to introduce changes to Chinese society or  impose its own political standards on China, to force China to  knuckle under with high-handed measures would certainly run  counter to this. Along with continued economic growth, China  will be able to build a better material basis upon which human  rights can be improved and will be able to quicken the pace of  improving human rights as well. Nonetheless, China will never  barter away its principles. The history of Sino-U.S. relations  contains both successful experiences and negative lessons. The  United States knows all too well that interference in China's  internal affairs only adversely affects Sino-U.S. relations.    China and the United States are two big countries that have  shared common interests. Just as Christopher pointed out, China  and the United States have a basis for cooperation on issues  like international affairs and regional security. For example,  China and the United States need to strengthen bilateral  cooperation on issues like safeguarding stability and security  in Asia, ensuring that the Korean peninsular remains a  nuclear-free zone, and so on, as well as on international issues  like narcotics control, immigration, smuggling, and  environmental protection. Regarding economic cooperation,  Christopher called for expanding the U.S. share of the Chinese  market. The United States has gradually realized that the  development of Sino-U.S. relations will provide it with more  advantages than disadvantages. It is precisely for this reason  that those forces which treasure Sino-U.S. economic cooperation  have now gained ground. According to a report carried by THE  NEW YORK TIMES, the U.S. president's economic experts group has  already reached a consensus: It is no longer appropriate to  link the human rights issue with MFN status. Eventually, the  U.S. Congress will also consider measures to remove the annual  threat of economic sanctions.    If all this is true, we will certainly embrace this trend.  China bases itself on seeking cooperation and improving  relations with the United States and adopts a positive approach  to the development of Sino-U.S. relations. However, China has  also prepared itself for any bad news and is not afraid of  losing MFN status.</p>

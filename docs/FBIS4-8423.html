			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received a statement from the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs spokesman on the air strikes against ground  targets in the region of the Bosnian city of Gorazde, which has  been declared a safe area.    The spokesman recalls the Foreign Ministry statement  regarding NATO's ultimatum on withdrawing heavy weapons around  Sarajevo, which also expressed the hope that there will be no  need for radical means to halt military actions on the territory  of Bosnia. However, developments in the situation showed that  certain sides in the conflict are taking steps that contradict  the decision of the UN Security Council. This causes serious  concern and reduces the chances of finding a lasting peaceful  solution to the conflict.    The reaction of the international community under the UN  aegis is an expression of its determination to take all possible  measures to implement the relevant decisions on defending the  safe areas and the personnel of the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR], the statement points out. Those actions are a clear  signal to the sides to the conflict to enter active negotiations  to end the conflict.    At the same time, the Foreign Ministry statement expresses  the hope that similar radical measures will not cause a chain  reaction. The sides to the conflict are called upon to refrain  from actions that could delay the achievement of the vitally  important peace agreements.</p>

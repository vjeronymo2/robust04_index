			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Lonrho aims for African mining deal: Opportunities beckon in South Africa - Pounds 41m first-half profits disappoint Lonrho is planning to double the size of its African mining interests in a deal expected to be announced within the next year. Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive of the conglomerate, said Lonrho had received several 'offers from institutions to supply funds without raising borrowing levels - for instance a rights issue'. Mr Bock added that Lonrho, which raised Pounds 170m through a rights issue just 18 months ago, had no immediate plans for a cash call. Analysts were surprised at the statement, as they had not been told of the plans at their meeting. Prospects of an equity issue were greeted with trepidation, given Lonrho's thin dividend cover. The proposed deal may centre on Lonrho's platinum operations in South Africa, where political change is felt to have created new opportunities for the group. These mines have been the focus of speculation about a possible deal with Gencor. Combining the two companies' interests, said one analyst, would create 'the world's biggest force in platinum'. Lonrho would only say it did not intend to cut its 76 per cent stake in platinum. Mr Tiny Rowland, joint chief executive, and Mr Bock, who fought a protracted battle for management control of Lonrho earlier this year, sought to present a united front at yesterday's interim results meeting. Nevertheless, there seemed to be continuing differences, in spite of Mr Bock's boardroom shake-up in January. These became most apparent over the possible flotation of a stake in Lonrho's African trading interests. Mr Rowland said Lonrho was likely to include its sugar business. Analysts said this had been ruled out earlier in the day by Mr Bock. 'This could be the prelude to another battle,' said one. The group reported a 45 per cent drop in profits to Pounds 41m for the six months to March 31, on sales down 37 per cent at Pounds 951m. The previous year was inflated by a Pounds 53m gain on disposals. The results were seen as disappointing, particularly in the light of a Pounds 7m exceptional gain on the sale of a Belgian property. While the core operations had all returned improved profits, there were 'still a lot of bits and pieces causing red ink,' said one analyst. The shares closed 5p down at 134 1/2 p. Lonrho finished the first half with a net cash outflow of Pounds 25m, against an inflow of Pounds 76m last time. Mr Colin Matthews, Lonrho's chief accountant, said the group expected to have a net cash inflow in 1995. Gearing was expected to rise 'slightly' by the end of this year from the half-way 25 per cent, which included an increase in net assets related to the Ashanti Goldfields flotation - Lonrho's stake is valued at Pounds 485m. The dividend was maintained at 2p. Earnings fell from 6.4p to 2.2p, although they rose from a loss of 0.8p in continuing operations. Lex, Page 20</p>

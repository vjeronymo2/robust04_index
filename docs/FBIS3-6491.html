What  do you think of Japan?    [Kim] I lived under Japanese colonial rule when I was child.  There were many things I witnessed for myself. Our nation was  liberated from Japanese colonial rule when I was a third-year  student at junior high school. It is no exaggeration to say  that I am well aware of what happened at the time. I have  thought long and hard about the position of South Korea in the  world during my time in politics and I have come to believe that  although our people cannot forget Japan's past colonial rule,  they must pardon it. Prime Minister Hosokawa has called Japan's  past war an aggressive one and sincerely apologized for it. I  rate the Japanese prime minister highly for taking such action.  Successive past Korean Governments have asked the Japanese  Government to compensate Korean comfort women. I have said we  do not need such compensation. We do not need compensation at  all. It is said that although Japan and South Korea are  geographically close, they are far apart in other respects. I  think the expression should be changed. The two nations are now  close neighbors.    [Kuniya] I think some Koreans still believe Japan should be  asked to compensate for its past colonial rule of Korea.    [Kim] Forty five million people live in our country and,  yes, some of them feel that way. A majority of the Korean  people, though, think my civilian government is different from  previous governments. I head the civilian government and I was  elected president fairly by popular vote. I am the president  they chose. The people, therefore, think my civilian government  is different from previous governments. There some Koreans who  feel Japan should be asked to compensate for its past colonial  rule, but they do not represent a majority of the Korean people.  I am sure of that.    [Kuniya] It has been said that an exchange of culture  between the two countries would serve to erase an lingering ill  feeling between the two countries. South Korea has a policy of  preventing Japanese popular culture from flowing into it.  Looking at the reality, however, Japanese popular culture such  as popular songs and comic books have already infiltrated South  Korean society. Are you considering changing policy and  allowing Japanese popular culture into South Korea in the near  future?    [Kim] If I decide to allow Japanese popular culture into  South Korea in a forced way, it would adversely affect  friendship between South Korea and Japan if things go wrong.  Therefore, I think it best that Japanese popular culture is  allowed into South Korea in a natural way over a period of time.  I believe it is desirable to think of introducing Japanese  popular culture into South Korea step by step. I think it will  be good for the mutual, friendly relations of the two nations to  deal with the matter in a steady manner rather than to be too  hasty about it.    [Kuniya] Do you think this can be realized sometime during  your term of office?    [Kim] Yes, I think so. I think this can be resolved during  my term of office. The governments and people of the two  countries need to make efforts toward that.    [Kuniya] You decided to tear down the old Japanese  Governor-General's Office in Korea which is considered a symbol  of Japanese colonial rule and has for so long been subject of a  debate as to whether or not it should be torn down. Talking  about ramifications of what you said just now and the thinking  that led to your decision on the building, could you dwell on  the background to making that decision?    [Kim] I thought for a long time -- for a long time before I  was elected president -- that it is not desirable to leave the  Japanese Governor-General's Office as it is. That is because  the building represents a symbol of colonial days. Its  existence reminds the people of the past. Every time they pass  by it, they see it and are reminded of the past. It is not  desirable to let the people recall the past forever. I think we  can free ourselves from the past. Removing the building is  indeed a way of freeing ourselves -- a way of securing peace of  mind. I have always thought tearing it down would provide a way  of enabling us to be freed from the past, and thus will be to  the benefit of relations and friendship between the two nations.    [Kuniya] If there is anything that represents a change in  Japan-South Korea relations most symbolically, I think, that  would be a visit to South Korea by the emperor. What do you  think, Mr. President? Do you think the emperor's visit will be  realized during your term of office?    [Kim] I think the emperor's visit to Korea has much meaning.  You asked if it would be realized during my term -- I expect  that his visit to South Korea will be realized during my term of  office. In order to help this take place, it is very important  that the people of the two nations create an atmosphere of  sincerely welcoming the visit. Very important is the  atmosphere wherein the people of Japan would think the emperor's  visit to Korea is desirable, and the people of Korea would  sincerely think it is good to have the visit realized.    [Kuniya] You will soon visit Japan. How do you plan to deal  with the question of the emperor's visit?    [Kim] I would like to convey the wish to invite him. I am  not supposed to say this in advance.    [Kuniya] In the past year, you have done so much to remove  corruption from the business world, military, and government.  Your campaign is even called revolutionary. What do you think  is the reason for the campaign's success. What is its secret?    [Kim] It cannot be called a secret. It was possible because  of my firm conviction. Injustice and corruption were  deep-rooted in South Korea as a result of military rule for some  decades. There was the need to drive out this injustice and  corruption, and to correct the people's wrong sense of values.  In order to do that, I thought it was necessary to change the  perception of the people and public officials. What I kept on  emphasizing was the need for political reform. It was my belief  that elections must be conducted in a clean and fair manner. I  talked about this every time there was a chance to say it. And  now, finally, the political reform bills have been enacted.  This is a great feat that can be called almost a political  revolution.    [Kuniya] You have done so much in a one-year period. On the  other hand, there is criticism saying that with so much power  given to one person as president, it is nothing more than  civilian dictatorship. What is your comment on such a view?    [Kim] That is erroneous thinking. What I have done so far  -- all of it -- is based on law. South Korea's government  system is a presidential system like that of the United States.  The president, elected by the people's will, is entrusted with  performing all the responsibilities. His rights are guaranteed  by the constitution. The president needs to guide the nation  under his responsibility. In Korea, freedom of speech is such to  be called excessive. There are people who talk about civilian  dictatorship, but they are wrong. I have pointed this out to the  mass media every time there is an opportunity. It is only  natural that a president in a nation with a presidential system  must perform his duties under his responsibility.    [Kuniya] So, you think strong leadership is needed in  South Korea of today -- if it is to change, right?    [Kim] Yes, I think so. After all, the destiny of a nation  is determined by its leader. That is clear if we see the  history of other nations. That applies to Korea too.    [Kuniya] As far as South-North Korea issues are concerned,  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] recently conducted  a nuclear inspection of North Korea, though the agency was  unable to conduct complete inspections. What is your view on  the nuclear threat of North Korea?    [Kim] The latest nuclear inspections by the IAEA were  imperfect, and the IAEA could not check two important nuclear  sites. This is a very regrettable thing. The issue of  conducting nuclear inspections in North Korea is very important  from the international standpoint. The nuclear inspections of  North Korea are also very important for South Korea and we  cannot help being jittery. North Korea's suspected nuclear  development must be cleared up.    [Kuniya] You have said that you are willing to hold a summit  meeting with North Korea, if necessary, to put a stop to the  nuclear threat. If a summit meeting becomes a possibility, what  will you say to President Kim Il-song?    [Kim] If the summit meeting is held, the nuclear issue will  be raised for discussion. I intend to discuss with my North  Korean counterpart how North and South Korea should move toward  reunification while building a relationship of trust between  them. As for how the two countries should be reunified, I think  the method used in Germany -- where one country absorbed the  other -- is not desirable. I intend to unify North and South  Korea eventually through a national federation formula while  acknowledging the recent North Korean system. It may be a  longer way of achieving the goal, but I think it would better.    [Kuniya] Mr. President, you like to climb mountains and you  have said that some day you want to climb Mt. Paektu, the  highest mountain in the North. When do you think that will  become possible?    [Kim] It is impossible to predict when the reunification of  South and North Korea will become a reality. It might come in  the near future, but it might take a rather long time. My dream  is to be able to climb Mt. Paektu in the not too distant future  -- while I am still alive.</p>

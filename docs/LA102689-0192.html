			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURF SQUABBLE STIRRED ON EXPANDING LAFCO  </P> <P> A turf battle among government agencies will come to a head next week when a  vote will be held on a proposal to expand the agency, which rules on  annexations and cityhood.  </P> <P> Fast-growing South Orange County is particularly interested in the struggle  because several of its communities are seeking cityhood.  </P> <P> "I think it would become harder for communities to become cities" under the  proposed change, Dana Point Mayor Eileen Krause said. "And I can tell you it's  already hard enough."  </P> <P> At issue is the proposed expansion of the Orange County Local Agency Formation  Commission (LAFCO) from five to seven members. The added two would represent  independent agencies, such as water and sanitation districts.  </P> <P> Most California counties have LAFCOs, agencies that are generally little known  to the public but wield considerable power. They have the authority to approve  or block votes on cityhood and control proposed municipal boundaries. The  agencies also have authority over annexations and formation or dissolution of  special districts.  </P> <P> The existing LAFCO is made up of two county supervisors, representing the  county; two city members, representing urban areas, and one member of the  public at large.  </P> <P> "We think independent agencies ought to be represented on LAFCO because it  would be equitable and logical," said Ray Woodside, general manager of the  Tri-Cities Municipal Water District in South Orange County.  </P> <P> Woodside, however, conceded that the expansion proposal has an uphill fight.  "These things can be pretty political," he said.  </P> <P> Orange County cities are lining up in opposition, saying their power on LAFCO  would be eroded.  </P> <P> LAFCO's staff has recommended the expansion, and 29 of the 38 independent  agencies in the county are strongly pushing for representation. Most of the  agencies in the county forced LAFCO with petitions to schedule a vote on the  question, which is scheduled for Wednesday at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Special districts need representation, Woodside said. The new members would be  "neutral," according to Woodside, and would not be anti-urban, as some county  cities have predicted.  </P> <P> But 13 of the county's 28 cities disagree with Woodside's argument. Thirteen  cities have passed resolutions opposing the expansion. Garden Grove is in  favor, and Irvine took a neutral position.  </P> <P> Such solid municipal opposition leaves Wednesday's vote very much in doubt.  </P> <P> "I think the special districts will have an uphill fight trying to get their  two representatives," said Evelyn R. Hart, a Newport Beach councilwoman who is  chairwoman of LAFCO.  </P> <P> "I see this opposition from the cities, including the League of Cities, and it  certainly tells me a message about how I should vote as one of the two  representatives of the cities on LAFCO," Hart said.  </P> <P> She is not persuaded by the independent districts' claim that they need  representation on the LAFCO board. "The special districts are already  represented because many city councilmen, myself included, also serve on  special districts," Hart said.  </P> <P> The LAFCO staff, in recommending expansion, said in a report that such new  members could bring in "a new and unique perspective that could be valuable to  the commission's deliberations."  </P> <P> But Phillip R. Schwartze, president of the county division of the League of  Cities, said he sees no reason to expand LAFCO. Schwartze is a San Juan  Capistrano City Council member and a former member and chairman of LAFCO.  </P> <P> "It takes no mathematical genius to see that cities wouldn't have as much  representation if LAFCO is expanded from five to seven members," he said. "We  see no reason for special districts needing to be on the board."  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAFCO EXPANSION  </P> <P> Special Districts favoring representation on LAFCO:  </P> <P> Buena Park Library District; Capistrano Bay Community Services District;  Capistrano Bay Park &amp; Recreation District; Capistrano Beach County Water  District; Capistrano Beach Sanitary District; Carpenter Irrigation District;  Coastal Municipal Water District; Costa Mesa Sanitary District; Dana Point  Sanitary District; El Toro Water District; Garden Grove Sanitary District;  Laguna Beach County Water District; Laguna Niguel Community Services District;  Los Alamitos County Water District; Los Alisos Water District; Mesa  Consolidated Water District; Midway City Sanitary District; Moulton Niguel  Water District; Municipal Water District of Orange County; Placentia Library  District; Rossmoor Community Services District; Santa Margarita Water District;  Serrano Irrigation District; Sunset Beach Sanitary District; Surfside Colony  Community Services District; Surfside Colony Storm Water Protection District;  Trabuco Canyon Water District; Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, and Yorba  Linda Water District.  </P> <P> Cities opposing LAFCO expansion:  </P> <P> Anaheim, Brea, Fountain Valley, Dana Point, La Habra, La Palma, Los Alamitos,  Newport Beach, Orange, Placentia, San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach and  Westminster.  </P> <P> Cities supporting LAFCO expansion:  </P> <P> Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Cities neutral on LAFCO expansion:  </P> <P> Irvine.  </P> <P> Source: LAFCO, individual cities  </P> <P> </P></p>

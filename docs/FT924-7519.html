			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japanese developers hit by property slump INTERIM profits of Mitsui Fudosan, Japan's largest property developer, have been hit by the country's property price slump and land holding taxes. The company posted a 38.3 per cent fall in non-consolidated taxable profits for the first six months to September, to Y17.4bn (Dollars 145m). Interim sales edged ahead by 0.1 per cent to Y396.4bn, while net profits fell 39.5 per cent to Y9.1bn. Mitsui blamed the stagnation of Japan's property market. Sales of the company's housing division fell 8.4 per cent to Y205.8bn. Newly introduced landholding taxes worth Y2.4bn also eroded profits. The company said capital spending for the current year would be slashed by about Y100bn from the previous year to Y70bn. Daikyo, the leading Japanese condominium developer, saw a sharp fall in first-half profits due both to the slump in the Japanese property market and an appraisal loss on securities holdings. Pre-tax profits for the first half to September fell 36.5 per cent to Y4.7bn, on a 24.3 per cent fall in sales to Y261.7bn. Net profits fell 14.7 per cent to Y2.8bn. Daikyo blamed the poor performance on a 35 per cent fall in condominium sales to 4,907 units and losses on its securities portfolio appraised at Y2.9bn. However, Daikyo's sale of office buildings worth Y40bn to affiliates and other business partners, as a part of its restructuring scheme, propped up its sales figure. The company's cash on hand and deposits fell 64.2 per cent to Y20.9bn, while short-term borrowings rose 45 per cent to Y675.3bn. Daikyo expects to slash profit margins in the second half to sell 6,000 condominiums to reduce inventories.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (26): Fierce battle among global players - 'Super-carriers' target corporate communications sector With the announcement last year of its US-headquartered Syncordia venture, the UK's BT fired the first shot in what experts say will become an increasingly ferocious battle for the private telecommunications business of the world's leading global corporations. The international private telecommunications sector is valued at nearly Dollars 3bn and is growing annually at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. Ironically, this market came into being in the first place as a result of the failure of public network operators to provide adequate solutions to the specialised communications needs of large corporate users. Now the public carriers are trying to claw back this lucrative business. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Syncordia was originally intended to marry the talents of BT with those of its German and Japanese counterparts, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (DBT) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). The plan was that this 'super-carrier' would divide up the leading US, European and Asian Pacific markets between its members, offering 'outsourced' packages for the management of existing private networks, and the construction and operation of new ones. As well as end-to-end management and round-the-clock, multi-lingual customer help-desks in a number of centres around the world, Syncordia's repertoire was to be extended to include international cashless calling, worldwide private numbering and mobile services for corporate users. 'We have great ambitions for Syncordia,' said BT chairman Iain Vallance at the company's launch. 'We intend to be the leading providers of outsourced networking services and we intend to set the industry standard for those services.' The ambitions remain, but the effort to expand Syncordia's membership did not pan out as its progenitors intended. While discussions about NTT's membership continue, DBT has broken away and, with France Telecom, formed a rival enterprise known as Eunetcom. BT is now in discussion with one of the US long distance carriers with a view to replacing DBT. Some observers believe that additional partners are vital to establish Syncordia's credibility with the biggest of the corporations it is targeting. Bert Roberts, president of the US carrier MCI, argues that any outsourcing venture will fail in the all-important US market if it does not include a US partner. A different view is taken by some of BT's senior management who think that BT can go it alone in Syncordia. No doubt Syncordia's recent success in picking up a reported Dollars 30m contract to manage some of IBM's European data network business, together with the handled by BT's existing, solely-owned international managed network business, dubbed Global Network Services (GNS), lends some weight to this belief. Two new additions to the GNS client list are the Gillette Company and JP Morgan. Regardless of whether Syncordia has one owner or several, achieving success in the outsourcing marketplace will require cast-iron commitment and a very persuasive sales pitch. Potential competition is on the increase. Not only are general purpose carrier alliances forming, including Eunetcom and the Swedish-Dutch enterprise called Unisource, but industry-specific partnerships are looking at wider possibilities. One such is the Financial Network Association (FNA). This was formed by twelve carriers in March to offer a range of private and public services to the international banking and finance sectors. Belgacom, the Belgian carrier which could sign up with Unisource after the middle of the year, is a founding FNA member. Belgacom director and chief engineer Joris Claereboudt believes that the lessons FNA learns in servicing the financial community could later be applied to other types of user. Another contender is the Scitor subsidiary of the airline telecommunications service organisation, Societe Internationale de Telecommunication Aeronautiques, (SITA). Set up in April, it is now offering managed data network services alongside its portfolio of value-added services and electronic messaging products. As the number of players on the field increases, the potential for business failures in the outsourcing sector will grow. This may prevent some would-be corporate customers from farming out their network operations until the sector is better understood . . . and less populated. Undoubtedly, Syncordia and other super-carrier outsourcers will be able to tweak their rates and system features to be highly competitive with those of privately-run networks. They will also have superior resources to resolve the increasingly complex technical and contractual telecommunications choices facing businesses operating internationally. However, many telephone companies still suffer something of a credibility gap with their would-be customers. In a survey of 20 large international corporations and organisations carried out by the UK's Yankee Group consultancy two years ago, some of the respondents already used third parties, such as GE Information Services and Infonet to provide certain network services and resources, but none was prepared at that time to outsource any significant portion of network management to a public telecommunications carrier. One user summed up the view of those who were sympathetic to outsourcing: 'We're interested in sharing management (with a third party), but it would have to be cost-effective, and we'd have to keep enough people to ensure we knew when the suppliers were lying to us . . . and we'd have to be able to take back control at short notice if we felt that was necessary . . 'We don't really expect to see carriers develop this capability for another five years.' As well as overcoming scepticism about their competence, carriers must sell the outsourcing concept initially to corporate communication managers, a body of individuals whose status, if not livelihood, could be adversely affected by the decision to buy outsourced services. Some consultants have queried the basis of the super carriers' stated business case. In addition to recognising that not all the players currently trying to enter the global services market will succeed, a new report from the UK's Analysys consultancy advises caution on the part of putative customers. Susan Ablett, the report's lead author, says that the pace of technological change and re-regulation '. . . means that long-term agreements negotiated now may not be to the advantage of the user within a matter of one or two years.' As the Syncordia experience demonstrates, the construction of super-carrier alliances is not necessarily straightforward. Klaus Grewlich, director general of the DBT's international affairs department, has noted that some carriers are competing with each other to provide end-to-end services for some global customers, and trying to co-operate with each other to bring the optimum spread of services to other customers. With a degree of understatement, Grewlich characterises this delicate balancing act as 'stimulating.' Last, but not least, the super-carrier idea faces an uncertain regulatory future. In 1989 the European Commission's Directorate General IV (which is responsible for preventing unnecessary restriction of competition through monopoly or cartel creation), forced the cancellation of the MDNS managed data alliance planned by 22 European telephone companies. More recently, the same body has required the Infonet data operation, which is jointly owned by some of Europe's leading carriers, to open its accounts for public inspection to ensure that it is not in receipt of cross subsidies which give it an unfair commercial advantage. So far, regulatory intervention in the super-carrier marketplace has been a European phenomenon. The odds are that this will not be the case for much longer.

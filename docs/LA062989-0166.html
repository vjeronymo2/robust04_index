			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 HOLDERS LOSE BID TO POSTPONE TIME MEETING  </P> <P> Time Inc. won a minor skirmish in its battle against the takeover bid of  Paramount Communications Wednesday when a Delaware judge rejected three big  shareholders' motions for postponement of Time's annual meeting scheduled for  Friday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, shares of Paramount surged again on heavy volume amid renewed rumors  that the hostile bidder may find itself the target of a takeover attempt. Time  has made a $70-a-share offer for Warner Communications as a defense against  Paramount's bid.  </P> <P> The shareholders -- Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass, Hollywood producer A.  Jerrold Perenchio, and cable operator Cablevision Systems Inc. -- contended  that Time hadn't properly informed shareholders about the events that have  transpired since proxy materials were mailed May 22. Paramount made a  $175-a-share bid for the company June 7, then increased it to $200 a share last  Friday.  </P> <P> The three shareholders contended that information on the bids -- and Time's  rejection of them -- could affect voting on the four incumbent directors who  are up for reelection at Friday's meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Deserve More Scrutiny'  </P> <P> But Chancellor William T. Allen of Delaware Chancery Court, ruling from the  bench, said a delay was unnecessary because nothing that could happen at the  meeting could irreparably harm shareholders' interest. Even if the incumbents  were voted out, he said, they would continue to serve temporarily until the  next directors' meeting was convened.  </P> <P> Allen said there may be merit to other complaints of the shareholders. The  complaints "deserve more scrutiny than the court is able to give them in this  setting," said Allen, noting that he is preoccupied with preparation for the  July 11 hearing on the dispute between Paramount and Time.  </P> <P> Paramount's shares jumped $3.375 to $62.875, with about 2.7 million shares  trading hands. The volume, much of it in the last hours of trading, made  Paramount the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Time shares  fell $6, closing at $157.25 on volume of about 1.3 million shares.  </P> <P> Traders speculated that the movement might be because of new rumors that oilman  Marvin Davis, broadcast mogul John Kluge or others were accumulating shares of  Paramount in preparation for making a bid of their own. The talk was stimulated  by a television report Thursday night in which financial columnist Dan Dorfman  said outsiders were accumulating Paramount shares. Dorfman last week correctly  predicted that Paramount would increase its offer for Time to $200 a share,  traders said.  </P> <P> Lawrence Garshofsky, a vice president at the Los Angeles arbitrage and  money-management firm of Kayne, Anderson &amp; Co., said the pattern of  movements in Paramount's stock was in some ways consistent with the idea that  an outsider was stockpiling large blocks of shares. He noted that Paramount's  stock has closed higher on days it might have been expected to decline, such as  the two days on which the company announced its offers.  </P> <P> At the same time, he added, the pattern "may be meaningless. . . . There may be  nobody out there."  </P> <P> In Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet said he delayed a decision on  Time's complaint that Paramount's tender offer has misled shareholders into  believing that the company's offer expires July 7.  </P> <P> At the hearing, Time attorney John E. Beerbower argued that shareholders would  feel pressured to tender their shares to Paramount by July 7, although  Paramount officials have indicated elsewhere that the company has no intention  of ending the offer at least until the July 11 court hearing in Delaware.  </P> <P> Barry Ostrager, attorney for Paramount, contended that Paramount has informed  shareholders in other documents that it will probably extend the offer. But he  said use of the July 7 expiration date was not misleading, because under some  circumstances Paramount might want to close the offer then.  </P></p>

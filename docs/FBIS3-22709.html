			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Japan will have a  relatively low 18,000 persons with AIDS and the AIDS-causing  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 2002, a Health and Welfare  Ministry team studying the epidemiology of AIDS said Thursday  [17 March].    The number is low compared to the United States which  already  has 340,000 patients with full-blown AIDS and where one person  in 200 is estimated to either have AIDS or is HIV positive.    The team said their forecast is lower than original  estimates.    It would mean that by early next century only one in every  7,000 people in Japan would have AIDS or be HIV positive.    Mitsuhiro Kamakura, a member of the team who lectures at  Keio  University's school of medicine, attributed the low forecast in  part to what he said was Japan's high average standard of  education, and its low numbers of homosexuals and drug users.    The team's findings will be announced in detail at a meeting  of the Japanese Society for Hygiene in Kanazawa from April 6.    In late 1993, the ministry's AIDS Surveillance Committee  said  Japan had 1,410 known HIV-positive and AIDS patients, excluding  those infected through tainted blood transfusions, but that the  real figure could be nine times as high.    In July last year, the committee also predicted some 26,000  HIV-positive and AIDS patients in Japan by 1998.    The revised estimate was reached after consulting 80 experts  on all aspects of AIDS. The estimate also takes account of the  probability of the development of an AIDS vaccine.    The estimate for 2000 includes about 3,100 AIDS patients and  about 14,700 persons who are HIV positive.    The committee said there is a 52.6 percent chance of a  viable  AIDS vaccine by 2005.</p>

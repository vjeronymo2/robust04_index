			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish Pounds 96m loss MIDLAND &amp; Scottish Res-ources, the offshore oil producer, yesterday revealed an Pounds 80m provision against its Emerald Field development. This resulted in pre-tax losses more than doubled from Pounds 46.4m to Pounds 96m for 1992. However, Mr Jon Hawksley, managing director, said that MSR would be back in the black in 1993, as he did not expect to have to make further provisions. Both its 25p and its 10p shares fell 3p to 14p. The provision was based, the company said, on current expectations of total recoverable reserves from the field. It added that the results of this drilling programme would need to be assessed and taken into account before the audited accounts could be published. As a result they will not be appear until late this month. In 1991, the provision had amounted to Pounds 38.9m. In July 1992 Midland &amp; Scottish Energy, an MSR subsidiary, assumed, with the agreement of the Emerald Field partners, the role of field operator from Sovereign Oil &amp; Gas. In August, the field came into operation. MSR said that after a satisfactory build-up, the performance of individual wells had 'varied considerably from that predicted' by Sovereign. Turnover in 1992 grew to Pounds 28.1m (Pounds 5.97m), but after operating costs including depreciation, amortisation of oil and gas expenditure, and administrative expenses, operating losses almost doubled to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 9.03m). Exchange gains of Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 583,000) were more than offset by finance costs of Pounds 7.65m (Pounds 423,000), though the sale of vessels produced a surplus of Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 1.43m). Losses per share were 47p (22p).</p>

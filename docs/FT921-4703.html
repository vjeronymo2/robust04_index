			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Collecting: Massive at Maastricht - The biggest art fair in the world is growing bigger THOSE WHO already find the marathon circuit of The European Fine Art Fair sufficiently exhausting may be dismayed to learn that this year the world's largest art fair is bigger than ever. Between March 14 and March 22, the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Centre (MECC) in the Netherlands, long since evacuated by Kohl, Major and Mitterrand, is host to 144 dealers from ten countries, many exhibiting for the first time, and a projected 27,000 visitors. The expansion comes of a decision to broaden the base of the fair. Two new specialist sections join ranks with 'Pictura', 'Antiquairs', 'Modern and Contemporary Art' and 'Textura' this year: 'Gravura' (prints and works on paper) and the grandiosely titled 'La Haute Joaillerie du Monde'. Maastricht's success rests on a desire to refine and improve. Ever since the city's two small biennial picture and antique fairs merged in 1985 and relaunched three years later as an annual event at MECC, its formula has been under constant revision. Some experiments were short-lived, such as the Orangerie, the loan exhibitions, and last year's Italian pavilion. The charity gala evening, the concert and lecture programmes remain regular features to entice visitors to linger in medieval Maastricht. Most inspired of all innovations was the introduction of 'Textura' in 1988, a fair within a fair comprising a handful of Europe's most distinguished dealers in carpets and textiles. The limitless and relatively inexpensive space at MECC (which resembles nothing so much as a DIY warehouse on the A40) makes it an ideal venue for exhibiting large-scale works of art. By ensuring uniformly high standards (interestingly, last year's guests were not invited back), the tight knot of exhibiting dealers have established 'Textura' as a centre of excellence and a magnet to specialist collectors. An indication of the calibre of exhibits this year is The Rothschild Medallion Hunting Carpet, woven in Isfahan around 1600, and presented by The Textile Gallery, London. Only one other complete example of this grand and enchanting 234 by 480cm rug is known. Far from being afraid of competition, dealers at Maastricht have found that a concentration of specialist stands has attracted more visitors and business to all. The exhibitors will bring new clients as well as new blood. According to Ben Janssens of Spink's and a member of the Maastricht board, it was felt that jewellery would also lend 'a certain amount of prestige to the fair.' He continues: 'Jewellers always seem to do a lot of business at the Paris Biennale, and are pleased to have the opportunity to show at an art fair'. Their appearance suggests, too, that the organisers have realised at last that stand after stand of middle-ranking Dutch and Flemish tavern scenes of roistering peasants, marine pictures, still-lifes, and snowscenes is of limited charm. The jewellers are not only bringing serious rocks - complete with certificates sprinkled with 'D flawless' - but objects more typical of a Northern Schatzkammer. A tempting idea is 'The Cup of Euphoric Bliss' offered by Gianmaria Buccellati of Milan, a 17th century vessel in the shape of a swan and incorporating an antique piece of moss jasper, silver, gold and emeralds. Swans seem to be popular. Garrard of London has a pair made of modern sterling silver. There is frivolity too - not always an inexpensive commodity. Cartier International of Paris shows a characteristic ruby, diamond and platinum brooch in the form of a coconut tree, and a 'Tutti Frutti' necklace. Harry Winston of Paris and New York offers 'Ruby Slippers' - an exact replica of Judy Garland's sparkling magic footwear in The Wizard of Oz made to mark the 50th anniversary of the film. They are crafted out of some 4,600 rubies. Maastricht's location has always determined its bread and butter business: Dutch and Flemish Old Master paintings. This year the fare is strengthened by the return of London heavyweights Richard Green and Colnaghi. The latter is back, according to the firm's Jeremy Howard, because there is no Palazzo Strozzi fair in Florence this year, and 'everyone seemed to do rather well at Maastricht last year.' Richard Green takes, among other things, a flowerpiece by Jan Brueghel the Elder of roses, tulips and iris in a Wanli porcelain kendi. Colnaghi, Bloemaert's Caravaggesque 'Holy Family'. Dealer Charles Roelofsz's newly discovered Terbrughen of a 'Women with a Candle' was the pictorial treat of last year's show. It seems to have attracted more fashionable Northern Caravaggesques. Spencer A Samuels brings from New York Terbrughen's extraordinary 'Heraclitus and Democritus', and Schlichte Bergen of Amsterdam, Jordaens' 'Bearded Man by Candlelight'. Good traditional landscapes come in the form of Verner Amell's Ruisdael and Noortman's Hobbema. What is interesting, however, is how much more variety there seems to be among the pictures this year. Arnoldi-Livie of Munich brings Rottenhammer and Menzel; Colnaghi, Bugiardini and Angelica Kauffmann (a portrait of a daughter of a Scottish Governor of New York). We find Oudry, Chardin and Boilly, Courbets and Corots. Martyn Gregory brings China trade pictures. Even Johnny van Haeften's Frans Post, his most expensive picture at Pounds 650,000, is a view of the Cathedral of Olinda in Brazil. The range of the works of art on offer is impressive, increased this year by the breadth of interests of the new exhibitors. At Maastricht one can discover anything from an Attic amphora to Art Deco: Oriental porcelain, pewter and grand French furniture, icons and Indian jewellery, maiolica, Limoges and silver, even leather panels, architectural columns and picture frames. Newcomer Luis Elvira of Castellon offers a terrifyingly beautiful pair of 16th century Spanish-German tournament spurs; Kugel of Paris present a set of five silvered and gilt bronze Dresden dwarves. An original and particularly intriguing new field is opened up in the modern and contemporary section. Hong Kong and London-based American dealer Ed Miller brings contemporary Chinese art to our attention, under the umbrella of Lo Shan Tang. Miller explains that almost no one outside Asia has ever seen the best of modern Chinese painting, and plans to redress the balance. 'I've taken a huge stand at Maastricht,' he says, 'and am bringing great stuff.' There is nothing flamboyant about Maastricht (except perhaps the eccentric parrot tulips that adorn the hall in splendid profusion). The displays are simple and swagless, and the objects are left to speak for themselves. Dealers seem to be 'cautiously optimistic', depending on the relative strength of the economy in Continental Europe and of the sound good sense of Continental collectors who have always prefered to use their income rather than their capital - and certainly not credit - to buy works of art. A weak dollar seems to have encouraged many US dealers to try their luck in Europe. The fair is open 11am-8pm weekdays, 11am-6pm weekends. Sabena World Airlines again offers a 50 per cent discount on all first and business class flights to Brussels for visitors from anywhere in the world, except German-speaking countries, and a regular mini-bus service between Brussels Airport Sheraton and MECC. To take advantage of this offer, entrance tickets must be booked in advance from The European Fine Art Foundation, (tel: 31-73-14-51-65) and presented to a Sabena agent.</p>

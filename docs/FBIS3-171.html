In a communique,  the opposition claims that supporters of the presidential group  continue to fire gunshots in the M'filou District in the  southern part of the city, and continue to "kidnap and murder  people suspected to be close to the opposition."    The opposition further asserts that in February more than 20  of its supporters were "kidnapped or killed" by members of the  ministerial reserve, a unit that is directly under the head of  state. This reserve is "responsible for the insecurity in the  northern district of the city" and on the Tsieme road leading to  the northern part of the country, the communique adds. The  opposition also adds that it has respected the cease-fire  agreement by helping to restore traffic and the "gradual return"  of displaced persons in the Bacongo and Makele-Kele districts  which it controls.    On the other hand, the CONGOLESE NEWS AGENCY claimed  yesterday that some 20 young men were enrolled in the opposition  militia controlled by the former head of state, General Denis  Sassou Nguesso, at Gamboma, in the center of the country, while  five cases of ammunition were stolen from the Gamboma  Non-Commissioned Officers School and sent by two soldiers to the  northern part of the city, an area under the control of the  opposition militia.    An official of the opposition has denied these reports.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Lamont leaves room for wider tax measures: Budget wins mixed reception in parliament and markets MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, warned yesterday that the government would take additional fiscal measures if it thought these were necessary to reduce the UK's public sector deficit. He said his Budget announcement of plans to increase taxation by a net Pounds 6.7bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96 was 'a bold step' towards removing the threat posed by excessive borrowing to economic recovery. But at a post-Budget press briefing, he declined to rule out a further extension of value added tax in addition to his decision to levy VAT on domestic fuel and power from April next year. The chancellor said he regarded the Pounds 243.8bn 'control total' set in November for government spending in 1993-94 as a ceiling, not to be breached in negotiations between the Treasury and government departments ahead of the unified Budget in November. He said the next spending round would be influenced by the long-term review of all aspects of government spending being carried out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary. Treasury officials confirmed that if this yielded savings, the chancellor would use them to cut the deficit further. Mr Lamont said he wanted the UK budget to move towards balance around the top of the economic cycle. But he also said the Maastricht criterion limiting the budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product was a 'good objective'. The Budget predicts that the PSBR will increase to Pounds 50.1bn in 1993-94, or 8 per cent of GDP, from Pounds 35.1bn in the current financial year, about 5.75 per cent of GDP. It forecasts only a gradual decline to Pounds 30bn, or 3.75 per cent of GDP, by 1997-98. Mr Lamont said he expected that most of the cyclical influences that had contributed to the UK's large deficits would have worked through the economy by the end of 1997. But he denied that this meant a large part of the deficit was structural. He said the 'vast majority' of the present PSBR was cyclical, reflecting the effects of the recession such as high unemployment and reduced tax revenues on the government's finances. He underlined that the PSBR projections were subject to uncertainty and said they could prove pessimistic if tax revenues were more buoyant than expected. The chancellor said he had not wanted to lessen the prospects for economic recovery this year in the Budget. However, he believed the main threat to sustained recovery was excessive borrowing.</p>

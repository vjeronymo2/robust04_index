			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Europa Minerals reduces loss after recent upheaval EUROPA MINERALS, the UK mining finance house dogged by poor performances at its mines and by boardroom upheavals since its 1989 listing, came close to break-even in the six months to July 31 - during which it was refinanced and restructured under new management. The group, which owns gold and coal mines in Australia and has North Sea and Indonesian oil and gas interests, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 289,000, reduced sharply from a Pounds 2.45m loss at the interim stage in 1991. Austmin, a small Australian mining company and Europa's largest shareholder, took over management of the company earlier this year. The Australian operations are now run by executive directors Mr Guido Staltari and Mr Bob Duffin. Sir David Hardy, executive chairman, said Europa had emerged from 'a frustrating period in which it had lost its way' as a slimmer and fitter company. Turnover rose from Pounds 8.31m to Pounds 8.91m. Costs of sales rose only 6 per cent which, with lower distribution and administration costs, enabled the company to return an operating profit of Pounds 14,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.55m in 1991. Losses per share were 4.3p, against 26.8p.</p>

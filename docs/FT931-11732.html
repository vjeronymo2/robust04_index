			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Perstorp advances 21% PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, benefited from its acquisition programme and the devaluation of the krona to record a 21 per cent rise in profits in the four months to December 31. Earnings after financial items increased to SKr81m (Dollars 11.5m) from SKr67m, as sales rose 10 per cent to SKr2.61bn. The group said recession had affected its markets, although it had benefited from an upswing in the US. It expects that its profits for the year to August will at least equal last year's SKr228m.</p>

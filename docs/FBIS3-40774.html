			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Brussels, Dec. 20 (UNI)--A major milestone was  achieved in the relations between India and the European Union  [EU] when the two sides granted each other the Most Favoured  Nation (MFN) status on Monday and pledged to reinforce and  diversify cooperation in agriculture, transport and  communication, health, banking and promoting scientific and  technological development. The EU countries are Belgium, Denmark  and Greece.    An agreement was signed by Commerce Minister Pranab  Mukherjee, Commissioner for developing countries of the EU, Mr  Manual Marin, and Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes.    The agreement will also facilitate India to have better  access to the European Union technology and promote commercial  exchanges.    The 30-article agreement provides for setting up of a joint  commission to establish priorities in relation to the objectives  and examine ways and means of enhancing the partnership in  almost all spheres of economic, technical and industrial  cooperation.    In a joint statement following the signing of the agreement,  the two sides expressed their resolve to reinforce and intensify  their mutual relations in the political, economic, technological  and cultural fields.    The EU is India's largest trading partner with a share of 25  percent of Indian exports and 33 percent of its imports.    The two sides attach importance to the principles of respect  for human rights and democratic rights. Article I of the  agreement states "respect for human rights and democratic  principles is the basis for the cooperation between the  contracting parties." Under the agreement, the two sides  committed themselves to improve the access for their products in  each other's market.    The acceleration of the pace of India's economic development  by supporting its efforts in building up its economy would get  priority.    Another area was the development of existing and new forms  of  economic cooperation to facilitate exchanges and contacts  between the business communities of the two sides to encourage  investment.    Support of environmental protection and sustainable  management of natural resources would be a focal area.    The agreement has two main parts--economic and development  cooperation.    Under the agreement economic cooperation is structured to  encourage the private sector with the expectation of resulting  multiplier effects.    It will involve three broad fields:    --Improving the economic environment by facilitating access  to European knowhow and technology.    --Facilitating contacts between economic operators and other  measures designed to promote commercial exchanges and investment.    --Reinforcing mutual understanding of their respective  economic, social and cultural environment as a basis for  effective cooperation.    The agreement covers cooperation in several specific  fields--energy, telecommunications, electronics, and information  technology, agriculture and fisheries and tourism.    The agreement recognises India's need for development  assistance. To contribute to India's own efforts in achieving  sustainable economic development concrete projects and  programmes under development cooperation will be targeted  towards the poorer sections of the population.    Particular attention will be given to rural development,  promotion of employment in rural towns, role of women in  development with an emphasis on education and family welfare and  primary health care.    The joint statement which was issued after the agreement  underlined the commitment of contracting parties to safeguard  peace and establish a just and stable international order in  accordance with the United Nations charter.    It suggested political dialogue at ministerial level between  India and the EU trioka. The ministerial meeting is expected to  be held in near future at Brussels.    The ministerial meeting will exchange information on foreign  policy decisions.    It would also contribute to consolidating and developing the  political dialogue between the parties.    "European capital and technology could combine well with  India's natural and human resources to cater to the growing  markets in India and elsewhere in Asia," Mr Mukherjee  said.</p>

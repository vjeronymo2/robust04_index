			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (2): East offers best outlook for growth - While global sales are at last improving, the Asia Pacific region holds the most promise Global car sales could rise by 6 per cent or more this year as Europe pulls out of recession to join the expanding markets of North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Car sales worldwide fell to 33.1m in 1993, the lowest level for six years, but according to DRI McGraw-Hill, the automotive analysts, demand has now moved into a period of recovery. After three successive years of decline, global car sales are forecast to rise to 35.3m in 1994. The main impulses for growth hitherto have come from the US, where sales of cars and light trucks are now in the third year of recovery and are forecast to rise by 12 per cent this year to more than 15.5m. New car sales in western Europe fell by more than 15 per cent last year to 11.45m, the sharpest annual decline in the post-war period, but the tide appears to have turned with sales rising by an estimated 6 per cent to 8.517m in the first eight months of the year. In Japan carmakers have been locked in a protracted recession with new car sales falling for three years in succession from 1991 to 1993. Registrations after the first seven months of 1994 were still 1.9 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago, but in recent months there have been fragile signs that the bottom of the recession has also finally been reached in Japan. Noel Goutard, chairman and chief executive of Valeo, the leading French automotive components group, believes that prospects are positive for the world auto industry. 'In 1994 we are in a new phase, and we anticipate strong growth,' says Mr Goutard. 'We believe that by 1995-96 the American, European and Japanese markets will be in a unique situation with all three converging on a path of strong growth. Asia Pacific will join as a fourth important region. There will be four markets in high gear.' The latest study by DRI McGraw-Hill forecasts that a sustained period of growth is in prospect with worldwide new car sales rising gradually to reach record levels throughout the second half of the 1990s. Sales are forecast to rise by 3 to 5 per cent in each of the next five years, rising from 35.3m this year to 42.6m in 1999. However, much of this growth will originate outside the traditional car consuming nations of west Europe, North America and Japan, with South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and east Europe offering the best outlook for growth for the 1990s and beyond. The world's leading carmakers are united in the view that the Asia Pacific region holds the brightest prospects, and automotive sales in Asia (excluding Japan) are expected to triple during the next 15 years. According to Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, about 80 per cent of the world's population lives outside the traditional automotive markets of western Europe, North America and Japan, however the number of cars and trucks sold in these regions represents only about 8 per cent of the world's total. Some of the fastest growth is forecast for China, where the world's leading carmakers, such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz are vying to win approval for new vehicle projects in order to catch up on the lead taken by Volkswagen of Germany, the Peugeot group of France and Daihatsu of Japan. New car sales in China have already jumped from only 78,000 in 1990 to about 430,000 last year, but the latest DRI study forecasts that sales could jump to 1m by 1999. This will be mirrored in a rapid build-up of car production in China with output rising from 44,000 in 1990 to more than 700,000 by the end of the decade, according to the DRI study. South Korean carmakers led by Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo have also developed an ambitious strategy for further growth in the coming decade. DRI forecasts that car production in South Korea could jump by more than 1m units in the next six years from 1.5m in 1993 to 2.64m in 1999. New car sales in the domestic car market are expected to jump from 963,000 last year to 1.45m in 1999, but domestic expansion will be supplemented by Korean carmakers pursuing aggressive growth plans overseas both through strongly rising exports and foreign-based vehicle production. In the world's developed markets the DRI report forecasts continued steady recovery in west Europe for the rest of the decade, cautious expansion in Japan but a slow-down in North America during the mid-1990s. The pick-up in west Europe has been patchy this year with sales rising strongly in France, Spain, Scandinavia and the UK, whereas Germany and Italy are still struggling to throw off the grip of recession. New car registrations in Germany, the biggest market in Europe, were still running slightly lower than a year ago after the first eight months of the year with a decline of 0.4 per cent. Worryingly, sales declined year-on-year by 4.9 per cent in July and by 5.2 per cent in August. Both the German and Italian markets are forecast to emerge from recession next year, however, and sales in west Europe are forecast to rise by 5 to 7 per cent a year in each of the four years from 1994 to reach a record level of 13.7m in 1996 rising further to 15m by 1999. In the US, with car and truck sales already in their third year of recovery, opinions differ over when the market will peak. Ford is currently forecasting total US car and truck sales of around 15.5m in 1994 compared with 14.2m last year and the nadir of 12.5m in 1991. The previous peak of 16.3m was reached in 1986 and David McCammon, Ford vice-president and treasurer, insists that 'the cycle still has several years to go. We are early in the cycle in the US - still in the first half of the cycle, in my view, and in Europe we're just at the beginning of the recovery'. Such optimism has not been shared by US financial markets in recent weeks, where the share prices of the big three US carmakers have fallen sharply to their lowest level for the year amid fears about rising interest rates. The latest DRI forecast suggests that North American car sales will suffer small declines in 1995 and 1996 after rising by 8.5 per cent this year. Cars are expected to continue losing market share to light trucks - pickups, sports/utility and multipurpose vehicles - which now account for more than 40 per cent of all US light vehicle sales.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD CAR SALES FORECAST (000S)*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1993      1994      1995      1996      1997  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD                   33,134    35,253    36,377    38,042    39,903 West Europe             11,450    12,181    12,743    13,692    14,362 Germany                  3,194     3,215     3,306     3,425     3,638 Italy                    1,890     1,858     1,948     2,075     2,191 UK                       1,778     1,978     2,074     2,236     2,303 France                   1,721     1,989     2,051     2,184     2,302 Spain                      743       849       867     1,056     1,054 East Europe***           1,334     1,366     1,472     1,550     1,675 Turkey                     443       252       287       331       420 North America            9,441    10,245     9,950     9,779    10,150 US                       8,702     9,424     9,044     8,822     9,147 Japan                    4,199     4,203     4,398     4,628     4,780 Asia Pacific****         2,848     3,155     3,509     3,831     4,027 South Korea                963     1,072     1,167     1,256     1,315 China                      430       481       618       758       791 Latin America            1,867     2,051     2,058     2,216     2,404 WORLD (net)**           33,887    35,059    36,554    38,550    40,203 West Europe             11,372    12,102    12,847    13,823    14,206 Germany                  3,794     3,946     4,085     4,310     4,391 France                   2,836     2,996     3,138     3,332     3,384 Spain                    1,505     1,661     1,776     1,801     1,808 UK                       1,375     1,433     1,565     1,840     1,918 Italy                    1,117     1,213     1,314     1,457     1,558 East Europe***           1,800     1,780     1,920     2,100     2,294 Turkey                     348       234       258       297       378 North America            7,329     7,961     7,968     7,758     8,042 US                       5,982     6,745     6,750     6,463     6,660 Japan                    8,499     7,942     8,266     8,723     9,018 Asia Pacific****         2,807     3,154     3,542     3,914     4,342 South Korea              1,512     1,791     1,962     2,150     2,389 China                      241       216       335       451       563 Latin America            2,214     2,423     2,339     2,603     2,651  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * 1993 actual, 1994-1997 forecasts   ** Excluding traceable double counting  *** Including Commonwealth of Independent States **** Excludes Japan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: DRI World Car Industry Forecast Report - August 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

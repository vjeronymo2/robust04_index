			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOUSE OKS $1.165-TRILLION BUDGET  </P> <P> The House gave final approval today to a $1.165-trillion fiscal 1990 spending  plan that cuts Pentagon spending, increases many domestic programs and  implements a budget agreement with President Bush.  </P> <P> Lawmakers approved the final version of the budget, crafted last week by House  and Senate negotiators who resolved most differences between similar budget  plans passed by each chamber.  </P> <P> Today's vote was 241 to 185.  </P> <P> The package goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it quickly. The plan  does not require Bush's signature because it is a resolution setting  non-binding spending and revenue outlines for congressional appropriators and  tax writers.  </P> <P> The plan cuts the deficit by $28 billion to $99.7 billion for fiscal 1990, just  below the $100-billion deficit limit required by the Gramm-Rudman  balanced-budget law.  </P> <P> Critics say the blueprint uses too many accounting gimmicks and artificial  savings to achieve the cut in the deficit, making the challenge of meeting  fiscal 1991 deficit reduction goals more difficult.  </P> <P> Lawmakers who drafted the pact with the White House said, however, that it is  the best deal they could get, given Bush's "no new taxes" stand and the  reluctance of congressional Democrats to slash domestic programs.  </P> <P> Bush announced the bipartisan budget agreement with Congress on April 14.  </P> <P> "Given the narrow constraints under which the budget was developed, I believe  it represents without question the best possible budget for fiscal year 1990,"  said Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget Committee.  </P> <P> Panetta said that he will push for a bolder deficit-reduction package in fiscal  1991 and that taxes must be on the table. He said the cooperative spirit that  produced the 1990 plan "sets the framework" for future talks.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique No. 645 issued by the Committee for the Peaceful </F> Reunification of the Fatherland Secretariat in Pyongyang on 6  March]    [Text] The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland [CPRF] Secretariat issued a communique denouncing the  Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique for suppressing with arms  [chongkallo tanap] the just struggle by the South Korean people,  youth, and students, berating it as an illegal and violent deed.    CPRF Secretariat Communique No. 645 reads:    Lately, fascist oppressive maneuvers by the puppet clique  with the mask of a civilian government are being conducted more  openly in South Korea.    According to reports, on 1 March, when some 2,000 Seoul  citizens and college students marched on the street, shouting  slogans "Yankee go home", "Cancel the plan to deploy patriot  missiles in South Korea" after holding a meeting marking the  75th anniversary of the 1 March popular uprising, the Kim  Yong-sam traitorous clique repressed the protesters with arms  and forcibly dispersed them by mobilizing the riot police, thus  committing fascist violence.    Prior to this, on 23 February, when some 400 students of  universities in Kwangju, including Chonnam and Choson  Universities, launched a demonstration, shouting slogans against  the rice market opening, the fascist clique savagely repressed  them by letting the armed police move out and release tear gas.    On 25 February, the puppet police showered tear gas  indiscriminately at college students in Kwangju, who were  staging a demonstration opposing the National Assembly  ratification of the nation-selling opening of the agricultural  market. The rascals released so much tear gas that patients at  the nearby Chonnam University Hospital had to seek help to take  shelter.    After the indiscriminate oppression at the demonstration  site, the puppets tyrannized by letting the riot police move to  Chonnam and Choson Universities, where they conducted a surprise  search and confiscation and incarcerated many students.    In mid-February, the puppets arrested students participating  in an anti-U.S. demonstration in the front of the American  Center in Kwangju and hauled in 23 students engaged in anti-U.S.  agitation activities in front of the Kwangju Post Office.    Moreover, the puppets did not hesitate in committing an  atrocity by arresting four students, including Yi Chang-yol of  Kyongbuk University in Taegu, for posting a notice supporting  the North's insistence on a billboard, by invoking the National  Security Law.    The South Korean students, the target of the puppets'  oppression, are patriotic students who oppose outside forces,  acts of selling the nation, and the confrontation between fellow  countrymen while insisting on independence and desiring the  reunification through alliance with communism and the North.  Their struggle and desire cannot be a crime.    Nevertheless, these fascist oppressive maneuvers following  the oppressive order to control with arms the South Korean  people's just struggle, which puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam issued  while berating it as an illegal and violent deed on many recent  occasions, clearly prove that the South Korea puppets are now  openly adhering to the fascist rule with arms after casting off  its perfunctory civilian mask.    The oppression with arms cannot save the Kim Yong-sam ring  from the power crisis [chonggwon wigi].    The South Korean people cannot achieve independence or  democracy, nor can they even maintain their lives, leaving  traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is as crafty as a fox, at the post of  power.    The South Korean people in various classes and strata should  struggle more stalwartly [kwagamhi] to overthrow [tado] the Kim  Yong-sam ring, which sells the interest of the country and the  people while depending upon outside forces and makes fascist  oppression and treachery to the country and the nation  commonplace.    [Issued] 6 March 1994, Pyongyang</p>

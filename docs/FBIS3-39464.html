As the  Federal Government reported on Wednesday [16 February] in  response to an inquiry by the Party of Democratic Socialism, the  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations registered 335 such  crimes last December. In October, 267 were registered,  following 296 in September. The figure for November has not yet  been published in the Bundestag, the response said.    The 335 crimes in December consisted of 16 arson attacks, 39  attacks against persons, and 280 "other crimes," such as  material damage or insults. A total of 176 suspects were  reported.    According to the Federal Government, during the third  quarter  of last year 7,076 investigations were initiated for right-wing  extremist or xenophobic crimes, 25 of them for murder or  manslaughter, 305 for bodily injury, 67 for arson, 172 for  offenses against the laws relating to civil disorders and  rioting, and 217 for anti-Semitic activities. A total of 2,250  investigations dealt with the dissemination of propaganda by  organizations which are hostile to the constitution; 1,915 dealt  with active demagogy, dissemination of publications dealing with  violence, or instigation to racial hated; and 2,124 dealt with  "other" crimes. According to the Federal Government, 3,900  investigations were discontinued -- mostly because it was  impossible to find a perpetrator.</p>

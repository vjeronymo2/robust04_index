			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The Who's reunion tour is set for this summer, including benefit performances  of the English rock band's celebrated rock opera "Tommy" at the Universal  Amphitheatre and at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Anne Weldon, the band's  New York-based manager, would only say Wednesday that the tour is under  discussion and details are unconfirmed, but sources close to the project say  that the tour -- concentrating on a retrospective of the band's career -- is  definite and that it will feature stadium appearances in approximately two  dozen U.S. cities. It is expected to reach Los Angeles -- probably the Los  Angeles Memorial Coliseum -- in late August. The "Tommy" shows at the  amphitheater and Radio City Music Hall will be benefits and will feature a  series of guest artists, including Tina Turner in the role of the Acid Queen.

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS TO MERGE TV COMEDY NETWORKS RESUME ;  </P> <P> BROADCASTING: THE PROBLEMS IN ATTRACTING SUBSCRIBERS HAVE LED TIME WARNER AND  VIACOM BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  </P> <P> The talks between Viacom Inc. and Time Warner Inc. regarding a merger of their  new cable television comedy networks appear to be on once again, but officials  close to the negotiations said there are still several obstacles to an  agreement.  </P> <P> Both Viacom and Time Warner are being forced back to the bargaining table  because their respective comedy channels have had a difficult time attracting  subscribers to the fledgling program services. Cable operators generally agree  that there is a market for an all-comedy cable channel, just as there are  all-sports and all-news channels, although second channels offering a similar  format behind an already established channel have mostly failed.  </P> <P> So far, neither Viacom's Ha! nor its direct competitor, the Comedy Channel,  have emerged a leader, and analysts see a long, resource-draining fight between  the two channels as they try to establish themselves.  </P> <P> Viacom launched Ha! on April 1 with only 4 million subscribers, although the  company says it expects to add another 1 million subscribers by next month and  have 6 million by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Time Warner, through its HBO subsidiary, launched the Comedy Channel in  November with a larger base of 4.2 million subscribers, although it has not  grown appreciably beyond the 6 million subscribers it had at the end of 1989.  HBO, however, says it has "commitments" from cable operators that would  increase the Comedy Channel's subscriber base to 15 million over the next  couple of years, depending on how fast cable systems are able to increase  channel capacity.  </P> <P> "We have no delusions about the reality of the marketplace," said Ha! president  Ed Bennett. "But we are fully prepared to stick with it."  </P> <P> Bennett says room for new cable channels will open as cable systems increase  their channel capacity to 54 channels over the next five years and systems  begin dropping "imported" distant signals because of copyright problems and  ailing home-shopping channels.  </P> <P> The battle between the two services has turned nasty. Personal insults have  been exchanged on top of litigation. Viacom last year filed a $2.5-billion  antitrust suit against HBO, charging it with monopolizing the cable television  business.  </P> <P> Last week, Time Warner threatened to sue a group of cable system operators who  were in discussions about making an equity investment in Ha! in exchange for  adding the program service to their systems. Time Warner lawyers contended that  those equity deals would have shut out the Comedy Channel on systems totaling  between 18 million to 20 million subscribers, even though the pact did not call  for exclusive carriage of Ha! The cable operators were sufficiently scared that  the equity discussions have now collapsed.  </P> <P> Sources say talks between Viacom and Time Warner over merging their comedy  cable networks have been stymied on several important matters, including who  would manage the combined company, what their respective interests would be and  whether to allow cable operators to invest in the company. Cable operators,  which provide the pipeline into the viewer's home, typically invest in the  programming services they carry.  </P> <P> The limited number of channels available on cable systems around the country is  a major reason that Viacom and Time Warner are finding it difficult to launch a  new cable network.  </P> <P> Cable systems on average carry 35 channels, but there are 104 different cable  networks competing for those limited openings. In addition, most cable  franchise agreements call for the cable system to set aside about one-third of  those channels for local broadcast stations, further reducing the available  slots for new cable networks.  </P> <P> "Clearly cable operators have limited shelf space," said Richard J. MacDonald,  a partner in the New York media investment firm of MacDonald Grippo Reilly Inc.  "The best thing for them would be to combine their efforts."  </P> <P> The Comedy Channel and Ha! are taking a different approach to programming their  respective channels, although both feature stand-up comics. The Comedy Channel  is relying heavily on the use of short comedy features, or "clips," similar in  format to music videos. Ha! is scheduling more traditional programming, such as  old reruns of "The Lucy Show" and "Saturday Night Live." The costs are steep:  HBO will spend about $40 million during its first year -- some believe the cost  will actually balloon to more than $50 million -- and Viacom officials have  said Ha! will spend between $85 million to $125 million over the next four  years.  </P></p>

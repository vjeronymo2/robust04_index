			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIANS SHUT ISRAEL SITES TO PROTEST SETTLERS  </P> <P> The Church of the Holy Sepulcher and other sacred sites in Israel were shut  Friday as Christians protested a Jewish settlement in the Christian Quarter of  Jerusalem's Old City.  </P> <P> In an unusual show of unity, about 150 clergymen from nine major Christian  sects gathered to oversee the closing of the church, the traditional site of  Jesus' Crucifixion and burial. It is near the Hospice of St. John, a complex  that 150 Jewish settlers are occupying in defiance of the Greek Orthodox  Church, which owns it.  </P> <P> Wajih Nusseibeh, a Muslim whose family keeps the key of the Church of the Holy  Sepulcher, said he believes it is the first time the church has been shut since  the Crusaders were driven out of the city by the Islamic warrior Saladin in the  12th Century.  </P> <P> The Church of the Nativity, the site of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, and holy  sites throughout Israel were also closed in the daylong protest. Church bells  rang in somber, funereal cadence for about five minutes every hour, and black  flags fluttered in the breeze.  </P> <P> In an act of solidarity, Muslim leaders closed Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque and  Dome of the Rock shrine to tourists. Only worshipers were permitted in the  complex.  </P> <P> Bishop Samir Kafiti, the head of the Anglican Church in Jerusalem, told  reporters that Christian leaders are dissatisfied with an Israeli Supreme Court  decision, issued Thursday, to evict most of the Jewish settlers by Tuesday.  Some would be allowed to stay pending a lower court decision on the tenancy  issue.  </P> <P> Kafiti said the court decision is ambiguous because the judges did not return  full control of the building to the Greek Orthodox Church. The church alleges  that the settlers are in the building under an illegal sublease.  </P> <P> The settlers moved into the 72-room Hospice of St. John on April 11, touching  off angry protests from Palestinian Muslims and Christians and bringing  international condemnation.  </P></p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: O&amp;Y keen to sell New York building OLYMPIA &amp; YORK is neg-otiating the sale of all or part of the 34-storey former world headquarters building in New York of ITT, the US financial, industrial and travel conglomerate. According to an executive close to the talks, a deal for the sale of at least part of the Manhattan office block might be completed within the next fortnight. 'Nothing is written in stone, but there is an 80 per cent chance of it going ahead,' the executive said. If the transaction goes ahead, it may help to reassure those bank creditors who believe that in the wake of the Canary Wharf project in the UK being placed in administration, the Canadian property group should consider filing for bankruptcy in the US. Speculation is mounting in New York that O&amp;Y may eventually need to seek protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules. The Manhattan building, which consists of 664,000 sq ft, has been vacant for the past 15 months. O&amp;Y last year put off plans to spend Dollars 150m removing asbestos and making a number of repairs as part of a complete renovation. Property analysts in New York say the present market value of the building, provided a tenant moves in, could be about Dollars 150 a sq ft. That would suggest that the building's current value may be about Dollars 100m. It is believed, however, that O&amp;Y still owes at least Dollars 100m in mortgage loans related to the property. The Canadian developer deferred plans earlier this year to refinance the loan, understood to be owed to a syndicate led by First Chicago Bank. The identity of the potential buyer for the building is not known, but one mechanism being explored is the sale of what is known as a 'condominium interest' in the building. That would allow O&amp;Y to continue owning part of the property. However, it might also result in an extremely complicated deal, since the buyer might have to assume part of the outstanding debt or agree to finance some of the repairs needed. The Reichmann family, which owns O&amp;Y, acquired the Park Avenue building in 1977 when it bought several prime Manhattan buildings.</p>

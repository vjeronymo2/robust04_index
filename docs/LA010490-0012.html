			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> I would like to thank the helicopter pilots and their crews for the tremendous  job they are doing in spraying.  </P> <P> Some complainers can't see beyond the end of their noses. If the Medfly is not  eradicated, it could ruin California's biggest industry. It could cause the use  of more pesticides and that would increase farmers' costs and ultimately what  we pay for fruits and vegetables.  </P> <P> The weirdos who claim they are spreading the flies in protest of the use of  malathion -- if they are indeed doing it -- are causing the use of more  malathion.  </P> <P> My hat is off to these men who are spending their nights doing a thankless job.  </P> <P> SARAH M. DUNCAN  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

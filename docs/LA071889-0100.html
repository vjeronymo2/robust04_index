			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH, SWISS FIRMS SAY THEY MAY JOIN IN GOLDSMITH'S BID FOR BAT  </P> <P> French financial group Compagnie Financiere de Paribas said Monday that it  might join Sir James Goldsmith in his proposed $21.2-billion buyout of BAT  Industries PLC.  </P> <P> "We are considering taking part in the bid. Very advanced discussions are under  way with (Goldsmith's) Hoylake Investment Ltd.," a Paribas spokesman said.  </P> <P> Swiss investment group Pargesa Holding SA also said it might back the  consortium seeking control of BAT, which has substantial holdings in tobacco,  retailing and insurance on both sides of the Atlantic.  </P> <P> The biggest takeover battle in European corporate history has been topped only  by the $25-billion RJR Nabisco Inc. buyout in the United States.  </P> <P> The addition of Paribas would broaden financial support for the bid, which has  hit some skepticism in London's relatively staid stock market, where  billion-dollar deals were unusual until recently.  </P> <P> Anglo-French financier Goldsmith, together with British banker Jacob Rothschild  and Australian businessman Kerry Packer, launched his bid last Tuesday, sending  the London market soaring.  </P> <P> But there has been concern over the group's plan to fund the cashless bid with  junk bonds. Financial analysts have said British regulatory authorities might  feel it necessary to launch an investigation into the offer because no cash is  involved.  </P></p>

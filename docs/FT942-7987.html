			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Lone eagles nest in the Rockies: Clean air, open spaces and low costs are drawing US professionals west Magnificent Rocky Mountain vistas dominate the view from Jeff Thredgold's new six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home near Salt Lake City, Utah. Walk out the front door of the imposing, pink brick structure, designed by Mr Thredgold himself, and within minutes you can be hiking in the foothills of Utah's Wasatch mountain range. Less than an hour's drive away lie some of the world's leading ski resorts: Park City, Deer Valley, Snowbird and Alta. 'Now this is living]' declares Mr Thredgold, surveying the Park City ski slopes over lunch on a warm, cloudless spring day. Mr Thredgold, chief economist for KeyCorp, America's 11th largest bank, is part of a significant US business and social trend: a rapidly growing number of American companies and individual professionals are settling in the Rocky Mountain region, attracted by its open spaces, low cost of living, and pro-business politics. Mr Thredgold's company is headquartered far off in the rustbelt state of Ohio. But modern communications mean he can keep in touch from the mountains of Utah, where he was raised. He prefers to live here because of its quality of life, family and social ties, and the perspective a western base gives his economic analysis. He built his dream house for a fraction of what it would have cost in many large US cities. Many newcomers are fleeing the once golden state of California, tired of its deep (though now ending) recession, regulatory red tape, high costs, pollution and almost biblical succession of recent disasters - race riots, earthquakes, and fires. They have helped make the six states down the spine of the Rockies - Montana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico - plus Nevada and Arizona, the fastest-growing US region in recent years, measured by job creation. Admittedly, this growth is from a modest base. The region is a vast, sparsely populated land, accounting for no more than 5 per cent of America's GDP, and encompasses great extremes of geography, from desert to rolling high plains. Expansion is also bringing problems, ranging from social tensions between Rocky Mountain natives and the newcomers to long-term questions about the sustainability of growth and the adequacy of water supplies in this largely arid region. For now, however, the upturn is welcome in an area which has been traditionally dependent on mining, oil, farming and forestry, with an economic history of booms and busts tied to commodity cycles. In the late 1970s the region's main city, Denver, Colorado enjoyed spectacular expansion on the back of a global oil crisis, but as crude prices fell in the 1980s, the region missed out on the strong growth enjoyed by the US as a whole. Ms Susan Piatt, of the Colorado state Office of Business Development, avoids calling the current expansion a boom. 'It implies things are out of control . . . We like to think its healthy growth and its our turn, because we were so depressed when the rest of the nation was doing so well.' Many of the companies coming to the Rockies are small - the kind of business that is creating most new jobs in the US - and many of them are in high-technology areas such as computing and medicine. For example, Boise, the capital of Idaho, a state renowned for growing potatoes, had the greatest job growth of any US city last year (6 per cent) and high-technology employment there has expanded by more than 10 per cent a year for the past six years. Companies are attracted by the region's cheap labour (the Rockies have among the lowest average wages in the US), and modest costs for utilities, workers' benefits, housing and office space. They also like the region's strong work ethic. Utah, the fastest-growing Rocky Mountain state, with 6 per cent job growth last year, seems to be benefiting in particular from the fact that 70 per cent of its population belongs to the Mormon church, based in Salt Lake City. Mormons are known for strong family values and emphasis on education and hard work. Some companies also hope the quality of life in the Rockies - with its wide open spaces, fresh air, low crime rate and small town values - will help them attract and keep well-educated employees. Says Ms DeeDee Corradini, Mayor of Salt Lake City: 'A decade ago, when I talked to businesses about moving to an area like this, they wanted to know what it meant for them financially. Today, I'm finding more and more asking: 'What's the quality of life? Will our employees and their families be happy living there?' ' The influx of professional individuals - such as fund managers, lawyers, computer experts, management consultants and writers - stems from two main forces. First, a large pool of these freelances is being created as US corporations, struggling to stay competitive, spin off service functions to outsiders. At the same time, modern communications - computer modems, fax machines and satellite television - allow professionals to live where they choose, if it is within striking distance of a good airport. Mr Philip Burgess, who heads the Center for the New West, a Denver-based think tank, calls the breed 'lone eagles' - mobile knowledge workers who live by their wits. 'We are in an era of a great shift in lifestyle preferences,' he argues. 'More and more Americans are leaving big cities to pursue a better quality of life.' This promises to revive small towns in attractive parts of the US, recently deemed to be dying as Americans moved to city suburbs. Several Rocky Mountain towns have begun wooing freelance professionals, knowing they are not only highly paid but tend to sink their roots deep into a community. Says Mr Burgess: 'They will serve on the library board and perhaps run for the county commission, bringing new ideas and a fresh perspective.' For example, Telluride, a former mining town in the Colorado Rockies now one of America's most fashionable ski resorts, has a project to build a community wide computer network and improve communications with the outside world. Locals boast it has the highest per capita ownership of personal computers in the US. But for all its benefits, the growth is also bringing problems. Many long-time Rocky Mountain residents deeply resent the newcomers, their wealth, cosmopolitan airs, and the inflationary impact on housing and farm land, which could create a gulf between haves and have-nots. Tensions have run particularly high in some Utah towns between straight-laced Mormons and free-wheeling Californians. The big challenge facing local politicians, says Mr Michael Leavitt, Utah's governor, is to balance growth against preservation of quality of life: 'The more attractive you are the more people want to come.' Utah, for example, has become more discriminating about the kinds of business it tries to attract. A few years ago it was happy to take all comers. But Salt Lake City recently cold-shouldered a company which would have brought jobs to the area but demanded large water treatment subsidies. Even if quality of life can be maintained, there remain big question marks over long-term growth. Industry may become less enthusiastic about the Rockies when wage rates rise closer to the national average. And high technology jobs can be destroyed by sudden technological shifts. California, for its part, is starting to fight back against the business exodus, for example by simplifying its red tape. On top of all this, growth will eventually bring to the Rockies a problem faced by all of the arid, western third of the US, but which regional boosters like to ignore: a shortage of water, pitting state against state and farmer against town-dweller. Herculean damming and water diversion efforts mean this may not be a problem for 20 to 30 years or more. But as the late Wallace Stegner, a leading novelist and historian of the region, pointed out: 'Sooner or later the west must accept the limitations imposed by aridity, one of the chief of which is restricted human population . . .Ghost towns and dust bowls, like motels, are western inventions.'</p>

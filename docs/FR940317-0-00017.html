			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the occurrence of brucellosis among workers at the packing plant, the State of North Carolina has ordered that the plant may obtain swine only from validated brucellosis-free States, or from validated brucellosis-free herds in States other than validated brucellosis-free States. Although, at this time, the infection of humans and the North Carolina order involve only one packing plant, if the problem were to broaden and occur at other packing plants in North Carolina, or to occur in additional States, additional individuals could suffer significant hardship from brucellosis infections, and packing plants and owners of herds other than validated brucellosis-free herds could experience severe economic disruption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States Animal Health Association (USAHA), a nationwide association of State veterinarians and industry members, recently passed a resolution requesting that the Department establish the goal of the complete eradication of swine brucellosis in the United States by the end of 1996. This resolution was supported by the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) and the American Meat Institute (AMI). Additionally, the USAHA passed a second resolution, supported by NPPC and AMI, requesting that the Department move to depopulate immediately all herds of swine known to be affected with brucellosis by paying fair market value for all swine in the affected herds. (Under &sect;51.1, a herd known to be affected is defined as any herd in which any animal has been classified as a brucellosis reactor and which has not been released from quarantine.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We compared the probable outcome of following the USAHA resolutions with that of continuing the existing eradication program, and concluded that eradication of swine brucellosis can be accomplished more quickly, with significantly less expense, by beginning now to pay fair market value for whole herd depopulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change in the indemnity regulations is warranted now due to the success of the existing swine brucellosis eradication program. During the life of the program, the prevalence of swine brucellosis has been reduced from 15 percent of the nation's swine herds to 0.014 percent. Currently, only 34 herds nationwide are known to be affected with brucellosis. Because the number of herds known to be affected is small, paying fair market value for whole herd depopulation is feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When undertaking whole herd depopulation, herd owners, where it is possible, will be required either to dispose of the swine through means other than slaughter (e.g., through burial, incineration, rendering, etc.) on the premises where the animals are held or penned at the time the indemnity is approved, or to move their swine for disposal to another location when movement to the location is approved, in advance, by an APHIS representative. Paying fair market value for whole herd depopulation, as provided for in this interim rule, will enable herd owners to dispose of swine through means other than slaughter (e.g., through burial, incineration, rendering, etc.). (The flat rates provided for under the existing regulations assume that the herd owner will also receive salvage value at slaughter.) Disposing of swine through such alternate means will help eliminate the danger of spreading brucellosis to swine, as well as help protect packing plant workers from the danger posed by brucellosis-infected swine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the effective date of this interim rule, &sect;51.6 of the regulations required that swine for which indemnity was paid under the regulations be slaughtered at a slaughtering establishment. In order to allow for alternative means of destruction, we are amending &sect;51.6(c) in this interim rule to provide that in the case of indemnity paid for whole herd depopulation, swine may be destroyed on the premises where the animals are held or penned at the time the indemnity is approved, or may be moved for destruction to another location when movement to the location is approved in advance by an APHIS representative. We are also providing that in cases where the swine are destroyed other than at a slaughtering establishment, the carcasses of the swine shall be disposed of by burial, incineration, or other disposal means authorized by applicable State law, and are requiring that destruction and disposition of animals destroyed other than at a slaughtering establishment be performed in the presence of an APHIS representative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, in paying fair market value for whole herd indemnity, every effort will be made to dispose of swine by means other than slaughter. In some cases, however, when a packing plant is willing to handle swine from herds known to be affected, when it has been notified of the arrival of the swine, and when appropriate precautions are taken to protect the plant's workers, slaughter may be a feasible means of disposing of the animals. As noted above, in such cases, the indemnity paid, plus any salvage, must not exceed the appraised value of the swine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although, under the provisions of this interim rule, average indemnity costs for the Federal government will increase from $1,760 per herd to $9,030 per herd, the total cost for indemnity is expected to increase only slightly over the life of the program, and total program costs are expected to decrease substantially. According to APHIS projections, the eradication program as provided for prior to this interim rule would have required over 30 more years to accomplish total eradication, with projected costs of almost $600,000 for indemnity and $18 million for surveillance. In contrast, because the provisions of this interim rule will allow for the quick depopulation of herds known to be affected with brucellosis, and therefore increase program effectiveness, total eradication is expected to be accomplished in 5 years, with projected costs of $850,000 for indemnity and $10.5 million for surveillance. Thus, the total cost of eradication will be reduced from $18.6 million to $11.35 million, and the time necessary to achieve eradication shortened by more than 25 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

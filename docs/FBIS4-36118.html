			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, minister of awqaf  and religious affairs, has valued the Revolution Command Council  [RCC] Decree No. 59, issued on 4 June, stipulating the  amputatation of the thief's right hand at the wrist.    The minister told INA's correspondent the decree is in line  with God's Book and the provisions of the Islamic Law and in  harmony with God's words: As to the thief, male or female: Cut  off his or her hands, a punishment by way of example, from God,  for their crime, and God is exalted in power. [Koranic verse]    The minister added that this legislation is appropriate to  address the robbery cases noted in the decree and that the  issuance of the decree is in line with the campaign of faith and  jihad led by the faithful leader struggler President Saddam  Husayn and to remedy the crimes of theft.    He noted that the rule of God is better than all other rules  in achieving deterrence that immunizes society against crime.  He asserted that the RCC decree is in implementation of God's  rule.    But who, for a people whose faith is assured, can give  better  judgment than God? [Koranic verse]</p>

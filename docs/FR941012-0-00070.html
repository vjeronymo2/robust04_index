			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters recommended that OSHA require CPR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training as part of required first-aid training (Ex. 5&hyph;42,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;50, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;19). Both NIOSH and the U.S. Dept. of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interior supported the CPR training requirement. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loggers, especially those deep in the woods are not close to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical facilities during the ``golden hour'' where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resuscitation may save a person's life, OSHA agrees with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters that it is essential that all loggers be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform CPR. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a requirement for annual CPR training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, OSHA has specified other basic skills and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge in Appendix B (mandatory) that are important for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing aid to injured loggers in isolated settings. OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is aware that there are many well-recognized first-aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs that have broad-based curricula which already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy OSHA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Visual and audible contact. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the hearing notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA requested comment on the maximum time and/or distance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separation between employees. In the proposed rule, OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included a requirement that employees work within visual or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audible contact of another employee, so that someone would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to respond quickly in case of an accident or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency. The proposed rule prohibited the use of engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noise, such as from chain saws, as a means of contact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various State logging standards also prohibit the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain-saw noise as a means of signaling (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received many comments on the contact and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signaling provisions. Many commenters testified that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed contact requirement is necessary (Ex. 5&hyph;14, 5&hyph;17,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;13; Tr. W2 197&hyph;98). One commenter said:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We think that visual or audible contact is important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will save lives. There are also electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices, some sophisticated and some like citizen band  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radios, that can be used by forest workers to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audible contact by electronic means. We recommend that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing proposed language be retained but modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perhaps to allow audible contact by electronic means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Tr. W2 197&hyph;98). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain commenters urged OSHA to make the contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement stricter than that proposed. One commenter said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees in solitary jobs also need to remain in contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, therefore, should be provided with two-way radios (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9&hyph;15). Another commenter said OSHA should require employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to remain within visual contact of another crew members (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9&hyph;20). Finally, two commenters recommended that OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require employees to work within normal hearing or calling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance of another employee (Ex. 9&hyph;19; Tr. OR 679&hyph;81).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, several commenters expressed various concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the contact provision, and particularly the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition against chain-saw noise as a means of contact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, some participants said the requirements would have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse impact on small employers, especially employers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work crews consisting of three or fewer loggers (Ex. 5&hyph;21,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;70). For example, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter said: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This requirement may adversely affect the livelihood of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many small-scale loggers in the South who may work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alone in the woods, or operate a single mobile ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skidder or felling machine and are frequently out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact with other phases of the logging operation (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;28).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter stated:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This requirement would not be practical for several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) there are a number of logging contractors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that work alone,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) log crews with two or three members are often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of contact because the great distance between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faller and log header,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) even at close range, visual and audible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signals are attenuated by thick brush and loud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machinery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> My experience has been loggers will keep track of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fellow workers the best they can but, due to the nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the job, individuals will be separated for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lengths of time. To require loggers to be within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signaling distance of one another will preclude the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of one and two man log crews, working in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thick brush, working in hilly topography, skidding long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distances, the use of ear plugs or working with loud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machines (Ex. 5&hyph;70). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, some commenters believed the contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement conflicted with the proposed requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain a distance of two tree lengths between work areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;4, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70). These commenters said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a separation of two tree lengths between work areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might make it impossible to maintain contact due to saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noise and obstructions such as hills or vegetation. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter explained:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

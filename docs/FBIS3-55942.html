It points out that in  recent times, "the state of affairs in civil aviation has  sharply worsened," while the leadership of Russia's Air  Transport Department is taking no effective measures to bring  the sector out of a deep crisis. More, department director  Vladimir Zamotin and his immediate entourage, the appeal says,  hamper in every way the work of airlines that have switched to  new forms of economic development. At the same time, "the safety  of flights in the sector is at a low level whereas the quality  of services to passengers has sharply fallen." All this, the  authors of the appeal think, results from the fact that "the  sector is being controlled by an amateur, a former party  apparatchik who had worked for a considerable length of time in  the Ukraine Communist Party Central Committee and the CPSU  Central Committee."    In this connection, participants in the conference passed a  demand to the Russian president and prime minister to relieve  Vladimir Zamotin of the position he fills, and recommended that  Anatoliy Kochur, president of Russia's Association of Air Crews,  be appointed director of the Air Transport Department in his  place.    As was intimated at the headquarters of the Association of  Air Crews, the conference had also passed an appeal to work  collectives of Russia's civil aviation for support of the demand  for Zamotin's resignation. At the moment statements supporting  this demand have come not only from civil aviation air crews and  aviation technical services of airline members of the  Association of Air Crews, but also from the Association of Air  Crews of the Armed Forces and the Federation of Air Traffic  Controllers of Russia, where they believe that the present  department director should be fired if only "for actions aimed  against free trade unions, as well as for red tape."</p>

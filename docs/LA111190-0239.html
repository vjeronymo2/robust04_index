			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME : A WEE BIT OF SCOTLAND ON THE WESTSIDE;  </P> <P> CHEVIOT HILLS: THE SQUARE-MILE COMMUNITY ECHOES THE SCOTTISH THEME IN ITS  STREET NAMES, SUCH AS DUMFRIES AND WIGTOWN.  </P> <P> In 1986, Timothy Homan, a math teacher at Santa Monica High School, bought a  three-bedroom fixer-upper in Cheviot Hills for $260,000.  </P> <P> Investing $100,000, he added a bathroom, replumbed, relandscaped, refinished  floors, made cosmetic changes, including wallpaper and paint, and sold the  house in 1988 for $550,000.  </P> <P> But Homan didn't take his profit and move on.  </P> <P> "I fell in love with Cheviot Hills," he said, "and I found my dream house" -- a  2,500-square-foot, two-story home that he bought for $700,000.  </P> <P> "It has three bedrooms, two baths and sits on a beautiful lot and a half, so  there's great potential to add on," Homan said. "I have wonderful plans for  this home and I plan to live in it for a long time to come."  </P> <P> Originally a section of farmland famous for its celery, beans and oranges, the  neighborhood of Cheviot Hills is about one square mile of undulating,  tree-lined streets located south of Century City and 20th Century Fox Studios,  north of the Santa Monica Freeway and to either side of Motor Avenue.  </P> <P> Built up during the 1930s, '40s and '50s, the area was named by two developers  who were inspired by the original Cheviot Hills of Scotland. The Scottish theme  is echoed in its street names, such as Dumfries, Haddington, Wigtown, Troon.  </P> <P> Kaye Van Horn, a field aide for Rep. Tony Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), has lived  in more than one home in Cheviot Hills -- like many of her neighbors -- and has  never wanted to leave the area.  </P> <P> "Those who live here are in love with its unique physical beauty," she said.  "It's an established community with a special character . . . lovely older  homes and beautiful landscapes . . . excellent schools and convenient  location."  </P> <P> "One of this neighborhood's greatest virtues is its accessibility," said  Richard Van Horn, director of the Mental Health Assn. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It's close to the business communities on the Westside . . . and, because the  freeway is so close, you can be in downtown Los Angeles or LAX in 15 minutes."  </P> <P> The community is also a "wonderful area to raise children," said Lynn Angalet,  who with her husband, Bruce, an educational consultant, are raising 4-year-old  Jason.  </P> <P> "Eight years ago, there were only three children on our street," she said.  "Then, about the same time that Jason was born, there was a kind of baby boom  and now there are more than 17 children on our block alone.  </P> <P> "Our older neighbors are terrific. They've all told us how happy they are to  have young children playing in the neighborhood again."  </P> <P> However, the Angalets face troubling issues common to other couples raising  families in Los Angeles, including the influence of gangs and drugs in the  schools.  </P> <P> "We thought about sending Jason to a private school but Overland Elementary had  an orientation program recently that convinced us that it's a very fine school.  The teachers are very good; they have new equipment; they provide an excellent  after-school day-care program for working parents, and they have tremendous  parent involvement," she said.  </P> <P> Millie Chase, a longtime resident who sold real estate in the area with her  husband, Jack, until they retired in 1978, recalled the early days when the  land was sold lot by lot.  </P> <P> "The homes were built as the lots were sold -- they were meant to blend in with  the scenery. It was quite common at that time to have only one house on an  entire block. That's why Cheviot Hills doesn't have a tract look. That is also  why the streets stop and start so abruptly."  </P> <P> The houses reflect a variety of architectural styles -- Norman French nestles  comfortably beside Mediterranean, Spanish mingles with traditional.  </P> <P> Of particular delight to residents are the cottages built in the 1940s and '50s  by the late Edmond J. Aiken. Sometimes called English cottages or "witches  houses," the homes rest in cozy landscapes with slanting thatched roofs,  curving brick walkways and thick mortar oozing between brick and stonework.  </P> <P> Working with his own crew, which included his son, Aiken filled the  small-scaled rooms with handcrafted doors, beamed ceilings, walls and floors,  all of which were finished with original paints and stains.  </P> <P> Originally a shipbuilder, Aiken made use of every cozy corner, fashioning  shelves for display, cupboards for storage and half-oval fireplaces that  provide a view of crackling fires from any seat in the room.  </P> <P> "Mr. Aiken built practical, lovable homes, and catered to young couples on  tight budgets because he knew they would love his homes as much as he did,"  said Rosemary Peters, who with her husband, Ralph, a stockbroker, arranged for  Aiken to build their first home in 1952.  </P> <P> "He loved funny, odd-shaped lots and would design the house to fit the lot,"  Peters said. "In fact, following his advice, we rejected one parcel that was  too ordinary for his taste and chose instead a uniquely shaped lot across the  street that suited the character of our home perfectly."  </P> <P> "He was an artist," said Virginia Counts, who with her husband, J. Curtis,  bought an Aiken home in 1948. Like other Aiken owners, the Counts kept in touch  with the beloved home builder and visited him in Northern California shortly  before his death in 1988 at the age of 99.  </P> <P> "Mr. Aiken used odd lots of brick and wood that make inevitable repairs next to  impossible, but also make his unique homes one-of-a-kind treasures," she said.  </P> <P> Like much Southland real estate, Cheviot Hills experienced extraordinary  appreciation in the past 20 years.  </P> <P> Eliane and Armand Capdeville have lived in Cheviot Hills since the early 1970s  and have worked together as a real estate agents for most of that time in  Cheviot Hills, Rancho Park and Century City. They now work for Prudential  California Realty.  </P> <P> "In 1970, an average 2,000-square-foot home in Cheviot Hills sold for $50,000  to $70,000. Today, that same home is valued at between $700,000 and $800,000,"  the Capdevilles said.  </P> <P> "And Aiken homes have always been worth more per square footage than any other  homes. In the early 1970s a 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath Aiken home  was valued at $60,000; today its value would begin in the mid-$500,000 range."  </P> <P> "There is a special feeling of community that has been maintained throughout  the years," said Millie Chase, a longtime member of the Cheviot Hills  Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> "The neighbors on our street have a summer block party," she said. "Everyone  joins in and brings potluck. I'm particularly impressed with the enthusiasm of  our younger neighbors, one of whom arranged for someone from UCLA to come to  speak to us and helped our block organize a neighborhood earthquake awareness  plan.  </P> <P> "Each neighbor knows the names of every adult and child living in each home,  the names of their pets and the names of anyone who lives with them or works  for them."  </P> <P> The neighbors have even chipped in to buy a generator for emergency use in case  of an earthquake disaster.  </P> <P> "We've always had a strong homeowners' association that's taken on City Hall  more than once concerning issues affecting our neighborhood, such as the  commercial development of areas surrounding Century City and what is now known  as the Westside Pavilion -- development that alarms many of the residents,"  Chase said.  </P> <P> "Some battles we win, some we lose, but it has always been a dedicated group of  individuals willing to work hard for issues that are important to the residents  of Cheviot Hills."  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> 1990 estimate: 4,225  </P> <P> 1980-1990 change: 3.1%  </P> <P> Median Age: 39.2 years  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: 28,818  </P> <P> Median household: 59,014  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 2.1%  </P> <P> $15,000-$30,000: 18.1%  </P> <P> $30,000-$50,000: 20.7%  </P> <P> $50,000-$75,000: 17.8%  </P> <P> $75,000 +: 38.7%  </P></p>

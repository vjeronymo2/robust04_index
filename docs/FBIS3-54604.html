In its statement,  Fatah stressed that it views with gravity recent Israeli  practices in the occupied territories, the culmination of which  was the recent campaign of detentions in the Gaza Strip.    The statement referred to opening fire on residents in  Jabalyah last Saturday [22 January], the demolition of houses in  Rafah, the detentions that have covered most areas of the Gaza  Strip, and the campaign of confiscating magnetic identity cards  from hundreds of workers without any justification.    The statement emphasized that the Israeli side is incapable  of proving its credibility and seriousness with respect to the  current peace process. In its statement, Fatah called on the  Israeli authorities to immediately release all prisoners,  especially the sick, the elderly, and those who have spent long  periods in detention, without discriminating against one people.  The statement also called on the authorities to release  fugitives who were detained after the signing of the Declaration  of Principles and to return recently revoked identity cards to  hundreds of workers.    In conclusion, Fatah stated that the Israeli side should  immediately stop these practices, which will have a negative  effect on the negotiating process.</p>

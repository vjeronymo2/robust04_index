			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana exports delayed for up to six weeks BANANA EXPORTS from the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and Panama will be interrupted for between two to six weeks, following the earthquake which devastated the region last Monday. Mr Euclides Diaz, the secretary-general of the National Banana Corporation in Panama, says repairs to roads and rail links to the banana-exporting port of Almirante will take '30 to 45 days'. The port itself has not been badly damaged, but most of the road and rail bridges in the region 'have been completely destroyed.' Six packing plants have been badly damaged and up to 3m boxes of bananas may be lost as a result. In Costa Rica, efforts are being made to divert exports through the Pacific Coast port of Puerto Caldera. According to the National Banana Corporation, 'it will take at least 15 days before exports can be resumed through Puerto Limon'. About 500,000 boxes a week can be trucked across the country from the least affected zones north of Puerto Limon.</p>

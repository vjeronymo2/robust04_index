			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Firefly Information" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Fourth Ibero-American Summit has just ended amid  the disappointment of the international media and after the  presidents rendered their laconic reports. This is what  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria told his colleagues in the  area:    [Begin Gaviria recording] This cannot be anything else but  to  advance as brothers in the [words indistinct] political, social,  and economic to be able to abolish inequalities, vanquish  violence.... [end recording]    He said he could not forget his fellow countrymen, the Paez  Indians in Cauca and Huila Departments, who are currently  suffering so much. Also, that he could not forget the  solidarity of so many friendly countries as it allowed his  brothers, who have been left without their dear ones and their  belongings due to providence, to initiate their first steps  toward a new life. This was what Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria Trujillo said when he closed the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit.    Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who was the first  president to refer to Cuba at the summit, again centered his  closing speech on that island's political situation. Without  mentioning the Cuban president, Mr. Menem emphasized the need  that Latin America have freedom as its point of departure.    [Begin Menem recording] It can be a democracy based on the  presidential, monarchic, or parliamentary systems, but it must  be a democracy. [end recording]    Mr. Menem said there is no conflict between the market and  the state and also underscored the importance of democracy as  the fundamental factor to obtain the peace required for justice  and freedom to rule. He added that if he were to be asked which  of the four summits he thought had been best, he would answer  that this one had, the one held in Cartagena, because of the  topics that had been broached, the debates, the freedom, and the  organization of the summit. It was an important and impressive  summit, he said. In his final words, President Menem said  freedom and democracy can only be strengthened with more  democracy.</p>

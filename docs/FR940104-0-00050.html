			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the winter-run chinook salmon was formally listed as a threatened species in November 1990 (55 FR 46515), the annual estimated run sizes have become more variable and have continued to decline with the exception of an increase in 1992. Although some protective measures were implemented beginning in 1987, the decline was exacerbated by a 6-year drought in California (1987&hyph;1992) and threats adversely affecting the species that were not addressed until recently. Based on the run size estimates for the last 3 years (1991&hyph;1993), the population now has at least one and possibly two extremely weak year classes (1991 and 1993). NMFS expects that the 1994 run will also be weak because of the small numbers of adults returning in 1991 (191 fish) and less than favorable conditions for spawning, egg incubation, and juvenile outmigration that occurred in 1991&hyph;92. This years class is likely to remain weakened for the foreseeable future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although conditions for winter-run chinook salmon began improving in 1992 and 1993 because of protective measures implemented to reduce the long-term impacts of operations of the Federal and State water projects and improve conditions for successful egg incubation, rearing, and outmigration, the 6-year drought ended, and the natural production of juveniles is being supplemented with hatchery produced fish, NMFS believes that quantifiable improvements in population levels are not likely to be evident for several years. Since the effectiveness of these recently implemented protective measures and supplementation efforts is unknown and cannot be assessed until future runs return, there remains substantial risk that the population is in danger of extinction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the continued decline of the population and increased variability of run sizes since 1991, the expected weak return in 1994, continuing threats to the population, and uncertainty about whether recently implemented protective and conservation measures will be effective, NMFS believes that the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon is in danger of becoming extinct and should be classified as an endangered species. NMFS will continue to monitor closely the status of this population as well as evaluate the effectiveness of existing and future protective and conservation measures to determine whether any further changes in its status are warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species that are listed under the ESA include listing, recovery actions, implementation of certain protective measures, and designation and protection of critical habitat. Some of the most useful protective measures are contained in section 7 of the ESA. Pursuant to section 7, Federal agencies are required to conduct conservation programs for endangered species and to consult with NMFS regarding the potential effects of their actions on winter-run chinook salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since winter-run chinook salmon was originally listed as a threatened species on an emergency basis in August 1989, NMFS has conducted numerous section 7 consultations with Federal agencies whose actions may affect the species. The most significant consultations have been with the Bureau and the California Department of Water Resources concerning the long-term operations of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project and the Corps concerning fish passage at the GCID diversion facility at Hamilton City. NMFS is currently engaged in consultations with other Federal agencies and will continue this process to determine whether Federal actions affect winter-run chinook salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10 of the ESA provides for addressing the effects of private and state (non-Federal) actions on endangered species. NMFS has worked with GCID to address the impacts of their major diversion facility on winter-run chinook salmon through this process. NMFS also expects to work with the CDFG to address potentially adverse effects of striped bass and salmon hatchery management on winter-run chinook salmon. In the future, NMFS will continue to pursue opportunities to remedy private and non-Federal activities that may affect winter-run chinook salmon through this process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, NMFS established a National Sacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon recovery team to develop a recovery plan for the species. The team is comprised of fishery resource managers, experts on winter-run chinook salmon biology and, other conservation specialists. The recovery team meets frequently and expects to complete development of a comprehensive draft recovery plan in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that, to the extent that it is prudent and determinable, critical habitat be designated concurrently with the listing of a species. NMFS published a final rule designating critical habitat for Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon on June 16, 1993. The designated critical habitat includes: the Sacramento River from Keswick Dam (RM 302) to Chipps Island (RM 0) at the westward margin of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, all waters from Chipps Island westward to Carquinez Bridge, all waters of San Pablo Bay, and all waters in San Francisco Bay north of the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge. The final rule also identifies those physical and biological features of the habitat that are essential to the conservation of winter-run chinook salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 50 CFR Part 222  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Endangered and threatened species, Exports, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

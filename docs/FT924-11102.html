			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Sweden and Finland seek fresh foreign funds TWO Scandinavian sovereign borrowers are expected to tap the Eurobond markets later today in D-Marks and French francs. Sweden is said to be raising FFr5bn in a five-year deal priced to yield 45 to 50 basis points over comparable maturity French Treasuries, while Finland is expected to announce a DM1bn five-year Eurobond. Other sovereign borrowers are also said to be testing the waters for fresh funds. The issue is said to be attracting muted interest from domestic French investors, who found Finnish 11-year French franc Eurobond launched earlier this year hard to digest. Dealers said that, despite the glut of issues in recent weeks, the markets had shown a reasonable capacity to absorb the supply. After its DM2bn issue earlier this month, the deal is expected to offer Sweden a somewhat narrower spread of roughly 15 basis points over London interbank offered rates than the 30 basis point margin on its previous issue. However, there has been considerable discussion about exactly what advantages will accrue to these sovereign borrowers once the funds are swapped back into the domestic currency. In Sweden, for instance, domestic interest rates for five-year money are lower than rates achieved following a swap from D-Marks. With the domestic markets unable to provide cash an the scale needed by Sweden, however, the borrower may have no option other than to raise funds, albeit at higher cost, in other currencies. Meanwhile, two more Mexican corporate borrowers tapped the Eurobond market yesterday, seeking a total of Dollars 350m of five-year debt, and more are lining up to follow suit. Grupo Televisa, Mexico's largest producer of Spanish-language television programmes, assigned a 10 per cent coupon to its five-year Dollars 200m bond and priced it at 410 basis points over comparable US Treasuries at 99.961 per cent, for an effective yield of 10.01 per cent. Chase Investment Bank was lead underwriter for the deal. Late yesterday, Morgan Stanley International said it would offer Dollars 150m of five-year Eurobonds for Empresas la Moderna, a Mexican cigarette distributor. The bonds are to be priced at 425 basis points over US Treasuries later today. Other Mexican borrowers preparing to tap the market are Vitro, Mexico's largest glass manufacturer, and Dina, a domestic truck and bus manufacturer. The collapse of equities prices on the Mexican stock markets three months ago has prompted companies searching for expansion capital to consider borrowing money rather than selling shares. Separately, Deutsche Bank described its DM100m issue for its Deutsche Finance Netherlands subsidiary as a block trade private placement for sale to retail investors through its own network. Morgan Stanley's DM100m seven-year reverse FRN for DSL Bank pays a coupon of 9 1/2 per cent for the first year and 20 per cent less two-times six-month Libor thereafter.</p>

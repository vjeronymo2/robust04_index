The survey will, for the first time, collect comprehensive information on trade in financial services between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign persons. It is intended to cover the universe of such transactions by type and by country. The information is needed to support trade policy initiatives, including trade negotiations, on financial services and to compile the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts. The survey will be conducted once every 5 years under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The first survey will cover 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> These rules will be effective November 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Betty L.

No comments on the proposed rules were received. As a result, the final rules are the same as the proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final rules amend existing 15 CFR 801.9 and add new 15 CFR 801.11 to implement the new survey. The survey will be conducted by BEA under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (P.L. 94&hyph;472, 90 Stat. 2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101&hyph;3108, as amended) and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100&hyph;418, 15 U.S.C. 4908(b)). Section 4(a) of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act provides that ``The President shall, to the extent he deems necessary and feasible_*&blank;*&blank;*(4) conduct *&blank;*&blank;* benchmark surveys with respect to trade in services between unaffiliated United States persons and foreign persons *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;'' In Section 3 of Executive Order 11961, as amended by Executive Order 12518, the President delegated the authority under the Act as concerns international trade in services to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated it to BEA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directs that ``The Secretary (of Commerce) shall ensure that *&blank;*&blank;* there is included in the Data Bank information on service sector activity that is as complete and timely as information on economic activity in the merchandise sector. The Secretary shall undertake a new benchmark survey of services transactions, including transactions with respect to *&blank;*&blank;* banking services; (and) brokerage services.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major purposes of the survey are to provide the information on financial services needed in monitoring U.S. services trade, analyzing its effects on the U.S. economy, formulating U.S. international trade policy, supporting bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations, compiling the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts, developing U.S. international price indexes for services, assessing U.S. competitiveness in international trade in services, and improving the ability of U.S. businesses to identify and evaluate market opportunities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BE&hyph;80 survey will be conducted once every 5 years, and the first survey will be for 1994. The survey covers the universe of financial services transactions between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign persons. Reporting is required from U.S. financial services providers who have sales to or purchases from unaffiliated foreign persons in all covered financial services combined in excess of $1 million during the reporting year. Those financial services providers meeting this criteria must supply data on the amount of their sales or purchases of each covered type of service, disaggregated by country. U.S. financial services providers that have covered transactions of less than $1 million during the reporting year are asked to provide, on a voluntary basis, estimates only of their total sales or purchases of each type of financial service. The survey is scheduled to be mailed to potential respondents in February 1995, and completed reports are due May 31. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that the information from the benchmark survey will be updated in nonbenchmark years by an annual follow-on survey that is more limited in scope and that will cover only a sample of the companies reporting in the BE&hyph;80 survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

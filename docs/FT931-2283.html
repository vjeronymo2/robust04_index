			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The winners and the losers - Company Cars / The new tax regime's impact / The Budget and You IS YOUR company car worthwhile? Until recently, most company car drivers, whether work users or perk users, received a clearly tax-efficient benefit if the car was available for private use. However, over the last six years the benefit has been eroded as company car tax charges have increased by more than 300 per cent compared with inflation of 40 per cent. In addition, chancellor Norman Lamont has announced a new tax regime based on the maker's recommended retail price - the list price - which will hit many company car drivers hard. Some will suffer further tax increases of more than 50 per cent from April 6 1994, although many will benefit to a lesser extent. The move to list prices is also expected to have a big impact on car prices. The practice of heavy discounting to large fleet users and fleet companies should lessen and list prices should fall. This will benefit the private purchaser, but will cause a rise in company car costs. The new regime, expected to raise an extra Pounds 100m per year compared with 1992/93, is based on a simple fixed percentage - 35 per cent - of the list price of the car when it was first registered (plus extras). Business users will receive discounts of two-thirds and one-third for heavy use (18,000 miles or more) and normal use (more than 2,500 miles) respectively. Older cars, four years old or more, will receive an additional discount of one-third. Thus, if you were a company car driver of the soon-to-be-launched Ford Mondeo 1.8 GLX 5dr - voted 1993 Car of the Year by What Car? magazine - with a list price expected to be Pounds 14,600, doing 1,000 business miles, your taxable benefit in 1994 would be Pounds 5,110 (Pounds 14,600 x 35 per cent). For a 25 per cent taxpayer, this would cost Pounds 106 per month. Under the prevailing system, the tax charge would be Pounds 93 per month - an increase of 14 per cent. If the driver covered 10,000 business miles, both figures would be reduced by one-third to Pounds 71 and Pounds 62 respectively. Table 1 shows how to calculate whether you will gain under the new rules. First, identify which of the five brackets your car falls into under the old system, based on its cost when new and its cylinder capacity. Then compare your car's actual list price to the breakeven list price shown in the first column. If your car's list price is greater than the breakeven figure, you are a loser; if it is less, you are a winner. For example, all drivers of 2-litre cars costing less than Pounds 19,250 will suffer if the list price of their car is greater than Pounds 12,814. Table 2 gives examples of typical winners and losers. In general, the losers are those drivers who chose cars at the top of the old bands. Deciding whether you are a winner or loser does not however necessarily resolve the question of whether your company car is still worthwhile. All the new regime has done is to reallocate the tax charges on a different, usually fairer, basis. However, because of the retention of the 2,500 and 18,000 business mileage bands, the benefit continues to be governed by business use, rather than private use. There is little to support these arbitrary business use figures. Also, the 35 per cent tax factor applied to list price is too crude a method of establishing a car's true annual cost. The true cost will be made up principally of depreciation, finance costs, maintenance and running costs and insurance (except fuel) together with the effect of taxes - income tax, corporation tax, VAT and national insurance. It appears that the new system has been pitched at too high a level and, in general, the new regime will over-tax company car drivers, both business users and perk drivers. A switch to cash will therefore be encouraged under the new rules. Surprisingly perhaps, those drivers with high business mileage (30,000 plus) may suffer most under the new regime as their business use discount will be limited to two-thirds. However, for work car drivers, tax efficiency is not usually a big consideration, other commercial factors weighing far more heavily. For perks car drivers (less than 2,500 miles), the tax factors carry their due weight and we can expect many more situations where it will be beneficial to switch to cash. However, such drivers should also consider non-tax factors. A car is probably the second largest purchase an employee would make, and the fact that all costs are usually borne by the employer, come what may, is a significant advantage. Companies also usually have access to greater discounts and cheaper funding and can also recover VAT on maintenance costs. Thus, even if a company car is not tax efficient, the relative cost savings available through sourcing a car through the company may be enough to make the provision of a company car cost effective, in spite of its tax inefficiency. On the other hand, the employee may be willing to downgrade or buy a used car. In many cases, the tax considerations will outweigh other factors. In other cases, the employee will wish to stick with the car in spite of its cost. He may also wish to consider employee lease purchase plans. The disadvantage of such schemes is their cost, because of increased credit risk. The cash or car decision is not easy. One thing is certain, however, and that is that considerably more drivers will benefit from a switch to cash, and employers may be able to make significant cost savings in the process. We can also expect to see a growth in innovative schemes designed to pass on tax savings to both employees and employers.

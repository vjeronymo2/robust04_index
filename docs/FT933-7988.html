			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw jumps to Pounds 3.7m - Results from two motor distributors illustrate industry recovery EVANS HALSHAW, the West Midlands-based motor dealing group, is seeking significant acquisitions as its trading performance improves sharply. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 3.73m, compared with Pounds 1.51m, on turnover of Pounds 189.1m (Pounds 169.2m). Earnings per share were 11.3p (4.6p). The interim dividend goes up to 3.8p (3.6p). Although the rise in profits was higher than market estimates, it emphasised a growing trend in the motor dealing sector. Rival groups Lex and Cowie have both recently announced improved results. Mr Geoff Dale, chairman, was confident that improved trading would continue. August, the new registration month, is 'very positive' with group sales 15 per cent higher than the same month of 1992 and the market, he said, 'is more consistent now, not just in car sales but across the business.' Overall car sales have been 20 per cent higher than last year. During recession, the group continued to invest, in, for example, motor villages where several franchises are grouped together, while, at the same time, bearing down on costs, helping it move into recovery with a lower cost base. Organic growth would continue, Mr Dale promised, 'while we step up our search for the right major acquisitions.' Potential purchases will be judged against three criteria. They will have to fit into the geographical pattern of the group's business; they will have to hold franchises which fit the existing blend - not being dependent on any one car maker; and they will be quality businesses with a local reputation and adequate showroom and technical facilities. Evans Halshaw is one of the six largest UK motor dealing groups, but is probably only half the size of Lex, which itself has been expanding with the purchase of Arlington and Lucas Autocentres. Cowie too has made a recent acquisition. With the larger motor trade groups in expansive frame of mind, Mr Dale sees the industry becoming less fragmented. Given that the car makers also have substantial interests at the retail end of the market, he opened up the possibility of the smaller and medium-sized companies being squeezed between them and the acquisitive larger groups. The rise in car sales - new model sales will probably finish 10 per cent higher in 1993 than in 1992 - can have a quick effect on the financial position of companies in the trade. Servicing and parts sales make up the base of their business - 74 per cent of Evans Halshaw's mix last year but 62 per cent so far this year as car sales rise. The new and used car trade is the jam on the bread and butter. But the jam is not being evenly spread. This is clear from Evans Halshaw's business which is spread over 42 dealerships and 17 marques. Dealerships south of the M4 motorway are finding trading the most difficult. The Ford franchises are doing less well than the Rover, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises. With the exception of Jaguar, the luxury end of the car market remains sluggish.</p>

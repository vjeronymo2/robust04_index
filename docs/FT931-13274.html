			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / NY Post staff take 20% pay cut EMPLOYEES at the New York Post voted last night to accept a temporary 20 per cent pay cut that the owner, property developer Mr Peter Kalikow, says is needed to keep the newspaper open. The cut, to be accompanied by a 25 per cent increase in the newspaper's cover price, was proposed by Mr Kalikow on Friday after Bankers Trust, the Post's banker, said it would no longer provide a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m) revolving line of credit. If the staff had rejected his proposal, Mr Kalikow had threatened to shut down the 192-year-old Post, the oldest newspaper in the US. While three of the Post's nine unions had agreed to the month-long pay cut on Saturday, it was not until last night that the remaining six unions agreed. Union leaders representing the paper's 720 employees had advised members to accept the pay cut. But the drivers' union did not agree to take the pay cut until late in the day, and it was expected last night that publication of the newspaper would be temporarily suspended. Yesterday's decision ensures that Bankers Trust will provide credit to the Post for 30 more days, giving Mr Kalikow more time to find a buyer, or an investor, to save the paper. Mr Kalikow says he has been in talks with three unnamed groups of investors. Speculation about their identities yesterday centred on Canadian businessman and newspaper owner Mr Conrad Black, on the New York Daily News, the Post's main tabloid rival, and on Mr Rupert Murdoch, who sold the paper to Mr Kalikow in 1988 for almost Dollars 38m (Pounds 25m).</p>

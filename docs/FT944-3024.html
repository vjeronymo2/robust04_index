			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (5): Income from legacies falls - In a competitive fundraising market, no one is secure The Imperial Cancer Research Fund, one of the most familiar household-name charities, announced in September that it was cutting back on research and jobs because of a fall in income. It came as a powerful warning that, although big charities are tending to fare better than smaller ones, in a highly competitive fundraising market no one is secure. The fund - one of the 10 biggest fundraising charities - will have to operate in 1995-96 on a spending limit of about Pounds 54m, which is Pounds 6.5m less than it had planned. A decline in legacy income made a significant contribution to the problem. The charity relies on legacies for 71 per cent of its voluntary income, and income from this source has fallen by nearly Pounds 2m this year. Legacies have, as Sir Walter Bodmer, the fund's director general, pointed out when announcing the cuts, become a more competitive area of charity fund raising than in the past. They form an immensely important element of total income for those charities that are good at attracting them. Fundratios, a study of 20 leading charities completed last month by the Centre for Interfirm Comparison, shows that legacies typically produce nearly 40 per cent of big charities' voluntary income. This compares with only 3.7 per cent raised from house to house collections. The study also shows, however, that the value of typical legacies has been in decline since 1992. So, according to the report, have corporate donations and response rates to cold direct mailings - the latter down to its lowest level in four years at 1.1 per cent. The research, carried out for the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, contains some better news as well - income raised by local support groups is rising, charities are getting better at recovering tax on covenants, and charity shops are performing well. But the overall picture is one of a difficult time for charity fundraisers. According to the survey, the 20 big charities covered, with a combined annual income of more than Pounds 600m, achieved an overall growth in voluntary income of 5 per cent last year - little more than half 1992's 9 per cent rise. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, charities and the government waited for an explosion in charitable giving that never happened. Innovations like Give As You Earn and Gift Aid were established to promote tax-efficient giving; ministers urged the public to recognise the importance of charity by becoming more regular and generous donors. While some individual causes have been outstandingly successful, giving in general has failed to expand in line with a growing demand for the services of charities. Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the Charities Aid Foundation, says that, in spite of tax incentives, the proportion of the population that supports charity in a planned, systematic way has remained stuck at around 10 per cent for the past six or seven years. Donors are, he says, giving no more in real terms now than at any time over the past five years. Yet if the public wanted low taxes and less state provision, they needed to contribute to voluntary organisations and charities 'by a decimal point more than they presently do.' The CAF - which assists charities with their investments and fund management  -this autumn made its own contribution to stimulating giving with the launch of CharityCard, a debit card which enables users to take advantage of tax-efficient means of making donations. Faced with the evidence of recent years that individual giving is not going to suddenly multiply, however, the CAF is also exploring fresh ideas for raising finance for charity. These include the possibility of attracting investment in charitable organisations from mainstream financial institutions and, perhaps, the eventual creation of a charity bank. There is a need, says Mr Brophy, for investments 'under banking rules' to be made in the not-for-profit sector for use as capital, bridging funds, mortgage funds or venture capital. As well as trying to stimulate individual support for charity, the government has encouraged business to become more active. This has proved largely successful, with corporate community involvement developing into a mainstream and planned business activity. It has not, however, become an extensive new income stream for charities. Corporate donations are tiny compared with other sources of funding, since many companies regard advice, expertise and staff time, rather than money, as their most valuable and appropriate contribution. A report on corporate giving, produced this month by Ashridge management college for the charity Action Research, suggests that, like individuals, companies often fail to support charity in the most tax-efficient manner - use of company trust funds was the least popular method of corporate giving. The survey found that, while national charities were popular with very large companies, small businesses were twice as likely to support local causes as national ones. Medical and health charities were particularly popular with large companies - 95 per cent of businesses with more than 10,000 employees had supported such causes. Other popular areas for corporate support were children and youth, and charities active in the disabilities field. According to the survey, businesses employing fewer than 200 people gave an average of Pounds 2,351 to charity in 1992, while the average value of gifts in kind was Pounds 1,736. Nearly half the companies responding to the survey - 46 per cent - said charities needed to be more businesslike to gain greater corporate support, while only 17 per cent disagreed with the statement. The importance of charities having good communications was stressed by company representatives interviewed for the survey, although the report warns that some business decision makers are 'likely to be put off by over elaborate presentations'. Appreciation of a good personal touch also emerged from the study. When faced with competing causes, says the report, some company decision-makers are likely to say: 'We will support this charity, because I get on well with their fund raiser.'</p>

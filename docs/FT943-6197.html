			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Radio to broacast location finder A broadcasting company which plans to use the latest radio technology to provide precise location information is hoping to take to the airwaves in the UK soon. Differential Corrections, a US-owned company, was the only bidder for a special Radio Authority licence. It bid Pounds 1,000 for the first additional service licence to be advertised by the authority. If successful its service will be carried on spare capacity on the Classic FM signal. The location information is used by everyone from surveyors to transport companies all over the world. The company, which prefers to be known as DCI, has spotted a business opportunity in correcting, for private and commercial subscribers, deliberate distortions in the Global Positioning System. This is a system of 24 satellites maintained by the US Defense Department which allows users to determine their position in the world to an accuracy of about 100 metres. The accuracy level is partly determined by ionospheric delays but also because of errors deliberately added for military security reasons. There was a fear that a system that was too accurate could be used by hostile ballistic missiles to target military bases. Civil use on the back of radio broadcasts is apparently of no use to ballistic missiles. Differential Corrections, which is planning to launch all over Europe, will offer subscribers three different services, providing accuracy to one, five or 10 metres. The company believes the main markets for the services will include vehicle and marine navigation, vehicle location systems and geographic information systems. Mr David Scaman, director of European operations, said yesterday: 'I think there is very large market potential in providing accurate locational and navigational systems.' Subscribers are able to get access to the information using FM receivers about the size of a pager. The information is carried on the radio signal using Radio Data System technology, which allows the radio signal to transmit digital data. DCI, which launched in the US six months ago, operates from 53 radio stations, with a further 50 in the process of being connected. It is also carrying out test transmissions in Norway. The company said that Trimble Navigation, the world's largest manufacturer of GPS receivers, is already incorporating DCI technology into its next generation designs. Once activated the FM data receivers automatically tune to the strongest correction signal, decode the data and give the more precise location to the GPS receivers. The Radio Authority said yesterday it hoped to announce the award of the licence within two months.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Insurer to sell some of its London property NORWICH UNION, the insurance group which is one of the largest property investors in the UK, has put nearly a quarter of its Pounds 1.25bn central London office portfolio up for sale. Mr Nick Price, chief estates manager, said he was not aware that any of the property was damaged by Friday's bomb attack in the City. The attempt to sell results from Norwich Union's desire to reduce its exposure to UK property and channel more of its funds into bonds and overseas property. Norwich Union has an unusually high exposure to UK property, which accounts for Pounds 3.5bn of its Pounds 12bn with-profits life fund. 'We were very overweight in property by comparison with our competitors,' said Mr Price. The group is concerned about the long-term growth prospects of property, particularly in the City, where the oversupply of offices is expected to delay the recovery in rental values for several years. Values of City offices fell 33 per cent last year, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a City broker, predicts further falls of 22 per cent by the end of next year. News of the proposed sale contributed to the depressed state of property shares on Friday. Analysts viewed the decision as further evidence of the pressures facing the property sector, which is suffering from oversupply, falling rental values and high borrowings. Norwich Union is also disposing of shopping centres in Birmingham, and in Enfield and Barnet in London. The sales, which are on the point of completion, are expected to raise Pounds 80m.</p>

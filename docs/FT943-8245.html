			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Book Review: Systems check on planet earth VITAL SIGNS 1994-95 By Worldwatch Institute Earthscan Publications Pounds 10.95, 164 pages Any journalist covering the environment quickly discovers two things: it brings a huge mail bag, but most of the information it contains is unreliable. Figures on the health of the planet are now so manipulated by lobby groups that it has become virtually impossible to finger the truth with any certainty. Worse still, it is now acceptable for governments to make environmental policy on the so-called 'precautionary principle', which means assuming the worst. This approach is said to be prudent, but it is little more than a surrender to ignorance, which could be expensive and dangerous. All of which makes any attempt to illuminate the subject in a calm and considered way most welcome. Vital Signs, compiled by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, is one of the few publications which can claim to fit that category. This is the third edition of what has the makings of an important book of reference, detailing in unemotional terms many key planetary indicators: the quality of the air, production of food, energy consumption, people's life expectancy, trends in plant and animal life, and so on. When put together, they paint a very interesting picture - though not one from which you could draw obvious conclusions. There is a lot of bad news. The world grain harvest seems to be in long-term decline, the air is getting dirtier, forests are shrinking, bird species are down, and the number of pesticide-resistant insects is gaining (rather alarmingly: 520 insects and mites are now wholly immune). But if you prefer the good news, car production has fallen during the recent recession while the number of bicycles has risen; meat output is keeping pace with demand; the growth rate of the world population seems to have peaked; cigarette consumption is down sharply and life expectancy up. Your assessment of the meaning of all this rather depends on what you think is important. There is a whole category of indicators which can be read either way. What do you make of the fact that fertiliser use is falling? It peaked in the late 1980s, and is now back at levels last seen in the mid-1970s. This is obviously why grain output is falling too, though many people must welcome the trend back to natural farming methods. (The whole world could easily be fed, incidentally, if global grain yields were as high as the UK's) Another knotty one: the number of fish caught has levelled out, presumably because fish are not reproducing fast enough. But fish farming is soaring. Should we welcome a shift away from the ocean to artificial methods, whatever their drawbacks, if that is a way of taking the pressure off natural stocks? Paper production is rising, and so, therefore, is logging. Yet more paper than ever is being recycled, so the outlook is not all bad. In the energy sector, source of so much environmental aggravation, oil production is flat and coal is declining. The energy sources on the rise are natural gas, renewables like solar, wind and, more controversially, nuclear power, which is getting a big boost in the Far East. If the quality of the atmosphere is your concern, these are all encouraging trends. Yet many people would rather see coal replacing nuclear because they can understand its risks better. What the book brings out especially well is the complexity of the world's natural systems - something that gets lost too easily in the heat of environmental debate. Even though the authors only catalogue 50 trends, that is quite enough to suggest the terrain within which rational discussion might take place. Take just one issue: global warming. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, are still rising. But annual emissions are falling slightly, which means that the rate of increase in concentrations is flattening out. The global average temperature was actually lower at the beginning of this year than in 1991. These may be short-lived trends which could easily be reversed as the world economy pulls out of recession. On the other hand, the scope for cleaning up dirty industries in former communist countries is enormous, and the trend towards cleaner energy sources has already been noted. The Worldwatch Institute's researchers go to some lengths to be objective, and their commentaries are, on the whole, admirably balanced. Nonetheless, you wonder why the book includes trends of little immediate relevance, such as the level of gold production, the incidence of Aids, world defence spending and UN peacekeeping activity, other than to imply that these are somehow bad for the environment. The environment debate is going to make more headway if participants stop dragging in other campaigning issues simply to raise the emotional heat. It would be more helpful if future editions carried indicators on the health of the oceans, the availability of safe drinking water, trends in desertification, and numbers on reforestation to balance the bad news on felling. Also useful would be indications of the amount of land lost to quarrying which, in its way, is much more destructive and irreversible than forestry. In fact a shift from irreplaceable minerals to replaceable trees in construction and manufacturing would be a rather healthy development. You could also criticise the book for being too sweeping: it scarcely matters that global population growth is easing if the trend is still remorselessly upwards in the poorest countries. But quite enough is already written about sectoral or regional problems. What Vital Signs can do is help create a global consciousness about environmental issues. Many of them know no boundaries, and require broader solutions than local agitators can secure.</p>

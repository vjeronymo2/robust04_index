			<p>BFN     [Text] As counting continues in the country's first  multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections, unofficial  results from various parts of the country show that the United  Democratic Front, UDF, has made significant gains, especially in  the southern region. Our correspondents covering the elections  say that the Alliance for Democracy, AFORD, have taken most of  the seats in the northern region but has failed badly in the  central and southern region.    The correspondents say several ministers in the current  cabinet have lost their parliamentary seats. These include the  minister of justice and attorney general, Honorable Lovemore  Munlo; the minister of forestry and natural resources, Hon.  Mfunjo Mwanjasi Mwakikunga; the minister of energy and mining,  Hon. Michael Mlambala; the vice president of the Malawi Congress  Party, MCP, Hon. Bwanda Chakuamba; the minister at large, Hon.  Sonnex Chitsonga; and the minister of labor, Hon. William Binali.</p>

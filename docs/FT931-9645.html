			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Antwerp at its apogee - Patricia Morison finds many Flemish masterpieces but little information An extraordinarily prolific outpouring of artistic talent is the theme of From Bruegel to Rubens: The Antwerp School of Painting from 1550 to 1650, at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Inevitably, we think of those generations in terms of the great foursome, Bruegel, Rubens, Van Dyck and Jordaens. Yet the aim of this exhibition is to shed light on the other talents, their pupils, friends, and competitors. With 150 paintings by no less than 79 Antwerp masters, it offers an ample tour d'horizon of an artistic centre which at that time enjoyed a reputation which can only be compared with the dominance of Paris in the 19th century. However, the show which should have been the perfect curtain-raiser to Antwerpen '93, the festival marking Antwerp's time as cultural capital of Europe, sells itself short. Previously the exhibition was in Cologne where, by all reports, it looked a far better thing than it does in the downstairs galleries of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Here, paintings are hung on a horrible system of steel braces. Flanders should really look to her greatest treasure. The time must surely be near for a major renovation of a gallery which houses one of the world's most evocative collections of paintings. Time and cash were perhaps not sufficient to allow redecoration ahead of the Festival. But what about some elementary housekeeping? Grass sprouting from the steps, torn and dirty curtains in gallery windows, a blown light-bulb casting shadow on a picture - those are easy enough defects to put right. A narrow strip of carpet running around the edge of the galleries allows the warders to sing out the moment anyone steps forward. It also has the depressing effect of making visitors patrol it as if it was a cat-walk. The paintings are hung in a way intended to show the sheer breadth of types of painting for which Antwerp's artists were famed. The true centre of gravity of the show is post-1600, by which time subjects which were novelties to artists 50 years earlier had reached a wonderful pitch of expertise. The mid-16th century saw Antwerp at the apogee of her wealth and status, and then enter into the long decline after the Spanish closed the Scheldt. Yet this made no difference to Antwerp's fame as an exporter of paintings - and also of artists. It is impossible to avoid speaking about 'factories' and 'production lines' in an epoch in which dealers sent Antwerp middlemen orders for paintings by the hundred. From Naples and Paris to Peru, demand was unquenchable for the wide skills of the Antwerp workshops. History painting, landscapes, battle-scenes, scenes of peasant life, shipwrecks, still-lives, paintings to record art-collections; the selection of works, many from private collections, ought to convey the right message about the intense specialisation of artists in this period. Unfortunately, the organisers of the exhibition appear to have wanted only to commune with fellow-specialists in Flemish art. The result is an inexcusable shortage of information about anything lay visitors might want to know. Nothing is said about the career of individual artists, and even their dates do not appear on the labels. There is nothing about the political and social background. If only these things could be easily followed up in the catalogue, it would be different; however, the logic behind this heavy volume is unfathomable. It is sad to have so many grumbles about the presentation of this rare hors d'oeuvre to Antwerpen '93. And yet, without question it is an achievement to have brought together so many paintings of singular beauty, rarity, and fascination. Of course, there are many unfamiliar artists to discover. Take Pieter Van Mol, an obscure contemporary of Van Dyck who settled permanently to Paris. His 'Descent from the Cross' from Rheims is a remarkable composition in which Christ's body, painted with painful realism, is held upright in the centre of the canvas by the holy mourners. Theodor Van Thulden, an important member of Rubens's 'factory', also moved for a while to Paris but later went back to Antwerp. His 'Flanders, Brabant, and Hainault Venerating the Virgin and Child' of 1650, is a magnificently graceful exercise in political flattery. The provinces, represented as well-dressed ladies, render up their prayers. Gold coins tumble down, the benefits of the wise governance of Catholic Spain. Every visitor will find paintings they particularly warm too - assuming they resist the pressure of the catwalk to pace along by, rather than looking with care. But the question needs always to be remembered, what are we looking at, a master or a team-effort? So often one skilled hand would add the animals to a landscape, another the flowers in a devotional painting. Hieronymus Francken painted the portrait of a lady at the virginals; his less-skilled nephew filled in the dancing company. As ever, argument rages over whether such a scene paints a moral. It could be a merry inn where Joachim Beuckelaer's cooks are preparing a hugely carnivorous dinner. Or is it a brothel? Among the loans from an impressive number of major collections one of the most familiar masterpieces is Van Dyck's 'Portrait of Isabella Brant' from Washington. From the Hermitage come two wonderfully harmonious paintings by Rubens and Jordaens. The first is Rubens's scene of a group of peasants on the edge of a spinney, who languidly make love and listen to the sound of a flute. The landscape is a sunny one, lit spectacularly by a double rainbow. The Hermitage's second superb loan is Jordaens's earliest homage to his family. It was painted in 1615, the year he was admitted as a member of the painters' Guild of St Luke, so perhaps that over-worked phrase could be used, a rite de passage. The family group clusters almost oppressively close around the table. On the women's faces we read maternal love and pious resignation, for above their heads play three golden-haired angels, the infants who had not lived. Jordaens himself cuts a debonair figure, playing the lute. However, he is seated so close to the only other adult male, his father, that he is surely making a statement that the Jordaens family assets are safe in his talented hands.</p>

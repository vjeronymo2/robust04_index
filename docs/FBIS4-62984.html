			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Latvian Foreign Minister Egils Levits, who  today returned from Brussels, reported that Latvia, Lithuania,  and Estonia support the idea of a stability pact, which they  regard as an important means of promoting the security of  Europe. Levits accentuated some so far unresolved or unclear  issues, namely the right of countries involved in the stability  pact to choose for themselves the themes for discussion at  regional round-table talks, the need to determine that  judicially existing borders are accepted, not generally existing  borders, as well as to give clarity to the concept of minorities  as it relates to the situation in the Baltic countries.</p>

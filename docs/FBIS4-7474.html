			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Evgeniy Ekov, secretary of the Internal </F> Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of Macedonian  Societies, by Svetlana Tikhova; place and date not given:  "Revolutionary Terror Is Part of History"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tikhova] Do great  differences exist between the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Union of Macedonian Societies [VMRO-SMD] and the  VMRO-Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity [DPMNE]?    [Ekov] From the historical point of view, the name is the  same. We both claim that we have legitimately inherited it.  Some of the tasks that our organization and [VMRO-DPMNE leader]  Ljupco Georgievski's organization have set for themselves are  the same, such as the democratization of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  and the struggle for its final recognition. Nevertheless, these  seem to be the only things that we have in common.  Unfortunately, despite its name, the DPMNE has betrayed the  principle on which the VMRO has always based itself and  developed. I mean the defense of the Bulgarian spirit in  Macedonia. An ideology has been adopted embodying a regime of  terror and all the repressive methods of the Macedonian state,  along with the theory of an independently existing Macedonian  nation. Thus, Macedonian nationalism, partly rejecting the  outdated form of the Communist Party, is trying to assume some  kind of democratic image. Naturally, this was not accepted by  part of the DPMNE, which was followed by an inevitable split.  Those who thought differently organized a new VMRO -- the  Fatherland Party [Tatkovinska Partiya], led by Dimitar  Crnomarov, former deputy chairman of DPMNE, who was expelled for  "pro-Bulgarian tendencies." Unfortunately, these are unpleasant  facts that affect our national interests. However, they should  be known so that the Bulgarian public may be acquainted with the  biased and hostile feelings prevailing among the ruling forces  in the Republic of Macedonia.    [Tikhova] In that case, what kind of Macedonia should be  established and by what means?    [Ekov] It should be an independent, sovereign, and  democratic Macedonia, based on legal, political means.    [Tikhova] Do you mean Vardar Macedonia, or all three parts?    [Ekov] We are talking about Vardar Macedonia. The truth is  that after 1934, when the VMRO, which was an underground  organization at the time, and the legal organizations were also  dissolved, the slogan for an independent Macedonia within its  geographical borders was raised. Then came World War II. The  Paris system of peace accords actually buried the idea of a  "geographic" Macedonia. To talk about the creation of a new,  united Macedonia today means causing an explosion in the  Balkans. We have a typical example of how borders are being  shifted here. In our opinion, the Macedonian problem, whose  crucial point is related to the fate, the rights, and freedoms  of the Bulgarian population in Vardar and Aegean Macedonia,  should be decided by opening the borders rather than shifting  them. If this should appear as utopia today, it could become  reality in the future. Let us recall that many similar  conflicts have existed in Western Europe, but see how the  problem between Germany and France related to the no less  controversial territories of Alsace and Lorraine was resolved.  There is no reason to believe that different kinds of people  live in the Balkans, people who are incapable of settling their  conflicts in the same manner.    [Tikhova] Nevertheless, the Macedonian problem also affects  Albania.    [Ekov] Yes, you are talking about Mala Prespa, Korchansko,  and Golo Brdo.... We went to Albania for the first time in July  1993. I shall never forget what I experienced during my  meetings with the people there. The people could not believe  that Bulgaria had remembered them. Most of them identify  themselves as Bulgarians, although I must admit that some of  them behave like Albanians, while others try to appear as  Macedonians.    [Tikhova] Nevertheless, how did we reach a situation in  which it is possible to talk about Bulgarians in Albania?    [Ekov] Albania has not recognized a Bulgarian minority, but  it is tolerant toward activities aimed at cultivating the  Bulgarian spirit of self-preservation among individual members  of our population in Albania. We have no claims and do not  intend to raise any claims toward the Republic of Albania for  recognizing the Bulgarian minority. In our view, the solution  of the problem should be sought in terms of guaranteeing  individual rights.    [Tikhova] The organization whose successors you are did not  particularly respect the sanctity of human life. Does the  historical memory of the VMRO bear some marks of guilt?    [Ekov] If anything is on our conscience, it may be the  unnecessary fratricidal conflicts during some periods of our  organization's existence. However, such deadly conflicts were  inspired from the outside. It is impossible to react with  traditional methods when one is deprived of all real  opportunities whatsoever to express his free will, and when one  is subject to physical violence and brutality. The  revolutionary terror exerted by the organization was always a  reaction to the violence used first in the Turkish Empire and  later on in Greece and Serbia against the Bulgarian population.  Whenever the VMRO had the opportunity to do so, it became a  legal organization. World War I gave us the opportunity for the  legal establishment of a party defending the interests of the  Bulgarian population both in the Vardar part and in the Aegean  region. Hence, the choice of our methods was not prompted by  the organization, but was rather imposed by external  circumstances. [passage omitted]    [Tikhova] Is it true that Mr. Tatarchev is introducing a  split in the ranks of the VMRO?    [Ekov] I doubt it, because Mr. Tatarchev has repeatedly  proved to be in sympathy with the goals and tasks of the VMRO,  as well as with the practical activities of the organization.  He is the descendant of a family that has given much to the  organization.    [Tikhova] Generally speaking, there can be no question of a  split within the VMRO-SMD?    [Ekov] I think that we have learned from the numerous splits  of the past, and we are the only organization that has not split  today.    [Tikhova] How could you resist the currently escalating  activities of the Ilinden United Macedonian Organization [OMO]    [Ekov] In our opinion, we have always resisted it through  our active propaganda work on a local scale and by our  persistent demands that the official Bulgarian institutions  should do their duty in preventing subversive activities  directed against the state. Many people would like to see us  involved in a conflict, but it has already become evident that  such things belong to the past. As a matter of fact, OMO has  long since been a fiction, solely supported by the interests of  the mass media.</p>

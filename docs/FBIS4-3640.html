			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The conclusion of the  report issued by the British House of Commons runs totally  counter to its professed desire to develop Sino-British  relations, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said  here today.    At the weekly press conference here this afternoon, Wu made  the statement when asked to comment on a lengthy report on  Sino-British relations issued on April 13 by the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the British House of Commons.    In disregard of the fact, Wu noted, this report confuses the  right and wrong and insists on supporting the erroneous policy  of the British Government on the issue of Hong Kong and  supporting its continued confrontation with China, thus fully  revealing the true intention of the British side to prolong its  colonial influence in Hong Kong by creating chaos there.    Wu stressed that Hong Kong will return to the motherland,  which no force whatsoever can stop.    The Chinese Government has the resolve and the capability to  resume exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled,  pursuing "One Country, Two Systems", implementing the basic law  and maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong  Kong, Wu said.    Wu pointed out that the report, while recognizing China's  economic success and the importance of its international role,  makes irresponsible remarks about China's internal affairs and  even made an attempt to meddle in them.    "We would like to remind the authors of this report that one  has to have some sense of history and reality," said Wu, adding  that today's China is no longer what it used to be when it was  "bullied and lorded over at will."    He went on to say that people can "never forget" the role  Britain played on the issue of Tibet and can only hope it will  "draw lessons" from history and adopt a "prudent attitude."    Any attempt to create "Two Chinas" or "One China, One  Taiwan"  runs counter to the principles governing the establishment of  the diplomatics relations between China and Britain and  therefore "will meet our firm opposition," the spokesman said.</p>

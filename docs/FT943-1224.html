			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (5): Pragmatic approach to defeat - Case study Norwich Union is a financial services group that decided to move into private healthcare in 1990. Norwich Union Healthcare (NUH) started life with 25 staff and a business plan aimed at creating the third-largest private healthcare company in the UK. With an urgent need to get relevant systems functioning, NUH decided to turn to an outside supplier. The existing Norwich Union organisation possessed formidable computing skills, but NUH wanted to buy in expertise in the specific area of private healthcare. It turned to Electronic Data Systems (EDS) to recruit key knowledge. EDS is the US company that made its name in outsourcing before the term had been invented. Across the Atlantic, healthcare had been a staple of its business. NUH called in EDS to supply a bag of healthcare programs. Mike North joined NUH as IT manager in April 1992. His immediate task was to oversee the transfer of the IT function back to the organisation, while the FM provider relinquished responsibility. Why did the contract enjoy such a brief life? 'We employed EDS to get the business off the ground,' says North. 'But we always said we'd renew the contract each year.' This rigorous scrutiny may have made life insecure for the external supplier, but it allowed the company's own IT experts to sell their skills. 'EDS had to compete against the in-house resources. The internal competition proved cheaper.' EDS had given NUH a vital kick-start. It had provided the security and knowledge to get the business working, according to North. But NUH was smart enough not to become reliant on one outside contractor. When the internal management services division won a review in December 1991, the third party had to hand over the reins of power. North admits that the return of IT operations to the core company was not totally trouble-free. 'We use a job-scheduling language, a program whose purpose is to tell the computer when to run other programs. EDS don't run this language. So all of that system had to be rewritten and tested.' Nevertheless, North praises EDS for their pragmatic approach to defeat at the hands of the customer's IT experts. 'They recognised that their job was essentially a short-term one.' What really drove NUH to abandon reliance on an outside source? Money is the key. 'We could do it cheaper in-house, and it was a better long-term investment in terms of the commitment of the IT staff.' North discloses an important drawback to outsourcing: 'We get a better commitment from people to the company when they're with the company.' He is not hostile to outsourcing but he believes that it is best used under particular circumstances. 'If you've got a skills shortage, then this is a good opportunity to get the expense of running IT out of your hair.' As things stand, NUH now employs more than 500 staff, with an annual IT budget of Pounds 1.3m. It can lay claim to 7 per cent of the total private medical insurance market, with 528,000 customers. North adds; 'I wouldn't rule out going back to EDS, if they came up with a good business solution.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "An Accidental Error or a </F> Logical Tragedy?"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The first impression from the  tragedy in the Iraqi skies was: An impossible, tragic mistake  has occurred. The situation, however, gives rise to a number of  legitimate questions. Answers to them may not be the most  pleasant for the U.S. military establishment.    First, about the pilots' professional level. Judging by  their initial testimony, they mistook U.S.-made UH-60 Blackhawk  helicopters for Iraqi Soviet-built Mi-8's. Indeed, outwardly  they bear a remote resemblance, but with the slightest doubts,  were the pilots not supposed to fly around what they saw as  suspicious objects and make sure what it was, friend or foe?  Moreover, were they not supposed to activate their Friend or  Foe identification system? If none of this was done, the  logical conclusion is: The fighters used the very first  opportunity to show the Iraqis who is master in their airspace.    The second question and the answer to it bears on the  performance characteristics of U.S. combat aviation. If the  F-15 pilots used the interrogator after all, did they therefore  receive no confirmation that the targets were not friendly? In  addition, as Lieutenant General Richard Keller, chief of staff  of the U.S. Command Europe -- responsible for the military part  of operation Provide Comfort-2 -- who was summoned to the  Pentagon explained, at the time of the incident airspace to the  north of the 36th parallel was monitored by AWACS aircraft.  Their onboard radars and computers are designed precisely to  detect and track air targets and guide the interceptors onto  them. In other words, one cannot rule out a malfunction in the  operation of these "super modern arms and equipment systems"  which are so zealously promoted by the Americans. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Welcome for Paramount legislation Mr Michael Heseltine's statement in the Commons yesterday may have come too late for the employees of Michael Mayes, the textile manufacturer based in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Although emergency legislation will apply from this morning, Mr Lindsay Denney, the receiver from accountants Touche Ross, warned late last night that the company was already being wound down and that there was no buyer in the wings. He said he had not yet made a final decision, but he expected to make an announcement to the company's 140 staff by lunchtime today. However, the insolvency profession in general welcomed the proposed legislation. Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at Price Waterhouse and president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, said: 'We're very pleased. This puts the law back to what is was before 1986. This is excellent news.' Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'This is good news for jobs, and for those concerned with the capacity of UK commerce and industry. '(It) gives back to administrators the crucial ability to manage companies back into solvency.' The amendment came after two weeks' intensive lobbying from the profession. Mr Denney had met Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and mentioned his case, while the society held meetings with Whitehall officials and submitted a report to Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs. For some, the legislation was already too late. Mr Steve Hill, an insolvency partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said that since the decision, he had had to lay off 12 employees at a small building company and six at a maggot farm. There have been relatively few such cases in the two weeks since the Paramount ruling in the court of appeal. Mr Homan said he believed that banks may have held back from calling in receivers since the judgment in order to wait for clarification. Mr Heseltine's statement offers no relief to companies already in receivership or administration, to which the Paramount ruling appears to apply. Mr Homan warned that this might lead to a freeze on future payments to creditors in many companies while potential additional employment costs were quantified. The administrators of Paramount are likely to appeal their case to the House of Lords, while other insolvency professionals are considering seeking legal advice on their own cases. However, one leading practitioner said: 'I think the urgency has gone out of this. Now it is each practitioner for himself.' Another practitioner warned that while the law would remove the burden of additional employment obligations from receivers and administrators, these costs remained in place for purchases of insolvent businesses under the transfer of undertakings law.</p>

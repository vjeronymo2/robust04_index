			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Mexico's poll The elections in Mexico this Sunday could prove a watershed on its journey towards democracy. They certainly need to be. Fortunately, the Mexican government has put in place conditions that should allow the presidential, congressional and gubernatorial elections to be the fairest in the country's history. This is faint praise. Yet if the new electoral rules are followed, the chances of a reasonably fair election are high. The next government's international credibility hangs on that achievement; so does its ability effectively to govern the country. It took a severe political crisis - the peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and the assassination of the ruling party's first presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio - for President Carlos Salinas to agree to the electoral reforms. But reluctant reform is better than the alternative of repression. Mr Salinas chose wisely. The rules for the election day include, for the first time, an independent electoral commission. Scrutiny of the election will be unprecedented: thousands of domestic and international observers will be in place, as will a more independent press. Credible measures have also been taken to ensure a secret ballot, and to prevent double voting and ballot stuffing - though, particularly in the countryside, ruling party chiefs still wield considerable power. It remains to be seen whether the rural vote will be free and fair. The rapid publication of several quick counts by independent agencies and the release of an official preliminary count after 15 per cent of the votes has been counted should sharply reduce the possibilities for systematic fraud. For all that, the playing field has not been levelled completely between the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the opposition. The most egregious inequality is in campaign finances. The limit on spending by any one party on the presidential election is Dollars 40m. Even that is a lot of money for the opposition, but the limit on spending for the presidential and congressional elections together is Dollars 275m. There is also evidence that businessmen are contributing to the campaign without the finance going through the PRI's balance sheet. Nor has election coverage of the campaign by the press and television been impartial. Certainly, the media have been more even-handed than in the past, but they had a lot of ground to make up. The PRI still gets more and better publicity than its opponents. These flaws should not fatally undermine the credibility of the election, provided everyone plays by the rules on Sunday. Sham elections in the past have inevitably created huge cynicism about the electoral process; another dose of cynicism is the last thing Mexico needs at this time.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo recovery hopes bring back memories - Prospects for Japanese equities Brisk sales of the Kabushiki Shimbun, one of Japan's financial tabloids catering to retail investors; a rally in speculative favourites such as ball-bearing companies or sewing machine makers; and the sharp rise in daily market volumes. In Tokyo's equity market, this combination has brought back memories of the boom days in the late 1980s. The sudden realisation that the economy and corporate earnings may be in for a recovery has prompted a rally which, many Japanese brokers hope, will pull the Tokyo market out of its four-year slump. 'The whole market is looking like a cyclical stock,' says Mr Jeff Bahrenburg, a strategist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. Corporate profits were better than expected for the past year - down 16 per cent before tax rather than the forecast 25 per cent - and a flow of data suggests that the economy has stopped falling, at least. The catalyst for the recent rally has been active buying by foreign institutions, which have been shifting funds to Tokyo due to the weakness in global stock and bond markets. While net buying has been unable to better the levels earlier this year, when overseas investors bought record amounts of Japanese shares, the rise in share prices has triggered further buying by domestic investors, eager not to be left behind. The strong rise, says Mr Bahrenburg, indicates that 'people have come to grips with the potential growth'. Although higher share prices have pushed up the price to earnings ratio for the Nikkei to over 100, the figure anticipates a firm rise in profits over a two- to three-year span. On conservative estimates, he says earnings for the corporate sector could grow by 152 per cent in the next five years, against real economic of 2.7 per cent. This predicates a 42 per cent potential rise in the Nikkei, the bulk of it coming over two to three years. However, unlike the 'bubble' era in the 1980s, when every investor participated in frenzied buying, many domestic institutions remain unconvinced of a sustainable rally. While some, not wanting to be left out of the rally have cautiously joined in, many fund managers do not believe that they should be buying stocks actively at current levels. Mr Yasuhiko Jinza, stock investment manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest institutional investor, regards current price levels as an 'overshoot'. 'Once the foreign buying stops, the optimism is likely to fade,' he says, adding that Japanese stocks will not look attractive unless the Nikkei index falls below the 20,000 level. Japan's life insurance companies are smarting from the low return on assets, mainly due to the buying of low-yielding equities in the late 1980s. The leading 27 life insurers are looking at an average 4.3 per cent on their Y148,000bn of assets, lower than the 4.96 per cent needed to cover payouts to policy holders. 'I know people are talking about us coming back into the market, but it's just not going to happen,' says Mr Jinza. With rising interest rates in the US threatening liquidity inflow, foreign buying is expected to start falling. The question many market participants are now asking is where share prices will go from here. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, says that individual investors, who have been absent for the past few years, could be wooed away from low-yielding fixed interest investments and take the place of overseas fund managers. Evidence that this is already happening can be seen in the rally of retail market favourites, slightly low quality, speculative stocks such as Oki Electric and Towa Real Estate. A recent stock market survey indicated that the percentage of individual investors holding equities earlier this year rose by 2.8 points to 23.7 per cent, the first rise in five years. Meanwhile an additional concern for investors is the large outstanding arbitrage position. According to the Tokyo stock exchange, long arbitrage positions as of last Monday totalled Y1.46bn, slightly lower than the record high Y1.49bn in April 1992. A build up of arbitrage balance puts share prices in a vulnerable position against negative news once trading volumes start to fall. For the next few months, says Mr Alexander Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, there are two possible scenarios. Individuals could pile in, sending the Nikkei up into the 23,000-24,000 range, followed by a correction; or small lot buying by domestic investors could push prices gradually forward. During the summer, when trade talks between the US and the Group of Seven summit talks are scheduled to be held, volatility in the yen could cause fluctuations in the stock market. The attractiveness of Japanese shares for overseas investors could change in the face of weakness or strength in other leading stock markets. Mr James at James Capel believes that a correction is likely during the summer months, but sees the downside of the market to be around 20,000. He expects that the spate of interim earnings estimates and previews will bring some cheer into the market, and forecasts the Nikkei around the 21,000 level at the end of September.</p>

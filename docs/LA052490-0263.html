Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GARBO ESTATE SETTLES BOOK SUIT  </P> <P> Greta Garbo's estate said Wednesday that it had settled a suit with publishers  Simon &amp; Schuster over whether a controversial book about the late movie  star is fact or fiction.  </P> <P> The suit, filed Friday, alleged that "Garbo: Her Story", by Antoni Gronowicz,  is a work of fiction and that it should not be touted as a factual biography of  the Swedish-born actress, who died last month in New York.  </P> <P> Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.  </P> <P> The lawsuit claimed that Simon &amp; Schuster falsely advertised that Garbo  contributed to the book when in fact the reclusive actress consistently denied  any involvement with it.  </P> <P> Simon &amp; Schuster has said the book contains frank comments from Garbo about  her lovers, including Mauritz Stiller, the director who discovered her.  </P></p>

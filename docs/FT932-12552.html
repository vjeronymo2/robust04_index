			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / IoD looks back in anger at recession THE PATIENT, said Lord Young of Graffham, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, 'is still in intensive care. We cannot afford any sudden shocks'. His sober diagnosis yesterday of the fragile state of the economy found plenty of sympathisers at the 44th annual convention of the Institute of Directors in London. Amid the mounting evidence this week of economic recovery - from the government, the Confederation of British Industry and the IoD itself - there is no sense of euphoria in the business community. There is tangible relief and a little excitement but the official declaration that the recession is over has been swallowed with a large dose of caution. After all, it was one long year ago that the newly elected prime minister appeared before the same audience to claim that economic recovery was under way and that Britain was on the brink of a new era of prosperity. He was repeating the message again last week. Most of the 2,000 IoD delegates gathered at the Royal Albert Hall appeared to believe that the worst was over. But as Mr Roger Goodwin, a Manchester hardware supplier, put it: 'Quite a lot of people are talking up the economy on the flimsiest of direct evidence.' The IoD is certain that the recent, slow improvement in business confidence is now being reflected in the statistics which really count - volumes, profits and orders. But as Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said before yesterday's convention: 'We have had recessions and recoveries before but we have never capitalised on our experience. The benefits have always been squandered. This time, we must grab the opportunity to build a sustained, long-lasting recovery'. Before turning to the economic challenges ahead, there were a few scores to be settled. The stunned satisfaction which followed Mr John Major's surprise election victory had given way to disenchantment, even ridicule. The 'party for business' had let business down with its macro-economic mismanagement and it would not be allowed to forget it. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll Group, the food retailer, said that the Tories had twice made fundamental economic errors - 'too strong a foot on the accelerator in the latter part of the 1980s, too savage a foot on the brakes in the early 1990s'. Beyond the brake and accelerator, he said, there was the question of steering. The slogans of free enterprise and the free market, Sir Alistair continued, had been used since the mid 1980s as an excuse for the government's failure to think through fundamental questions of economic and industrial policy. A government which appeared to be 'in the grip of events' had to create broad policy outlines as part of a 'vision of 21st-century Britain'. Sir Alistair warned that the period of convalescence for business carried with it many risks and he called on companies and banks to borrow and lend sensibly, and to devise new methods of finance offering more stable funding. Mr Morgan was also short on compliments. If recovery was finally under way, it was 'more or less over the dead bodies of Bank of England and Treasury officials' who had battled to keep Britain within the exchange rate mechanism and consistently given bad advice to their political masters. The result was that successive governments had debauched the British currency, while manufacturing had been seriously damaged by the boom-bust cycle. Attacking excess 'political discretion' in management of the economy, he called for a tough, independent Bank of England to oversee a 'sound money' policy. But not everyone in government was cast as the villain. Mr Morgan likened Britain to a football team which had been badly run, whose finances were a disaster, whose players had talent but who lacked skills. Now, however, it had a coach with a distinguished playing career. His name was 'Hezza' and, together, Team UK could win. The IoD delegates enjoyed the joke. They were less confident about the year ahead.</p>

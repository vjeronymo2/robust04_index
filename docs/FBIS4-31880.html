			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 14 (CTK) -- "Romania could occupy the  place of a fully-fledged partner in the Central European  Initiative (CEI)," Czech Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde said  today at a meeting with Adrian Nastase, Romanian Assembly of  Deputies speaker, who began a four-day visit to the Czech  Republic on June 12.    Every democratic state as well as a state striving genuinely  to build a democratic system had its place in the CEI, Uhde  said. He pointed out, however, that "we seek to prevent the CEI  from forming firm structures or becoming a "small Europe" within  a "great Europe."    Nastase described Uhde's remarks as an exceptionally  positive  comment. He said his statements took into consideration certain  realities in Central Europe and at the same time corresponded to  joint interests of the Czech Republic and Romania which are  orientated towards integration into European structures and not  the "institutionalisation of antechambers."    Uhde stressed that since the collapse of the communist  systems in Central and Eastern Europe, no problems had arisen  which would hamper Czech-Romanian relations. He pointed to the  process of ratification of a Czech-Romanian agreement on the  prevention of double taxation, which is currently underway, and  to an agreement on a free-trade zone which is almost ready to be  signed. The conclusion of a basic Czech-Romanian treaty of  friendly relations and cooperation can also be expected soon,  Uhde said.    Uhde and Nastase agreed to support cooperation between the  two countries' parliaments and, especially, cooperation between  the parliaments' Economy and Foreign Affairs Committees. They  also supported the exchange of visits by state representatives  and information on building the legislation and economic reform  in both countries.</p>

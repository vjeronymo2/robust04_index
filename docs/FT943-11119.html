			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up FUND LAUNCHES Two new emerging market funds have been announced in the past few days. Credit Lyonnais Securities is planning to launch a Dollars 50m fund to invest in the Indian communications industries. It will be managed by Schroder Investment Management and will invest mainly in Indian securities through a domestic fund to be administered by Indbank Merchant Banking Services. The other fund is to be launched by Fleming Investment Management to invest in newly privatised Russian companies. It also has a Dollars 50m target and will be advised by Brunswick Investment. POLAND The government has decided to allow foreign investors to buy shares in all publicly traded companies without seeking permits from any government agencies. The new regulations will come into force within 10 to 14 days. Under the present regulations, dating from 1991, foreigners wishing to invest in Polish publicly traded companies in industries considered strategic had to get special permits from the privatisation ministry. VIETNAM Vietnam hopes to grant US, European and Asian banks licences to set up branches this year, a senior State Bank official is reported as saying. Vietnam is keen to attract more US investment and develop trade. Bankers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City expected US banks, Bank of America and Citibank, together with Deutsche Bank, Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and ING of the Netherlands as leading candidates. JORDAN Barings has come out with a positive report on the financial markets in Amman, saying that they will benefit from peace with Israel. Baring also says that Amman shares are currently trading around 17 times 1994 earnings, and at about 13 times if 'distorting factors' are excluded. Further liberalisation of the financial infrastructure is planned and Jordan's authorities are committed to encouraging foreign investment, they add. Baring's analysts are looking for Jordan's economy to grow by 6 per cent in 1994 and by 7 per cent in 1995. MOLDOVA The Moldovan government formally launched its privatisation programme last week, announcing a nationwide auction to sell shares in 11 state companies for vouchers distributed last year. Forty-seven computerised centres throughout Moldova opened to ease the process of obtaining shares in state companies liable be privatised. According to the government programme, about 1,600 state companies, or 34 per cent of all state property in Moldova, should be privatised for vouchers by September 1995. Vouchers have already been distributed to 90 per cent of Moldovan citizens. HUNGARY The country's shares-for-compensation coupon programme should be completed by the end of 1995, the government announced last week. So far, compensation coupons with a nominal value of over Ft108bn have been issued to more than 1m people. Of that number, less than Ft40bn has been swapped for shares, according to the Compensation Office. Emerging markets coverage appears daily on the World Stock Markets page</p>

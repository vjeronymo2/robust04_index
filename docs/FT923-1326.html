			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Credit Lyonnais profits fall in wake of provisions CREDIT Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank which has come under criticism for its aggressive expansion strategy and loans policy, suffered a sharp fall in net profits in the first half of 1992 following a steep increase in provisions. The collapse in net profits - from FFr1.6bn to FFr119m (Pounds 13.2m) - triggered a profits warning from Thomson-CSF, the French electronics group which is a significant minority shareholder in the bank. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson-CSF, warned that the company would not meet its profits forecast for this year because of the shortfall from Credit Lyonnais. Thomson-CSF, which three years ago acquired its 15.5 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais in return for ceding control of Altus, its old financial subsidiary, produced net profits of FFr2.35bn last year. The shares of both Credit Lyonnais and Thomson-CSF were suspended yesterday only to fall sharply when they resumed trading. Credit Lyonnais' shares ended the day FFr42 down at FFr510 and Thomson-CSF's shares slipped by FFr12 to FFr135.9. This will be the second successive year of high provisions for Credit Lyonnais. It raised provisions 85.6 per cent to FFr6.3bn in the first half of this year and warned it would be forced to make hefty write-downs in the second half. Credit Lyonnais attributed the rise in first-half provisions to the problems of its Dutch subsidiary and the Paris property market. Last year it saw net profits slip to FFr3.16bn from FFr3.71bn, after doubling client risk provisions to FFr9.5bn because of losses on loans to clients such as Mr Robert Maxwell, the disgraced British media magnate. The bank, which is chaired by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, also warned that its second-half banking activities could be affected by the uncertain economic environment. Its net banking income rose 16 per cent to FFr24.4bn in the first half with gross operating profits increasing 33 per cent to FFr6.8bn. Credit Lyonnais's results mark the start of the interim reporting season for France's big banks. Although the aggressive Credit Lyonnais is seen as the most exposed of the French banks, analysts are bracing themselves for increased provisions across the industry because of the weakness of the Paris property market and the sluggish state of the French economy.</p>

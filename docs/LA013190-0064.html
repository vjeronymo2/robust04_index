			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Dulled Repute: Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) wants to rename Dulles International  Airport to honor President Dwight D. Eisenhower, stripping the accolade from  Ike's controversial Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. Dulles is  remembered as the force behind the now-discredited "brinkmanship" policies and  of the "domino theory."  </P> <P> But the plan dismays Dulles' grandson and namesake, John Foster Dulles: "It is  most appropriate that we honor President Eisenhower. . . . However, it would  certainly not be in keeping with his desires that the tribute, which he  accorded my grandfather, be taken away in this manner."  </P> <P> * Devoted Duos: What do President George and First Lady Barbara Bush have in  common with actor Don Johnson and actress Melanie Griffith? The two dissimilar  couples run neck-and-neck as one of America's most stylish twosomes, according  to a recent poll of more than 1,000 men and women conducted by Martini &amp;  Rossi Asti.  </P> <P> * Sex After 50?: As they approach their 50th birthdays, newsmen Ted Koppel and  Tom Brokaw talked about the news business. NBC's Brokaw was born on Feb. 6,  1940, ABC's Koppel Feb. 8. Koppel said in the Feb. 3 TV Guide he believes Peter  Jennings, Dan Rather and Brokaw "have a level of sex appeal that I don't have."  But said Brokaw of his work: "I don't think I'll be here for another 15 years."  </P> <P> * New Heights: Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympics star gymnast, says children  without goals are more likely to get involved with drugs, including alcohol.  "You have to be willing to make sacrifices," she told a group of students in  Huntington, W. Va. "There will be a lot of hard choices." Retton retired from  gymnastics four years ago. "It was time for new goals, like getting a good  education," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Chinese markets still down in the doldrums - A year of little cheer for equities John Crossman, senior representative in Shanghai for Jardine Fleming, did not mince his words: 'This has been a brutally bad year for the markets in Shanghai.' Shanghai's B-share market for foreign investors is some 40 per cent down on its high for the year achieved in early January, and ominously it has sagged badly since rallying in September and October. The end of 1994 brought little cheer for investors in both Shanghai's A-share market for locals and B-shares. This is a year investors would prefer to forget. Yesterday Shenzhen A shares dived for the fourth consecutive session as investors were unable to find positive stimulation. The index lost 2.3 per cent to 140.45, but in volume was down to 193m shares from the previous session's 241.9m. Shenzhen B shares were not traded. In Shanghai the story was similar with the A's also losing 2.3 per cent to 682.17, and the B's off a marginal 0.08 to 61.94. Representatives of the Shanghai Stock Exchange are adopting a more sanguine view, no doubt reflecting satisfaction with the high turnovers achieved this year in the bond market. According to an official Xinhua news agency dispatch, transactions in the bond spot, futures and re-purchasing markets exceeded one trillion yuan (USDollars 116.2bn) for the first 11 months of the year - 158 times the figure for the previous year. Ms Li Qian, spokeswoman for the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said that while trading in bond futures had been robust, turnover in stocks had been quiet for much of the year, but she expected 1995 to be livelier. She added that there would be a big increase in new listings, including Dollars 1bn worth B-shares listings at a planned rate of about 10 new companies each quarter. This would boost significantly B-share market capitalisation from the current Dollars 1.4bn. It would also more than double the numbers of B-share counters from 33. Ms Li also forecast that the A-share market would be enlivened by the lifting of a freeze on new listings. Stock market regulators in Beijing had deferred until 1995 Yn5.5bn worth of new listed stock because of concern about overloading a flagging market with new issues. Among other factors likely to affect the market next year is the expected promulgation of a new national securities law that has gone through at least 10 drafts, and is yet to be presented to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval. The securities industry has been agitating for the early passage of the law to help build confidence in the markets buffeted too much adverse publicity this year, including several high profile insider trading cases. A new national law governing B-shares is also in the works and is expected to appear in the new year. Stock analysts in Shanghai expect the B-share market to recover in 1995, but also warn that this will depend to a large extent on a revival of confidence in China's efforts to deal with its economic problems. The performance of Hong Kong stocks will also weigh heavily with the Chinese markets. Mr Crossman of Jardine Fleming said there was no doubt that confidence had 'taken a hit' this year, and people might be asking themselves whether it might not have been a little early to enter the market. Among problems for B-share investors was an illiquid market with turnover falling to very low levels. Richard Graham, chief representative in Shanghai of Baring Securities, believes that comments recently by Premier Li Peng suggesting that China's stock markets were 'experimental' had not contributed greatly to confidence but 'suggested a lack of political commitment to the development of capital markets.'' Mr Li Peng's remark, he added, did not augur well for the innovative development of the markets, and the introduction of such instruments as warrants, indexed futures and other derivatives. Investors were likely to continue to be skittish for the time being as evidenced by the lukewarm reception given to recent listings such as Huashin Cement which tumbled 18.5 per cent at issue in spite of a price earnings multiple of seven. Mr Graham drew three broad categories of investors in China's B-share markets at this stage: the China funds which are locked in to the market; the emerging market funds, which have a wide choice; and possiblely a third who might be tempted to take a contrary position with the B-share market having fallen so low. Shanghai analysts, while they might differ on likely trends next year, would agree that artificial attempts by the authorities to boost the market, as happened late last summer, will be treated much more warily next time. Beijing , panicked by the market's free fall, introduced emergency measures in August, freezing new listings, indicating that the A-share market would be open to foreign investors through joint venture funds, and making funds available to securities companies for share purchases. The A-share market rose to a high for the year of 1092.85 on September 13 before it quickly subsided to a trading range between 600-700. Market regulators should have learned by now that there are no 'quick fixes'.</p>

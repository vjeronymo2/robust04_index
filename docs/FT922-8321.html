			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (7): A relationship built on mutual need  -Menem and Cavallo IT IS a marriage made in hell. President Carlos Menem and his Mr Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister could never survive for long without each other. Equally, their relationship is racked with fear, jealousy and suspicion. Little wonder then that they are regularly said to be on the verge of splitting up. Although they have wrought one of the world's least likely economic miracles, their stormy relationship is also a permanent source of uncertainty. The edgy business community would be deeply unhappy if Mr Cavallo left, believing that the impetus of reform would suffer with his resignation. However, Mr Cavallo, 46, warns: 'Do not underestimate Menem and me. We have demonstrated that, even when nobody abroad believed us, we continued in the direction we decided on.' The two men could hardly be more different. Mr Menem, 61, is a typical Latin American politician - a charismatic populist with firm grip on all the reins of political power, but only a limited grasp of the intricacies of diplomacy and economic policy. Mr Cavallo is a technocrat rather than a politician. He took an economics doctorate at Harvard and has a clear understanding of how the worlds of high finance and international relations work. He is also a glutton for work and is notorious for rousing his aides in the dead of night to discuss policy. Mr Menem is said to be easily bored or irritated by Mr Cavallo's laborious efforts to explain recondite economic theory. While Mr Menem may have established the broad political and economic strategy, he is only too happy to leave execution in the safe hands of Mr Cavallo. Others say Mr Menem feels frustrated in his relationship with Mr Cavallo and is given to taunting and humiliating his minister - a claim Mr Cavallo obviously denies. He does say Mr Menem's occasional bursts of anger subside quickly when a decision is shown to be in line with government policy. Still, the punctilious and unrelenting minister contrasts sharply with the president's lighthearted and less intense personality. Mr Menem's jealousy seems to be worsening as his minister goes from success to success. Mr Menem said in an interview that Mr Cavallo 'will continue in his job as long as he follows the directives of the president. Ministers must know they are like fuses - they are the ones that get worn out. The one who does not go is the president.' Mr Menem added: 'There are two forces: the force of his capacity, talent, honesty. And there is political force, which is more important, which the president gives him.' Mr Cavallo understands Mr Menem's jealousies and makes every effort to pass off his achievements as those of Mr Menem. He does recognise that his success depends strongly on Mr Menem's political backing. 'To carry out change like this requires power, and power is essentially a political question,' Mr Cavallo says. Despite his claim to be an apolitical technocrat, Mr Cavallo is said to have engineered the fall of several of his cabinet colleagues and some of the more unsavoury members of the president's personal entourage. Mr Cavallo is suspected of leaking some of the corruption scandals to the press that have forced Mr Menem to purge the government. That is a charge Mr Cavallo vehemently rejects. Nonetheless, he is hated by Mr Menem's close friends who are widely suspected of corruption. The two met after Mr Cavallo was elected to Congress as an independent in 1987. At the time, Mr Menem was the governor of the impoverished province of La Rioja. When he came to power in 1989, he made Mr Cavallo foreign minister. Mr Cavallo won international respect for renewing diplomatic links with Britain and mending fences with the international community. He also kept an eagle eye on economic policy. He became economy minister in January 1991 after an inflationary burst forced his predecessor to resign. Politics are at the heart of their increasingly difficult relationship. Opinion polls regularly place Mr Cavallo far ahead of Mr Menem, and his policies are credited with winning last year's mid term elections. He is therefore an obvious potential presidential candidate when Mr Menem's term expires in 1995. But Mr Menem wants to reform the constitution that bans successive presidential terms and run for re-election. However, much as Mr Cavallo denies presidential ambitions, he is generally assumed - by Mr Menem and by many others - to want to become president. There is a risk that Mr Menem will fire Mr Cavallo or try to compromise his rigidly orthodox economic policies to win support for constitutional reform. Another big worry is that the horse trading of a re-election campaign would fuel corruption. Mr Cavallo and his team are seen as a bulwark against corruption. The general assumption is that Mr Cavallo will probably remain in office at least until the end of the year. For his part, Mr Cavallo says he supports and is working for re-election and says he hopes to be foreign minister in Mr Menem's second government.</p>

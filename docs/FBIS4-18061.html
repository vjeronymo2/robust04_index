The tasks  facing society are too complex and too difficult for its  resources to be dissipated in political antagonism.

It is our common aim to make the Russian Federation a  flourishing state, enjoying a high level of authority in the  international arena, a state inhabited by free people, proud of  their history and looking toward the future with confidence.  This aim can be achieved only through a social accord that  grows out of respect for the dignity of the human being, for  different political convictions, and for national, cultural, and  religious traditions.    For the sake of social accord, the president of the Russian  Federation, the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of  the Russian Federation, the State Duma of the Federal Assembly  of the Russian Federation, the Government of the Russian  Federation, the components of the Russian Federation, the Public  Chamber under the president of the Russian Federation, political  parties, trade unions, other public associations, and religious  associations (henceforth referred to as the parties to the  treaty), acting in accordance with the Constitution and laws of  the Russian Federation, placing common interests higher than  group, party, departmental, and religious interests, ruling out  the possibility that the problems arising in society can be  resolved through violence, whatever forms it takes, conclude the  present treaty.  <H8>  I.

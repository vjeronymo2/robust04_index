			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Minister champions BAe deal MR John Cahill, chairman of British Aerospace, will today meet representatives of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) in an attempt to restart stalled talks on a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft. Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, who is in Taiwan as part of an east Asian tour will also discuss the venture with Mr Yang Shih-chien, the vice-minister of economic affairs and the politician most closely associated with the proposed deal. Mr Needham yesterday met Mr Hsu Li-Teh, the vice-premier, who repeated his government's backing of the deal. Failure of the venture would be a blow to Mr Cahill's plans to improve BAe's performance. The company has not made a full-year pre-tax profit since 1990. In addition, about 3,000 jobs in the UK would be put at risk. Taiwan wants the joint venture as part of an industrial policy to bring the island's industries into the civil aviation sector. The previous round of talks broke up last month with both sides disagreeing on the long-term strategy of the venture, called Avro. Both TAC and the government's representatives this week repeated that progress depended on a commitment that Avro would develop a new generation of regional jets, called the RJ-X. BAe says more research is needed to discover whether this Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) programme can be justified.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK markets The bandwagon in the UK equity market seems unstoppable. Despite a profits warning from Fisons and Pounds 400m of write-downs and provisions from Trafalgar House, the FT-SE 100 still ended the week 76 points higher. Some of the gain reflects a squeeze on those institutions which held back ahead of the budget and are still trying to climb back on board. But the main impetus remains interest rates. With inflation subdued, the view is growing that rates may be cut not just in the new year, but again in the spring when tax increases start to bite. Whether the Bank of England will oblige is another matter. The recovery does not look weak enough to make a fresh cut urgent, and the latest German money supply data suggests continental cuts could be deferred. But as long as it can convince itself that rates are heading lower, the equity market could retain some steam. Cash is an unattractive alternative - as retail investors were reminded this week by fresh reductions in building society and National Savings rates. Only when the interest rate frenzy stops will the market have to worry about boring matters such as earnings and dividends. Then it will be time to remember that if low inflation holds back reported earnings, it will take even longer for cover to be restored to the point where dividends can grow in tandem.</p>

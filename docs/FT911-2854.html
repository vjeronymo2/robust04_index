			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Money Markets: Bank lends at 12% THERE WAS little evidence of downward pressure on London interest rates yesterday. Lack of economic data kept trading quiet, but the Bank of England decided to underline the present rate structure by lending funds to the money market at the bank base rate level of 12 per cent. Three-month sterling interbank was quoted at 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent, compared with 11 13/16 -11 3/4 on Thursday, while 12-month money was unchanged at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent. Short sterling futures traded in a narrow range on Liffe, with June delivery remaining above technical support at 88.57. The contract opened unchanged at 88.64 and touched a low of 88.60 before closing at 88.62. Apart from lending to the market, the authorities also deterred thoughts of lower interest rates by not providing enough assistance to take out the full underlying credit shortage. This left the short end of the money market tight, even though speculation about an early cut in base rates has tended to fade on a weakening of sterling in the ERM and recent disappointing economic news. The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of Pounds 1,650m, but revised this to Pounds 1,550m at noon and to Pounds 1,750m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 1,406m was provided. An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought Pounds 454m bills, including Pounds 123m outright, by way of Pounds 54m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 69m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Another Pounds 331m bills were purchased for resale to the market on May 13 at 11 29/32 -11 15/16 per cent. Before lunch a further Pounds 362m bills were bought outright, via Pounds 198m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 164m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon the Bank of England did not buy any more bills, but invited the discount houses to use their borrowing facilities. A total of Pounds 590m was lent to the houses for seven days at 12 per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,631m, with a rise in the note circulation absorbing Pounds 510m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 485m to liquidity and bank balances above target of Pounds 5m. At the weekly Treasury bill tender the average rate of discount on 91-day bills fell to 11.1700 from 11.1806 per cent.</p>

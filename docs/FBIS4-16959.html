			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine and Iran have reached preliminary  understanding on the mechanism of implementing the 1992  agreement on oil and gas shipments to Ukraine. Under the  agreement, Iran was supposed to annually deliver 10 to 12 Bn  cubic meters of gas and 5 Mn tonnes of oil.    However, according to the Ukrainian embassy in Tehran, the  agreement actually did not come into force because the question  of building a gas pipeline from Iran to Ukraine remained open.  The Ukrainian side is unable to supply the pipes and other  building materials. Besides, the pipeline was to cross Russian  territory and no agreement was reached on the project with  Russia.    At talks in Tehran on Monday the Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko and the Iranian Oil and Gas Minister Gholam Reza  Agazadeh reached preliminary agreement on increasing Iranian gas  supplies along the existing gas pipeline to Azerbaijan by 3 Bn  cubic meters. Turkmenistan should accordingly reduce gas  supplies to Azerbaijan and increase deliveries to Ukraine.    According to the Ukrainian Embassy, the pattern of gas  deliveries has been discussed with Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, talks  with Turkmenistan on the matter have not been held.    Last February Turkmenistan stopped direct gas deliveries to  Ukraine when the Ukrainian debt rose to $700 Mn.    The talks in Tehran reportedly focused on the possibility of  Iranian oil supplies in exchange for Ukrainian farm goods.    As the Ukrainian facilities technologically are unable to  refine Iranian oil, deliveries will evidently follow the same  pattern as in the case of gas -- using a third country.    The patterns of delivery will be finalized during sessions  of  a mixed commission for trade and economic cooperation.    An agreement between the two countries might be signed  during  the visit to Ukraine by the Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  planned for this year.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Continental Air recovers sharply to Dollars 12.4m CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier which emerged from bankruptcy protection for the second time in April, yesterday joined other US airlines in reporting a sharp financial recovery in the third quarter. It made net profits of Dollars 12.4m in the three months to September, compared with net losses of Dollars 29.5m last time. Turnover rose from Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.6bn, and net income per share was 53 cents (no comparable figure was available because of the reconstruction). Like other US carriers, Continental has benefited from cuts in operating costs, a fall in fuel prices, and a favourable comparison with last year's third quarter, when a price war was being waged. Mr Robert Ferguson, president and chief executive, said the impact of the new Continental Lite services introduced in the east had exceeded expectations.</p>

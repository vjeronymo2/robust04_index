			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Something profitable to sing about for burly chassis maker - James Abbott on Trinity Holdings' ascendance BUSINESS LIFE is looking rosy for Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman and chief executive of Trinity Holdings, which manufactures fire engines, buses and other commercial vehicles. On December 20 the Ministry of Defence confirmed a Pounds 5m order for 147 chassis for troop buses, won against fierce competition from international manufacturers such as Volvo. For Trinity, the deal capped a good year, the third since Mr Hollyhead and his fellow managers bought the company for Pounds 26m, with the support of a syndicate of eight banks led by Bankers Trust Citicorp. The managers own 51 per cent of the equity, the banks the rest. Trinity was formerly the engineering division of Hestair, which sold it to concentrate on its employment bureaux. However, that business turned sour and Hestair was bought by BET, the business services conglomerate. In contrast, Trinity has gone from strength to strength. Turnover is up from Pounds 55m in the last year under Hestair to Pounds 90m in 1991. Pre-tax profits have risen from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 5.5m. Trinity has been toasting the new year with its fattest-ever order book: it has taken Pounds 45m-worth of orders in the last four months. This growth has been achieved in the face of markets which are either stagnant or declining. Trinity's products are hardly the stuff of quick-buck salesmanship; behind the growth lies a knack for accurate assessment of the needs of its target markets. Typical of these products is the Dart midibus, produced under the Dennis marque. Developed in the last months of Hestair ownership by the team that was to buy Trinity, the Dart fulfilled a need in the competitive UK bus market. Bus operators had set up new routes in the mid-1980s which penetrated housing estates and ran at increased frequencies. Many of these routes were worked by minibuses made from van chassis with bus coachwork. In many cases these vehicles were not up to the rigours of bus operation - on some routes in London, brakes had to be replaced after just three days. 'The smallest feasible, big bus is what people wanted,' says Mr Steve Brown, engineering director. This thinking resulted in the Dart: a short wheelbase chassis that is highly manoeuvrable, but built to the same exacting standards as a traditional bus. The Dart has proved extremely successful: more than 400 have been sold to London alone. The Dart has helped Dennis become one of the top sellers of bus chassis in the UK, and the company has recently begun marketing in the Benelux countries. While Dennis has long sold buses to Hong Kong and other east Asian markets, this is the first foray into the fiercely competitive European bus market. The same prescription of carefully tailoring to the market's needs has been applied to fire engines and dustcarts. Larger rivals adapt truck chassis for these purposes, which leads to second-best solutions. By contrast, Trinity purpose builds for these specialist markets. For instance the Rapier, Dennis' new fire engine, has a wheelbase designed to accommodate the water tanks and give an appropriate centre of gravity. 'It handles like a Ferrari,' boasts Mr Hollyhead. These products are also being pushed into Europe. Sales there of 120 dustcarts over the past few years have kept output up in the face of a 40 per cent drop in domestic demand following the contracting-out of local government services. While strict attention to market needs has been winning orders in the UK and abroad, careful housekeeping at home has led to improved results on the bottom line. Better inventory control, for instance, has cut stocks from Pounds 14m to Pounds 9m, while debt and credit control has also been improved. 'It's marvellous how one's mind is focused when it's your own money,' says Mr Hollyhead. In a deftly timed asset disposal in summer 1989, Trinity sold its Duple coach name, along with jigs and drawings, to Plaxton for Pounds 4m. 'Another three months and we'd have had to shut it anyway,' says Mr Hollyhead. While Plaxton has hit financial trouble, Trinity has been able to redevelop the Duple site at Blackpool; altogether, getting rid of Duple will have raised about Pounds 11m. Much of this has been spent on a new Pounds 10m bus chassis and fire engine factory at Guildford, Surrey. With a continuing strong flow of orders backing his optimism, Mr Hollyhead expects Trinity to be in a position to repay by the end of 1993 all its borrowings, which currently stand at Pounds 8m.</p>

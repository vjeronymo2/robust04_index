			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by 'Atif 'Umar: "Don't Close Every Door to the </F> Palestinian People"]    [Text] Today is 13 April, the date to which Israel  committed itself, saying it would implement the Declaration of  Principles Agreement with the Palestinians regarding withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho in preparation for the establishment of  self-rule in this area and as a confirmation of its true desire  to establish genuine peace with the Palestinians, in particular,  and the Arab states in general. Despite Israel's commitment to  this date, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated that  things had been postponed until the end of this month. Before  news agencies could confirm the date, Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin made a statement in which he declared that the  agreement on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles  might be signed in the middle of next month.    A sense of despair is increasing among the Palestinian  people  inside and outside the occupied territory, especially following  a new decision by the Israeli Government to import foreign  workers to replace the Palestinian workers employed by some  Israeli companies in the occupied Palestinian territory. This  decision has dangerous implications for the Palestinian people  as it affects their livelihood and their right to maintain a  decent life in the land on which they were born and raised. It  might push the Palestinian people in the occupied territory into  extreme despair, the result of which no one can calculate. When  life and death become equal, the resulting reaction could be  difficult to predict or calculate. Perhaps what happened in  'Afula and that led to regression in the peace process proves  the truth of what we say. Credibility in abiding by the  articles agreed upon and the dates set to implement what is  concluded between the two negotiating parties is essential-- if  there are indeed sincere intentions to resolve the Palestinian-  Israeli differences.    The Palestinians in the Cairo negotiations have agreed to  postpone the implementation until the end of this month,  according to the Israeli foreign minister's statement. This is  because the PLO doesn't want to miss any chance for the  Palestinian people to secure their rights and emphasize the  Palestinian desire to establish permanent and viable peace with  Israel and solve the Middle East conflict according to the  principle of land for peace, which was endorsed by the  international community in Madrid.    Israel's continuing attempts to postpone the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement places Israel in a position that  we think is not in its favor. The PLO has offered everything  that could advance the peace negotiations and achieve permanent  peace in the Middle East and all the Arab capitals have  expressed their support and backing for every step to achieve an  agreement that will restore security and peace to the Middle  East, providing this is done on a just basis.</p>

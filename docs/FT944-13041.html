			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dogs and the digestives test Sir, With reference to David Blackwell's article 'Making a meal of a dog's dinner' (October 25), I discovered last Saturday why the pet food market is so lucrative. Reason: pound for pound at my local Tesco superstore the cheapest brand of dog biscuit is more expensive than digestives. In tests my dog showed a clear preference for digestives - he found them easier to dunk. Alex Morris, New Road, Wonersh, Surrey GU5 0SE</p>

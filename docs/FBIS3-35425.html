This  offer made by American companies to India reflects a shift in  American policy on South Asia and the contradictions of the U.S.  leadership. By the end of last year, the Clinton administration  had warned India to desist from making indigenous production of  military equipment that may flare up a war frenzy. Hence, in  consonance with this policy, the United States has refused to  provide super computers to India and has also prevented Russia  from providing the latter with rocket engines, which may be used  in the manufacture of long-range missiles. To discourage India  from producing sophisticated weapons indigenously, the U.S.  Government also threatened India that if it manufactures such  equipment at home, the United States would sell materials for  the manufacture of AWACS planes to Pakistan. After this  warning, India obviously halted work on the AWACS system at home  and began talks with the United States for the purchase of  latest equipment for its air force. However, after the offer of  the American companies, besides manufacturing latest equipment,  India will be able to achieve indigenous production of AWACS.  This way, the Indian Air Force will have superiority in the  region. The Indian Air Force is already more powerful than its  counterparts in Pakistan and other countries of the region.    This state of affairs is greatly regrettable. This is the  reality and every Pakistani with any common sense is fully aware  of the fact that the Americans are totally insincere people, and  when their is purpose served, they become indifferent. During  the Afghan war, the United States needed Pakistan. Despite  great risks, Pakistan decided to confront Russia. At that time,  the United States did not have any objection to Pakistan's  nuclear program. Now strong pressure is being exerted on  Pakistan to roll back this nuclear program, because now the  United States does not need Pakistan to forestall Russian  influence. On the contrary, after the downfall of Russia as the  superpower, the American policy makers are not only ignoring  Pakistan but also are encouraging India on several issues, which  is a cause for concern to the political circles and the people  of Pakistan.    The offer of sophisticated military equipment to India by  the  American firms is a cause of anxiety to our policy makers. They  should make a careful study of the offer and review the  motivations and inspiration behind it. Pakistan is not Nepal,  Sri Lanka, or the Maldives. It cannot accept the hegemony of  India. However, by joining hands with other regional countries,  Pakistan can prepare programs that will be beneficial to all the  countries of South Asia. With the help of our neighbors, we can  make this region a zone of peace, which ensures the  independence, security, and the effective protection of the  territorial boundaries of the countries in it. We hope that  other regional countries are also not ready to accept the  hegemony of India and that they will join hands and cooperate  with Pakistan to make the region a zone of peace. We will  request that the Government of Pakistan lodge a strong protest  against the offer of sophisticated defense equipment to India by  the American firms. Pakistan should launch an effective  diplomatic campaign to assure the American leadership that  Pakistan cannot tolerate Indian hegemony and its policing.    It is also imperative to inform the American leadership that  the Indian leadership is making threats of dire consequences to  Pakistan because of its moral and political support to the  freedom struggle of the Kashmiri people. Pakistan does not have  any militaristic or expansionist designs. We would also request  that the Indian Government review the situation at home in the  global context with a cool head and in a relaxed way and adopt a  policy to coexist with other countries of the region, including  Pakistan, on the basis of the principles of peaceful  coexistence. We would also suggest that the Indian leadership  fulfill its pledges made to the United Nations, grant the right  of self-determination to the people of Kashmir, and concentrate  on eradicating the poverty of its own people instead of  browbeating and making threats of dire consequences to Pakistan.</p>

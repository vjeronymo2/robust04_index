			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yaroslav Khobta: "Signs of Spring Have Appeared </F> at the End of May in Ukraine's Relations With the World"]    [Text] In the spring of 1994 Ukraine began a massive  advertising campaign to create a positive image of itself in the  world. An unexpected shock for world observers was the March  indicator of the inflation rate for the karbovanets. This figure  amounted to 5.6 percent, whereas at the start of the year it had  been higher by several orders of magnitude. The very tough  monetary policy introduced by Zvyahilskyy, after several months  of hand-wringing, has only now begun to lose its funereal  colors. Only now--in the observers's opinion--have the  presidential edicts and the decrees adopted by the Cabinet of  Ministers as well as the National Bank taken on a quality of  logic and purposiveness.    Of course, this could not fail to have a marked effect on  Ukraine's foreign relations with the most influential circles in  the West. It's most likely that the West has ceased to blink in  astonishment after each new item of information from Ukraine. To  be sure, investors who have already invested their U.S. dollars,  German marks, and other such hard currency here are still  grasping their heads, but they are no longer spitting in all  directions and cursing the day when their money crossed our  border. The packet of privileges for investors which was  proclaimed by the president of Ukraine prior to 1 April has not  yet attained the status of an April Fools joke; and under our  conditions even this can be considered an achievement. In  commenting upon the course of economic reforms during the spring  period, certain analysts have expressed the opinion that the  liberalization of the economy is directly linked to the  elections. But--on the other hand--if nobody is worse off  because of this, then what is the difference as to when the  reforms were conducted--during the elections, before them, or  after them? In essence, the West began to take a new attitude  toward Ukraine after Kravchuk's visit to the White House in  Washington. The granting of assistance to Ukraine by the United  States in the amount of 700 million U.S. dollars (which exceeded  the previously allocated total several times over) served as a  unique guarantee not only for the governments of other  countries, but also for potential investors. And although right  now the situation in Ukraine is far from being what such  investors would have wanted, they have  all--nevertheless--reached the conclusion that we are not to be  deserted. And if tens of millions more must be poured into our  country today, then tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will  begin to yield some profits. And just where are we headed now?    According to data provided by the Ukrainian Ministry of  Statistics, as of 1 April 1994, the growth of investments in  Ukraine's economy during the period from January through March  of this year reached the figure of 66.7 million U.S. dollars. At  the beginning of 1994 the total amount of investments in Ukraine  had reached the level of 1.2-1.5 billion U.S. dollars. However,  according to data provided by the Cabinet of Ministers, we need  to employ four times that total in order to carry out our  top-priority tasks in the immediate future. The legal foundation  for investors in Ukraine is still the Decree passed by the  Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers dated 20 May 1993, "On the System  of Foreign Investment." In line with this Decree, the Law "On a  State Program for Encouraging Foreign Investments" was passed in  December 1993; it designated 11 high-priority sectors for  investing in our economy. Furthermore, Ukraine has just recently  introduced several more legislative acts aimed at encouraging  foreign investments here. To sum up, the West will continue to  have a sentimental attitude toward us until such time as we  ourselves cease to have a sentimental attitude toward the West.    But, meanwhile, this spring the world's financial  institutions have significantly stepped up their scrutiny of the  conditions for granting credits to Ukraine. On 19 May the  mission of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] completed its  work, the goal of which was to standardize the conditions under  which Ukraine could be granted the so-called STF (Standard  Transformation Facilities)--credits amounting to 700 million  U.S. dollars, keyed to a period of 15 years at interest rates of  6 or 7 percent percent per annum. As a rule, the IMF grants STF  to countries with a transitional type of economy for the purpose  of amortizing the deficits in their budget payments. Of course,  it would have been best if--during this visit--the Ukrainian  government had prepared a letter to the IMF, in which a method  of putting such credits to advantageous use could have been set  forth, although even this cannot be regarded as a panacea. In  the words of Lorenzo de Milnera, the IMF's permanent  representative in Ukraine, one of the mandatory conditions for  granting STF to Ukraine is political stability in our country;  this would manifest itself--first and foremost--in the existence  of "solid persons" in positions of authority. And, therefore, it  can be safely predicted that--in any case--the IMF is waiting  for the election results.    A discussion of the global initiatives with regard to  granting assistance to Ukraine--initiatives which were set forth  several weeks ago by the Commission of the European  Union--recently took place in Brussels at the level of the  ambassadors from the 12 member-states of the EU [European  Union]. The specific total figure for such assistance was not  revealed, but Great Britain's ambassador noted the importance of  the proposals set forth by the Commission, and the EU  Commission's official representative--Peter Gilford--hinted that  the problem of assisting Ukraine Ukraine would not remain in the  corridors of power at Brussels. In contrast to the United  States, Canada, and other trans-oceanic investors, the EU is  more disturbed by Ukraine's nuclear problem and--in  particular--by the question of the Chernobyl AES [nuclear power  station]. Specifically because of this, Western Europe is still  dancing about in its interrelations with Ukraine. This matter is  to be discussed during the course of the meetings between the  leaders of the "Big Seven" states in June 1994; and Ukraine will  be practically the first country to feel the results of these  discussions.    Quite a good result of the final accord among Ukrainian  politicians reached on 17 May was a "first" in the history of  the relations between Washington and Kiev. This was the signing  by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and Ukrainian Deputy  Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov of an agreement on cooperation in  the sphere of converting military-type production. An agreement  to create the Ukrainian-American Westron JV [joint venture] was  signed at the highest level. It is the first substantive proof  that Ukraine's relations with the United States have entered  upon an entirely new stage of development. All this gives us  occasion to consider that--in the very near future--Ukraine can  anticipate the first wave in our memory of ardent, assiduous  attention from the world's financial giants. But on one  condition: that we stop spitting into our own well.    Volume of investments in Ukraine by CIS countries in  thousands of U.S. dollars    Russia--1673.15    Latvia--306.95    Estonia--521.30    Lithuania--21.60    Moldova--14.74    Volume of investments in Ukraine by "Big Seven" countries  (except Japan) in thousands of U.S. dollars    Great Britain--5243.29    Germany--2099.46    Italy--4239.63    Canada--58988.99    United States--20031.63    France--3521.99</p>

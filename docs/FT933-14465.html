			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Go-ahead for BAe's Taiwan deal TAIWAN'S economics ministry and local banks yesterday gave a conditional go-ahead to provide Dollars 460m (Pounds 309m) in low-interest loans for joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC). The proposal to transfer production of BAe's regional jet (RJ) airliners to the Pounds 250m joint venture is fundamental to the restructuring and recovery of BAe's loss-making civil aircraft business. BAe said the main condition made by Taiwan's government - a commitment to the joint development of new aircraft models - was already the subject of talks between the two parties. The loans are needed to finance the production and leasing of the RJ aircraft, to be assembled in Britain and Taiwan. Mr Yang Shih-chien, deputy minister of economic affairs, said the bank group now 'has a grip on the risk factors'. It is 'willing in principle to co-ordinate with government policy' which is strongly in favour of the venture. Mr Yang said the banks agreed in principle to offer TAC a minimum package of Dollars 460m, including Dollars 400m to help finance the launch of the leasing operation for the RJ jet and Dollars 60m in working capital. But the banks want BAe to provide firm commitments on several issues before granting final approval. The 'focal point' was a commitment by BAe to develop jointly with TAC an advanced regional passenger jet (or RJ-X). The ministry and the banking group had agreed that 'development of the RJ-X is an indispensable part of the entire plan', Mr Yang said. He also wanted to know more about possible launch aid from the UK and further details of the arrangements for leasing the aircraft. The bank consortium, led by the state-owned Chiaotung Bank, has questioned the sales and leasing potential of the RJ and the feasibility of the venture's plans to lease the aircraft. TAC, 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, and BAe agreed in January to form the 50:50 joint venture to produce a new family of passenger aircraft to cash in on the fast-growing but competitive Asian markets.</p>

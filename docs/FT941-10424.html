			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Further advances at Allstate Allstate, the diversified US insurance group which was floated on the stock market last summer, reported a further profits rebound in the final quarter of 1993 after heavy losses from hurricane Andrew the year before. Mr Wayne Hedien, chairman and chief executive, said the company would be able to 'accelerate growth in our major business segments sooner than we anticipated,' thanks to its stronger operating profits and the proceeds from sales of securities. Allstate reported net income of Dollars 259m, or 57 cents a share, for the final quarter and Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 2.99, for the year. In 1992, it had losses of Dollars 139m in the final quarter and Dollars 825m (Dollars 500m before accounting changes) for the year. Hurricane Andrew led to post-tax losses of Dollars 506m in the quarter and Dollars 1.65bn in 1992. Leaving aside the hurricane, operating income rose to Dollars 1.16bn in the year from Dollars 1.04bn, as overall revenues grew by 3.5 per cent to Dollars 20.9bn. Underwriting results in the property and casualty business improved, with the combined loss ratio falling to 103 in 1993 from 105 the year before.</p>

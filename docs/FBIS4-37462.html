			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel is willing to release Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] leader Ahmad Yasin from prison if he signs  the standard statement saying that he knows that he is being  released in the framework of the Israel-PLO agreement and that  he undertakes to refrain from any acts of terrorism. The  paralyzed and blind Yasin, however, refuses to sign this  statement and will consequently remain incarcerated in Israel.  Our military affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda reports:    [Begin Ben-Yehuda recording] The issue of Hamas leader  Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's release was reviewed once more several  weeks ago, and again it was decided not to release him. Israel  is making Yasin's release conditional on his signing the  statement all released Palestinian prisoners must sign on  refraining from acts of or support for terrorism. This was  divulged by a security source. So far, Yasin has refused to  sign such a statement. Several Palestinian elements, some of  them official, recently submitted requests for the release of  Yasin, who has been imprisoned in Israel since 1988. All the  requests were reviewed, but as long as Yasin refuses to sign the  statement, he will remain imprisoned. The security source said  Israel does not want Yasin to die in an Israeli prison, because  this could have an impact on Hamas activity and could result in  a wave of violence by other organizations as well. The state of  Yasin's health, however, has not changed. As a result of a  childhood disease, he is paralyzed throughout almost all of his  body, but there has been no serious deterioration in his  condition. [end recording]</p>

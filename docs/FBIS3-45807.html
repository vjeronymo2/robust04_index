As learned, in 1993 the province's  revenues topped 10 billion yuan, an increase of 3.37 billion  yuan over the previous year, which is 36.4 percent.    At a provincial financial work meeting yesterday, Governor  Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor Chu Bo fully confirmed their  achievements. Early last year, influenced by stock and real  estate fever, there were serious outflows of funds from the  province to other provinces. Apart from this, other factors also  restricted the province's revenues. During the first five  months, the province registered a fall in its revenue. To  tackle this problem, governments and financial departments at  all levels throughout the province assigned pertinent financial  task to the grass-roots level. To strengthen tax collection and  management, beginning in the second half of last year, financial  and taxation departments in the province began to stop  provisional tax exemptions. In the course of carrying out a  general taxation, financial, and price inspections, funds in  violation of discipline totaling 580 million yuan were  discovered. In the course of strengthening tax collection and  management, financial and taxation departments in the province  also vigorously carried out an improvement of financial  resources. Last year the number of counties and cities topping  100 million yuan in revenues increased from the previous five to  14, and the number of townships and towns which topped 10  million yuan in revenue increased from eight in the previous  year to 33.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Zuhayr Mashariqah by </F> correspondent Sana' al-Sa'id in Damascus; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Sa'id] The American campaign against Syria,  which resulted recently in putting Syria on the list of states  that have failed to assist in the fight against drugs, is very  odd. Many believe that it is unfair. How do you view that  campaign?    [Mashariqah] The campaign some elements in the U.S.  Administration launched against Syria was undoubtedly unfair.  It sought to inflict harm on Syria and its policy through  accusing it of failure to fight drugs. It also aimed to destroy  Syrian-American relations and put pressure on Syria to dissuade  it from taking the stance it is assuming on the peace process  and its fixed principles. That campaign sought also to belittle  the outcome of the Geneva summit meeting between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton and inhibit the impetus it gave to the peace  process.    The manifest fact is that Syria is making efforts in  cooperation with the Lebanese authorities to fight poppy and  other drug farming, particularly in the Lebanese area of  al-Biqa'. Syria has issued many legislations and laws to fight  drugs, including the infliction of the severest punishments on  whoever farms, manufactures, or smuggles narcotics. Syria's  drug-fighting efforts seemed very satisfying to the United  Nations, as represented in the regional committee on fighting  drugs, which selected Damascus as a venue for its 30th session.  The committee's representative saw that Syria's drug-fighting  efforts are worthy of praise.    The goal of this campaign is to put pressure on Syria and  force it to relinquish its solid stance and just issues, which  were recognized by international legitimacy, that seek to  establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. But  Syria's stance and its just claims cannot be the subject of  one-upmanship.    [Al-Sa'id] Can this campaign be viewed as a sign of pressure  on Syria, particularly since it was launched just before  Christopher's tour of the region?    [Mashariqah] Putting Syria's name on the list of states that  fail to fight drugs is merely extortion to drive it to accept  Israeli conditions in the peace process. Syria always  reiterates that it rejects extortion and will not tolerate  one-upmanship when it comes to its basic issues. There is no  way that Syria will relinquish its rights; it is determined to  hold on to basic principles concerning Arab rights and claims.  Pressure will only enhance Syria's insistence on these rights  and on defending them. All methods and pressure will not succeed  to force it off its course or make it back down on its approach  to defend Arab rights and issues.    [Al-Sa'id] The Geneva summit, held between presidents Hafiz  al-Asad and Clinton on 16 January, managed to shed light on the  fact that the Syrian role is the key to peace in the Middle  East. How can the obstacles placed by Israel to block a  comprehensive and just peace in the region be overcome?    [Mashariqah] The success of the Geneva summit in January  between presidents al-Asad and Clinton was great. It drew the  attention of various Arab and world political circles and it was  reported by all print and broadcast media in detail. These  media focused on the summit's effectiveness and positive results.    President al-Asad went to Geneva to remove Zionism's  allegations and falsifications that cast doubt on Syria's desire  for peace. He stressed that a just and comprehensive peace is  an irreversible strategic option for Syria.    The Geneva summit has turned over a new page in the  bilateral  relations between Damascus and Washington and enhanced the great  role of Syria and its president. The U.S. President became  certain that Syria's pan-Arab role is unique and that Syria's  influence in events at the regional level cannot be bypassed.  The summit's atmosphere was positive and the Americans asserted  that they will make sincere efforts to achieve a tangible  progress in the peace process.    Obviously, Israel did not like the atmosphere that prevailed  at the summit or the results. So it began to raise doubts,  disseminate fabricated lies, and show reservations to circumvent  the outcome of the Geneva summit, absolve itself from the  requirements of the peace process, and diminish the world's  serious stance on achieving a just and comprehensive peace in  the region, especially that of the United States.    Syria has always stressed its enthusiasm about the peace  process and ensuring that it achieves its goals by bringing  about a just and comprehensive peace that will restore Arab  rights and territories. As far as Syria is concerned, peace is  an irreversible strategic option. If the United States makes a  sincere effort to make tangible progress in the peace process,  as President Clinton promised at the Geneva summit, and plays  the role of an impartial mediator, the process can achieve its  desired goals according to international legitimacy resolutions.    [Al-Sa'id] What about the methods the Israeli Government  uses in its dealings with the peace process?    [Mashariqah] The methods of the Israeli Government affirm  that it tends to stall, delay, and weasel its way out of  discussing the basic issues that lead to establishing a just and  permanent peace and that were stipulated by the principles of  international legitimacy and the UN resolutions. This peace is  based on retrieving the occupied Arab territories and the  national rights of the Palestinian Arab people. In addition,  the current attempts to proceed with partial and unilateral  solutions could create obstacles before a just and comprehensive  peace is realized, which was the objective of the Madrid  conference and the negotiations that followed it in Washington.  The maneuvers and practices of the Israeli Government are  preventing the establishment of the desired peace. If the  Israeli Government continues its methods, it will make these  real opportunities for peace hit a dead end.    Syria wants peace. What is important now is to use logic in  all matters. Logic dictates that we have an international  resolution that stipulates a full Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan Heights. Syria adheres to the peace process in accordance  with the bases and grounds of the Madrid peace process. These  bases concentrate on international legitimacy represented in  Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as the land-for-peace formula.    [Al-Sa'id] There are some sides rushing to normalize  relations with Israel and lift the boycott before establishing  peace. What do you think about this?    [Mashariqah] The Arab boycott of Israel was an Arab decision  made by the Arab League at that time to confront Israel's  aggressive policy and expansionist ambitions. If this decision  is to be reviewed, only the side that passed it can do so when  it finds a need for this. The reality is that the reasons that  the boycott decision was made still exist. The Arab territories  are occupied, national rights are usurped, and Israel does not  want to establish just and comprehensive peace in accordance  with the international legitimacy resolutions. In the  Washington peace talks, it is resorting to procrastination,  deception, and wasting time. At the same time, it continues to  build its settlements and commit crimes and massacres, one after  the other, against the Arab citizens in the occupied  territories. It wants land and peace. It wants peace for  peace. This is how it wants to normalize relations with the  Arabs. It wants control and influence. It wants to hegemonize  over the Arab region and control its resources. It wants to  realize its strategies in any way possible so that the whole  Arab region will submit to it in the end. What stands in the  way of Israel's dreams is Syria's firm and principled stance in  confronting its maneuvers and tricks, as well as its adherence  to the basic principles of the peace process, which stem from  international legitimacy and implementation of the latter's  resolutions.    [Al-Sa'id] Inter-Arab disarray has weakened the position of  Arab negotiators with Israel. In your view, how can solidarity  be restored among Arabs?    [Mashariqah] Disarray has indeed weakened the position of  Arab negotiators. This is what Israel has been eager to achieve  so that it could negotiate with this or that Arab side alone,  wrestle as many concessions as it could, strip the peace process  of the required momentum, and shatter the hopes peace-loving  elements in the region and in the world have pinned on that  process. From the outset, Syria has been careful to sustain  Arab solidarity and keep up coordination among the negotiating  Arab delegations. It believed in the need for a comprehensive  and just solution that guarantees the restoration of Arab rights  and lands as a natural prologue for stability and peace in the  region. Syria has not ceased to exert sincere efforts to  restore Arab solidarity. This solidarity enhances the position  of Arab negotiators and foils Israel's procrastination, which  seeks to ruin the peaceful process.    [Al-Sa'id] How do you view Israel's attempt to promote a  Middle Eastern market through which it can control the region?    [Mashariqah] Since it was planted in the heart of the Arab  homeland, Israel has pursued an aggressive expansionist policy  and a strategy that seeks to control the entire Arab region with  its political, economic, military, and cultural capabilities.  Nothing has changed in Israel's policy and strategy. Its talk  about peace is just a maneuver. Israel does not want peace; it  is far from binding itself to the principles of a just and  comprehensive peace as specified by the resolutions of  international legitimacy. It is trying to make negotiations  lose their vigor; it wastes time and effort at the Washington  talks to make the process lose its momentum. Israel wants to  normalize relations with Arabs and wants peace for peace. In  other words, it wants Arabs to surrender to its will because it  wants land and peace, control and influence, and seeks to  subjugate the region to its will, policy, and strategy. Its  promotion of the idea of a Middle East market falls in this  context. What shatters Israel's dreams is Syria's solid stance  regarding its maneuvers and the Arab masses' determination to  hold onto their rights and claims against Israel's schemes and  procrastination.    [Al-Sa'id] How can Arab relations be developed in the face  of  the so-called new world order?    [Mashariqah] There is no new world order; there are  international changes and developments that led to the  disintegration of the Socialist bloc in Eastern Europe and the  collapse of the Soviet Union and, consequently, the emergence of  the unipolar trend in international relations. These changes  have not reached their ultimate form and developments are  continuing. Hence, we cannot talk of a developed new world  order.    At any rate, developing Arab relations and enhancing Arab  solidarity are for the good of the Arab nation. They will help  it cope with international developments and defend its rights  and existence by confronting threats. The same thing goes for  relations with Islamic states.</p>

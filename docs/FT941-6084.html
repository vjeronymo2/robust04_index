			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Insulting customers does not pay Sir, I was dismayed when Malaysia adopted its 'Buy British last' stance, but even more dismayed by the tone of your editorial 'False moves in Malaysia' (February 28) and some of the broadsheet responses I read over the weekend. As one who has worked extensively in Malaysia in the last two years, I am disappointed to find you still telling them 'they'll be sorry in the end'. Surely we must learn that if you insult customers - and, incidentally, suppliers these days - they have the right to take their custom elsewhere. The developed world is queueing up for Malaysian business - I wish I could see a similar queue at Britain's door. We must learn - the press included - from the Japanese market approach of 'Japan plc' when looking at global markets. Insulting customers, from whatever source, does not pay.

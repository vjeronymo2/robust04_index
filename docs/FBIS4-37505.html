			<p>BFN     [Text] A firebomb was hurled a short time ago at an  Israeli vehicle near the entrance to the Jewish settlement of  Alfey Menashe. It exploded on the road, and there were no  casualties or damage.    Seven Nabulus residents were shot and wounded by the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] when riots were dispersed. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports that hundreds of residents  demonstrated in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners on a  hunger strike in the Janin jail. The IDF called on them to  disperse and when disturbances started, the soldiers used force  to disband them.</p>

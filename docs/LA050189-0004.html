			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said President Bush has told him that  there was no quid pro quo discussion of expedited military and economic aid to  Honduras in return for that country's assisting the Nicaraguan Contras when  Bush met then-President Roberto Suazo Cordova there in March, 1985. Documents  released at the Oliver L. North trial have implied that Bush played some role  in a U.S. plan to expedite aid to Honduras in return for its assistance to the  Contras. White House officials said secret documents will be released to  buttress the claim that Bush's visit was not part of the quid pro quo deal.  They will include a State Department cable from then-Ambassador John  Negroponte, which, Sununu said on NBC's "Meet the Press," "makes it very  obvious that there was no quid pro quo."  </P></p>

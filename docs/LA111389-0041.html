			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> ETHNIC BALANCE ON THE ARTS  </P> <P> That the boards of directors of arts groups should have minority  representatives is obvious in a community such as Orange County, where more  than a fourth of the population is Asian, Latino or other minorities. To fail  to include them is to risk skewing the offering of art, theater, opera and  other cultural activities in favor of the dominant white society -- a loss for  everyone. This is true for privately funded arts groups such as the Orange  County Performing Arts Center, and even more true for publicly supported groups  such as Pacific Symphony and South Coast Repertory.  </P> <P> But the governing boards of arts groups in Orange County are far from  ethnically balanced.  </P> <P> The four major arts groups receiving state subsidies average just 7%  minorities, according to the California Arts Council, which considers minority  representation in deciding annual grants. This year, the council cited SCR's  board composition in cutting its grant request to $81,960, which was 23% less  than the $106,000 stipend the previous year.  </P> <P> While we worry that it might be a short step from making such a cut to  dictating local artistic decisions, the council's action does call attention to  the need for broader representation on the SCR board.  </P> <P> At present, the Tony Award-winning SCR has three minority members -- an  Asian/Pacific Islander and two Latinos -- on its its 45-person board. First  housed in a storefront, SCR operates on a $5.3-million annual budget in its  multimillion-dollar, two-theater complex in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> SCR has shown its commitment to minorities in ways that its board composition  does not indicate. It sponsors the nationally recognized Hispanic Playwrights  Project, which showcases budding authors. All told, it spends $500,000 on  community outreach, some of which benefits the minority community.  </P> <P> SCR leaders say it is hard to find people in the minority community with an  avid interest in regional theater. But in reducing SCR's state grant, one  member of the Arts Council contrasted SCR with the Newport Harbor Art Museum,  which has five minority members on its 28-person board, drawn from the same  community as SCR. South Coast Repertory takes its role in the community  seriously. It can show its commitment even more with an ethnically balanced  board.  </P></p>

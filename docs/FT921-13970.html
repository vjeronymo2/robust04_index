			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins fails for second time to sell stake in Soporcel ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the paper group, has failed for the second time in as many years to sell its 42.8 per cent stake in Soporcel, the Portugese pulp and paper maker, writes Daniel Green. Yesterday it broke off negotiations with a consortium led by South Africa-based Mondi Paper, part of the Anglo American group. The consortium included Neusiedler, an Austrian paper company. Mr Stephen Walls, Arjo Wiggins' chief executive, said: 'We have always made it clear that we were only a seller on the right terms. The company's shares fell 17p to 258p. Arjo Wiggins would not say what the Mondi consortium had offered except that it was 'less than Pounds 126m'. That was the figure Arjo Wiggins accepted from Stora of Sweden, Europe's largest paper and pulp company, in 1990 before the deal was blocked by the Portugese government. The company said yesterday it still wanted to sell the stake, for which it paid Pounds 42m in 1985.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Independence exercised Sir, I agree with the conclusion of the Commonwealth report as carried in Michael Holman's article entitled 'Kenya poll overseer was removed from bench' (January 25), that there is no information or evidence to suggest that Mr Chesoni and other electoral commission members were associated with or taking directions from Kenya's ruling party. The commission exercised its due independence during the just concluded elections. M Ngali, acting high commissioner, Kenya High Commission, 45 Portland Place, London W1N 4AS</p>

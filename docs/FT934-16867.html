			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Gilts: Steady period in prospect DEMAND for gilts strengthened last week on the back of anecdotal evidence that inflationary pressures in the UK are unlikely to be a problem for some time. With little in the way of economic data on inflation, investors were quick to dive into the market to buy gilts at the first sign of any fall in prices. Such developments kept support fairly strong, in spite of last Wednesday's Pounds 3.25bn auction of 11-year gilts, which drained a large amount of supply. Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a yield drop of about 10 basis points, with yields being quoted at around 7 per cent on a par basis on Friday night. The auction means that the Bank of England has found buyers for three-quarters of the Pounds 45bn of gilts which it is estimated the UK will need to sell during 1993-94. During the week, demand from non-UK institutions as well as UK pension funds and insurance companies was steady. While prices dipped on the day of the auction, they recovered later as investors moved in to take advantage of the increase in yields. The next few days will see few economic data likely to affect demand for gilts. However, the markets will be watching for today's publication of the figures for the year-on-year rise in the M0 measure of money supply last month. City analysts expect this to be about 4.3 per cent, rather less than the figures for recent months. If they are right, the data can be expected to lift gilt prices, on the grounds that they add to recent evidence that the upturn evident earlier this year is slowing. Subdued expectations remain that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, could cut base rates, now at 6 per cent, during the next few days. He could announce this in his speech to the Conservative party's conference on Thursday. However, the consensus in the markets is that the chancellor is more likely to cut borrowing costs later in the year, possibly to offset any increases in taxes he might announce in the November 30 Budget. Many commentators think a rate cut might be needed to inject more life into the economy, which has been looking lacklustre in recent weeks. Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist of the Item forecasting group, relies for his views on anecdotes fed to him from 25 companies and financial institutions. He says: 'Because of a slackening in demand, industry is being extremely cautious about predicting any significant rises in output. Costs are generally under control and many companies are suffering from severe competitive pressures. As a result, I don't see any good reason to be worried about inflation.' Summing up the view of many financial commentators outside the UK, Mr David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, says: 'The British labour market has become a lot more flexible and cheap and as a result the UK looks in a good position to attract international industry. I don't think inflation in the UK is going to be an issue for the next 18 months or so.' If these views are correct, gilts can be expected to see a generally steady, if rather dull, period over the next few months. They may be helped by any general interest rate cuts in the rest of Europe but in the next few weeks few expect much in the way of any easing in monetary policy across continental Europe. At the Bundesbank this Thursday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, in his first council meeting as president, is expected to set the tone for such thinking and is unlikely to press for action on German interest rates.</p>

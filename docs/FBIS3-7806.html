The "Turija North 1" oil field is the largest of its kind  discovered in Serbia over the past three decades. According to  "Naftagas" manager Srboljub Stankovic, Turija and the eastern  part of Srbobran literally stand on oil. The subterranean field,  situated between two points at a depth of 2,000 meters is coated  in a layer of oil 47 meters thick.    Some $60 million has so far been invested in the "Turija  North 1" oil field. This year, another $32 million is needed  for the second phase of construction, while the third phase --  the construction of transportation systems and oil and gas  pipelines calls for another $11 million.    Around 86,000 metric tons of oil were produced in this area  last year. This year, the production of 120,000 tons of oil is  planned.    Vladimir Zivanovic, republican minister for energy, was  among  the many guests who attended today's celebrations.</p>

Reinart said Estonia is currently working on new wordings  for  the texts of the draft treaties, which he said now "hopefully  are also acceptable to the Russian side."    He expressed hope that progress will be made at the next  round of the talks, due to start on Apr. 5, also over the troop  withdrawal agreement. "This agreement was ready already once,  but because of the proposed amendments from the Russian side  some disputed wordings have come up," the head of the Estonian  delegation said.    Commenting on Russia's demands that the troop withdrawal  agreement must be signed together with an agreement on social  guarantees for the retired Russian military in Estonia, Reinart  said differences in opinions of the two parties still remained  over the latter.    "The greatest difference is that the Russian side would like  to set forth in the agreement the circle of the retired military  who are entitled to apply for a residence permit in Estonia.  Estonia's position, however, is that the agreement is not meant  to determine the circle of the retired military, but will  establish regulations on how the retired military would get  their pensions from Russia and how they will pay for medical  services," Reinart said.    The second major difference is over granting the retired  military the right to privatize their flats for vouchers.  Reinart said Russia wants that Estonia delivered to the retired  military its privatization vouchers for the time of their  service in the armed forces.    "Since Estonia doesn't give the vouchers even to Estonian  citizens for the years of service in the Russian army, this  means that the Russian side wants to have for the retired  Russian military a little more rights than the Estonian citizens  are having," Reinart explained.    The head of the Russian delegation for the talks, Vasiliy  Svirin, has said Russia will continue discussing the issue of  social guarantees for its retired military at the talks with  Estonia.    The 18th round of the talks will be held on Apr. 5-6 near  Moscow. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar has said Estonia plans  no changes in its delegation and will continue with its present  team.</p>

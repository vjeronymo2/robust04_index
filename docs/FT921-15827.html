			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Property Security hits Pounds 3m HIGHER RENTAL income and dealing profits enabled Property Security Investment Trust to more than double pre-tax profits in the six months to end-September - from Pounds 1.42m to Pounds 3m. Net property and investment income rose from Pounds 7.62m to Pounds 8.84m, while there were dealing profits of Pounds 43,000 compared to losses of Pounds 887,000. All interest in respect of investment properties continued to be charged to revenue. As from April 1 this year all interest in respect of dealing activities will be treated similarly, instead of being capitalised. Sales of investments in property and securities, amounting to Pounds 639,000 (Pounds 1.43m), were taken as extraordinary credits. Including those, earnings came to 2.27p (2.08p) and the interim dividend is stepped up from a scrip-adjusted 1.25p to 1.5p.</p>

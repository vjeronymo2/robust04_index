			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP;  </P> <P> * NICARAGUA HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITHOUT ORTEGA'S CHEAP SHOTS  </P> <P> Daniel Ortega was lauded when he stepped aside gracefully after losing  Nicaragua's presidency to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. But Ortega's grace seems  to have given way to taking pot shots at Chamorro's fledging effort to restore  economic health to that weary nation.  </P> <P> About 85,000 Sandinista-allied trade unionists are paralyzing Nicaragua's  public sector in the second general strike since Ortega ceded power to  Chamorro. The strikers presented strident demands, unsatisfied even though the  last walkout netted an 100% wage hike.  </P> <P> Union excesses are justified, according to Ortega, because Chamorro promised  and failed to bring prosperity to Nicaragua. Things were less moribund during  his term, Ortega contended, despite a horrific civil war.  </P> <P> Oh, sure.  </P> <P> Ortega's carryings-on smack of sour grapes: Chamorro's government is just nine  weeks old and the last Contra came in from the mountains only days ago.  </P> <P> The strikes fly in the face of the spirit that carried the elections and  persuaded the Contra rebels to put down their arms. Chamorro inherited empty  coffers, an unbelievable inflation rate of 36,300% and dormant agriculture and  industry. Chamorro, simply stated, faces the quixotic task of multiplying zero.  </P> <P> Even with massive infusions of U.S. aid, it will take the cooperation of all  Nicaraguans to repair the damage caused by a lifetime of despotism and warfare.  </P> <P> If Ortega is really eager to help, he should promote cross-ideological  reconciliation. The Sandinistas must step back and let Chamorro heal the wounds  of conflict.  </P></p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): HMSO services face disruption SERVICES PROVIDED by Her Majesty's Stationery Office face disruption after three out of four unions representing non-industrial workers voted for industrial action over pay. Members of the NUCPS and CPSA Civil Service unions and the GMPU print union voted for industrial action short of a strike over an offer which the unions say is worth 3.5 per cent in a year. Members are to be instructed by their leaders to refuse overtime work and to work to rule. The three unions are also considering a series of selective strikes by key groups of workers. One possibility is that they will call for strike votes among workers at Hansard, which publishes parliamentary debates. Apart from printing services, HMSO provides stationery and furniture for some government departments. The dispute is significant because HMSO is the first, and so far only, government agency to introduce a pay system outside national bargaining structures in the Civil Service. The government wants other agencies, and possibly entire Civil Service departments, to follow the HMSO example. Mr Graeme Watt, NUCPS national officer, said that even without strikes, the overtime ban and work to rule would slow the work of HMSO, causing delays for the public and government departments. Members of the IPMS Civil Service union voted to accept the offer which would mean deferring a pay rise for three months from last October, when the settlement was due, and receiving a 4.7 per cent increase for the rest of the pay year. Its leaders will nonetheless press for an increase, on the grounds that the 184 to 163 vote to accept the deal showed that there was considerable hostility to it. In other ballots the NUCPS produced a 198 to 173 vote for action and the CPSA voted by 250 to 94 for action. The 4.7 per cent offer compares with increases of at least 6.5 per cent won last year by civil servants covered by national pay bargaining arrangements. HMSO pointed out that most of the 2,000 non-industrial civil servants would win performance-pay rises of 5 per cent from April, in addition to the 4.7 per cent rise. It said anything above 4.7 per cent would have jeopardised its ability to meet last year's profit target of Pounds 4m, set in discussions with the Treasury. HMSO has refused the unions' request for arbitration. Mr Eddie Spence, CPSA national officer, said the options were a fight or a fair deal.</p>

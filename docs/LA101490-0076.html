			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COACH GETS 3 YEARS FOR MOLESTATION  </P> <P> A former Lawndale Little League coach was sentenced in Torrance Superior Court  Thursday to three years in state prison for molesting two of his team members.  </P> <P> Michael Steese, 34, pleaded no contest in June to two misdemeanor counts of  molesting the boys, who were 10 and 11 when the incidents occurred last  December and April at Steese's home, authorities said.  </P> <P> The sentence imposed by Judge John P. Shook was less than the five-year term  recommended by Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Geltz. Steese's conviction marks the  second time in two years that a league volunteer has been arrested for  molestation.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Lawndale Little League team manager William Anthony Boguille,  23, pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor counts of sexual battery for  regularly pulling down his players' pants to spank them. Boguille, who denied  that those events constituted molestation, was ordered to perform community  service and was placed on three years' probation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: THEY'RE BACK -- COFFEEHOUSES ARE PERCOLATING AGAIN IN THE '90S  </P> <P> The Unicorn, the Cafe Renaissance, the Bit, Caffe Espresso, the mysterious  Positano in Malibu and other L.A. area coffeehouses of the '60s are long gone  -- but a coffeehouse revival has recently visited our city, bringing us instead  such establishments as Java, Mama Pajama, Highland Grounds, the Living Room and  the new Axe (pronounced "ah-SHAY") in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Now veteran restaurant manager Lawrence Casperson wants to, as he says, "up the  ante" with a new coffeehouse-plus, which he plans to call the King's Road  Espresso Bar Cafe.  </P> <P> Casperson, a transplanted San Franciscan, has worked for Bay Area restaurant  entrepreneur Sam Du Vall since 1981 as a part of the management team that  opened Izzy's Steak and Chop House and Samantha's in San Francisco and the Ritz  Cafe and the Sugar Shack in L.A. (Du Vall has just invested the Sugar Shack,  incidentally, with a new menu, a new chef and a new name -- Mango Reef.) Now,  Casperson is joining forces with two fellow San Franciscans -- City Restaurant  head chef Wendy Brucker (who also cooked at Stars and Square One in S.F.), who  will create the King's Road menu and consult on the food while retaining her  position at City, and Bay Area artist Michael Brennan, who will design the  cafe's interior. "This is kind of an 'old friends from San Francisco' venture,"  offers Casperson.  </P> <P> "I'm actually a big fan of places like the Living Room and Java," he continues,  "but I want to do something a little different. We're going to offer food  that's something like you might typically see at a cafe in Italy -- panini  sandwiches, a couple of little pizzas, pannetone toast for breakfast, things  like that."  </P> <P> King's Road, to be located on the corner of that street and Beverly Boulevard,  approximately across the street from the Mandarette, is scheduled to open in  September.  </P> <P> NEW TABLES IN TOWN: Mauro Vincenti is about to open Pazzeria, which he  describes as "the pizzeria of Pazzia" -- on the site of the original Pazzia  bar, across the courtyard from the restaurant itself, and in a space adjacent  to the bar that he has recently taken over on La Cienega Boulevard. "Pizza,  pasta and vegetables" will be the theme, Vincenti says . . . A new La Salsa has  debuted in the Marina Marketplace complex in Marina del Rey -- the first unit  of the fast-food Mexican chain to be a full-scale restaurant, complete with 100  seats, waiter service and a full bar. This one is a franchise, owned by Michael  Condon, once a manager of the Ginger Man in Beverly Hills and later co-owner of  the now-closed Wave in Santa Monica. . . . Meanwhile, the California Pizza  Kitchen chain has just opened its latest restaurant, the 14th, on Ventura  Boulevard in Studio City . . . Richard and Jennifer Chang, owners of the tiny  Chang's Kitchen in Beverly Hills, have launched the full-sized Chang's Szechwan  and Seafood Restaurant in Palms. (Various members of the Chang family also own  restaurants in West L.A., Brentwood and Encino.) . . . And scheduled for an  Aug. 20 opening is Caffe Zaretti in Northridge, to be opened by Giancarlo  Zaretti, former proprietor of L'Etoile in West L.A. and Pontevecchio in Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> RESTAURANT MISCELLANY: The Bistro in Beverly Hills is closed for summer  vacation until August 27th. . . . J.W.'s Restaurant in the J.W. Marriott Hotel  in Century City features the wines of Sterling Vineyards and dishes prepared  from Sterling kitchen recipes in the latest installment of its "cuisine of the  wine country" series, through next Sunday, the 19th. . . . Emilio's in  Hollywood has started serving lunch: Thursdays and Fridays only.  </P></p>

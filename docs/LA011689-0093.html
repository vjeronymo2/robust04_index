			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEATTLE'S ELLIS SAYS ARREST MAY STRENGTHEN MARRIAGE  </P> <P> Dale Ellis of the Seattle SuperSonics says his marriage may become stronger as  the result of his arrest in a domestic dispute last week.  </P> <P> "The whole thing was blown out of proportion," Ellis told the Seattle Times.  "That's what happens when you're in the public eye. You're under a microscope.  You have to do the right thing all of the time.  </P> <P> "That's the sad thing about it. I don't really want to discuss what happened.  It's kind of personal. A little embarrassing. But you know, you argue the most  with people you love the most."  </P> <P> Ellis, 28, and his wife, Monique, have a 2-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> Ellis was booked into the King County Jail on charges of simple assault,  resisting arrest and having an outstanding warrant for driving without a  license. He was released after Seattle president Bob Whitsitt posted $1,800  bail.  </P> <P> "I feel that everything happens for a reason," Ellis said. "I think this  incident was a sign that there is something in my life that I need to change,  to re-evaluate. Now, I'm searching for what that is. Maybe it's something I'm  not doing right. My wife and I have talked about it. Maybe this will make our  relationship better. We'll start treating each other better."  </P></p>

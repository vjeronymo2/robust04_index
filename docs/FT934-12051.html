			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Badgerline profits in the fast lane BADGERLINE Group, the Avon-based bus company which is coming to the market next month, yesterday forecast that it would raise profits before interest and tax by 36 per cent in the current year, to at least Pounds 12.6m. Badgerline, which has grown into one of the UK's biggest providers of local bus services, will raise Pounds 36m by way of a placing and offer for sale, which will value the group at Pounds 100m. The company, which began as a Pounds 3m buy-out from the National Bus Company in 1986, now operates 2,300 buses and coaches in the Midlands, South Wales and the south of England. Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman, said this significant record of expansion demonstrated the ability of Badgerline's management team to improve the results of acquired businesses and outperform the market. He said: 'There are numerous opportunities for further expansion through the acquisition of both publicly and privately owned bus operators in the UK, whose performance can be enhanced by the management team. A number of such opportunities are currently under examination.' Badgerline forecast the sharp increase in profits, even though it does not expect much advance in turnover, which amounted to Pounds 127m last year. Mr Smallwood said the group was able to ehance profitability by improved marketing and productivity even in a stable market. Although bus passenger growth had fallen by 21 per cent in areas outside London in the last eight years, Badgerline's figures had increased by 3 per cent. The flotation will be sponsored by Lazard Brothers, and Cazenove will act as brokers. The prospectus will be published on November 10, with the offer closing on November 19. Dealings are scheduled to begin on November 26.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trades in narrow range on mixed data Wall Street US STOCK markets traded in a narrow range yesterday, following a mixed batch of new economic figures which provided little fresh information on the condition of the recovery, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.56 at 3,313.27, with the index spending all day only a few points either side of Wednesday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also finished slightly weaker, down 0.03 at 417.75, while the Amex composite closed 0.27 higher at 386.73 and the Nasdaq composite 0.14 firmer at 570.99. Turnover on the NYSE was 187m shares. The day's economic statistics were a mixture of good and the bad. The 0.1 per cent increase in July consumer prices was good news, as was the bigger-than-expected 0.5 per cent rise in last month's retail sales; but that was offset by a big downward revision of the June retail sales data, which was changed from an original 0.5 per cent rise to a fall of 0.3 per cent. If the last two months are taken together, the figures show that retail sales growth remains very weak. The latest weekly jobless claims numbers were also released, revealing a 66,000 fall, but the figures were heavily distorted by the recent temporary shutdown of some General Motors plants. Overall, the economic data provided no real direction for the market, explaining why share prices languished in a narrow range. Among individual stocks, General Motors rose in early trading on news that the car maker's Hughes subsidiary has forged a pact to get billing services for its satellite television service from Digital Equipment and Network Computing. After weak 10-day car sales figures were released, however, GM fell back to end down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36 1/2 . Northrop fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 25 1/8 after two broking houses, Wertheim Schroeder and Prudential, cut their earnings estimates following the announcement from the company of a Dollars 2.13 a share charge for the third quarter. Gap Stores firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 7/8 in turnover of 2m shares on news of second quarter profits of Dollars 37.7m, up slightly from a year ago. The company also reported that comparable same stores sales were up 6 per cent on last year. Ohio Edison rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22 in turnover of 1.1m shares after the utility announced that it would freeze its basic electricity rates until the year 2000 and provide Dollars 75m to fund energy-efficiency projects for consumers. On the Nasdaq market, SciMed Life dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 in heavy trading after the Baltimore-based brokerage house, Alex Brown, downgraded the stock from a 'strong buy' to a 'buy' because of concerns about flat market share growth. American Software plunged Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 on a profits warning. Canada TORONTO shares ended lower for the second consecutive day, in moderate trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index lost 17.30 points, or 0.51per cent, to close at 3,360.45. Declines led advances by 285 to 238, volume of 21.2m shares was well below the previous 38.2m, and trading value was CDollars 246.2m against CDollars 404m.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (8): From peak to shining peak - Temperatures run high at the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange THE Kuala Lumpur stock exchange has been breaking records this year. The composite index has reached successive peaks and the number of shares traded has sometimes exceeded levels in New York and Tokyo. Following a round of privatisations which brought companies such as Telekom (the telecommunications network) and Tenaga (the electricity utility) on to the market, the KLSE's market capitalisation of more than Dollars 100bn is now comfortably ahead of regional rivals Bangkok and Singapore. The increased volumes and the rise in the index, however, have not always moved in step. The first half of the year was characterised by frenzied activity from local speculators, largely in secondary stocks. Volumes soared - on April 15 more than 1bn shares worth about Dollars 1bn changed hands - but the index, dominated by blue chips, responded only sluggishly. Trading patterns were typical for a developing market in a booming economy; as in Bangkok a few months earlier, investors piled into a maelstrom of speculation and share-ramping by syndicates. Some brokers slept in their offices at night as they struggled to keep up with the paperwork, and chartered helicopters to shift scrip around the country. 'Before they would buy 10 lots (of 1,000 shares), now it's 100 lots,' said one stockbroker of his clients. Money held offshore by ethnic Chinese businessmen flooded back into the country as confidence in the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar, strengthened. A lack of rights issues as a result of a reorganisation of the market's regulatory system has left investors with plenty of cash, although that is likely to change in the remaining months of this year. Each political rumour, each hint of a tenuous business deal in China produced a flurry of activity in the stock concerned, a trend encouraged by a series of tentative agreements signed by Malaysian businessmen during a visit to China in June by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister. It was the smaller stocks that were attracting the most attention. The price of a small property company called Granite, with a handful of employees and an unimpressive track record, increased more than tenfold on the back of an agreement to install thousands of gambling machines in north-east China. Other China gaming plays soared as well. Timber stocks rose as the price of logs on the international market climbed sharply. Companies with strong government connections, such as Renong, were bought heavily, with speculators assuming they would benefit from contracts for large infrastructure projects; sometimes several competitors for the same deal were ramped one after the other, brokers said. Political manoeuvering ahead of elections in November for posts in the United Malays National Organisation (Umno, the dominant party in the government) has added further zest to the stock market. Attention is focused on an expected tussle between Mr Abdul Ghafar Baba, the incumbent party deputy president and deputy prime minister, and his undeclared challenger Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister. Speculators buy stocks in companies linked to politicians they believe will do well in the election. Conversely, they also buy companies connected to probable losers, on the grounds that the losers will be persuaded to withdraw in return for financial favours from the eventual winners. Stockbrokers believe that the finance ministry will, before the election, rush through a plan to list the state Heavy Industries Corporation of Malaysia (Hicom), probably by means of a reverse takeover involving New Serendah, a small listed rubber company whose share price has jumped in anticipation; an allocation of 30 per cent of the shares to Bumiputras (Malays) at a substantial discount is likely to give the Malay community a pre-election windfall. Perhaps inevitably, the bull market has been marked by an element of greed. Traditional blue chip stocks such as the Sime Darby conglomerate are considered too dull for speculators interested only in quick profits. 'When you tell a client the upside of a share is 20 to 30 per cent, they say they're not interested - they want 100 per cent,' said a local stockbroker. The dangers of such a febrile market were demonstrated recently by a fiasco involving Union Paper, a small toilet paper manufacturer thought to be a target of a reverse takeover bid by a property and financial cooperative dominated by Umno members. The shares soared to more than 10 times their original value and then plunged, leaving some speculators in default, apparently because of illegal short-selling. The new Securities Commission, established earlier this year, has investigated the affair and is expected to make an announcement soon. Union Paper's shares were suspended. It was a salutary lesson for small investors, who subsequently lost some of their enthusiasm for second board stocks and took more interest in blue chips. Both the KLSE and the Commission are attempting to tighten regulation of the market to curb share manipulation and put a stop to misleading company announcements, although foreign and local brokers have yet to be convinced that the regulators have teeth. 'People start to feel that there is one place where they can make quick and big money,' acknowledged Mr Nik Mohamed Din, KLSE executive chairman. 'When the market becomes bullish there are bound to be some problems that come up. We are very concerned and very vigilant to avoid situations where people benefit through manipulation,' he said. 'If we do not check this kind of activity then the market will not be sustained. One of these days it will just burst.' While the KLSE is demanding more frequent and accurate announcements from companies - about, say, their deals in China - the Commission is tasked with investigating other misdemeanours and with streamlining the hitherto bureaucratic procedures for new listings. Other developments include the proposed establishment of the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Kloffe) by a politically well-connected private sector consortium (in the face of initial opposition from the Kuala Lumpur Commodities Exchange and the KLSE), and the slow implementation by the KLSE of its central depository system for immobilising scrip and reducing paper transfers; 11 shares from the second board have been included so far and the KLSE wants to bring in the other 60 or so second board companies by the end of 1993, and to complete the entire process within five years. Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, has issued call and put warrants on the composite index. Although some foreign brokers are unsure whether Kuala Lumpur needs complex derivatives markets at this stage in its development, they are confident in the underlying strength of the KLSE, which now has nearly 400 companies quoted on its main and second boards. Brokers in the Malaysian capital also believe that the threat to their turnover posed by the over-the-counter CLOB market in Singapore - which Mr Nik Mohamed describes as a 'black market' - is gradually diminishing, especially as CLOB does not deal in newer arrivals on the KLSE such as Tenaga or Telekom. The KLSE itself says there are 69 foreign funds with investments in the Kuala Lumpur exchange, and foreign interest has increased since the middle of the year, pushing up the index - if not the volume - after the local speculators eased off. 'In the first half of the year, it was retail-driven, but in the past month or two it's swung around the other way towards institutional buying,' said Mr Eugene Marais of Baring Research (Malaysia). 'Foreign interest has surged.' Even if much of the trading by Malaysian investors on the exchange is purely speculative, the economy remains robust and continues to grow at eight per cent or more a year. Average earnings per share are forecast to rise 13.5 per cent this year and 15 per cent in 1994. By mid-August, however, Kuala Lumpur shares were starting to look pricey to investors interested in fundamentals, especially when compared with rival stocks in Asia's other fast-growing economies. The KLSE's prospective price/earnings ratio for 1993 was more than 22, and even for 1994 it stood at 20. 'It's quite expensive,' said one broker.</p>

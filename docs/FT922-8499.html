			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland in NZDollars 53m bid - Surprise move follows Countrywide's downgraded forecast THE BANK of Scotland yesterday announced it was making a full bid for the Countrywide Bank at a cost of NZDollars 53m (Pounds 15.8m). The surprise move followed a downgrade in Countrywide's forecast profits this year and difficulties in raising equity capital from minority shareholders. Under last month's agreement, Bank of Scotland was to take a 60 per cent stake in the enlarged Countrywide, following the latter's purchase, for NZDollars 182.5m, of the United Bank from the troubled State Bank of South Australia. As part of that deal, Bank of Scotland announced it was buying a 20 per cent holding in Countrywide from General Accident, the UK insurer. It would underwrite Countrywide during its expansion and capital raising, which would make it the sixth largest retail bank in New Zealand. However, a statement from Countrywide yesterday linked Bank of Scotland's decision to make the full bid to Countrywide's demand for capital following the United takeover. It said equity of about NZDollars 180m, compared with Countrywide's current capital of NZDollars 133m, would be needed to replace short-term funding needed to buy United. The statement to the New Zealand stock exchange said Countrywide's profit for the year to June 30 would be 'disappointing'. Normal trading profits after tax would fall to about NZDollars 9m (NZDollars 17.9m) as a result of continuing pressures on interest margins and bad debt positioning. Combined with the extra costs that would be involved in taking over United, that had led directors to re-evaluate prospects of raising the extra capital required in the present market through the planned cash issue. Countrywide directors said that a 'closer examination of the problems involved' had led to the conclusion that Bank of Scotland should accept full responsibility for the long term capital needs of United. A significant reduction in minority holdings would have occurred had Countrywide gone ahead with the cash issue, they said. All directors, including three independents, supported Bank of Scotland's bid of Dollars NZ2.05 a share, the same as paid to General Accident for its holding. Before the takeover, Countrywide shares were trading at NZDollars 1.90. Bank of Scotland explained yesterday that it had decided to purchase the outstanding 40 per cent stake in Countrywide when it became clear that raising extra capital through a rights issue would have been expensive for minority shareholders. It would have had to underwrite the rights issue and would probably have ended up increasing its stake in Countrywide in any case. It was therefore better, the bank said, to make an outright offer for the remaining stake.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government will propose to North Korea that a working-level  meeting be held on exchanging special envoys if Pyongyang issues  visas to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors on  Friday.    The decision was made as Pyongyang expressed hope that Seoul  would take the initiative in resuming inter-Korean dialogue at  working-level meetings with the United States in New York on  Wednesday and Thursday, informed sources said.    If North Korea and the United States reach agreement at  their  meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang will call a high-  level strategic meeting to prepare a telephone message to his  North Korean counterpart offering to hold the fourth  working-level meeting on exchanging special envoys.    The message under consideration is expected to call for a  working-level contact on the southern side of the truce village  of Panmunjom early next month.    In line with the working-level meeting, informed sources  said, Seoul will reportedly announce suspension of the annual  South Korea- U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" provided that  North Korea cooperates fully with International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspection activities and shows sincerity toward  inter-Korean dialouge.    Pyongyang and Washington met again in New York on Thursday  to  continue discussions on follow-up measures to North Korea's  acceptance of IAEA inspections.    The two are said to be near a compromise and may announce a  set of agreements after meeting on Friday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN envoy has not been able to visit Kigali,  contrary to expectations. Can we talk of a mission failure?  Thierry Perret put the question to the Canadian Jean-Guy  Plante, military spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda]:    [Begin recording] [Plante] No, I would not say it was a  failure, one could rather talk of difficulties. Mr. Riza has in  fact had [word indistinct] from the representatives of the  Patriotic Front. He did not meet the commander of the patriotic  forces, but he met important figures in this movement. So one  cannot really talk of a failure. Mr. Riza is expected to met  the representatives of the Rwandan Government and the chief of  staff of the Rwandan Army tomorrow.    [Perret] So it seems that the UN envoy intended to visit  Kigali but could not do so, why?    [Plante] He could not visit for security reasons. The route  he was expected to take is under the control of the Patriotic  Front. The latter preferred to warn us that this route was not  secure. He will board a plane of the Canadian Armed Forces for  Kigali tomorrow. This plane, which comes regularly to Kigali,  landed in the capital today for the first time in five days.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The main European and world ceremony celebrating  international labor day on 1 May, was held in Sarajevo today.  The secretary generals of the three largest trade union  confederations in Europe and the world visited Sarajevo today  for the occasion. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Ejup Ganic, member of the  Bosnian presidency, also addressed the meeting on behalf of  President Izetbegovic and the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency.    [Begin Ganic recording] It is not by accident that the  world's largest trade union confederations have chosen Sarajevo  as the venue for this year's main May Day celebration. This  reveals a bad conscience because the world has failed to do all  that it can for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Workers, those who are  least to blame for the failure to act, are doing this to catch  the attention of UN politicians, politicians of all countries,  people who hold the power. In the name of human solidarity, in  the name of the moral and political principles they uphold, they  should not have left a country of hard-working people, a country  of culture, science, and work, to the tender mercies of the  armed chetnik gangs. What is all the more humiliating is that  this country and its people have been denied the right to defend  themselves by the imposition of an unjust embargo on the import  of arms.    The so-called protected area of Gorazde was defended by the  courage of almost unarmed defenders who sustained the assaults  by the aggressors equipped with (state-of-the-art) weapons of  mass destruction. Those who prevented a more effective defense  and protection of Gorazde and its residents are the accomplices  of the crime in that town. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

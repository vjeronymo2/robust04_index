			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Deals at attractive prices whet investors' appetites STRONG demand for a Dollars 400m offering for the Republic of Austria and a Pounds 100m issue of subordinated debt by Abbey National yesterday showed that, even in rather lacklustre market conditions, investors' appetites can still be tempted by attractively-priced deals issued by strong credits. The inventory of unsold paper left over from last month's deluge of aggressively-priced dollar deals has not yet been cleared, but is being passed over in favour of attractively priced sovereign paper. Yield spreads of some top quality paper have continued to narrow. In particular, the World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn 10-year global issue is now yielding two basis points less than the comparable US Treasury. Consequently, Austria's 10-year deal, priced to yield 25 basis points above the comparable Treasury, appeared attractive, even against deals which have performed poorly, like Credit Local's 10-year issue currently trading at 27 basis points over the 10-year Treasury. The recent dip in supply of dollar paper may persist due to the relative lack of swap opportunities, although demand for paper is improving, as investors take a more positive view on the dollar. The Austrian deal had an unusual triple-currency swap structure: the interest payments are swapped into D-Marks while principal will be repaid in Swiss francs and yen. In the sterling sector, Abbey National successfully raised Pounds 100m of subordinated debt, which will count as lower-tier two under Basle capital adequacy guidelines. Abbey holds a high proportion of tier one capital, due to the substantial amount of equity raised when the bank was floated in 1989, but is seeking to build up its tier two capital in order to make more efficient use of its equity, an official said. The deal met strong demand, especially from UK fund managers who focused on the attractive 90 basis point spread for a double A-rated credit, rather than the subordinated status of the debt. By the end of the day, the deal was offered at a spread of 88 basis points above the 10-year gilt. The reception of the issue was not marred by confusion on Friday, when J. P. Morgan began to syndicate the deal, under the misapprehension that the mandate had been awarded to Morgan to launch the deal at a spread of 95 basis points above the gilt. Dealers said the positive reception also reflected the generally bullish sentiment pervading the sterling bond market. Continental European as well as UK demand remained firm as investors focus on the likelihood of lower interest rates. 'The market is not factoring in the possibility of a Labour victory' in the forthcoming UK elections, according to one trader. However, swap spreads are unattractive, so the supply of new issues is likely to be limited. The Abbey National deal was swapped into floating-rate sterling. In the Ecu sector, the Council of Europe added an Ecu135m tranche to its outstanding Ecu365m two-year deal.</p>

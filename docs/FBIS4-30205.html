			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Watchara Charunsantikun and Charuwan Loetwinyu] </F>   [Text] The Court of Directors of the Bank of Thailand  yesterday ruled against introducing special measures to tackle  rising prices, even though the inflation rate in May rose to 5.1  percent compared with the same month last year.    The central bank has set a target for inflation of 4.2  percent in 1994. The first five months have already seen  inflation rising by 4.8 percent compared with the end of last  year.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he had ordered the  authorities to closely monitor building material prices to  prevent significant impact on overall inflation.    Siam Cement Co, the largest cement producer, has also been  asked to hold prices to avoid raising the national inflation  rate further.    Chuan said the situation was not worrisome and recent  increases in interest rates ought to slow down excessive  spending.    The Bank of Thailand earlier warned that commercial banks  were extending excessive credit, especially for personal  consumption. Banks' total credit extension grew 24.7 per cent in  the first five months of this year compared with the same period  last year. The target set for 1994 is 21 per cent.    Bank Governor Wichit Suphinit said there was no sign of a  "bubble economy", a notion used for a high growth and overheated  economy which collapses suddenly as witnessed with the recent  economic trend in Japan.    Yet, he admitted that the economy has seen a big  month-to-month jump in inflation by 1.1 percentage points in May  and the second half of 1994 was likely to see higher domestic  spending.    "The current weak monetary policy ought to be able to  curtail  inflation from rising too high. We are still at a deterrent  state and there is no need to take tough action," he said.    Informed sources said the current higher inflation rate is  caused by three factors. The first is a 48 percent attribution  from supply shortages -- especially of raw materials used in the  production of industrial goods -- of commodities such as cotton,  timber, fruit and vegetables (due to drought).    The second, with a 40 percent weight, is what is described  as  the demand-pull factor, especially in services.    The cost-of-production factor is assessed to have  contributed  12 percent to the total weight of the current level of inflation.    However, concerns about a possible bubble economy continue  among top central bank officials, according to sources,  especially if domestic spending should keep on rising. This is  caused by the 7-8 percent rise in the wages of blue collar  workers and 20-30 per cent increase in the wages of white collar  workers and of civil servants. High export growth has also  contributed to higher spending.    Higher oil prices have also resulted in the current account  deficit surpassing the 5.4 per cent target in relation to gross  domestic product. It was 5.5 percent in the first five months.    Sources quoted Wichit as telling the central bank directors  that Thailand's inflation rate is higher than Singapore and  Malaysia but lower than Indonesia, South Korea and the  Philippines.    Foreign Liabilities of banks in May also climbed by Bt  [baht]  31 billion over the previous month to Bt354 billion, or twice  the amount at the end of 1993. Overseas loans have been used to  support high domestic credit growth.    Phisit Li-atham, the central bank spokesman, disclosed that  credit extended by foreign and local banks inclusive of offshore  banking facility, grew a hefty 24.7 per cent in the first five  months, but deposits grew only 14 per cent. As a result, the  credit/deposit ratio reached a record high of 120.9 per cent.    He described the five-month economic performance as  satisfactory although credit growth was three percentage points  higher than the target and total outstanding credit edged closer  to Bt3 trillion.    "We think that the credit system is still disciplined  enough.  We may have to closely monitor some institutions. With the  capital adequacy floor rising from seven to 7.5 per cent now and  to 8 per cent next year it should reduce the credit growth  pressure on top of previous interest rate increases," said  Phisit.    The public sector reported higher cash surpluses in May with  the total for the first eight months of the current fiscal year  reaching Bt8.9 billion, and possibly reaching another Bt50  billion in the four remaining months of the fiscal year.    Budget revenue is up 14.7 percent during this period  compared  with the target increase of just 12 percent. Expenditure is up  17.9 per cent which is close to the target.    "The expected budget surplus of Bt60 billion this fiscal  year  will help to ease the inflationary pressure," Phisit said.    The manufacturing index during this period grow at a slower  pace in May to 10.5 per cent, with a private investment rate of  9.7 percent.</p>

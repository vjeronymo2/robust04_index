			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RIA report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Russian Arms </F> Export Up"]    [Text] The export of Russian arms and military hardware in  1993 was up 11.7 percent, standing at $2.15 billion.  Interestingly, the share of products intended for export  amounted to as little as 5.2 percent of the arms manufactured.  This was announced by Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the Russian  State Committee on the Defense Industry. He admitted that the  number of arms importing countries had fallen to 26, that is to  half of what it was at the time of the former USSR in 1990.  Importantly, Russia has virtually lost an arms market in the  Baltics, where arms now come from Israel. According to him,  Moldavia [Moldova] is increasingly orienting itself in its  imports policy toward Romania, while arms suppliers in China,  Iran, and Turkey are actively working in the newly formed states  of Central Asia.    Still, Glukhikh thinks that the CIS market should be a  priority for Russia. There is a considerable quantity of  weapons there created on the basis of the former Soviet  standards and arms systems which are being produced in Russia.  To boost arms exports, the head of the State Committee on the  Defense Industry thinks, one should arrange for supplies of  spare parts for military hardware, servicing, repairs, and  modernization of armaments delivered. These problems will be  tackled as a package by the recently created "Rosvooruzheniye"  state company.</p>

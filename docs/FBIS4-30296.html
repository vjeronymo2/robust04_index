			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan Directly Involved in War of Aggression on Korea -- </F> Memorandum of DPRK Institute for International Affairs" -- KCNA  headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Institute for  International Affairs on June 23 published a memorandum opening  to the world public concrete data proving that Japan  participated in the June 25 1950-July 27 1953 war of aggression  on Korea. The memorandum was released when the revived Japanese  militarists have been creating a grave danger to peace and  security not only on the Korean peninsula but also in the rest  of Asia, not bothering to conceal their intention to commit  another military aggression against the Korean people. The  memorandum consists of four parts, "1. Japan prepared with the  United States for a war of aggression on Korea", "2. Japan  served U.S. Forces as a logistic base, supply base, repair base  and attack base during the Korean war", "3. Japan was directly  involved in the Korean war" and "4. Japan directly participated  in the germ warfare, too".    According to the memorandum, 850 munitions factories had  been  returned to Japanese monopoly capitalists by the U.S.  occupation forces in Japan by 1949, and 645 Japanese arms  factories had resumed production toward the end of 1949.  (Japanese book "Postwar History of Japan" Part I, 1970 edition,  p. 60).    In 1949, the year before the outbreak of the war in Korea,  Japanese arms factories supplied the South Korean puppet army  with 40,000 rifles, more than 2,000 bazookas and 40,000 shells,  a large number of 105 mm howitzers and 37 mm and 57 mm anti-tank  guns, flame throwers, 60-80 mm mortar guns and 700,000 shells,  mines and over 2,000 machine guns and submachine guns and  upwards of 4,900 trucks. (Japanese book "Reunification of Korea  and Human Rights", 1976 edition, p. 116).    The United States reorganized and rearmed the Japanese Army  under the name of "police". In March 1948 the United States  enforced a new police system in Japan and increased the police  force to 125,000 men and armed them with weapons and equipment  of U.S. Army's type.    In a letter to the then Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida July  8, 1950, Macarthur, the then commander of the U.S. Forces in  the Far East, instructed him to found a new "police reserve  force" 75,000 strong and reinforce the existing military  strength of the maritime safety agency by 8,000 men.  Subsequently, the Japanese Government enacted Decree no. 260  and organized the "police reserve force" with soldiers of the  old Japanese Army. (Japanese book "History of Japan", Vol. 22,  "Contemporary History 1," 1977 edition).    While the Korean war was raging, Japan was virtually a  warring party which played the role of both a quite actual  logistic base and munitions factories. (South Korean magazine  "MAL", June, 1990).    The United States purchased various kinds of munitions it  needed from Japan. The specially ordered munitions for the  Korean war in the period from May to the end of 1950 amounted to  about 300 million dollars. (Japanese book "Japanese Imperialism  and Military Industry", 1979 edition, p. 80).    Napalm bombs called a devilish weapon in the Korean war was  mass produced by the Nissan Motors, (?Shii) Iron, Toyo Heat  Industries, Fuji Industries-Handa, Showa Motors and other  Japanese companies, and this accounted for 90 percent of the  special orders for the U.S. Airforce in the Far East. (Japanese  book "Modern History of Korea", 1953 edition, p. 266).    In the period from May 1952 to June 1953 Japanese factories  produced and supplied to the U.S. Forces about 2,000 artillery  pieces of different calibres, 7,656 bazooka- type anti-tank  guns, 400,000 rocket shells, 1,200,000 shells, 2,300,000 mines  of various kinds and 2,200,000 handgrenades. (Japanese magazine  "ECONOMIST", June, 1952).    Japan earned a colossal amount of money and laid a  groundwork for "a high-rate economic growth" by producing and  supplying weapons and military equipment specially ordered for  the U.S. Forces in the Korean war. (South Korean magazine "MAL",  June, 1990, p. 164).    But for the Korean war, there would have been no high- rate  growth of Japan. (Japanese book "Basic Vision of the Korean  Question", 1976 edition, p. 178).    The U.S. imperialists installed and used 612 military bases  and setups in Japan during their war of aggression on Korea.    U.S. warplanes made 700 to 800 sorties daily, 900 to 1,000  sorties at times, from their Airforce bases in different parts  of Japan including Okinawa and Aomori for promiscuous  scorched-earth operations. (Book of the former Soviet Union  "Korea Revives", 1956 edition).    The main force of the U.S. First Marines Division got aboard  ships at Nagoya, Japan, and the Seventh Infantry Division at  Yokohama and the Seventh Fleet rounded off preparations at  Sasebo for a landing operation in Inchon, Korea. (Japanese book  "Korean War" Vol. 4, 1969 edition)    Most of the ground, Naval and Air Forces of the United  States  conducted operations with Japan as their bases. (Japanese book  "Postwar History of Japan" 1941 edition, p. 65)    The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters expressed their  will  to participate in the Korean war before the war broke out.    Hirokawa of the Liberal Party, a friend of then Japanese  Prime Minister Yoshida, in July 1949 called for participating  in a possible war on the side of the United States, saying that  the "duty of the Japanese is to join their efforts with the  United States." (Book of the former Soviet Union "U.S.  Imperialism in Japan," 1951 edition, p. 100)    A reporter of TELEPRESS said in February 1951 that the  United  States recruited 140,000 Japanese for a war against the Korean  people. (Book of the former Soviet Union "U.S. Imperialism in  Japan," 1951 edition, p. 49)    Japan disguised the Japanese unit as "unit of Japan-  resident  Korean volunteers" to conceal its investment in the Korean war.  (Japanese book "History of Modern Korea" 1953 edition, p. 266)    In September 1950, 30,000 Japanese were attached to U.S.  technical and transport units to participate in the landing  operation in Inchon and 10,000-strong Japanese "police reserve  force" took part in military actions on the side of the  aggressor. (Book of the former Soviet Union "U.S. Imperialism  in Japan," 1951 edition, p. 49)    Mine sweeping was mostly done by the Japanese Navy before  the  landing operations of the U.S. Forces, and Japanese ships were  mobilized in the transport of U.S. war supplies.    According to data announced by the ships bureau of the  Japanese Ministry of Fisheries on October 14, 1950, Japan  mobilized 248 ships for the Korean war from July to October  1950, transporting 995,800 tons of U.S. war supplies.    And Japan mobilized transport ships from November to  December  1950 to ensure the retreat of the Tenth Army Corps of the U.S.  imperialist aggression forces which was hit hard in the northern  half of Korea. (South Korean magazine "MAL" June 1990)    Japan served as the base of the germ warfare of the U.S.  imperialists in Korea.    The U.S. medical institute in Omiya, Saitama Prefecture, had  taken over the bacteriological institute of the Japanese Army.  The U.S. Forces manufactured bacteriological weapons there  through researches.    The U.S. imperialists mobilized germ experts of the old  Japanese Army, war criminals, in a germ warfare in Korea.  ("Report of the International Academic Committee on the  Investigation Into the Germ Warfare in Korea and China," 1952  edition, pp. 12-13)    The U.S. imperialists had planned a germ warfare against the  Korean people from the end of 1950 and conducted living body  experiments on prisoners of war with germ weapons manufactured  in Japan.    TASS from Prague and TELEPRESS from Rangoon December 12,  1951, reported that a warship carrying Shiro Ishii, Tsujiro  Koetsu, Masaji Kitano and other germ experts of Japan left for  Korea to participate in a germ warfare. (South Korean magazine  "MAL", June 1990)    The U.S. imperialists killed tens of thousands of innocent  Koreans by spreading pest, cholera, smallpox, typhoid and other  infectious diseases with germ weapons with the help of Japan  during the Korean war.    They dropped large quantities of germ weapons on Sinchon  county of Hwanghae Province, Munchon county of Kangwon Province,  Pyongwon, Ongchon, Yongwon and Taedong counties of South Pyongan  Province and other areas in the February- May period of 1952.    Thus, Japan inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and  sufferings  on the Korean people by participating in the war of aggression  in Korea started by the U.S. Imperialists, in violation of  international laws and its "peaceful" Constitution.    The Japanese militarists, far from drawing a lesson from the  history, scheme to jump into flames, pining for the days of the  Korean war of aggression when they "acquired a windfall,  roasting chestnut in the flames." Those who are fond of fire are  fated to die in fire.    If the Japanese reactionaries expect another "shower of  gold"  in a "second Korean war", it is a big mistake.</p>

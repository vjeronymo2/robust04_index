			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY FAILS TO OVERCOME EARLY MISTAKES IN 31-20 LOSS  </P> <P> Antelope Valley College's excursion Saturday night onto the synthetic turf at  East Los Angeles College was hardly what one would call a magic carpet ride.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley turned the ball over three times in the first quarter, fell  behind, 21-0, and spent the remainder of the game playing catch-up in a 31-20  Foothill Conference loss.  </P> <P> East Los Angeles (3-3, 3-1 in conference play), the Foothill's top offensive  team, piled up 408 yards against the conference's second-best defensive unit.  But the Huskies turned the ball over six times, allowing Antelope Valley  (3-3-1, 2-2-1) to stay close in the second half.  </P> <P> ELAC's Adan Avina, the conference's leading rusher, gained 201 yards in 36  carries and scored on runs of 10 and two yards. Avina also scored from 28 yards  on a screen pass in the second period.  </P> <P> The Huskies' defense, ranked sixth in the conference, held Antelope Valley to  two yards rushing and 146 total yards.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley quarterback Cole Speer threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Abe  Ivory late in the second quarter, and the Marauders trailed, 24-6, at halftime.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley closed to within 24-12 when Ivory scored on a one-yard run  after Birk Sopsher's interception of a Larry Razo pass in the third period.  </P> <P> But Avina's two-yard touchdown run on the ensuing possession gave the Marauders  a 19-point lead.  </P> <P> Razo threw another interception, at the Huskies' two, and Ivory scored his  third touchdown on a two-yard run late in the third quarter.

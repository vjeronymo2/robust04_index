			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANCELED BOOK ADDS FUEL TO JERUSALEM POST TIFF  </P> <P> The Jerusalem Post on Thursday canceled publication of a book about human  rights in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, making a move that is  sure to fuel conjecture that the influential and traditionally liberal paper is  taking on a marked conservative slant.  </P> <P> The book, entitled "Essays on Human Rights," was edited by Meron Benvenisti,  the leading Israeli authority on the occupied lands. It was one of a series on  the occupied region that the Post's book-publishing department was putting out.  </P> <P> Benvenisti is suing to have the book published as planned. "This is clearly an  attempt to suppress the book. The act reflects the publishers' real political  views," he stated.  </P> <P> There have been months of tumult at the Jerusalem Post after its purchase last  year by Hollinger Inc., a Canadian company. Post editor Erwin Frenkel and about  30 editors and reporters have resigned to protest what they called editorial  interference by the new publishers, who are represented by a retired army  colonel, Yehuda Levy.  </P> <P> Publisher Levy maintains that cancellation of Benvenisti's book is part of a  streamlining operation to make the Post profitable.  </P> <P> "Our move has nothing to do with human rights," he said. "We have simply  decided to break away from activities that have nothing to do with the  newspaper."  </P> <P> Levy has been in control of the manuscript since early December but said he had  not read it.  </P> <P> The Post has been advertising the seven-volume "West Bank and Gaza" series for  several months; five books have been already published. The planned sixth  volume, "Essays on Human Rights," covers topics such as confiscation of  Palestinian land, labor conditions for Palestinians, the legal system in force  during the Arab uprising and censorship of Arab publications.  </P> <P> The Post, which is published in English, came under attack by Prime Minister  Yitzhak Shamir last year for its hard-hitting reporting on the intifada, or  Arab uprising. Shamir is said to have especially resented the Post's reach to  foreign audiences through its weekly international edition.  </P> <P> The drama at the paper is part of a larger debate in Israel over the role of  the press, both domestic and foreign, in covering the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict. Government officials say reporters skew coverage to favor the  Palestinians. Journalists are chafing under steady attempts to limit coverage  of the conflict through censorship and military prohibitions on traveling to  the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> In a column published Jan. 21, Yosef Goell, a member of the Post's editorial  board, sharply criticized the newspaper's past coverage of Israel, which he  characterized as "scorched-earth" journalism.  </P> <P> "A definite pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli bias had begun to creep into the  newspaper in its treatment of news linked to the Palestinian, territorial and  intifada issues," Goell wrote. Several other staff members attacked Goell's  remarks.  </P></p>

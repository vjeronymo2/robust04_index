			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLES SCRAMBLE FOR FOOD AHEAD OF HIKES  </P> <P> Poles fought to buy meat and besieged other food stores today, one day before  massive price increases meant to launch a Western-style market system.  </P> <P> "Don't take pictures! It's already humiliating enough to line up like this,"  people shouted at a news photographer as they fought to get into a bare-shelved  state meat store in Warsaw that had only sausage to sell.  </P> <P> Prices of meat and most foods are expected to soar 200% to 300% on Tuesday when  meat rationing ends after seven years and prices are partly freed under a  government "marketization" plan widely condemned as ill-prepared and lacking  sufficient compensation.  </P> <P> In Parliament, outgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski and Finance Minister  Andrzej Wroblewski faced impeachment threats for triggering 100% inflation, a  huge budget deficit, collapse of the currency and massive food shortages.  </P> <P> Communist parliamentary deputies approved Rakowski's proposal for Interior  Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak to be the party's candidate to succeed him as prime  minister following Rakowski's election as Communist Party leader Saturday.  </P> <P> Rakowski's 10 months as prime minister have seen a rapid deterioration of the  economy on all fronts. Industrial output has fallen and Poland is currently  accepting emergency food donations from the European Community.  </P> <P> Tuesday's food price rises will plunge 60% of Poland's 38 million inhabitants  below the poverty line, according to some Communist Party officials who oppose  the government's plan.  </P> <P> Government, Solidarity and other opposition leaders have forecast a possible  public upheaval that could sweep away an agreement on political and economic  reforms that has set Poland on the path to parliamentary democracy.  </P></p>

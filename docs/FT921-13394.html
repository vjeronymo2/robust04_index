Mr Jean-Paul Gut, head of the Matra subsidiary's international operations, said the Korean contract is the first stage of a multi-phase procurement programme for the Korean armed forces over the next four to five years. The Korean order marks the entry of Matra as a defence supplier in Asia and is the first of five to be announced from the region.

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (5): Madrid Bolsa's watchdog - CNMV THE public share issue undertaken by the government-controlled banking group Argentaria last month was similar in size and public impact to that of Repsol, the energy group, in 1989. The difference was that a rumpus followed the allocation of the energy group's oversubscribed equity four years ago - but all was ostensibly peace and quiet in the equally demand-driven allocation of Argentaria shares. The Repsol issue brought the Madrid Bolsa's watchdog, the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores, CNMV, into the centre stage for the first time. Then recently formed and modelled on the SEC, the CNMV took a very critical look at the manner in which a limited number of Madrid security houses had bent and broken rules in order to obtain extra volumes of Repsol paper for their clients. Some houses were fined by the CNMV in the wake of the energy group's share offering and one was ordered to cease operating. There was no need for any such disciplinary action last month when Argentaria came to the market. The banking group, with the benefit of hindsight and also with the experience of public issues in the UK, took a series of steps, such as the creation of a shareholder register in advance of the offering, that the trail-blazing Repsol placement had failed to undertake. The absence of controversy was a backhanded compliment to the CNMV. 'It is not that we have learnt our job better,' says Mr Luis Carlos Croissier, the commission's chairman, 'It is the market that has learnt that it cannot act with impunity. Anyone who wants to commit an irregularity should think three times.' But it would be quite wrong to assume that all is now transparency and ethical behaviour. There are malpractices on the Bolsa as there are on every other market. One who in the past year apparently failed to think three times about committing an irregularity - or, rather, a series of them - was a former chairman of the Bolsa and the former chairman of the now defunct Ibercorp bank. Mr Manuel de la Concha came under CNMV scrutiny for failing to properly identify shareholders, among them a former governor of the Bank of Spain, who had invested in one of his funds and for giving a select group of them who were his personal friends preferential treatment. Mr Croissier says the collapse of Ibercorp and the subsequent investigation of its directors was 'a positive catharsis' for the financial sector. What he regrets is that the public may have come to expect too much from the commission. It is not its job to assess bad debt risks and to ward off bankruptcies. It is proving considerably harder for the CNMV, however, to unravel the the extremely complex web of interests that were built up in Spain by the Kuwait Investment Office through Grupo Torras, the investment arm that the KIO set up in the 1980s and which went into receivership six months ago. Potentially the investigation is politically sensitive. This is because opposition parties claim that Grupo Torras investments should have been approved by the cabinet because the KIO is an agency of a sovereign nation. The government says that approval was unnecessary because the purchases of Spanish assets were made by companies which although owned by the KIO were based in the Netherlands and therefore they were treated as investments from the EC. To a great extent the CNMV, which is still a young institution with a small staff, is learning the regulatory business as it goes along. This was illustrated at the end of last year when a bitter fight to control a small property group prompted allegations that the CNMV was favouring one of the parties, the powerful Banco Bilbao Vizcaya banking group. The row erupted when BBV's property unit failed to submit a written counter bid for the target company and ran instead a series of press advertisements in which it urged shareholders to reject what they were being offered because it intended to improve the first bid. Under the terms of takeover rules published in 1991, the BBV's unit should have registered its competing bid with the CNMV together with a pricing prospectus. The CNMV took the view that there was nothing in the takeover code that explicitly prohibited successive informal bids. Critics said such an attitude severely comprised its position as a regulator. Mr Croissier stands by his interpretation of the rule book. Ultimately, what the CNMV seeks is the best deal possible for minority shareholders. In the row over the property company his judgment was vindicated because the original bid was first improved and the final price to minority shareholders was higher still when the two competing parties eventually presented a joint bid. As with the Repso share issue, the market has taken another lesson on board. An important precedent was established and it will apply to future takeover battles.</p>

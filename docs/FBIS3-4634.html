Regent H. Karimujddin  Hasjbullah stated that agricultural reform is being considered  to deal with a difficult period as collections under the PBB  [Tax on Land and Buildings] from the agricultural sector decline  when production from the Arun natural gas field comes to an end,  about nine years from now.    The regent made this statement on 12 January at his first  meeting with reporters in 1994. The statement was made in  connection with the concern felt by a number of community  leaders about how to deal with the situation after the natural  gas deposits run out. He emphasized that Aceh Utara will  certainly have difficulty obtaining development funds after the  natural gas deposits in the Arun field dry up. At present this  vital project in Aceh Utara provides about 25 billion rupiahs in  PBB taxes annually.    Regent Karimuddin Hasjbullah stated that the first priority  and central point of emphasis in future development will be  agriculture, concentrating on horticultural and agricultural  estate production, in addition to continuing to develop the  output of paddy and soy beans. The production of these crops has  increased since several technical irrigation projects have begun  to function. What remains to be done, requiring attention and  follow-through, is an effort to deal with the marketing of these  crops. Until now this has always been a problem for the farmers.    According to the regent, half of the PAD (basic provincial  tax income) has come from the payment of PBB taxes by vitally  important companies in the Lhokseumawe industrial zone, such as  Mobil Oil Indonesia (MOI), Parun Natural Gas Ltd., PT Pupuk  Iskandar Muda (PIM), PT [limited company] ASEAN Aceh Fertilizers  (several types of fertilizer), and PT Kertas Kraft Aceh (KKA)  [Aceh Kraft Paper Company]. He said: "When the natural gas  deposits dry up, provincial income will decline. Until now gas  production has supported the steady implementation of  development activity. However, we should not be too pessimistic."    Karimuddin continued that, in view of the natural resource  potential of the area, it is only the agricultural sector which  could bring in new resources to replace declining PBB tax  revenue from the mining sector, which will be forced to halt  operations altogether. However, to strengthen the economic basis  of the agricultural sector, the regional government must  stimulate agricultural development, beginning now. To do that,  large amounts of money and hard work will be needed.    Most affected by the drying up of the natural gas wells is  the Regency of Aceh Utara. Meanwhile, nine other regencies in  Aceh and the Aceh provincial government itself will also lose  PBB tax revenues from the mining sector. However, the other  regencies have become used to shortages and limitations  affecting their budgets, and the consequences will not be  particularly felt.    Dr. M. Djakfar G. Hatta, a staff assistant of the regent for  the economic sector who was formerly chairman of the North Aceh  Regional Development Board, said that Aceh Utara will be very  seriously affected because about half of the budget, which at  present ranges between 55 billion and 62 billion rupiahs  annually, will be lost. Meanwhile, the Aceh provincial  government still has rather large additional sources of revenue,  such as city taxes, the motor vehicle tax, and tax receipts from  other large industries.    In fact, Aceh Utara has a rather large amount of  agricultural  land. However, since the Arun natural gas field was discovered  in 1972, all groups have concentrated on gas and easy money and  have not paid attention to what must be done for the good of the  regency. No one thought that the natural gas wells would dry up  in 20 years or so. Agricultural fields were forgotten, and  agricultural development was delayed for 10 years.    Djakfar G. Hatta supported the regent's view that Aceh Utara  must rebuild the economic strength of the agricultural sector to  what it once was. However, he went on to say, this effort will  be increasingly difficult because the majority of the farmers  have abandoned their agricultural fields, and some of the land  has been sold. The farmers now work as laborers. Meanwhile,  thousands of hectares of rice land have been used for the  industrial zone.    Regent Karimuddin Hasjbullah stated that in the large  agricultural plantation subsector Cot Girek Plantation IX is  carrying on an overall diversification program, converting some  of its land planted to sugar cane and rubber to oil palms. At  present the estate agricultural company is building a modern  factory for processing palm oil which is expected to go into  production in 1994. In addition to planting its own oil palm  area Cot Girek Plantation also needs oil palm seeds produced by  individual farmers and under the PIR [Smallholder Nuclear  Plantation] program.    According to the regent, the District of Kuta Makmur is now  moving quickly to become an oil palm plantation area. Many small  and medium-sized businessmen are establishing oil palm  plantations. Meanwhile, local people are also beginning to plant  oil palm trees. He said: "Efforts like these will support an  improvement in community economic welfare."</p>

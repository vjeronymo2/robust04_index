			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Dinkins' parade boycott could cost Irish votes: Gay group holds counter-demonstration after federal court upholds march ban NEW YORK'S Mayor David Dinkins threw political caution to the wind yesterday when he decided to boycott the city's annual St Patrick's Day parade yesterday because the event's Irish-American organisers had banned an Irish lesbian and gay organisation from joining the ceremony. The mayor's decision, which could alienate New York's many Irish voters as well as other ethnic groups who are Catholic, came in the wake of a federal court ruling that used a technicality to uphold the banning of gay marchers. On Monday night, Judge Pierre Leval ruled that the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organisation was too low on the waiting list of groups wishing to join the parade to be admitted by its sponsors  - the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Mr Dinkins, who became the first New York City mayor to snub the parade in 38 years, said he would have preferred to have taken up his traditional position at the head of the parade, but could not do so in good conscience. 'It is a sad day in our city,' he said. Other leading Democrats who joined the mayor in boycotting the Irish event included Mr Andrew Stein, the city council president, who plans to challenge Mr Dinkins for the mayoral nomination next year. Governor Mario Cuomo, who had not planned to attend, issued a statement in which he expressed his solidarity with the lesbian and gay group. Traffic in midtown Manhattan was blocked near the two-mile-long Fifth Avenue parade route, as an estimated 150,000 marchers danced, sang, played music and chanted. Just before the parade began, the Irish gay marchers staged a brief counter-parade and demonstration near the Plaza Hotel at the south-eastern corner of Central Park. An aide to Mr Dinkins said he hoped the decision to boycott the parade would not cost the mayor votes. But the political backlash could extend beyond Irish-Americans, especially since a major supporter of the traditional Irish and Catholic communities is Cardinal John O'Connor, the outspoken and ultra-conservative archbishop of New York. Mr Cornelius Doolan, a 58-year-old native of Cork who served yesterday as grand marshal of the parade, was said to be sympathetic to the request by Irish gays to join the march, but Mr Doolan told one local tabloid it was not his 'function' to get involved in the debate that has gripped the city. His only comment on the eve of yesterday's parade was: 'You can bet there will be a parade, darlin''.</p>

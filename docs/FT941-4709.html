			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Company-car drivers confess to sins Company-car drivers are nearly twice as likely to break motorway speed limits than private motorists. They also break speed limits on other main roads more readily and admit to parking illegally more often. This unflattering portrait of company-car drivers is set out in the latest annual survey of the business-car community by polling organisation MORI and Pragma Consulting. The survey was commissioned by Lex Vehicle Leasing, owned by Lex Service and finance house Lombard North Central. MORI's soundings among fleet managers about the differences between men and women found that 'in general women are thought (by fleet managers) to be better and safer drivers and that they look after their vehicles better'. Younger fleet managers were more likely to feel that women made better drivers. More pertinent in terms of the costs incurred by companies on repairs and insurance premiums, when asked 'Who in your organisation has most accidents?', 43 per cent of the managers said men and 54 per cent saw little difference. Only 4 per cent said women. The survey concludes that the percentage of company cars, at 11.3 per cent of the total, is higher than for several years and that the population has increased by 50,000 in the past 12 months. The average age of the cars has fallen from 2.8 years to 2.5 years in the past 12 months, indicating that companies are increasing the replacement rate. Mr John Walden, Lex Vehicle Leasing's managing director, sees this as a sign that business confidence is improving. He said: 'Companies make investment decisions, like replacing company vehicles, when they are confident that the business climate is improving. The survey results . . . clearly indicate a turnaround in business outlook'. Only 1 per cent of company-car drivers surveyed said their companies were phasing out company cars. More than 4,000 stolen cars were offered for sale to dealers in the last quarter of last year, reflecting a continuing surge in car-related crime and fraud, according to HPI, the vehicle information tracking agency. HPI also found last-quarter increases in vehicles written off by insurance companies being repaired and re-offered for sale, and more cars being offered for sale while still subject to hire-purchase agreements. The agency makes about 3.5m vehicle-background checks a year for auction houses and the motor trade. Mr Brian Bailey, HPI's chairman, said part of the rise was likely to be seasonal and related to financial pressures in the approach to Christmas. But there was also a 'worrying underlying trend' driving the statistics upwards. 1994 Lex Report on Motoring - The Company View.

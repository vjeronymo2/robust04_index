			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAXICARE SAYS IT WILL TRIM PAYROLL AGAIN;  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE: THE AILING HMO IS TRYING TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY  PROCEEDINGS.  </P> <P> Embattled Maxicare Health Plans Inc., once the nation's largest for-profit  health maintenance organization, will again trim its payroll by laying off an  undisclosed number of workers at its Los Angeles headquarters.  </P> <P> Maxicare, which at its height in the mid-1980s employed 7,000 workers and  provided medical services for 2 million people in 27 states, said it decided to  trim its 800-person work force to further cut costs and reorganize itself so  that it can emerge from its nearly yearlong bout with Chapter 11 bankruptcy  proceedings.  </P> <P> "The layoffs will not be inconsequential," said Maxicare spokesman James B.  Lucas, who nevertheless declined to say how many Maxicare employees might be  affected. But he said senior managers as well as support staff would be laid  off.  </P> <P> "We are continuing the decentralization of management functions at Maxicare and  moving authority and accountability down to the local level as we prepare to  emerge from reorganization," Lucas said.  </P> <P> The decision on layoffs, which was reached in a special senior management  meeting Thursday, came two days after Maxicare had formally filed a proposed  plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Maxicare, which last March filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11  of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, has proposed to distribute cash, notes and a new  issue of common stock to satisfy creditor claims. The proposed layoffs, which  had not been disclosed to employees, were not mentioned in the plan.  </P> <P> "They have an uphill battle because their name has been so badly damaged by  what's gone on," said Randy Huyser, a health-care analyst at Montgomery  Securities. "It's a real shame that Maxicare shot itself in the foot by  leveraging itself" in the mid-1980s when it got heavily into debt to buy  competing health maintenance organizations.  </P></p>

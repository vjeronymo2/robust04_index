			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexander Barrios in Caracas from the "Union </F> Radio News" newscast]    [Text] Upon leaving Technical Judicial Police [PTJ]  facilities, where he has been registered in the police corps'  criminal files, former President Carlos Andres Perez termed as  an absolute outrage the Supreme Court of Justice's [CSJ]  decision to issue an arrest warrant for him.    [Begin recording] [Perez] You cannot mistreat a man who has  struggled 50 years for Venezuela and has twice been president of  the Venezuelans!    [Unidentified reporter] The terms of the document....    [Perez, interrupting] The Venezuelans believe in me!    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Perez] The fact is there are no charges against me. That is  a...[pauses] that report published in EL UNIVERSAL is shameful.  The fact is there is no evidence about anything, yet the charges  against me are incredible. I am accused of helping stabilize  democracy in Nicaragua and that the person who received  Venezuelan state security funds was President Violeta Chamorro,  an prominent Latin American woman. This accusation is  interference in the executive branch's purview of international  relations. [end recording]    The former president reiterated that under no circumstances  does the law allow him to reveal how the secret funds were spent.    [Begin Perez recording] No one knows how the secret funds  were distributed because it is a secret, and the law forbids me  to reveal that. Second, there is absolutely no evidence or proof  of anything. Third, international relations is the exclusive  purview of the president of the Republic, meaning the executive  branch, and the CSJ is interfering in the executive branch's  activities when it tries to establish guidelines for how to  handle the state's foreign security affairs. [end recording]    Following these statements, former President Perez left the  PTJ facilities and went to the site of his imprisonment, that is  El Junquito Jail. The triumphant way in which the former  president left was surprising--waving to all those had gathered  in front of the PTJ building.</p>

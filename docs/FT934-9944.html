			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (1): The glitter starts to fade - Big improvements in the country's infrastructure testify to the benefits of EC membership. The creation of the single market has, however, brought agriculture and industry face to face with competition from more advanced neighbours THE TIDE of euphoria that has buoyed Portugal since it joined the European Community in 1986 is ebbing fast. The high growth rates of the late 1980s have given way to recession, and the political stability which cemented business confidence for more than a decade can no longer be taken for granted. The EC has lost its glitter as companies grapple with competition within a single market. Unemployment is rising and foreign investors no longer find the country almost irresistible. 'The pessimism that is gripping Portugal is a natural reaction to less spectacular rates of growth,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based partner with consultants Arthur Andersen. 'Portugal could not go on being the star of European growth forever. The pace of economic development is having to be reined in.' One of the most telling signs of Portugal's economic slowdown was a massive budgetary overrun in 1993. This brought embarrassment for the centre-right Social Democrat government of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and deep concern for the business community. In October, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister, was forced to announce a supplementary budget for 1993 because low tax revenue and higher than forecast social security spending had almost doubled the budget deficit compared with original forecasts. This year's budget deficit is now forecast at Es1,000bn (Dollars 5.8bn), 8 per cent of gross domestic product, against an original forecast of Es576bn, 4.6 per cent of GDP. The forecast deficit for 1994 is Es776 billion, 6.9 per cent of GDP. 'The budget deficit is our most acute worry,' says Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, the central bank. 'No governor can be happy with a 7 per cent deficit.' Mr Beleza's dissatisfaction with budgetary performance appears to reflect a sharp difference of opinion between the finance ministry and the central bank over key areas of economic policy. But Mr Braga de Macedo is far from bowed by the heavy deficit. He points out that EC economies are forecast to contract by about 0.5 percentage point this year - a far cry from earlier hopes that the 3 per cent growth rates of the late 1980s could be maintained. Portugal will continue to out-perform the Community as a whole, he points out, and the government remains committed to the goal of economic convergence and to participation in economic and monetary union (Emu), currently set for 1997 or 1999. For the average Portuguese worker, there is a concrete goal behind the ideal of convergence: wages moving towards the same level as those elsewhere in Europe. In the heyday of Portuguese growth, the philosophy behind pay negotiations was that wages could catch up with the rest of Europe, but that objective has had to be put aside, at least temporarily, as the recession bites. 'For our firms to remain competitive in the single market, we simply cannot offer workers more than main trading partners such as Germany, Spain and France,' says Mr Braga de Macedo. In tense negotiations for a national wage pact in 1994, the government is offering public administration employees a zero rise and others workers four per cent. The talks appear likely to collapse over a difference of half a percentage point which is preventing unions, employers and government from reaching a deal. The convergence of wage levels is only one aspect of Portugal's relations with the EC that is beginning to turn sour. The Portuguese have been fervent Europeans since membership, and many vital new infrastructure projects bear witness to the billions of Ecus that have poured in from Brussels since 1986. But the opening of the single European market this year has brought industry and, particularly, Portugal's backward agricultural sector face to face with the reality of competition with far more advanced neighbours. Trucks carrying Spanish pork have been attacked and fish, fruit and milk dumped in the streets as farmers protest against cheaper, better quality goods from abroad. 'The vast majority of the Portuguese are strongly pro-European,' says Mr Antonio Guterres, the leader of the main opposition party, the Socialists. 'European policy is an area in which the two main parties are in basic agreement.' But clearly Brussels is no longer seen only as the bountiful provider it once used to be. Socialist party policy differs only slightly from the Social Democrats in other areas, too. This has undermined Mr Guterres' attempts to present the Socialists as a clear alternative to the Social Democrats in government. Critics say the Socialists are too fragmented and have failed to take sufficient advantage of the Social Democrats' weaknesses to make a viable bid for power. The Socialist Party is also overshadowed by the figure of Mr Mario Soares, the president of the republic and a former Socialist leader. The president is often ironically referred to as the leader of the opposition. As president Mr Soares is officially supposed to remain above party politics. But in view of his capacity to veto government legislation, to send laws to the constitutional court for vetting and to expose social ills in his tours of the country, the president is often seen by the prime minister as one of the forcas de bloqueio, or opposing forces, that are supposedly hampering the government's reform programme. By the time of the next general election in 1995, Mr Cavaco Silva will have ruled Portugal with an overall parliamentary majority for a decade. The key question is whether he can win a third consecutive majority, particularly in a markedly less favourable economic climate. In two recent television debates, the prime minister polled only a 45 per cent approval rating against 80 per cent for Mr Guterres. The next real test of the two main parties' standing will come in local elections in December, when the Socialists will be fighting to hold on to Lisbon, Oporto, and other cities which they won in a backlash vote against Mr Cavaco Silva in the last election. As voters face up to economic realities, their attention is likely to turn away from new motorways, bridges, and shiny bank frontages, built during the years of economic expansion, to the state of Portugal's health, education and social security systems. The lack of resources for improving these services will influence the electorate, says Mr Cunningham. Many analysts think it is unlikely the Social Democrats will win a third overall majority, and believe they will be forced into coalition with a small right-wing party. But gloom and uncertainty are not universal sentiments in Portugal. A thriving cultural scene has blossomed with economic development, led by a younger generation less concerned with politics than their predecessors of the 1970s and early 1980s. Lisbon has been elected European Capital of Culture in 1994. Four years later the city will stage a Universal Exhibition. If all goes to plan, Expo '98 will transform derelict dock lands to the east of the city into a thriving centre of the arts. By then - provided the Portuguese and EC economies have attained higher growth rates - the country should have something to celebrate.</p>

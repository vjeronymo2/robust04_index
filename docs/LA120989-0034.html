			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS FIGHT NEEDED MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE  </P> <P> No mas, no mas.  </P> <P> Pay-per-view fights should come complete with a money-back guarantee. If the  performance isn't appealing by the midway point, you can call in and ask for a  refund. I'd rather watch a Rocky film. Or the WWF.  </P> <P> Cease boxing's Senior Circuit before one of them actually has to throw a punch.  The Hearns-Leonard draw was a joke and I've seen better fights in the Coliseum  stands than the Duran-Leonard waltz I got suckered into paying for Thursday  night.  </P> <P> GARY MIEREANU, Northridge  </P></p>

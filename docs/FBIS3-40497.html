The Necessity for Introducing Low-Pollution Vehicles and  the Reasons for Selecting the Vehicle Types Covered in the Study </H3>   In Japan the abatement of atmospheric pollution has been  advocated for quite some time, and to date, various types of  measures have been devised to counter the so-called fixed  sources like factories, e.g., emission concentration controls,  aggregate emission volume controls and restrictions on fuels  used by factories and the like.    As a result of the use of petroleum-fueled internal  combustion engines as the motors for automobiles, they too, like  the other fixed pollution-generating sources, have become the  source of a considerable portion of the total volume of urban  exhaust gases.    For this reason, and in light of what is known about the  behavior in the environment of various substances in exhaust  gases and their effects on the human body, a systematic, phased  response has been devised within the technical framework of the  petroleum-fueled internal combustion engine designed  to abate exhaust gas from automobiles, e.g., through the  establishment of long-term technology development goals by the  Central Environmental Pollution Countermeasures Council, etc. As  a result, current petroleum-fueled internal combustion  engines may be safely called combinatorial aggregates of  incremental improvement technology which responds to  widespread demands for environmental considerations in addition  to such primary requirements for automobile engines as fuel  consumption and horsepower, etc.    In addition, a great many businesses, beginning with the  road  transport carriers, and other parties associated with road  transport, the ones using automobiles, have been giving their  due cooperation as well in reducing environmental impact by  implementing rational operations along with timely and  appropriate introduction of vehicles which have been improved in  this manner.    Although regular progress is being demonstrated in this way  by the restrictions on individual substances in exhaust gases  from automobile units, the volume of automobile travel brought  about by growth in the national economy is increasing, and the  overall volume of exhaust gases continues to rise.    Where this trend is particularly evident is in the  environmental problems of the greater metropolitan areas like  Tokyo and Osaka. Specifically, there are many areas where the  environmental standard for nitrogen dioxide (NO[.sup]2[/])  has not been achieved and there is no trend of improvement in  evidence. In order to cope with this situation, the ``Special  Measures Law Concerning the Reduction of the Total Amount of  Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Emitted by Automobiles in Designated  Areas'' was passed in June of this year, and the basic policy,  etc. for reducing the total volume of NOx is scheduled to be  clarified by autumn of this year. According to the Environment  Agency, once this law is put into effect, environmental quality  standards will be attained by the year 2000; however, the  popularization of substantial numbers of low-pollution  vehicles is being counted upon to achieve this goal.    Furthermore, social concern over current environmental  issues is in transition to a global environmental approach  on issues like global warming from carbon dioxide  (CO[.sup]2[/]), and acid rain which is attributed to sulfur  oxides (SOx) and NOx, etc. In addition, a more global sweep is  being evidenced, e.g., the UN Conference on the  Environment and Development was held in Rio de Janeiro in  June of this year, and a Climatic Changes Framework Agreement  (Treaty to Prevent Global Warming) obtained the signatures of  more than 150 countries.    The amount of CO[.sup]2[/] emissions per person in Japan  is among the lowest group among the developed nations, but the  amount of these very CO[.sup]2[/] emissions is equal to  approximately 5% (276 million tons) of the world total,  fourth  highest in the world. Japan has established an Action Plan  To Prevent Global Warming designed to promote systematic,  comprehensive measures to deal with global warming and says that  it will achieve per-capita CO[.sup]2[/] emission volumes  which are at the 1990 level in the year 2000. A considerable  amount of effort is going to be required to achieve this target.    That being the case, hereafter, in response to consciousness  of environmental issues in which the focus will likely be placed  on the global environment in this manner, the  question of whether or not some sort of specific results will be  achieved by petroleum-fueled internal-combustion engine  automobile technology while pursuing the conventional  policy of incremental technical improvements is  likely to become an issue.    Regarding this point, there are those who indicate concern  about trade-off issues between existing technologies already  developed in response to conventional technical requirements,  and there is concern that, increasingly, the technical options  are becoming far too narrow and the solutions more difficult.    Naturally, while we continue to feel that it is important to  keep up with technical challenges in this fashion, there are  limits to coping with present and future environmental issues,  and to overcoming and improving on them with this approach  alone. Especially now, when the trend of society as a whole is  to demand material contributions toward protecting the  environment from those connected with road traffic, e.g., a  great many businesses, beginning with all road transport  carriers, it is necessary to accelerate actions and measures  designed to protect the environment by everyone concerned in  order to take some sort of obvious steps.    In particular, the deterioration of the urban environment,  e.g., the failure to achieve NO[.sup]2[/] emission standards,  etc., is being pointed out, while on the other hand, at present,  when it is being recognized that prompt implementation of  comprehensive measures like the elimination of extreme  concentrations or the improvement of traffic flow by the  promotion of road maintenance and upgrades is, very regrettably,  difficult, the adoption of a comprehensive, tandem approach of  seeking and promoting possibilities for using  low-pollution vehicles (low-emission vehicles) or  vehicles with no exhaust gas (zero-emission vehicles)  is being recognized as necessary and significant.    It is recognized that some of the so-called  low-pollution vehicles have matured in terms of their  stage of technical development to the extent that it is possible  to evaluate them as subjects of study. This study committee  adopted such a viewpoint, and on the assumption that there are  vehicles which have possibilities for mitigating in all aspects  the environmental impact from automobile exhaust gas which would  be used by road transport carriers who now have great occasion  to use diesel vehicles, which have contradictory characteristics  concerning both CO[.sup]2[/] and NOx in particular, and also  that the degree of their technical maturity has reached a  prescribed level, the committee decided to subject four types of  vehicles to study, i.e., energy-regenerating-type hybrid  vehicles, methanol vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG)  vehicles and electric vehicles.    In addition, the decision was made to give consideration to  comprehensive introductory support measures so that these  vehicles could be introduced in as smooth a replacement cycle  for conventional vehicles as possible. In line with this, we  studied whether or not it is possible to use each of these  vehicles as productive assets.    As one of the steps in the study, the committee decided to  gain an understanding of the operating structures of the road  transport carriers which would correspond to the actual  operation of the four types of low-pollution vehicles and then  to do a compilation of vehicle use realities in the road  transport industry, to include vehicle procurement methods.    The committee decided that if, after having illuminated the  realities of vehicle usage learned in this manner and having  confirmed that a market exists which could match the performance  of low-pollution vehicles, it should be determined that their  autonomous popularization could not be anticipated in terms of  the operating structure of the industry, they would take under  consideration policy support measures.  <H5>  II. Operating Structure of Road Transport Carriers </H5> <H5>  1. Size of Freight Carrier Firms </H5>   We will gain an understanding of this from various types of  data concerning the present status of freight carriers. However,  since the currently available data predates the effective date  for the Second Law on Material Handling, the data still contains  distinctions such as route and area, etc. According to the  classification of a small or medium enterprise established by  the Minor Enterprises Act, as of the end of March 1991,  99% of  area carrier firms and 83% of route carrier firms fell  under  the small or medium enterprise classification. When divided into  route and area classifications, small firms accounted for a  great majority of area trucking firms in terms of  capitalization, number of employees and number of vehicles. On  the other hand, among route trucking firms, it appears that  those capitalized at &yen;100 million or more accounted for  17%, while those with 301 or more employees accounted for  19%,  and that these large firms account for a considerable share of  transport.    Thus, there are a great many medium and small-sized firms  among the road transport carriers, and so in order to bring up  the diffusion rate of low-pollution vehicles, it is important  that we begin working on firms at this operating level and not  just the large firms.

Operating Conditions </H5>   In order to gain an understanding of the business and  operating realities of road transport carriers, we will analyze  various kinds of business indicators by size of the carrier  firms.    First of all, in looking at the settlement of accounts  status, in route trucking, 13 firms were operating at a loss in  contrast with 98 firms operating at a profit, while in area  trucking, there were 194 in the black and 28 in the red. No  particular difference in the ratio of firms operating in the red  was detected in correlation with route and area trucking.  However, when analyzed by size, in contrast to the absence of  any correlation to size for firms operating at a loss among the  area trucking group, none of the firms operating at a loss among  the route trucking group were found among firms with 101  vehicles or more, and one could say there is a clear difference  correlating to size among the route trucking firms for the ratio  of firms operating at a loss.

Route trucking has risen to the  4-5% level and area trucking has leveled off at the  5% level.  On the other hand, this figure is at the fairly high level of  7-8% for manufacturing and 7% for the retail  industry.  Nevertheless, in the wholesale industry this level is low at  5%.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 2-4.

The average rate of recurring profit on total capital  for route trucking is 5.4% and falls below that for firms  other  than those with 1-20 vehicles or with 301 and above. In  addition, there appears to be a difference in the ratio of  recurring profits to operating revenue which correlates to the  size of the firm. In the case of area trucking, the correlation  between this difference and size is all the more apparent. In  particular, the average for firms with 1-20 vehicles is  -1.6%  and a great many of these firms are operating in the red.       Chart 2-5.

This  represents the ratio of liquid assets to current liabilities,  and normally, when this ratio exceeds 100%, one can  conclude  there is no need to worry about short-term solvency. In  connection with route trucking, other than firms with 1-20 or  with 301 or more vehicles, this ratio falls below 100% and  there is lingering concern about short-term solvency. On the  other hand, in the case of area trucking, excluding firms with  20 or less vehicles, this ratio exceeds 100% and from the  standpoint of liquidity, one can say that area trucking firms  are in better shape. Also, when the ratio of long-term  capitalization to fixed assets (where one evaluates the  operating status of long-term capitalization) exceeds  100%, it  indicates that there are current liabilities requiring  short-term repayment in connection with the portion which is in  excess and that it is being covered by fixed assets capital. In  route trucking, firms other than those with 1-20 or 301 or more  vehicles, and in area trucking, firms with 20 or less vehicles  exceed 100%. Also, among these firms, the individual net  worth  ratio is declining as well.       Chart 2-6.

Note: In the majority  of firms among small and medium-sized enterprises, profitability  is low, and their operating efficiency and financial structure  too are not altogether good. In particular, the liquidity ratio  is quite a bit below 100%, and one could say that there is  lingering concern about their short-term solvency.  <H3>  3. Total Expenditure and Composition for Freight Carrier  Firms </H3>   In order to analyze the operating realities of the firms, we  study the composition of the various expenses incurred in the  course of their business activity. According to small and medium  cost indicators compiled by the Small and Medium Enterprise  Agency, the average sales volume of a sound enterprise is  &yen;309 million, and 96.1% of that goes to cover total  costs  with fixed costs accounting for 37.5% and variable costs  for  58.6%. Also, the personnel cost ratio, including welfare  costs,  employee training and the like, is 38.8%. Fuel costs,  repair  costs, and depreciation costs are cited as expense items  relating to vehicles during the course of business. Depreciation  costs average &yen;13 million and as a ratio of operating costs  have grown to 13.6%, a sales volume ratio of 4.4%,  second only  to executive salaries and allowances. As for other industries,  e.g., manufacturing, the figure is &yen;39 million, 3.2%  of the  total cost structure; for the wholesale industry it is &yen;9  million, 0.4% and for retail, it is &yen;2.5 million,  1.1%.  Vehicle fuel and repair costs average &yen;8 million,  2.5% of  the total cost structure.       Chart 2-7.

Among area trucking firms, vehicles account for 5.0% of  the  fixed asset depreciation costs. Also, in totaling up fuel costs,  maintenance costs and depreciation costs, they account for  7.6%  of operating costs among route trucking firms and 14.1%  among  area trucking firms, and the cost burden relating to vehicles is  growing for area trucking firms.    Further, if you examine these costs by the numbers of  vehicles, the weight of vehicle depreciation costs  for route trucking firms with 50 or less vehicles, it exceeds  the average for route trucking firms. Among area trucking firms,  the ratio of vehicle-related expenditures is higher overall when  compared with that for route trucking firms, and here again, the  depreciation cost component ratio is higher among smaller firms  with 50 vehicles or less.    The introduction of low-pollution vehicles is a very  important business issue for road transport carriers. As  evidenced in the indicators of the Small and Medium Enterprise  Agency, compared with other industries, their depreciation cost  burden is higher, and according to MOT indicators, it is obvious  that the smaller the enterprise, the larger the burden for fuel  costs, maintenance costs and vehicle depreciation costs  accounted for in operating costs. In the future, when weighing  measures to popularize and promote low-pollution vehicles, it  will be necessary to consider handling measures with business  realities such as these fully in mind.

Bus Company Business Realities </H5>   In examining bus company business realities, both private  and  public, it is obvious that they have become deficit-prone  business operations. According to the motor transport business  indicators of the Road Transport Bureau of the MOT, as far as  can be determined by the indicators when averaged, bus service  operators, both private and public, are operating at a deficit,  and even charter bus firms have a very low earnings structure.  In particular, public bus service companies are running  substantial operating deficits. Of the general bus service  companies which qualify to receive MOT regional bus subsidies  (333 firms), no more than 55, 16.5%, are operating in the  black, and the overwhelming majority have lapsed into deficit  operations.    In addition, bus companies have high capital investment in  vehicles and buildings and the like, and a high fixed assets  ratio (fixed assets/net worth), even in comparison to trucking  firms. That is also manifested in a low rate of turnover of  total capital (operating revenue/total capital), and the fact  that revenue is extremely low compared to the scale of  investment and that investment efficiency has deteriorated is  obvious. Because this operating structure has become intrinsic,  with the exception of public companies, the liquidity ratio  (liquid assets/current liabilities... indicates the ability to  make external payments) of bus companies has dropped below  100%, and they are confronting credit-related problems.    When we look at costs per operating kilometer, income per  kilometer of actual travel is &yen;451, while costs are  &yen;490. According to the component itemization of these costs,  the component ratio of personnel costs is very high, vehicle  maintenance costs account for 2.91%, and vehicle  depreciation  costs for 4.43%. The ratio of vehicle depreciation costs  is  equivalent to that for the costs of fuel, oil and lubricants,  and in terms of the overhead burden has become an important  factor.    Thus, bus operations are working under extremely stringent  conditions, and in a great many cases bus service operators are  pursuing other lines of business as well. Generally, bus service  companies are assessed as enterprises having a highly public  nature, and their credit rating as enterprises ends up being  boosted. Accordingly, when you examine the ratio of operating  profit to net sales by size of operation for bus service only,  among the bus services in question the operating costs exceed  operating revenue in all cases, regardless of size, but when  evaluated on an overall enterprise basis, including the other  lines of business, those bus companies with 1-30 and 301 or more  vehicles are generating operating profits, and even in terms of  recurring profit are showing up in the black.    Thus, for bus companies which are operating in a business  environment more severe than that for trucking firms when judged  as a separate and independent business, the introduction of  low-pollution vehicles will be a greater burden. However, the  public bus companies have opportunities to bring in funding from  general revenue sources, and the pilot introduction of  low-pollution vehicles in terms of the aspect of environmental  management is to be anticipated. Also, among the private firms,  even in those where the bus service operation is running at a  deficit, when one makes allowance for subsidies from within the  company, it is perhaps possible that the burden of introducing  low-pollution vehicles can be covered to a certain extent.  However, even in that case, reduction of the costs to introduce  these vehicles will determine the numbers introduced just as it  will for the trucking firms, and so various types of support  measures will be needed to facilitate their popularization.

Current Vehicle Usage of Road Transport Carriers </H5> <H5>  1. Vehicle Procurement Methods </H5>   Later on we will present these in detail, but as a measure  for popularizing low-pollution vehicles which are relatively  high-priced in comparison to existing diesel vehicles,  especially among small-scale firms with low liquidity ratios,  the mitigation of the initial capital burden will be highly  significant, and it is conceivable that a great many cases will  require support measures in combination with a lease system  designed for this purpose. Nevertheless, it appears that at  present, there are few cases in which these businesses use  leases to procure vehicles. Accordingly, along with clarifying  current forms of procurement and the reasons for not using  leases, etc., by implementing a questionnaire survey of these  businesses, we gained insight from existing data into the  circumstances for and problems with using leases when procuring  vehicles.    First of all, let's look at the types and methods of vehicle  procurement by businesses. According to a questionnaire survey  sent out to the various branches of the Tokyo Metropolitan  Trucking Association in which a majority of the members are  small and medium firms, almost all (23 out of 25) responded that  ``when required, trucks are purchased in small lots,'' and cases  of combined, large-lot purchases are limited. Also, it is  obvious that when purchasing vehicles, approximately 60%  of the  firms are cognizant that ``it is important because of the need  for a fixed amount of depreciation costs every year'' from an  accounting standpoint.    Furthermore, as reasons for the poor utilization of leases  for vehicle purchases, ``because even when money is borrowed,  funding can be procured at low-interest,'' and ``because of the  structuring to produce profits for the actual years of a  vehicle's serviceable life after it is fully depreciated'' were  cited most often. Also, more than one third of the respondents  indicated that it is ``because they do not fully understand the  merits of leasing.''       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-1.

As of  1990, the number of lease-held passenger cars was 420,000,  buses, 10,000, and trucks, 680,000, and in terms of component  ratio, trucks and passenger cars were the more prevalent. Also,  in terms of the ratio of lease-held vehicles accounted for in  the numbers of vehicles in use, leases accounted for 7.2%  of  buses, for 7.1% of trucks, for 1.3% of passenger  cars, and for  an overall average of 2.7%. Whatever class of vehicle one  considers, lease utilization is rising steadily, and it appears  this trend is going to continue in the future as well.     Incidentally, according to a FY1990 lease demand trends  survey on leasing overall conducted by the Japan Leasing  Association, corporations then utilizing leases accounted for  86.9% of the total, a 2.3% rise in comparison with  a survey  conducted in 1986. As for the items being leased, communications  equipment and exchanges were the leading category, and for  vehicles, leases were used by 31.5% of enterprises,  demonstrating a rise of more than 10% in comparison with  the  20.2% recorded for 1987.    All of which is to say that for low-pollution vehicles, the  speed of future technical innovation will be greater in  comparison with existing vehicles, or in other words, as a  result, the risk of their becoming superannuated is expected to  be high, and so too there will be a greater need to avoid the  risk of superannuation associated with the speedy introduction  of low-pollution vehicles with higher performance, and in this  aspect, the merit of leasing seems to be growing.    As far as we can judge from the data and the survey findings  mentioned above, for medium and small enterprises vehicle  procurement is an important business issue and independent  procurement is the norm. Also, as far as dissatisfaction with  the lease system is concerned, there are problems relating to  ``the impression that it is relatively expensive,'' and ``the  terms establishing the residual value, or the period of the  lease.'' Consequently, in the event assistance policies which  employ leasing are devised, a system which is responsive and  easy for businesses to use, and the employment of low-interest  funding such as fiscal investments and loans designed to negate  ``the impression that leases are relatively expensive'' will  likely be indispensable. And, it will probably be necessary to  give consideration to the methods of establishing residual value  and lease periods as well.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-13A>           Graph 3-2. Lease Ratio Changes </FIG>     In any event, if a lease system is incorporated as part of  the assistance policies, concrete, readily understandable public  relations (PR) aimed at these businesses is going be a major  prerequisite.  <H5>  2. Business Operations and the Realities of Vehicle Usage </H5>   We sorted out the realities of how trucks and buses are  being  used on a daily basis in various businesses primarily on the  basis of the results of a questionnaire in cooperation with the  Tokyo Metropolitan Trucking Association supplemented with  existing data and investigative hearings. Below, we have  compiled the actual conditions and special features concerning  the forms of truck and bus usage judged in terms of, (1) size of  enterprise, (2) transport destination, and (3) items conveyed.  <H5>  (1) Forms of Usage in Terms of the Size of the Enterprise </H5>   In the case of the major transport carriers, for usage  within  an urban area (travel distances of 50-80 km), 2-ton vehicles are  the primary choice. However, 4-ton vehicles are used for hauling  to industry. For suburban, large-volume hauling (travel  distances of 100-140 km), 5-ton vehicles or larger are used. For  long-distance hauling (travel distances of 500-600 km), 10-ton  vehicles or larger are used, and transport is conducted at night.    In the case of medium-sized transport carriers, 2-ton  vehicles are used primarily for short-haul (travel distances of  30-50 km), and medium-to-long haul transport (travel distances  of 300-1000 km) is handled with 4-ton and 10-ton vehicles.    City-route buses travel around 110 km per day. They always  perform nearly the same travel pattern (frequent stops, and an  average vehicle speed of around 11 km/hr.). Also, the per-trip  travel distance of sight-seeing buses is around 200 km, and the  travel patterns of buses employed for specific services such as  shuttle service within airports, etc. are fixed within a  specific area.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-3.

Among 4-ton vehicles, there is a  tendency to emphasize upgrade capability.    For long-distance transport, because there is a lot of cargo  to deliver and comfortable accommodations are sought due to long  driving time, etc., primarily 10-ton vehicles are used. Also,  since refueling in the course of a run is not desirable,  vehicles with good fuel consumption are sought.    In the case of route buses, stops are highly frequent, and  there are a great many acceleration and deceleration cycles.  Features such as road performance and ease of handling are  sought.    In the case of long-distance buses running between cities,  long-distance, overnight, high-speed operation is called for,  and safety, accommodation and cruising range, etc. are the  features sought.  <H5>  3. Current Status of Urban Traffic </H5>   The present status of truck and bus usage by various  enterprises is as described above, but here we will address the  realities of truck usage and possession overall.    The number of trucks owned nationwide as of the end of March  1991, was 8.83 million, and of that, the number of trucks for  businesses numbered 900,000. In terms of the composition of the  types of cargo vehicles on a registered vehicle basis, compact  trucks accounted for just under 70% nationwide in  contrast with  full-sized trucks which, conversely, accounted for approximately  70% of business vehicles. In the case of compact trucks,  a high  percentage were gasoline vehicles. We will examine in detail the  full-sized truck class in which diesel vehicles accounted for  the majority. In the makeup of business vehicle types,  full-sized trucks in the 9-ton-and-over-to-under-11-ton class  were the most prevalent, accounting for 18.8%, followed by  trucks in the 3-4-ton class at 15.2% and the 2-3-ton  class at  15%. However, when full-sized and compact trucks are  lumped  together according to carrying capacity, the 2-3-ton carrying  capacity class vehicles were most prevalent at 19.8%. When  classified by operating area, the 2-3-ton class vehicles were  the overwhelming leaders in the Tokyo metropolitan area (Tokyo,  Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba) at 32.5%, and no more than  6.2%  nationwide, while trucks under 2 tons accounted for 10.5%  in  the Tokyo metropolitan area and about the same nationwide. In  the Kinki area (Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo) as well, the ratio of  2-3-ton class vehicles was higher in comparison with the  nationwide ratio. In the Nakagyo area (Aichi, Mie), unlike these  other two areas, the 3-4-ton class vehicles were the more  prevalent, and the component ratio for 9-11-ton class trucks was  high as well.

The average transport distance for  regular-sized business trucks is 83.2 km, and for compacts it is  35.3 km. Also, we consider these in terms of average transport  distance and number of tons transported per actual working  vehicle day.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-7.

It appears from  these figures that in practical terms, refueling is done once a  day, and so the cruising ranges which these travel distances  will demand of the low-pollution vehicles to be introduced will  be considered. For the number of transport tons, the number of  tons transported per working transport trip, rather than the  number of tons per day, will be considered for the performance  required. According to these figures the per-trip tonnage is 5.3  tons for full-sized vehicles and 0.8 tons for compacts. However,  large-sized trucks are included among the full-sized class, and  we need to take into consideration the fact that this inflates  the figures.    Note: Since these figures include times when the vehicles  are  running with no cargo, they represent the distances traveled,  rather than the average transport kilometer for business  vehicles cited above.

Kilometers traveled per working vehicle day = kilometers traveled/total vehicle  working days. 2. Number of tons transported per working vehicle day = number of tons  transported/number of working vehicle days. 3. Number of transport trips per working  vehicle day = total number of transport trips/number of working vehicle days. 4.  Kilometers traveled per working transport trip = kilometers traveled/total number of  transport trips. 5. Number of tons transported per working transport trip = number of  tons transported/total number of transport trips.      Next, we will sort out in simple terms the travel conditions  within cities. First of all, in terms of trucks in general, the  travel modes comprise a combination of 4 elements: idling,  acceleration, constant speed and deceleration. The 10-15-mode  travel used in calculating such things as automobile exhaust gas  regulations are representative. And, in diesel vehicle  regulations, 6-mode-travel is applied to heavy vehicles. In  FY1994, this will be changed to 13-mode to correspond with the  10-15 mode. Currently, the average 10-15-mode-travel vehicle  speed is 22.7 km/h.     According to this, in terms of average vehicle speeds,  although the data is from 1985, the average for Tokyo's 23 wards  was 14.9 km/h, roughly less than half the national average of  36.9 km/h. This average has declined in other metropolitan areas  as well, it was 19.5 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya area, a reduction  in average speed of just under 13% for Osaka and of just  under  24% for Nagoya when compared with 1980 data. According to  this  data, it appears that the average vehicle speed is falling and  that the frequency of idling is rising as shown in these graphs  based on the results of study by the MOT's Traffic Safety and  Nuisance Research Institute.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-17A>           Graph 3-9. Current Travel Modes (10-15 Mode, 11 Mode) </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-17B>           Graph 3-10. Average Traveling Speeds on Public Roads (Peak Hours) </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-17C>           Graph 3-11. Average Vehicle Speed and Idling Cycles per km </FIG>     Also, since the frequency of idling cycles is high for buses  because of idling at bus stops and while passengers get on and  off, in addition to traffic signals and traffic backups, their  average vehicle speed is low. According to the constant speeds  established in the urban bus operating schedules for FY1989, the  average bus speed in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 11.4 km/h,  and 12.8 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya metropolitan area, even lower  than the average vehicle speeds cited above. And, according to  data on actual Tokyo route buses (Shibuya-Shinbashi, 17 January  1992), the lowest average speed in one day was 9.15 km/h over 10  vehicle hours, approximately less than half compared to that for  the early morning.    In addition, backup time at the major intersections within  Tokyo reached 2,150 hours in 1990. On a per-day basis this was  equivalent to approximately 6 hours. Thus, for urban travel,  travel patterns with high idling frequency and low average  vehicle speed are on the rise.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-18A>           Graph 3-12. Changes in Backup Time of Major Intersections in Tokyo </FIG>  <H3>  IV. Features and Possible Uses of Vehicle Types Covered by  Study </H3>   In this chapter we will sort out the features and specific  systems as well as possible uses, etc. for (1) hybrid vehicles;  (2) electric vehicles; (3) methanol vehicles and CNG vehicles  respectively.  <H5>  1. Hybrid Vehicles </H5>   A brief synopsis of the concepts, special features and  specific systems relating to hybrid vehicles is offered as  follows:  <H5>  1) Concepts </H5>    Hybrid vehicles have internal combustion engines and  non-internal combustion engines for motors, and depending on the  travel conditions, etc., have the ability to combine the motive  power of its non-internal combustion engine with the internal  combustion engine output, or to make exclusive use of the motive  power of its non-internal combustion engine.  <H5>  2) Features </H5>   We would sort out the principal features of hybrid vehicles  as follows:    (1) Their intent is to allow the merits and demerits of  internal combustion engines and non-internal combustion engines  to compliment one another, and to resolve problems such as fuel  consumption, exhaust gas properties, cruising range, and the  like.    (2) They offer a great deal of flexibility in terms of the  internal combustion engine for which it is possible to consider  a wide range of engines such as methanol and natural gas engines  and not just gasoline and diesel engines, and afford a variety  of combinations to meet performance requirements.    Furthermore, based on the latest technical advances, hybrids  have been proposed which, instead of being limited to simple  combination methods, focus on ways to harness energy  regeneration and on energy conservation measures and the like.  <H5>  3) Specific Examples </H5>   Various types of systems have been proposed for hybrid  vehicles, some examples of the leading specific systems are as  follows:  <H5>  (1) Excitation-type Regeneration Systems </H5>    a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving  energy and reducing the volume CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust.    b. Regenerates braking energy and the like and stores it in  batteries. An electric motor is activated with this  battery-stored energy and the output of the internal combustion  engine is supplemented by it for starting, acceleration and  upgrades. By reducing the load on the internal combustion engine  with this stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation  and the like are to be achieved.    c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of  current  diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through  the regeneration of energy is conceivable.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-18B>           Graph 4-1. Diesel-Electric Hybrid Vehicle </FIG>    d. Among the excitation-type regeneration systems, a working  bus with the HIMR (Hybrid Inverter-Controlled Motor and Retarder  System) method diesel-electric hybrid system has been perfected,  and has been put into partial use.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-19A>           Graph 4-2. Diesel-Accumulator-type Hybrid Vehicle </FIG>   <H5>  (2) Accumulator-type Hybrid System </H5>   a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving  energy and reducing the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust.    b. Braking energy is regenerated and stored with hydraulic  pressure. A hydraulic pump is activated with this stored  hydraulic pressure for starting, acceleration and upgrades and  by reducing the load on the internal combustion engine with this  hydraulic stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation  and the like are to be achieved.    c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of  current  diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through  the regeneration of energy is conceivable.    d. Operational tests with test vehicles are being conducted.   <H5>  (3) Engine-Generator-type Hybrid Systems </H5>   a. Technology developed with the aim of improving the  cruising range of electric vehicles.    b. Operates an internal combustion engine at a high  efficiency rating point to run the vehicle and power an electric  motor to produce electric power. Stores the surplus energy  generated by the internal combustion engine in batteries.    c. Output performance is equivalent to that of an electric  vehicle so that the vehicle can be powered by the electric motor  alone.    d. Concept stage (theoretical studies), or basic research  stage.  <H5>  (4) Engine-Electric Motor-Combination-type Hybrid System </H5>   a. Improved energy conservation the main development  objective.    b. System which operates on either the internal combustion  engine or the electric motor. A variety of methods have been  proposed over quite some time, but one of the latest systems,  the VW-Audi System (operates on an electric motor as the primary  engine for travel within the city and on an internal combustion  engine as the primary engine for travel outside the city, and  when the electric power output runs down, it uses the internal  combustion engine as an auxiliary engine) has been proposed for  passenger cars.    c. Improvement is needed on power output problems to where  the system is equivalent with gasoline engine systems, as well  as on the cruising range.    d. VW-Audi is perfecting the system on the passenger car  level. It is in the theoretical study stage in Japan.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-19B>           Graph 4-3. VW Hybrid System </FIG>  <H5>  4) Possible Uses </H5>   Considering things like the technical features of hybrid  vehicles like those described above, they are judged to be  particularly suitable for large-city traveling. As pointed out  earlier, travel within cities demonstrates a pattern of  repeating starts and stops, and hybrid vehicles devised to  regenerate braking energy can be described as systems with high  introduction value.    Also, the introduction of hybrid vehicles requires no  provision of special infrastructure, and so one can claim there  are few physical impediments to their introduction. Furthermore,  test operations are proceeding smoothly, and technical  reliability is growing.  <H5>  2. Electric Vehicles </H5>   We will sort out the concept and features of electric  vehicles as automobiles, and the issues, etc. presently being  confronted as follows:  <H5>  1) Concept </H5>    Electric vehicles use electric power as their energy source  and operate with electric motors. Charging batteries are used  primarily as the energy supply source.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-20A>           Graph 4-4. Vehicle Component Diagrams </FIG>   <H5>  2) Features </H5>   Given that it eliminates entirely exhaust gases with SOx and  NOx while operating, and that, in terms of the electricity  generating source, the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] gas emitted is  small compared to that of gasoline vehicles, the electric  vehicle is the ultimate expression of a low-pollution vehicle.  Also, it has the added advantage of producing very little noise.  <H5>  3) Problems </H5>   At present, 1,000 vehicles or more, mainly compacts and  light  vehicles, are being used on the road in Japan, but the short  per-charge cruising range (approximately 100-150 km at a  constant speed of 40 km/h, around 50 km within the city), and  the short life span of the batteries have been pointed out as  problems in terms of their use. Also, continuing new development  is needed on systems overall for electric vehicles because the  current price levels are very high, from 2 to 10 times that of  existing vehicles, and that wide variation is also a major issue  in terms of popularizing their introduction.    Furthermore, acceleration is poor, and the driveability in  cities, where responsive driving is called for, leaves something  to be desired. And for vehicle design as well, current designs  are premised on lead storage batteries, and design constraints  in terms of weight and space are imposed. It appears that in the  future factors like the aging of the truck operator population  and the employment of some women will be inevitable, and if  attempts are made to offset this with chassis design strategies  as part of the measures to secure a labor force, these storage  batteries might become limiting factors.    In order to solve these problems, development of smaller,  more powerful storage batteries (high-energy-density batteries)  is needed, and a great deal of hope is placed on results from  development work on storage batteries as mobile, high-output  sources of electricity being promoted by the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI). In this connection,  research and development (R&amp;D) on a new type of compact,  high-performance battery, including a fast-charge system, began  in April of 1992, and along with it research studies are to be  initiated on the provision of social systems and infrastructure  which will support the mass popularization of electric vehicles.  It is also anticipated that in the future, with mass production,  there will be substantial declines in the price levels of  electric vehicles.   <H5>  4) Possible Uses </H5>   At the current stage of development, in terms of road  performance, etc., it would be difficult for electric vehicles  to compete with existing diesel vehicles, especially in carrying  capacity in the 2-ton class or above. However, once the essence  of electric vehicles is understood, one can assume that because  they produce no exhaust gas and very little noise, they will be  used actively in specific fields. And, with future advances in  storage battery technology, gradually, their fields of use are  likely to broaden.  <H5>  3. Methanol Vehicles </H5>   We will sort out the concepts and features of methanol  vehicles as automobiles, and the specific issues they are  confronting at present as follows:   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-21A>           Graph 4-5. Areas of Responsibility of Related Industries in Electric Vehicles and Gasoline Vehicles </FIG>  <H5>  1) Concepts </H5>    With methanol vehicles there are two types of concepts, the  auto type and the diesel type. The auto type is a vehicle  mounted with a methanol engine which is a slightly modified  gasoline engine, and the diesel type is a vehicle equipped with  a spark ignition device or glow plug ignition device based on a  diesel engine.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-21B>           Graph 4-6. Auto-Type Methanol Engine </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-22A>           Graph 4-7. Diesel-Type Methanol Vehicle </FIG>   <H5>  2) Features </H5>   With the auto-type methanol vehicle it is possible to  achieve  exhaust gas levels which are equivalent to those of gasoline  engines for CO, HC and NOx because of the use of a ternary  catalyst. And, with the diesel-type methanol vehicle, NOx  exhaust content is lower than that of diesel engines and black  smoke is not exhausted.  <H5>  3) Problems </H5>   With equivalent capacity fuel tanks the cruising range per  fillup is short, half that of gasoline and diesel vehicles, and  so it is limited to short-range service like pickup and delivery  within cities.    Also, their use for long-distance transport would require  the  installation of a fuel supply network. While long-distance runs  would be possible by increasing the carrying capacity of the  fuel tanks, it would have to be at the cost of lowering the  effective carrying capacity of the vehicle.    In addition, there are technical problems like the corrosion  resistance of the fuel supply system materials, and with the  auto-type, improving the low temperature starting and high  temperature restarting performance and reducing the levels of  unburned methanol and aldehyde in the exhaust gas, etc.  <H5>  4) Possible Uses </H5>   Methanol vehicles have already been under test operation for  an extensive period of time and a broad field of use is assumed.  However, as cited above, the cruising range per refuel is short  and the installation of new fuel supply facilities will be  required, so for the time being their use will be focused on  travel within cities. In the future, as fuel-supply networks are  established, it is assumed they will be used in long distance  travel modes as well.  <H5>  4. CNG Vehicles </H5>   We will sort out the concepts and features of CNG vehicles,  and the issues and specific systems, etc. as follows:  <H5>  1) Concepts </H5>   Natural gas vehicles (NGV) are vehicles fueled with natural  gas, and NGV presently operating are classified according to the  form of the natural gas in the fuel tanks: as compressed natural  gas (CNG) vehicles or as liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles.    The total number of NGV presently operating in the world is  estimated to be from 750,000 to 1 million (according to a  ``Clean Fuels Report'' article of April 1990), and most of these  are CNG vehicles. LNG vehicles on the other hand, have yet to be  generally popularized due to difficulties with the fuel supply  and storage aspects, and so, other than some in the U.S., only a  very few are in use.    There are also adsorbed natural gas (ANG) vehicles which  store natural gas at low pressure (1/5 - 1/3 of the pressure of  CNG vehicles) using an adsorbing material, but at present, these  are in the research stage on natural gas adsorbing materials and  have not been put into practical application.  <H5>  2) Features </H5>   We will sort out the main features or advantages of CNG as  follows:    (1) Natural gas fuel has been established as an energy  substitute for petroleum, reserves equivalent to those of  petroleum have been confirmed, and it is endowed with superior  supply stability since the producing nations are not  disproportionately located in the Middle East.    (2) It has a low CO[.sup]2[/] generation rate per calorie  unit (70% that of petroleum).    (3) Because impurities are removed when it is liquefied, the  purity of the methane is high and it has great potential for  lowering pollution.    (4) The following can be pointed to for its features as an  automotive fuel:    a. It has a high octane value of around 130 and superior  knocking resistance, enabling a high-compression-ratio engine as  a result.    b. Lean-burn stability parameters are broader, resulting in  improved fuel consumption (energy conserving).    c. By burning in a mixture with light oil, it is possible to  use natural gas as a fuel in diesel engines without modifying  them by adding plugs. Technical development is underway on the  assumption that this will result in lower exhaust of black smoke  and NOx, and this will have the effect of improving the vehicle  usage process.    d. Because it is a gas fuel, it has good starting properties  in cold climates.    e. Since fuel supply will use gas pipelines, vehicle  transport with tank trucks and the like are not necessary.    f. Since impurities are not found in the fuel, it will be  possible to extend engine life and to reduce maintenance and  administrative costs.    (5) When converting vehicles into NGVs, one needs only to  modify a gasoline or diesel vehicle's fuel supply system, spark  or ignition system (only for CNG diesel type vehicles) and, as  needed, the compression ratio. Vehicle performance already has  been demonstrated in the case of gasoline-type vehicles. Also,  with mass production, it is possible that the costs can be kept  at a level that is equivalent to that of conventional vehicles.  <H5>  3) Problems </H5>   The principal CNG problems are as follows:    (1) The areas in Japan which are supplied with natural gas  by  pipeline are limited to the major metropolitan areas and the  domestic natural gas production areas of Shinkata, Akita and  Chiba, and at present, this network cannot be quickly expanded  nationwide.    (2) On-board space must be secured and vehicle weight  increased in order to accommodate a fuel storage cylinder.    (3) The per-refuel cruising range is short, around one  fourth  that of gasoline and diesel vehicles equipped with identical  capacity fuel tanks, so they are limited to short-range service  such as pickup and delivery duty within cities.  <H5>  4) Specific Examples </H5>   A variety of system types have been proposed for CNG  vehicles, and these are roughly classified as light and heavy  vehicle types, and generally categorized according to engine  system and form of fuel usage.  <H5>  Categories of CNG </H5>   Light Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems (fuel  switching), and CNG-exclusive systems.    Heavy Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems;  dual-fuel,  diesel fuel and CNG, systems (mixed burn); and CNG-exclusive  systems.    They also can be classified in terms of two combustion  methods, the lean-fuel-air-combustion (lean burn) method and the  theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion (stoichiometric) method.  <H5>  (1) Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle </H5>   The gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle is one that is capable of  interchangeably using the two fuels, gasoline and CNG. A  majority of the NGVs presently operating in the world are  gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles which are gasoline vehicles that  have been modified by adding CNG fuel systems. Conversion kits  for these modifications can be procured cheaply overseas. The  reason for the spread of this method appears to be due to the  lower convenience of vehicles fueled with CNG alone, as a result  of the restricted cruising range (travel distance per tank of  fuel) and fuel supply facilities.    In gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles, the CNG is stored in a fuel  cylinder under 150-200 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] of pressure and after  it travels through a fuel pipe and it is reduced to  near-atmospheric pressure in a pressure regulator  (pressure-reducing valve) located in the engine compartment, it  is fed to the engine through a gas/air mixer. As for the engine  combustion method, in nearly all cases in Japan it is the same  as that for gasoline engines, the theoretical air-fuel ratio  combustion method, in which the air-fuel ratio (_l_) is  operated  at close to 1.0, is employed, and in order to purify the exhaust  gas, a ternary catalytic device is added.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-24A>           Graph 4-8. Schematic of Foreign Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle </FIG>   <H5>  (2) Diesel Fuel/CNG Dual-Fuel Vehicle </H5>   Natural gas has a low octane rating in comparison to light  oil and it is hard for auto-ignition to occur, and so it is  difficult to use in this manner in compression-ignition type  diesel engines. Therefore, if one is going to combust natural  gas in a diesel engine, an ignition source is needed.  Accordingly, one gets the natural gas to combust by modifying  the fuel and intake systems and using light oil as the ignition  source. This is referred to as the diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel  system. The diesel engine is operated with a high compression  ratio, and so it is possible to make more efficient use of  natural gas with it than with a gasoline engine. However,  because the kits to convert diesel vehicles into diesel fuel/CNG  dual-fuel vehicles have not come into wide use at present, the  price is high, and the installation is more complicated than in  the case of a conversion to a gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle.  Nonetheless, since the use of this type of vehicle is  conceivable as a measure to improve the use of diesel vehicles,  there are hopes for technology development.  <H5>  (3) CNG-Only Vehicles </H5>   Gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle and diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel  vehicle engines use a number of different fuels, and so while  they are optimized to make the best use of the combustion  features of natural gas, they cannot help but do an inadequate  job. CNG-only vehicles are mounted with engines designed for CNG  in order to make the best use of the combustion characteristics  of natural gas. For cases in which the vehicle is being  converted from a gasoline vehicle, a  theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion method engine is used. For  conversions from diesel vehicles, a lean-fuel-air-mixture method  is under development.    CNG-only vehicles, including those converted from diesel  vehicles, are mounted with diesel-type, premixed,  single-chamber-ignition system engines; diesel-type, premixed,  precombustion-chamber-spark-ignition system engines; a  mechanical-carburetor-control system engine developed by Gasunie  NV (The Netherlands); and an engine in which the fuel-air-ratio  is electronically controlled developed by TNO (The Netherlands).  <H5>  5) Possible Uses </H5>   Numerous CNG vehicles already are in actual use in various  foreign countries, and from a technology development standpoint  there are few problems. However, CNG-only vehicles have a short  per-refuel cruising range, and so their use will be focused in  cities. As stated earlier, the CNG supply system is limited to  areas which are focused on large cities, and these CNG-only  vehicles can be described as suitable for use in large cities  where the environmental problems are severe.    Since CNG dual-fuel vehicles can use diesel fuel as well, it  will be possible to use them for long-distance trips as well. If  they are used as transit vehicles and the like for major cities,  the claim could be made that their use would be highly valuable  from an urban environmental standpoint.  <H3>  V. Study Concerning the Social Infrastructure Upon Which  Introduction of These Vehicles Is Premised </H3>   1) The low-pollution vehicles addressed by this study  committee are hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, methanol  vehicles and CNG vehicles. Hybrid vehicles are fundamentally  based on light oil-fueled vehicles, and do not require road  transport carriers and others to make new investments in fuel  supply facilities and the like or in related infrastructure.    On the other hand, for electric, methanol and CNG vehicles,  the use of their energy/fuels as fuel for conventional  automobiles had not been foreseen, and so no nationwide supply  system for them as automotive fuel has been established.  Therefore, when road transport carriers have attempted to use  these vehicles, they have had to procure the energy sources, and  in addition, to set up facilities to supply their vehicles on  their own.    Nonetheless, as confirmed by the questionnaire study  conducted as part of this study committee's work, it has been  difficult for urban businesses to add on large-scale fuel  facilities to their company sites, and restrictions on the  further establishment of supply facilities and questions about  how uninterrupted supplies of fuel are going to be secured,  etc., have led to difficulties in expanding the scale of supply  of petroleum-substitute fuels. On the other hand, until these  issues are overcome, the reality is that there can be no clear  awareness that we must use petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles.    For the service stations which sell conventional gasoline,  etc. and which are in the most convenient locations to supply  petroleum-substitute fuels, the situation has been one in which  they have had no confidence whatsoever concerning the volume of  sales that can be anticipated, and whether it can succeed as a  business, and the fact that there has been no choice but to be  negative toward new investment has been a major obstacle from  the standpoint of establishing petroleum-substitute-energy  supply stations.    2) Nonetheless, in light of the very recent rise in concern  about global environmental issues, etc., a major shift in energy  supplier awareness of petroleum-substitute energy supply is  evident. To support this, we cite the report of the  ``Petroleum-Substitute Energy, Energy Supply Systems for  Automobiles Study Committee'' (22 June 1992) which studied  petroleum-substitute energy supply systems with the  participation of the ``National Federation of Petroleum Dealers'  Associations,'' an association of petroleum dealers.    This report:    i) Provides a uniform assessment of the role of  petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles saying, ``they will have  the effect of killing two birds with the same stone by resolving  pressing issues like environmental policies for the reduction of  CO[.sup]2[/] and energy policies on lessening the degree of  dependence on petroleum.''    ii) Adopts an aggressive energy-supply-side attitude,  indicating that ``the relationship between 'alternative-energy  vehicle R&amp;D and popularization' and 'the establishment of  energy  supply networks for alternative-energy vehicles' is a 'chicken  and egg' relationship, and until we cut through this dilemma,  rapid popularization of alternative-energy vehicles cannot be  anticipated. Rather, there is a need to establish the role of  both as 'two wheels of the same vehicle' and to promote both in  a systematic, policy-type manner.''    iii) Further mentions the handling of service stations and  states that they should make efforts to be able to handle  automotive energies other than gasoline and light oil (CNG,  methanol, electricity) in the medium-to-long term.    iv) Pointing out that there are dangers with any form of  energy, and in terms of urban disaster prevention, the separate  establishment of supply stations for these respective energies  is not desirable, and that the cost of land is high in urban  areas where the need for alternative-energy stations is great,  and so the cost of establishing alternative-energy stations  could be prohibitive, the report advocates ``that the provision  of infrastructure be undertaken by making use of 60,000 service  stations nationwide.''    The report further clarified the study committee's position  on the provision of infrastructure by indicating in particular  that in using existing service stations, ``we should attempt to  establish alternative-energy stations as model operations for  the first three fiscal years, and for the time being,  policy-type incentives such as subsidies, etc. would appear to  be needed because of the lack of commercial interest.''    In accord with this, the Agency of Natural Resources and  Energy (ANRE) has formulated the ``Environmental Vehicles  Popularization Infrastructure Program (Eco-Station/2000  Program).''    In concise terms, it aims for the establishment of 2,000  ``eco-stations'' by the year 2000; calls for the provision of  about 100 ``eco-stations'' as model operations during the  initial phase of the program, from 1993 through 1995; for  national treasury grants to cover the expenses; and for  nationwide development of the remaining stations from 1996 to  2000 with provision of the required funding through a system of  interest-free loans.    The budget request relating to ``eco-stations'' for FY1993  is  &yen;1.8 billion, and a very major step has been taken relating  to the provision of a supply infrastructure for  petroleum-substitute energies.    In other words, in connection with the provision of a supply  network for automotive petroleum-substitute energies, it is safe  to say that, at the very least, there are prospects for a  solution to this issue in the form of facility establishment by  suppliers at a prescribed pace.    Thus, based on current circumstances in which an increase in  the ``number of taps'' is being affirmed, the focus in terms of  the prime issue for road transport carriers relating to the  supply of alternative energies likely will shift to the  questions concerning whether or not supply margins for  petroleum-substitute energies will be stable enough for  automotive markets in the context of world or Japanese domestic  demand, followed by questions concerning how prices will react  once automotive fuel demands are created as new sources of  demand for these energies.  <H5>  (1) Electric Power Supply </H5>   In looking at the supply and demand structure of electric  power which is the motive energy for electric vehicles, one  finds that there are major swings in the course of a single day,  with consumption high during the day and low at night. At the  same time that daytime electric power supply and demand is  growing tighter, the range of fluctuation between day and night  demand is getting bigger from year to year as well.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-26A>           Graph 5-1. Daily Electric Power Demand Load Curve </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-26B>           Graph 5-2. Changes in the Biggest 3-Day Averages per Month </FIG>     In the event electric vehicles are popularized in large  numbers, it is anticipated that electric power supplies will  grow all the more tight if things like daytime charging of  electric vehicles and fast-charging, etc. are carried out.  Electric power has superior features, e.g., it is clean and can  be used for a variety of purposes. Conversely, the fact that it  cannot be stored is a drawback. As a result, facility capacity  must be slightly more than peak demand. Consequently, facility  utilization rates (annual amount of electric power output  divided by 8760 hours and then multiplied by 100) tend to be  low, and the generating costs end up being that much higher.    In order to cope with these circumstances, it is necessary  to  attempt to level the load by introducing a system of rates  differentiated by time periods. A time-differentiated-rate  system attempts to facilitate consumer load shifting and to  smooth demand load by establishing different rates for peak-load  and low-load periods.    It will be necessary to encourage the charging of electric  vehicles at night and to smooth out the supply and demand  balance through the introduction of this kind of night rate  system. Also, if low-cost, night-rate charging can be used, it  will contribute to improved electric vehicle energy costs, and  so this too will serve to promote their popularization.    First of all, development of an electric vehicle  fast-charging system is to be initiated this fiscal year using a  new type of battery power storage system (making effective use  of nighttime power output by storing it and then using it for  charging demand during the day) being developed by the New  Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization  (NEDO). In addition, in order to promote the popularization of  electric, methanol and CNG vehicles, MITI has announced an  ``eco-station'' program to establish 2,000 stations by the year  2000 which will supply electricity and natural gas, and is  studying the provision of subsidies beginning in 1993 to be used  to cover the costs of remodeling existing gas stations.    Thus, while the provision of infrastructure for the use of  electric vehicles is inadequate, it is possible to make the  assessment that steady progress is being made.  <H5>  (2) Methanol Supply and Demand </H5>   First of all, in looking at the international supply and  demand for methanol, current estimated annual worldwide demand  is approximately a little less than 20 million tons, around  80%  of the sustainable supply (approximately 23 million tons). In  terms of regions, supply capacity is great in North America and  Eastern Europe, while demand is great in North America and  Western Europe.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 5-3.

Methanol Uses (Worldwide Basis) </FIG>     Next, if one looks at the CIF (cost, insurance, freight)  price of refined methanol as an indicator for understanding the  methanol supply and demand situation in Japan, considerable  fluctuation from year to year is evident as shown in Graph 5-5.  This demonstrates instability in the supply and demand structure.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-27B>           Graph 5-5. Changes in Methanol Production, Import and CIF </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-27C>           Graph 5-6. Changes in Methanol Demand and Price </FIG>      The raw material for methanol itself is natural gas, and  there is general consensus on the point that there is no need  for concern about a shortage in the supply of natural gas.  Therefore, it seems there is no need to consider a shortage in  methanol feedstock as a factor in future supply and demand  instability.    On the contrary, current price fluctuations are the primary  cause of supply and demand imbalances. The methanol production  industry is a typical process industry, and when a methanol  plant is expanded it is on the scale of 600-700,000 tons per  plant; in other words, expansion is conducted on the order  3%  of the global supply capacity. When demand rises, given the  comparatively high operating rates of current facilities, price  jumps occur easily, and this promotes strong motivation to  increase production facility capacity, but after capacity  increases, it creates noticeable surplus capacity once a decline  in demand occurs, leaving a market structure susceptible to  ``pig cycle'' types of price fluctuations in which prices slump.    In addition, at present, there is no consensus on which  types  of service vehicles M85 and M100 respectively are going to be  used for, and, as indicated in connection with this point by the  ``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles  Study Committee'' mentioned earlier, ``comprehensive study is  needed, to include the social and economic aspects, and not just  the technical aspects.''    In any event, if one takes the long view, it will likely  require efforts to establish a stable supply and demand  relationship which is independent of supply and demand for  chemical-feedstock methanol in order to secure stable supplies  of methanol as an automotive fuel.    On top of that, because of properties like the formation of  combustible, explosive gas compounds and invisible inflammation,  etc., methanol is regulated by the Fire Protection Law, the  Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Law, and the Labor  Safety and Health Law, and since there must not be any  discharges outside the systems of use, if widespread  popularization with ordinary users is anticipated, it is  conceivable that revisions of the relevant laws and ordinances  or the creation of new standards will become necessary.  <H5>  Natural Gas Supply and Demand </H5>   First of all, in looking at the supply and demand structure  of natural gas which is the motive energy of CNG vehicles, we  learned that the worldwide demand for natural gas in 1990 was 1  trillion 931 billion cubic meters, a 2% increase over the  year  before. The former Soviet Union and Central Europe accounted for  approximately 40% of the overall consumption. Total global  production volume in 1990 was 1 trillion 957.1 billion cubic  meters, a 2% increase over the year before. The former  Soviet  Union produces approximately 40% of the world's total and  the  U.S. approximately 25%. The former Soviet Union in  particular  has greatly expanded its production, approximately four-fold  over the last 25 years.    With natural gas there is little emission of SOx and NOx,  and  even the emission volume of CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of  global warming, and is 70% that of petroleum and  60% that of  coal when combusted. Therefore, it is evaluated highly as a fuel  in terms of environmental considerations.    Also, in terms of supply, it is stable in comparison with  other fuels. The resource supply nations are widely distributed  in places like the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia, etc.,  and there are 12 years more proven reserves than there are for  petroleum. Japan depends on the Middle East for 6% of its  natural gas supply, very low compared to 70% for its oil  supply.    In view of these facts, natural gas appears to be a  desirable  petroleum-substitute fuel for transport.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-28A>           Graph 5-7. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-28B>           Graph 5-8. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas </FIG>     Natural gas demand is forecast to grow 3% annually  until the  year 2000. Petroleum demand, on the other hand, will grow at an  annual rate of 1.5%. Under the circumstances with  environmental  issues and the like, energy demand in Europe has begun to shift  rapidly to natural gas. There are prospects that by the year  2010, the ratio accounted for by natural gas for all energy  sources, including petroleum and coal, will expand from the  current 15% to 30%.    In terms of supply as well, with the collapse of the Soviet  Union, which has been the leading supplier nation up to now,  development is now under way with western capital. Furthermore,  the Middle East, which accounts for 30% of total  reserves, is  being counted upon to satisfy the increase in demand, and the  probability of stable supply is growing.  <H5>  (Infrastructure Establishment) </H5>   The biggest obstacles to natural gas being used for vehicles  are the establishment of a supply infrastructure and especially,  the securing of supply for the ``eco-stations.''    In Japan the areas which have natural gas pipelines  installed  and which are being supplied are limited to large cities and  their environs and domestic natural gas producing areas such as  Shinkata, Akita and Chiba, etc. The concept of a pipeline  traversing the whole country (targeted completion in 2010) and  the like have been rumored, but in any event, Japan is in no  position to develop a pipeline network right away.    Within the currently supplied areas there is the possibility  of using the existing pipelines for terminal distribution, and  it is conceivable that refueling facilities for CNG vehicles  could be established with relative ease.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-29A>           Graph 5-9. Town Gas Supply Areas Which Supply Natural Gas </FIG>     At present, six CNG dedicated stations have been established  nationwide and are being used to supply fuel to CNG vehicles  owned by the gas companies. CNG refueling is rapid and timed,  and the refueling technology has been proven overseas. The  development and establishment of compact, rapid refueling  facilities (compressor and dispenser) is a pressing matter, and  in Japan a 3-year project was started in FY1992 with an AIST  subsidy for the ``development of practical NGV refueling  equipment,'' and needed infrastructural technology is being  readied for mass popularization.    Furthermore, in order to popularize CNG vehicles, relevant  legal system revisions and the like will be sought. The revision  of the High-Pressure Gas Control Law and the establishment of  vehicle technical standards, etc., and various types of  environmental apparatus directed toward mass popularization have  become urgent matters.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-30A>           Graph 5-10. LNG Plants in Japan </FIG>   <H3>  VI. Estimates of Costs To Introduce and Operate  Low-Pollution Vehicles </H3> <H3>  1) At this juncture we are going to make estimates of the  introductory and operating costs for the hybrid, electric,  methanol and CNG vehicles which are to be targeted for </H3>  introduction by the road transport carriers, bearing in mind  analyses of the studies cited earlier and the like. The object  of these cost estimates is to enable forecasting concerning such  issues as how big a burden would be imposed on these businesses  if they introduce and operate the vehicles in question, and if  various types of support policies are devised, how effective  would they be?    In order to establish more realistic premises and take into  account the features, etc. of each of the vehicle types, the  estimate premises are not necessarily common to all, but the  basic cost framework was made common to all. Thus, before  getting into the estimates for each of the low-pollution  vehicles, we will sort out the common premises.    The following items are offered as common premises or  thinking:    (1) We used estimated prices formulated on the basis of data  on the various vehicle types provided by the auto industry of  Japan as a premise of study by this study committee, and on the  basis of investigative hearings with associated industry groups  and enterprises.    (2) It is assumed that fuel is to be procured from  ``eco-stations'' and the like. Note: We will explain fuel price  later on as well, but because it is difficult to accurately  predict, as a premise of this exercise, we formulated and used  uniform-estimate values.    (3) Expense accumulation items were placed in six areas:  vehicle price; maintenance costs; fuel costs; operating costs;  infrastructure and facility costs; and education and training  costs.    (4) To evaluate low-pollution vehicle introduction costs, we  used the method of comparing the total costs of the accounting  period, which totals the initial costs (vehicle price,  automobile acquisition tax, etc.) and operating expenses (fuel  costs, expendable items, interest payments, etc.), and the  average annual costs with those for current base vehicles.    In estimating the introductory and operating costs of  low-pollution vehicles using premises such as these, we found  that with a simple purchase case, assuming average service life,  the average annual operating cost in the case of a hybrid  vehicle is &yen;1.51-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.3-1.7  times current vehicle costs. For a methanol vehicle, it is  &yen;1.23-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.4-2.1 times current  vehicle costs. For a CNG vehicle, it is &yen;1.12-1.73  million/year, equivalent to 1.3-2.0 times current vehicle costs.    Given the road transport carrier operating structure  outlined  in Chapter 2, it is difficult to view these as cost levels  supporting autonomous popularization. Therefore, in order to  lower these operating cost levels, various types of support  policies will be devised, and we have assumed a variety of  options, presented below, as the principal thinking on handling  policies.    (1) Lowering financing costs in order to reduce the cost of  procuring the new vehicles. As operating premises of this study  committee, the use of fiscal-investment-and-loan-type special  interest loans, and a financing ratio of 50% are assumed.  Also,  regardless of the source of funding, implementation of some sort  of grant for paying at a fixed rate of interest is assumed.  Specifically, reference is made to the system of interest  subsidies relating to purchase funding for vehicles conforming  to the latest regulations with transport industry promotional  subsidies.    (2) Lowering initial introductory costs in view of the low  financing capacity of medium and small-sized firms. As an  operating premise of this study committee, we assumed the use of  leases in combination with fiscal investment and loans.    (3) Incorporation of credit supplementing measures since  medium and small-sized firms are short on credit resources. As  operating premises of this study committee, in the event these  are used in combination with a lease system, the introduction of  a system in which business cooperative associations stand surety  for money loaned and the lowering of lease rates are assumed.    (4) Endeavoring to lower the per-year cost burden by  devising  incentives in connection with corporate taxes, etc. As an  operating premise of this study committee, allowing a tax  deduction equivalent to 7% of the basic lease fee (total  amount  of the lease fees x 60%) for companies using a lease  system,  similar to ``MITI's Medium and Small-Sized Enterprise New  Technology Promotion Tax System (known as the Mechatronics Tax  System),'' is assumed.    (5) Allowance to use incentives in connection with all other  vehicle taxes. As an operating premise of this study committee,  reduction of the vehicle acquisition tax, and vehicle tax is  assumed.    2) Note: Electric vehicles, as mentioned when we presented  their technical features, are particularly superior in terms of  their lack of exhaust and quietness, and they are generally  recognized as the ultimate expression of the non-polluting  automotive vehicle of the future. Development efforts to date  have focused on vehicles in the ``light automobile'' class  because of the relationship to the issue of the capacity of  current storage batteries. For this reason, in the 2-ton  commercial vehicle class which is considered necessary for the  actual introduction of low-pollution vehicles by the road  transport carriers, development is still in the stage where  demonstration vehicles have begun to be provided for trial  operation.    For the electric vehicle itself, as stated earlier,  extensive  technical component development still remains to be done on  storage batteries and in other areas. Also, technology  development aimed at making the important peripheral electric  vehicle equipment, the recharging facilities, more inexpensive  is needed.    Thus, a lot of hope is riding on the potential for future  component technology development for the 2-ton class electric  vehicles, and given the cost estimates, including operating  costs, based on the price for the trial manufactured 2-ton  vehicles, the majority of the committee feel it is still too  early, and so we will forego specific estimates on these at this  juncture.    3) Also, estimating the ``costs'' of petroleum-substitute  energies proved extremely difficult; although it is relatively  simple to get a handle on the comparative costs for electricity  and CNG (the price for LNG, the feedstock material, is set by  long-term contracts), there are many elements of uncertainty,  not to mention methanol, which as was pointed out in the report  of the ``Study Committee for Energy Supply Systems for  Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles'' cited earlier, ``is one  of the feedstock materials for MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl  ether) in which there is heightened interest as a gasoline  component, and research study on future supply and demand trends  is needed.''    Consequently, as an operating premise of this study  committee, for fuels in which the related enterprises have some  degree of responsibility for supply prices, we made reference to  the price estimates of those enterprises, and for those fuels  for which no such circumstances exist, we estimated supply  prices on the premise that the fuel costs per kilometer of  travel would not be cheaper than those for petroleum-derivative  fuels.  <H5>  1. Hybrid Vehicle Cost Estimates </H5>   Cost category content for the introduction and operation of  hybrid vehicles is as shown below. It is assumed that by  employing energy regeneration, hybrid vehicles will have better  fuel consumption rates than existing vehicles, and that some of  the introductory costs will be recovered with lower operating  costs. Note: For maintenance costs, we used the estimates of the  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Also, given the  technical features of the hybrid vehicle, there is no need for  the provision of new infrastructure, and since instruction and  training can be handled in a very few days, the decision was  made to disregard those costs in these estimates.    These estimates are premised on a 4-ton truck and a  large-model route bus as the test hybrid vehicles. With respect  to the former, the establishment of a 2-ton class, compact  vehicle was studied out of consideration for the realities of  truck usage in urban areas, but in taking into account the  technical features of the hybrid vehicle and the current stage  of technical development, etc., the committee decided to premise  the estimates on the highly feasible 4-ton vehicle. For the bus,  we targeted the large-model route bus which already has a track  record as a test vehicle and for which there are a great many  units in use. Note: Taking into account economies of scale  depending on the scale of manufacturing, we established a 2-tier  price structure for the vehicle prices. Also, we adopted a  10-year and 13-year service life for the trucks and buses  respectively based on data of the Vehicle Inspection and  Registration Association. Travel distances were set at 35,000  km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on the basis of  the results of the questionnaire which was sent to the Tokyo  Trucking Association and existing statistical data. Using  existing experimental data, etc. as a reference, the rate of  energy regeneration was calculated at 20%.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Estimated Costs (Hybrid Vehicles)                                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cost Categories                       |Estimate Premises                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vehicle Price                         |Establish per unit price based on dat-|  |                                      |a, etc. of the Japan Automobile Manuf-|  |                                      |acturers Association.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in  contrast to an average annual cost of &yen;1.14 million for  existing trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type  assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of  100 units is &yen;1.99 million, just under twice that of current  vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 5,000 units,  the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to  &yen;1.51 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles.  However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that hybrid  vehicles are going to be popularized with road transport  carriers.    Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction  measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average  annual cost drops to &yen;1.44 million with an annual production  level of 5,000 units, and if a lease system which incorporates  fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, that cost falls  to &yen;1.32 million. Furthermore, if a fixed-rate-interest  subsidy is added on, the average annual cost is lowered to  &yen;1.27 million, 1.11 times the current average annual vehicle  cost. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance  measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the  disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around &yen;130,000  per year.    The same holds true for hybrid buses as well, required costs  swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared with trucks,  the vehicle price disparity between existing buses and  low-pollution buses is relatively small, and so the disparity in  cost with existing vehicles ends up being the limiting factor.  If it is assumed that all support measures are possible, and if  annual production expands to 1,000 units, that cost disparity  will shrink completely to a mere &yen;70,000 in average annual  cost, and so substitution for current vehicles can be  anticipated within existing frameworks for new vehicle  replacements.

Methanol Vehicle Cost Estimates </H5>   Introductory and operating cost categories for methanol  vehicles are shown below.    For maintenance cost estimates, we used the estimates of the  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel  costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and  multiplied those with the annual mileage. Methanol vehicles make  the provision of new refueling facility infrastructure  necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates of fuel prices  are difficult, and so we made our estimates on the premise that  ``fuel costs per kilometer of travel will not be less than that  for other petroleum-derived fuels.'' Also M100 was assumed as  the fuel standard.    Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and large-model  route  bus as the trial methanol vehicles. The large-model route bus  was chosen because a test vehicle track record already exists  and a large number of units are in service. Note: Taking into  account economies of scale depending on the scale of production,  we established a 3-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the  trucks and a 2-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the  buses. Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for  the trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle  Inspection and Registration Association.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in  contrast to an average annual cost of &yen;880,000 for existing  trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type  assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of  100 units is &yen;1.89 million, more than twice that of current  vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 1,000 units,  the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to  &yen;1.55 million, around 1.8 times that of existing vehicles.  If annual production is expanded to 10,000 units, the average  annual cost for introduction and operation falls to &yen;1.23  million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles. However, as  it stands, it is hard to believe that methanol vehicles are  going to be popularized with road transport carriers.    Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction  measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average  annual cost falls to &yen;1.19 million on the basis of an annual  production level of 10,000 units, and if a lease system which  incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, the  cost falls to &yen;1.13 million. Furthermore, if a  fixed-rate-interest subsidy (3%) is added, the average  annual  cost is lowered to &yen;1.06 million, 1.2 times that of existing  vehicles. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance  measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the  disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around &yen;180,000  per year.    In looking at methanol buses, similar to the trucks, the  required costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles.  Compared with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing  buses and the low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so  the cost disparity with existing vehicles will shrink. However,  even with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest grant  of 3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, the  lowest the  average annual cost will fall is approximately 1.12 times that  of existing vehicles, over &yen;440,000.

CNG Vehicle Cost Estimates </H5>   Cost categories for introducing and operating CNG vehicles  are as shown below.    For maintenance cost estimates we used the estimates of the  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel  costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and  multiplied those with the annual mileage.    CNG vehicles make the provision of new refueling facility  infrastructure necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates  of fuel prices are difficult, and so we used a price formulated  using the prices estimated by the Japan Gas Association as  reference.    Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and a large-model  route bus as the trial CNG vehicles. The large-model route bus  was chosen because a large number of units are in use. Note:  Taking into account economies of scale depending on the scale of  production, we established a 3-tier price estimate structure for  the trucks and a 2-tier price estimate structure for the buses.  Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for the  trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle  Inspection and Registration Association. Travel distances were  set at 35,000 km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on  the basis of the results of the questionnaire which was sent to  the Japan Trucking Association and existing statistical data.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cost Estimate Categories (CNG Vehicles)                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cost Category                         |Estimate Premises                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vehicle price                         |Per-unit prices established on the ba-|  |                                      |sis of data of the Japan Automobile M-|  |                                      |anufacturers Association, etc. and on |  |                                      |investigative hearings, etc. with rel-|  |                                      |ated industry associations and enterp-|  |                                      |rises.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in  contrast to an average annual cost of &yen;880,000 for existing  trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type  assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of  100 units is &yen;1.73 million, a little less than twice that of  current vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 1,000  units, the average annual introduction and operating cost falls  to &yen;1.31 million, around 1.5 times that of existing  vehicles. If annual production is expanded to 10,000 units, the  average annual cost for introduction and operation falls to  &yen;1.12 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles.  However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that CNG vehicles  are going to be popularized with road transport carriers.    Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction  measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average  annual cost falls to &yen;1.08 million on the basis of an annual  production level of 10,000 units, and if a lease system which  incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, the  cost falls to &yen;1.02 million. Furthermore, if a  fixed-rate-interest subsidy (3%) is added, the average  annual  cost is lowered to &yen;960,000, 1.09 times that of existing  vehicles. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance  measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the  disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around &yen;80,000  per year.    In looking at CNG buses the same holds true, the required  costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared  with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing buses and the  low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so this will  shrink the cost disparity with existing vehicles. However, even  with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest subsidy of  3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, CNG buses  will be  cheaper than existing buses, and it is to be anticipated that  they will replace existing vehicles within the new vehicle  replacement frameworks already in place.

implementation basis) conducted under a prescribed set of  conditions from the standpoint of making a comparison with  existing diesel vehicles, annual costs are expected to rise  respectively by &yen;130,000 for a hybrid vehicle (4-ton  carrying capacity), &yen;180,000 for a methanol vehicle (2-ton  carrying capacity), and &yen;80,000 for a CNG vehicles (2-ton  carrying capacity).    Similarly, for buses, annual costs are expected to rise by  &yen;70,000 for hybrid vehicles, and by &yen;440,000 for  methanol vehicles, but conversely, for CNG vehicles a cost  reduction on the order of &yen;30,000 is anticipated.    2) In order to endeavor to popularize these low-pollution  vehicles even further, the key will be whether or not it is  possible to find factors which will allow us to shrink these  cost disparities.    First of all are the prices of the hybrid/methanol/CNG  vehicles assumed within these estimates. Particularly, given the  far shorter history of technology development on vehicles which  use petroleum-substitute fuels than that for diesel vehicles,  when compared to these engines which are ``more tempered'' by  the demands of the market, it is no exaggeration to say that  engines which use petroleum-substitute fuels are still under  development. It is possible that in the future, as a result of  cooperation between users and manufacturers, far more usable  engines than those currently available and, in turn, more easy  than at present for road transport carriers to use, and vehicles  priced lower than the current estimates will become available.    Second, financing cost reduction is possible. Current  estimates for hybrid vehicles assume an annual fixed-rate  interest subsidy of 1%, but, for example, in a case in  which  the introductory number of units is relatively low, it is  probably possible to assume higher and more liberal  fixed-rate-interest subsidies similar to those for methanol and  CNG vehicles.    Also, Japan Development Bank special-interest-rate financing  is assumed in the estimates for all three types of vehicles, but  there is a high probability of further cost reductions in the  area of funding procurement, e.g., the opportunity for the  parties introducing these vehicles to take advantage of  preferential interest rates available for medium and small-sized  enterprises, and further, in the case of using imported  vehicles, the opportunity to take advantage of the Import-Export  Bank of Japan product import financing system (interest:  5.3%  at financing rate of 70% of item cost).    Third, there is the importance of further ingenuity in terms  of the use of all three vehicles types by the road transport  carriers actually using these low-pollution vehicles. In the  case of hybrid vehicles in particular, it is conceivable that  transport costs will decline due to improvements to the  relatively conservative mileage estimates as these enterprises  secure more adequate operational stability and implement more  efficient operating plans.    Also, methanol and CNG vehicles have feature flexibility in  terms of carrying capacity, mileage and chassis design by  varying the energy density of their respective fuels and by  changing their fuel-carrying methods. As a result, it is also  possible that when we attempt to fully demonstrate the  respective features, we will end up with more ingenious vehicles  in terms of capacity, etc., than those premised in these  estimates.    In addition, in the case of CNG vehicles, the  ``eco-stations'' which are likely to be developed will have the  feature of being completely limited to the areas supplied by  Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas and Osaka Gas for the immediate future.    It is likely that individual road transport carriers will  devise ways to absorb cost increases by using the features  illustrated earlier and making them conform sufficiently to  performance demanded in response to the characteristics of their  customers.    With the accumulation of such efforts and ingenuity by the  parties concerned, effectively combined with tax incentives,  fiscal investment and loans, and the like, we probably can  expect to be able to promote the introduction of hybrid,  methanol and CNG vehicles.    3) As mentioned earlier, no matter how difficult they have  been to build, the history of low-pollution vehicles is still a  brief one. Compared to vehicles with diesel engines which have a  long tradition as commercial vehicle engines, one can  justifiably argue that low-pollution vehicles which use  petroleum-substitute fuels in particular are under development.  As long as current circumstances prevail, users cannot choose to  bear the burden of full-scale introduction on their own, nor can  manufacturers decide to undertake adequate R&amp;D investment, or  facility investment at their own risk. Just as they are for  structuring issues on the energy supplier side mentioned in the  report of the ``Energy Supply Systems for  Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles Study Committee,'' the  problems in introducing low-pollution vehicles are also  inherently ``chicken or egg'' issues.    In order to come up with breakthroughs on these issues, road  users, starting with the road transport carriers, should  formulate ``long-term targets for the introduction of  low-pollution vehicles'' individually and in step with the  response of their associated industry, and then strive for  steady introduction on the basis of those objectives.    In particular, if national and local-level government  organizations make use of these vehicles as part of their  operations, it goes without saying that they should set their  own ``targets'' to serve as models for others, and then lead the  private sector by steadily meeting these targets.    Also, the national government should approve the application  of measures to support their introduction cited earlier only for  those businesses which have clarified these ``targets,'' and  should consider eligibility in such a way that they do not  discourage road users, beginning with road transport carriers.  Steps should be devised so that these ``targets'' do not act  simply as triggers for eligibility for these support  measures.    The following idea is an example of such a step.    Customarily, whether it is a low-pollution vehicle or a  regular vehicle, when it comes to a choice between a vehicle  that has been on the market for several years or one that is  just hitting the market, the one that has been tried and tested  by the market will be the superior vehicle in terms of  performance and price, etc. Therefore, one idea is to lower the  burden and risk for those enterprises attempting to introduce  these vehicles ahead of other enterprises by, for example,  approving the application of support measures for road transport  carriers attempting to introduce ``low-pollution vehicles''  which have not been on the market long, even if their  ``targets'' call for a relatively low proportion of  ``low-pollution vehicles'' among the vehicles they possess,  while requiring a fairly high rate of introduction of these  vehicles to be eligible for support measures after a prescribed  period of time has elapsed and vehicle assessments concluded,  etc.    As for methods of using introduction targets, even aside  from  elements which must await government administrative review  because of issues relating to utilization of tax incentives and  fiscal investment and loans, clarifying these long-term  introduction targets can be expected to have the reverberating  effect of enabling automobile manufacturers to define demand  estimates, making it possible to lower marketing-associated  risks even further.  <H5>  VII. In Conclusion </H5>   (1) In our study through chapter 6, we have pointed out that  the possibilities for improving the operating costs and speeding  up the pace of popularization of low-pollution vehicles increase  by devising a series of support policies like tax and fiscal  investment and loan incentives as well as schemes to make use of  them, etc.    In the event the introduction of low-pollution vehicles is  facilitated as a result of regional features, etc., in addition  to policies such as these, which ought to be characterized as  uniform national minimums, it is preferable that the incentive  measures be added on region by region.    Similarly, from the standpoint of alternate energy policy,  although not policy in direct support of low-pollution vehicles,  the formulation of any sort of support measures is welcome. As  long as they are conducive to the popularization of  ``low-pollution vehicles,'' it is probably preferable to need to  make active use of these policy measures from separate  perspectives.    (2) As explained a number of times, road transport carriers  have adopted the position that there need to be guarantees for  the systems from which supplies of energy for  petroleum-substitute-energy-type low-pollution vehicles are to  be received. The position of the energy suppliers on the other  hand, is likely to be that clear estimates of the amount of  demand and guarantees to cover facility investment risks are  needed.    In order to put a stop to this kind of endless debate, the  ``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles  Study Committee'' introduced earlier has stated that an  ``Eco-Station 2000'' program should be put together and the  support, etc. it requires implemented.    The formulation of support policies such as these in itself  would be welcomed as being truly opportune. If we were to take  it upon ourselves to assume the position of a business actually  operating vehicles and point to this program, the first priority  naturally would go to the metropolitan areas, especially those  which are subject to NOx laws and regulations, as investing  parties in low-pollution vehicles which they themselves would  use. Therefore, in attempting to invest in vehicles which use  petroleum-substitute energies, it would be desirable that the  stations supplying the petroleum-substitute energies, i.e., the  ``eco-stations,'' be concentrated in the metropolitan areas, and  on the major artery roads closely linked with them. Also, there  appears to be a great need on the part of the energy suppliers  like the petroleum retailers, etc. to get a handle on vehicle  upgrading trends of the road transport carriers.    Therefore, in order to formulate future targets for the  corporate introduction of petroleum-substitute-energy-type  low-pollution vehicles, it is necessary for those on the user  side, beginning with the road transport carriers, and those on  the energy supplier side, the petroleum retailers, et al., to  come up with estimates for the supply and demand of  petroleum-substitute fuels that range into the future. There is  an especially great need to come up with estimates between the  enterprises and the energy suppliers, the petroleum retailers,  et. al., on the amount of supply required in the event the use  of petroleum-substitute-fuel vehicles is attempted, even if only  in those areas subject to NOx laws and regulations. The issues  straddle the jurisdictions of several ministries and agencies,  but a forum to study supply and demand ought to be established  through the cooperation of the administrative parties. As stated  earlier, it is of course conceivable that in the initial stages  of use of low-pollution vehicles, a certain amount of problems  with the convenience of use will surface. And, some types of  product complaints need to be fed back steadily to the  manufacturers.    This kind of steady feedback in itself has the ability to  bring about progress toward a more ``user-friendly'' vehicle,  and conversely, provide automobile manufacturers with know-how  and new technical data relating to the use of low-pollution  vehicles, and as a result, stimulate even wider demand for  low-pollution vehicles.    It will probably be necessary to secure points of interface  of this kind between users and manufacturers in some form.  Normally, this role is played by the sales and service  departments of automobile dealerships, but it seems that if  several manufacturers build a specific type of ``low-pollution  vehicle,'' as much sharing of their technical data as possible  would lead to an effective use of precious manpower.    Also, low-pollution vehicles have many points of difference  with existing automobiles, particularly in terms of upgrading  and maintenance, etc., and will require mastery of unique  technology, particularly in the initial stages of introduction.  For this reason, in using the lease system which this study  committee made a premise of its review, we should consider  extending it to a maintenance lease, rather than limiting it to  a financing lease, so that along with serving the convenience of  the road transport carriers who will be the users of the  low-pollution vehicles, it will be possible to use these leases  as the point of interface between the manufacturers and the road  transport carriers for upgrading and maintenance data and other  data.    (4) Although tentative proposals have already been made  regarding the handling of low-pollution vehicles in terms of  taxes, it is probably going to be necessary to consider the  optimum methods of implementing various automobile-related taxes  and fuel taxes as long-term issues needing further study.    For example, there is the issue of the automobile weight  tax.  This problem is directly manifested in electric vehicles, and  even if excessive weight increase from storage batteries or the  weight increase from the accumulator and storage battery  apparatus in hybrid vehicles, the so-called ``tonnage  reduction'' issue, is cleared up through the application of  design ingenuity, rises in vehicle weight tax are unavoidable,  and so without some sort of consideration, it is inevitable that  this tax will be a source of cost increase for users of these  vehicles.    Also, within this report, we have addressed the issue of  terminal sales price in connection with petroleum-substitute  fuels, and we have kept issues pertaining to intermediate-stage  taxation completely outside the purview of our study. Hereafter,  having taken into consideration how they would conform with the  series of policies aimed at bringing about low-pollution  automobile traffic, and with promoting the introduction of  petroleum-substitute energies, it likely will be necessary to  study the best way to handle the imposition of taxes.    (5) Furthermore, in order to confer social approval on the  use of low-pollution vehicles, active consideration ought to be  given by the appropriate parties to establishing conditions for  their use such as devising measures like affording priority to  low-pollution vehicles in public parking facilities, or setting  preferential toll road usage fees for low-pollution vehicles, or  providing standardization and certification systems, etc.    In addition to that, active responses will be needed through  the mutual cooperation of the industries concerned and  cooperation with local governing bodies, etc. in connection with  the extensive activities required to enable the smooth future  popularization of low-pollution vehicles, e.g., the work of  enlightening those concerned who benefit from the uses of road  traffic, general consumers, shippers, etc., on the significance  of using low-pollution vehicles, and improving the ability of  the automobile-related industries to understand technology  development trends, etc., which is needed to form a consensus  that the ``cost increases'' which cannot be further eliminated  should be borne by society as a whole by formulating tax and  fiscal investment and loan incentives.    (6) As indicated above, there is a considerable amount of  work requiring close, mutual cooperation between automobile  manufacturers and road users, and between road users and fuel  suppliers. These various tasks require in particular the  establishment of some type of fora for consultations on the  formulation of low-pollution vehicle introduction targets by  individual enterprises, for consultations with the petroleum  retailers, and for consultation with the automobile  manufacturers. Naturally, it is conceivable that a variety of  methods could be used to establish these kinds of fora.    For now, the establishment of a ``Low-Pollution Vehicle  Popularization Forum'' (tentative name) with government  cooperation as a forum to allow the relatively ``soft''  undertaking of collective, timely exchanges of manufacturer,  user, and petroleum retailer information, and above all, direct  contact and discussion of low-pollution vehicle issues by these  three parties are likely to be an effective ``first step.''    Item (6) stated above is a proposal designed to supplement  support policies for the popularization of low-pollution  vehicles. In addition to ancillary measures like this, even more  difficult issues remain to be dealt with as far as things that  should be done to protect the environment in terms of road  traffic are concerned, e.g., on top of upgrading the road  network, making the flow of traffic smoother, and the  distribution of goods more efficient. We would again point out  the need for greater effort by the parties concerned.  <H5>  (Reference Data) </H5>   Given the fact that it seems the price in the initial stage  of low-pollution vehicle introduction have to be high compared  to their price in the stage of full-scale popularization, and  that there are aspects of insecurity relating to marketability  for the manufacturers, we need to lower the risks for users for  the initial stage in which specific low-pollution vehicles are  thrust into the market. Furthermore, more than 80% of  trucking  firms are medium-to-small-sized enterprises, and in light of  their funds availability and credit circumstances, the  introduction of relatively expensive low-pollution vehicles is  going to require policy incentives.    In terms of specific support measures for enterprises and  individuals shifting purchases to low-pollution vehicles: (1)  tax incentives such as reducing vehicle tax and vehicle  acquisition tax, and corporate and individual income tax  deductions, etc.; (2) the use of fiscal investment and loans;  and (3) the use of a lease system, etc. are being considered. In  addition, (4) a fixed-rate-interest subsidy from the Japan  Trucking Association; support measures from local governing  bodies; and (6) other indirect support measures are conceivable  as well.  <H5>  (1) Tax Incentives </H5> <H5>  Automobile Tax (Local Tax) </H5>   - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce  the  rate of the automobile tax for electric vehicles (applying the  rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994    - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce  the  rate of the automobile tax for methanol vehicles (applying the  rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994    -Establishing a measure to reduce the rate of the automobile  tax for hybrid vehicles (applying the rate prior to the FY1984  tax revision) for FY1993 and FY1994 (period applicable)    - Reducing the vehicle tax by to half for 12 months  following  a purchase when a diesel vehicle (truck or bus) manufactured  prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas regulations is  scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle conforming to the  latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991 (period applicable)  <H5>  Vehicle Acquisition Tax (Local Tax) </H5>   - Presently 5% of acquisition price for private  vehicles and  3% for business vehicles    - Extending (the period applicable) the 2% reduction  in the  acquisition tax applied to methanol vehicles to FY1993 and FY1994    - Establishing a new measure to reduce the acquisition tax  2% for hybrid vehicles for FY1993 and FY1994 (the period  applicable)    - Providing 1% reduction when a diesel vehicle  (truck or  bus) manufactured prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas  regulations is scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle  conforming to the latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991.  <H5>  Corporate Tax (National Tax) </H5>   - Will implement tax incentives against the nominal price of  a vehicle in line with those in MITI's system of tax measures to  promote new technology investment by medium and small  enterprises (known as the Mechatronic Tax System) and its system  of tax measures to promote investment to deal with changes in  energy and the environment (known as the Energy and Environment  Tax System)    (For reference) MITI System of Tax Measures To Promote New  Technology System Investment by Medium and Small Enterprises  (popularly referred to as the Mechatronic Tax System)    - Authorizes a special depreciation for medium and small  enterprise purchases of the latest mechatronic equipment,  30%  over the ordinary depreciation for that business year  (36% for  imported equipment), or a corporate tax credit (on purchases  above &yen;1.6 million per unit, up to 20% of the amount  of  corporate tax) of 7% of the revenue tax (8.4% for  imported  equipment)    - For leases as well, in addition to allowing lease fees to  be treated as deductible, as a method of reducing taxes, it is  possible under the Mechatronic Tax System to take a tax  deduction of 7% of the basic lease charge (total lease  fees x  60%).    (For reference) Tax System To Promote Investment To Handle  Changes in Energy and the Environment (popularly referred to as  the Energy and Environment Tax System)    - Authorizes a special depreciation of 30% for that  business  year on purchases of equipment to counter energy and  environmental changes (of more than &yen;1.6 million for things  like vehicle internal combustion engines which conform to the  FY1990 automobile exhaust gas regulations, etc.), or a corporate  tax credit of 7% of the acquisition amount (up to  20% of the  corporate tax amount for that fiscal year)    - Authorizes under depreciated amounts to be carried forward  for 1 year  <H5>  (2) Use of Fiscal Investment and Loans </H5>   - Enable the use of low interest loans from the Japan  Development Bank and the Small Business Finance Corporation to  obtain vehicles (interest rate long-term prime rate minus  0.5-0.8%)  <H5>  (3) Use of Lease System </H5>   If a lease system is used, the leasing company assumes the  burden for the funding to purchase the low-pollution vehicle and  the user gets by with just paying a monthly lease fee. A further  advantage to leasing is that the full amount of the cost of the  item can be treated as deductible within the period of the  lease. Consequently, if the lease period is shorter than the  legal service life (within the limits of Ministry of Finance  notification), it has the effect of saving taxes. Also, since  cost is centralized in the monthly lease fee, it is simple to  get a handle on the current value.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-55A>           Figure </FIG>     (For Reference) Institutional Leasing    An equipment procurement measure referred to as leasing is a  system devised by MITI in its attempts to rationalize and  modernize medium and small enterprises based on the  determination that it is very effective in terms of promoting  popularization and expanding use of specific equipment and  functions. The ``National Standard of Living Equipment Lease''  which covered ``voluntary-chain'' equipment and ``cold-chain''  equipment, etc., with financial debenture underwriting measures  in 1970 was the start of institutional leasing. Institutional  leasing subsequently developed into ``Leasing To Promote  Popularization of New Machinery and Equipment, etc.'' Relatively  low-interest financing for facilities and equipment for which  the promotion of popularization is desirable in terms of the  national economy is made available to lease companies using  capital derived from financial debenture underwriting measures  as the source of funding. As a result, lease users end up being  able to make use of designated equipment for a relatively  inexpensive lease fee. These institutional leases have continued  from 1972 up to the present as leases covered by financing from  the Japan Development Bank, a government-affiliated finance  institution.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-55B>           Institutional Lease Arrangement Financed by Japan </FIG>  <H3>  Japan Development Bank Lease Financing System Coverage  (Equipment) </H3>   Items covered by institutional leasing: ``social welfare  equipment''; ``point of sales (POS) systems''; ``automatic gas  cut-off devices for liquid propane (LP) gas''; ``social welfare  equipment for the home''; and ``satellite broadcasting and  receiving systems.'' Financing for 35-40% of the cost of  an  item is received from the Japan Development Bank.    Japan Development Bank Financing is received in various  other  categories:     -  1. Aircraft    -  2. Aircraft Facilities and Equipment    -  3. Data Processing, Communications Enhancement    -  4. Import System Upgrade (equipment required to facilitate  imports)    -  5. Equipment To Improve Energy Usage (e.g., co-generation  systems, etc.)    -  6. Distribution Systemizing (machinery and equipment to  improve  distribution)    -  7.

In other words, a ``lease subsidy system'' was  begun. Once a subsidy is determined the Food Industry Center  pays the leasing company a subsidy twice a year. Based on these  subsidy payments, the user deducts an equivalent amount from his  payments and then pays the leasing company. When the interest  equivalent on the cost of the item in the lease fee is  calculated in terms of annual interest, it is lowered  approximately 2% with the subsidy.    In FY1987, the Forestry Agency initiated a subsidy system.  This was done in an attempt to facilitate the introduction,  through leasing, of equipment to increase artificial drying of  lumber, mainly domestic lumber and wood products, to improve the  distribution of lumber. In this system the Japan Lumber  Stockpile Organization subsidizes a portion of the lease fee  when lumber drying equipment is introduced by leasing. Similar  to the Food Industry Center mentioned earlier, a subsidy is paid  to the leasing company and the user bears responsibility for the  remainder of the fee. In FY1990, coverage was expanded to apply  as well to computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided  manufacturing (CAM) equipment among the equipment to improve  lumber distribution.    In 1990 MITI's ANRE initiated a subsidy system. Under this  system a subsidy for part of the lease fee is received from the  Federation of Gasoline Retailers and Petroleum Associations in  cases where equipment relating to restructuring is introduced  through leasing. Unlike the two systems cited earlier, the  subsidy is paid to the user. Diagrams of the various subsidy  arrangements are given below:   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-57A>           Food Industry Subsidy </FIG>      <H5>  Lease Credit Insurance System </H5>   This is a national insurance system established in 1973 as a  system to supplement the credit access of medium and small  enterprises in order for them to use leasing on advantageous  terms. In substance, the item insured is stipulated and the  leasing company concludes an insurance contract with the  government covering the lease contract, and in the event of  default such as non-payment of the lease fees, etc., the  government provides compensation of approximately 50% of  the  amount of default. The contracting party in the current lease  credit insurance system is the Small Enterprise Credit Insurance  Corporation which took over on behalf of the government in  October of 1984 from the Machinery Insurance Division of MITI's  Machinery and Information Industries Bureau.    This system not only supplements the credit access for  medium  and small enterprises, the insurance money is paid promptly upon  contract of the insurance, is virtually as efficient as a  no-interest loan, and it also has the advantage of low insurance  rates, etc.  <H5>  Leasing of Aircraft for Overseas Markets </H5>   As part of the measures to deal with Japan's favorable  balance of international payments in 1978 (the so-called surplus  reduction) under the leadership of MITI, the leasing companies  implemented emergency imports of aircraft and then leased them  to foreign airline companies. Under this arrangement the leasing  companies purchase aircraft and plants, etc. from abroad using  the emergency import foreign currency loan system of the  Import-Export Bank of Japan, and then provide them under lease  to various countries. It had the effect of succeeding in  reducing the surplus amidst growing criticism from a number of  countries, and of contributing to economic cooperation as well.  <H5>  (4) Fixed-Rate-Interest Subsidies </H5>   The Japan Trucking Association, a trucking industry group,  also has implemented a fixed-rate-interest subsidy for  replacement purchases of vehicles which conform to the latest  regulations, and low-pollution vehicles will be covered by these  subsidies as well.  <H5>  (5) Local Government Body Support Measures </H5>   Local government bodies will provide support to private  enterprises purchasing low-pollution vehicles.    (For Reference) Measure of the Environment Agency to promote  the introduction of electric vehicles: ``Pollution-Related  Health Damage Compensation and Prevention Foundation Subsidy''  (since FY1988)    (1) Foundation Details    The Pollution-Related Health Damage Compensation and  Prevention Foundation acts as a source of funds derived from  contributions made from the standpoint of social responsibility  by parties who are sources of atmospheric pollution, as well as  those who are connected with the sources of atmospheric  pollution, and provides prescribed-amount subsidies to local  public organizations engage in the following undertakings:    (i) local public organizations purchasing their own electric  vehicles    (ii) local public organizations providing subsidies to  private enterprises, etc. purchasing the electric vehicles    (2) Areas Covered (47 areas):    Chiba; 23 Wards of Tokyo; Yokohama; Kawasaki; Fuji; Nagoya;  Tokai; Yokkaichi; Mie Prefecture, Mie District, Kusunoki; Osaka;  Sakai; Toyonaka; Suita; Morinaga; Yao; Higashi Osaka, Kobe;  Kobe; Amagasaki; Nishinomiya; Ashiya; Kurashiki; Tamano; Bizen;  Kita Kyushu and Omuta.    (3) Principal Implementing Entities    The urban and rural prefectures and municipalities and towns  which oversee these areas    (4) Subsidy Amounts    (i) For cases in which a local governing body makes its own  purchase, the foundation subsidizes costs equivalent to one half  the purchase cost. Per-unit subsidies for FY1988 were:    (a) Electric Garbage Collection Vehicles, &yen;10 million    (b) Light Electric Vans, &yen;1.2 million    (ii) For cases in which a local governing body subsidizes  private enterprises, etc., the foundation subsidizes costs  equivalent to one fourth the purchase cost. Per-unit subsidies  for FY1988 were:    (a) Electric Garbage Collection Vehicles, &yen;5 million    (b) Light Electric Vans, &yen;600,000  <H5>  (6) Indirect Assistance Measures </H5>   - Exempting low-pollution vehicles from traffic density  control measures implemented to combat atmospheric pollution    - Formulating measures to give priority to low-pollution  vehicles in public parking    -

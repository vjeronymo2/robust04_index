			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Zimbabwe gains ground - Tony Hawkins reports on the turn around of the equity market led by renewed foreign buying Ten years ago Zimbabwe's finance minister Mr Bernard Chidzero denounced the stock exchange as the 'prostitute of the economy'. Industrial share prices, which reached a record high less than a year after independence, plummeted to a 17 year low in 1984 as investors took fright at President Robert Mugabe's strategy of 'socialist transformation' and Mr Chidzero's expropriation, for balance of payments reasons, of domestically-held foreign equities and bonds owned by Zimbabwean investors. Today the wheel has turned full circle. In April, Mr Chidzero liberalised the regulations governing foreign investment allowing overseas investors to buy up to 25 per cent of companies listed on the ZSE and allowing residents to open foreign currency deposit accounts with Zimbabwe banks. This was followed by reductions in capital gains tax on share market investment to 10 per cent from 30 per cent, and the withholding tax on dividends declared by quoted companies to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. From January companies will also be allowed to open foreign currency accounts, having the effect of 'floating' the Zimbabwe dollar. The impact of foreign buying on the equity market has been dramatic. The industrial index, which reached a peak of 2,700 (Jan 1967=100) in September 1991, before losing two thirds of its value, dipping below 900 at the end of last year, has staged a strong come back. It began moving off the bottom in the first half of the year picking up almost 10 per cent; but it was only when foreign buying started in late June that the market took off, rising more than 65 per cent in the last three months to 1,650. Market capitalisation which had fallen from a peak of ZDollars 7bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in September 1991, to ZDollars 3.4bn at the end of last year, has recouped all its losses, but because of devaluation it remains well below its 1991 hard-currency high of Dollars 2.7bn. Initial interest came from individuals, but following the tax reductions in the July budget, emerging market funds, mainly UK-based but also some from the Far East, the US and Australia, started buying. Fund investors are driven primarily by price-earnings considerations. At mid-year the Harare industrial p/e ratio of 3.9 was about half the 8.0 acceptable to fund managers, but now it is hovering around 7.6 and seems set to move higher. Turnover has jumped from ZDollars 750,000 (Dollars 115,000) weekly in the first half of the year to more than ZDollars 10m (USDollars 1.5m), of which over 40 per cent is foreign buying. In less than four months since liberalisation, foreigners have put some ZDollars 60m (Dollars 9m) into the market, which is more than the net inflow of foreign direct investment since independence 13 years ago. Ironically, foreign buyers are pushing prices up at a time when many, if not most, of the ZSE's 62 listed companies are reporting falling earnings. But with inflation and interest rates now on their way down and the economy expected to register marginal growth in 1993 the market is scenting better days ahead, though analysts expect another six to nine months of poor corporate profits. The IFC plans to include Zimbabwe in its investable indices from January 1994.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Dollar terms                     No. of       Sep 17    % Change      % Change Market              stocks         1993   over week    on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)       774.36        +3.2         +33.5 Brazil                (44)       235.98        +6.5         +88.8 Chile                 (20)       459.54        +2.7          +9.8 Colombia1              (8)       505.56        +5.8         +18.9 Mexico                (58)       711.23        +1.6          +5.2 Peru2                  (7)       111.47        +1.5         +11.5 Venezuela3             (8)       548.40        +8.4          +5.5 East Asia South Korea4         (130)        96.75        -1.5          -1.4 Philippines           (11)       194.40        +1.7         +45.6 Taiwan, China5        (76)        78.97        +0.5          +7.0 South Asia India6                (61)        90.47        -0.2          -3.5 Indonesia7            (31)        92.42        -1.4         +57.5 Malaysia              (61)       258.32        +5.0         +57.9 Pakistan8              (8)       234.29        +2.0         +17.0 Sri Lanka9             (5)       130.85        -0.5         +30.8 Thailand              (52)       315.69       +13.9         +37.0 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)       234.42        +3.6         +35.2 Jordan                 (5)       170.76        +3.1         +23.0 Portugal              (16)       108.98        +4.6         +41.3 Turkey10              (31)       188.35        -4.6        +174.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Local currency terms                        Sep 17     % Change     % Change Market                   1993    over week   on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina          475,160.07         +3.2        +33.8 Brazil          45,839,560.15        +16.8     +2,098.1 Chile                  760.93         +3.3        +18.7 Colombia1              727.55         +6.0        +19.0 Mexico                 954.99         +1.5         +5.2 Peru2                  145.76         +2.0        +45.8 Venezuela3           1,244.31        +11.0        +33.3 East Asia South Korea4           103.18         -1.2         +1.4 Philippines            262.02         +0.4        +62.1 Taiwan, China5          79.60         +1.5        +14.1 South Asia India6                 100.05         -0.2         +4.8 Indonesia7             105.59         -1.3        +60.5 Malaysia               242.18         +4.7        +53.5 Pakistan8              316.86         +2.0        +36.7 Sri Lanka9             139.84         -0.6        +39.8 Thailand               316.75        +14.0        +35.8 Euro/Mid East Greece                 370.30         +2.9        +30.0 Jordan                 243.07         +2.8        +46.6 Portugal               124.24         +3.2        +59.4 Turkey10             1,071.20         -2.0       +299.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

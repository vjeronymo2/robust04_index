			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / German fire investigation continues GERMAN police said yesterday a fire that on Friday gutted a building commemorating Jews who died at the Sachsenhausen death camp was started by a human hand, but could not say yet whether neo-Nazi arsonists were guilty, Reuter reports from Berlin. However Mr Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, was certain neo-Nazi militants torched the barrack in Oranienburg, north of Berlin. He demanded the barrack be restored and said any failure by politicians firmly to oppose neo-Nazi violence would encourage militants to step up their attacks. 'It is a disgrace for Germany that a memorial for murdered Jews is burned down,' the Jewish leader said in Bonn. There were no immediate statements from Bonn politicians on the incident. Police said their investigation had established the fire was started by somebody either by accident or on purpose. Final results would be released today.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Many roofing sites 'unsafe' NEARLY a quarter of all roofing sites inspected this summer were shut down because they broke safety law, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday. In a four-month national inspection drive starting in May, 2,596 roofs were checked and 29 prosecutions completed. One contractor was fined Pounds 20,000 - the statutory maximum - for offences involving a death. More than 600 prohibition notices were issued, forcing contractors to stop work until workplaces complied with safety law. The average fine was Pounds 2,500. Almost 100 more prosecutions are being considered. Dr Tim Carter, the HSE's field operations' director, said the figures showed that bad safety practice was 'deep-rooted' in the roofing industry. 'For too long, roof work has been seen as a rogue industry attracting the unscrupulous 'get-rich-quick' brigade.' More than one in five of deaths in construction occurs during roof work. About three workers a month are killed falling off roofs and passers-by have been hit by falling materials. In the past three years, 109 workers have been killed and more than 2,500 seriously injured. The HSE estimates that there are more than 7,000 roofing contractors in Britain employing about 30,000 workers. Almost 75 per cent of roof workers are with companies employing three people or fewer. The HSE says it is still analysing the 2,596 reports and plans to monitor the impact of its campaign. It believes it has been successful in raising contractors' awareness of safety. Next year the HSE plans to run a similar campaign which will focus on the use of protective equipment.</p>

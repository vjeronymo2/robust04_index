			<p>BFN     [Text] Peruvian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Efrain  Goldenberg, who is in Morocco, today expressed optimism about  the decision to create the World Trade Organization.    Goldenberg is heading the Peruvian delegation that is  participating in the GATT conference. Goldenberg said that the  World Trade Organization, which will be created after the  conclusion of the GATT conference and will supervise world  trade, is the outcome of the liberalization policy advocated by  Peru.    Regarding the so-called social clause advocated by the  United  States and several European countries, Goldenberg was against  mixing the labor jurisdiction of the International Labor  Organization with the trade jurisdiction of the future World  Trade Organization.</p>

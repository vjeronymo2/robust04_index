			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> More than 500 Tibetan university students defied a ban on demonstations in  Lhasa and marched to the regional government headquarters calling for a  "peaceful solution to the Tibetan problem." Tibetan and foreign sources said  that the demonstrators from Lhasa University encountered no resistance from the  massive Chinese police force in the capital and that there was no violence. The  demonstration was in sharp contrast with an anti-Chinese, pro-independence  rally Dec. 10 in which police fired on unarmed Tibetan Buddhist monks and  onlookers, killing as many as eight people.  </P></p>

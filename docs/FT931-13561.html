			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Internal watchdog plan for banks BANKS MAY be asked by the Treasury to appoint internal ombudsmen to deal with complaints from small business customers, the government said yesterday, Robert Peston writes. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to announce next week the results of the Treasury's review of how the banks have been treating their small business customers, following widespread complaints about insensitive treatment and overcharging. He will say the inquiry found that the banks have on the whole been passing on the benefits of lower base interest rates to small business borrowers, although there is evidence of sharp rises in business tariffs. Mr Lamont is also likely to extend the scope of the banking ombudsman scheme so that complaints of malpractice from incorporated small businesses can be considered by Mr Laurence Shurman, the official ombudsman. Unincorporated businesses can already take complaints to him. The bulk of business complaints relate not to mistakes by banks, however, but to the terms and conditions imposed by banks for loans and other services. The Treasury is considering asking the banks to appoint internal ombudsmen, to deal with these complaints.</p>

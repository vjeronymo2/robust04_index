			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>   [Excerpt] Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir informed the  attorney for the Hebron settlers that no evacuation of Tall  al-Rumaythah would take place in the coming 10 days.    The attorney general also said that an evacuation would take  place only after proper deliberations are held either in the  cabinet or the Knesset and after the settlers are given  sufficient time to appeal to the High Court of Justice.    Similar remarks were made yesterday by Major General Dani  Yatom, commander of the Central Command, to settlement leaders  in Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. Gen. Yatom said that if the  settlers are uprooted from Hebron it will be done in an orderly  and public way and not like "thieves in the night."    Our correspondent Mikhal Goldberg reports that before this  promise was made, Uri Qarzan, a Tall al-Rumaythah resident,  appealed to the High Court of Justice to order the defense  minister and the Army to give 72-hours notice before evacuating  Jewish settlers from Hebron. The court will deliberate on the  appeal this week.    Likud Knesset Member Mikha'el Eytan yesterday called on the  prime minister and justice minister to give a week's prior  warning before carrying out any evacuation in the territories.    The Hebron march which was due to take place tomorrow will  be  replaced by a large gathering of settlers in Qiryat Arba' on  Thursday, it was decided yesterday following a day of  discussions between the settlers and Gen. Yatom and Gen. Sha'ul  Mufaz, Army commander in Judaea and Samaria. [passage omitted]</p>

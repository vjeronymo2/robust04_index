			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, "prominent </F> Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip," by Shalom Oren, place not  given; from the "It Is All Talk" program -- live]    [Text] [Oren] We heard this morning that Hamas considers  cooperation with the autonomy police conditional on continued  terror attacks inside the Green Line boundaries. What did you  reply?    [Abu-Zayidah] I believe there was nothing new in this  morning's report by Moti Amir. That is, no new situation was  created today which did not exist a week, a month, or a year ago.    [Oren] The recent attacks inside Israel, however, do create  a new situation.    [Abu-Zayidah] I am speaking about our negotiations with  Hamas, not about the location of terror attacks. We hold  constant discussions in a bid to preserve the peace process, as  Palestinians, as PLO members.    [Oren] What do you tell them when the say: We will  cooperate only if we are allowed to go on with terror attacks in  return?    [Abu-Zayidah] Obviously, there are serious differences  between us and Hamas regarding the road we should take. We have  covered quite a distance on the road to peace, the peace  process. They do not believe in this way, and it is no secret;  everybody knows this. There is no argument in which they say:  You cooperate with us on terror, and we will cooperate in the  negotiations. This is self evident. They have their way and we  have ours.    [Oren] How, then, do the two organizations -- one of which  wants peace and the other does not -- negotiate?    [Abu-Zayidah] There are many things we discuss. For  example, both parties are not interested in a head-on collision  between the two on the ground. Naturally, we both seek to  prevent a civil war in the strip. We share an interest on this  issue. Another example concerns the future of the process:  Soon there will be a Palestinian rule here -- this is a fact!  Knowing this, they know they will have to go along with the new  situation, and discuss their incorporation in it.    [Oren] When autonomy is set up and there is a Palestinian  police in the Gaza Strip, what will you do if, God forbid,  terror acts are perpetrated inside the Green Line?    [Abu-Zayidah] As Palestinian members of the PLO, we will do  whatever is required. We will implement and observe every  agreement we sign.    [Oren] Will you arrest Hamas members when required?    [Abu-Zayidah] We will have our laws and it is clear that  Hamas and PLO members will be arrested if they violate them.  Anyone who violates the law will put himself in jeopardy. This  is the way it is being done in every organized state, although  we do not have a state yet. We will have our rule, which is  clear, and it will have its own laws, and the citizens will have  to observe the laws.    [Oren] But there is cooperation between Fatah and Hamas in  the Gaza Strip.    [Abu-Zayidah] On what, for example?    [Oren] For example, speaking on the anniversary of the death  of Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir], Muhsayn Abu-al-Ata, a Hamas  leader, spoke about such cooperation.    [Abu-Zayidah] Look, there are no taxes on words, as you say.  Let me tell you -- there is no cooperation on terror. We know  that the terror attacks aim at damaging the peace process. How  can we cooperate with this? We will, for example, cooperate on  education.    [Oren] Do you have any bargaining chips with Hamas? We know  that Hamas receives aid from Jordan while Fatah has financial  problems. Hamas has arms, while Fatah handed over some of its  weapons to the Army.    [Abu-Zayidah] You bet we have. We will be in charge. We  will have a police force, money that we have, and money we are  yet to receive. The rules of the games will change.    [Oren] What is your reaction to the report that Hamas is  making cooperation with the autonomy police conditional on the  continuation of attacks inside the Green Line? Do you  absolutely reject this?    [Abu-Zayidah] We are not only rejecting this, we do not  allow them to even say this. This request means sabotaging the  peace process. Do you believe we will commit suicide? It is  impossible. Anyone who thinks this way is insane. Believe me,  they have never raised this condition.    [Oren] Do you deny that they did?    [Abu-Zayidah] They did not raise this. They cannot raise  this. They know our policy.</p>

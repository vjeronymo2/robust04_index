			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Legal basis for action is unclear THE LEGAL status of the latest hostilities in the Gulf is confused by two separate Security Council resolutions, which differ in form and content. Resolution 687, passed on April 4 1991, embodies the formal ceasefire terms imposed on Iraq by the UN at the end of the Gulf war. Iraq was required to accept it, and did so, as the alternative would have been a resumption of hostilities. Violations of it amount to breaches of the ceasefire, and therefore the powers which fought the war (with the authorisation of the Security Council under an earlier resolution, No 678) consider themselves legally entitled to respond to such violations with military force. Resolution 688 deals with the internal affairs of Iraq. It was a response to President Saddam Hussein's suppression of the uprisings in both south and north that followed his defeat in the war. The attack on the Kurds, especially, caused an outburst of revulsion and guilt in western countries as well as serious alarm in Turkey, which found itself facing a refugee crisis. The Security Council condemned the repression and demanded that Iraq put a stop to it, called for a 'broad dialogue' aimed at ensuring respect for 'the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens', and insisted that Iraq allow international organisations access to all those who needed help in any part of the country. It did not, however, threaten any action to enforce these demands if Iraq failed to comply with them. Western powers frequently refer to Resolution 688 to justify the military action they subsequently took, first to establish a 'safe haven' for the Kurds in the north of the country, and more recently to create a 'no-fly zone' in the south - the latter being supposed to inhibit repressive activities against the Shia Moslem population, and particularly against both refugees and indigenous inhabitants in the marshes of lower Mesopotamia, close to the Iranian frontier. But the text of the resolution contains no reference to any such action. There has been intermittent talk of a new resolution to back up 688 and make it enforceable. But so far none has been submitted. Formal de-recognition of Mr Saddam's regime might be a necessary first step. The US and its allies seem to be on stronger legal ground in taking military action to deal with incursions across the Kuwaiti border, or with obstruction of the UN inspection missions, verifying the destruction of Iraq's non-conventional weapons facilities, than they were in proclaiming the no-fly zones or in using military force to impose Iraqi compliance with them.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / The Property Market: The final curtain call - Vanessa Houlder on MEPC's outgoing chairman Sir Christopher Benson, the outgoing chairman of MEPC, Britain's second largest property group, does not view next week's annual general meeting with his usual equanimity. He is bracing himself for a possible intervention at the behest of Mr Harry Hyams, the reclusive post-war developer of Centre Point in London who is one of MEPC's most critical shareholders. 'I would be surprised if Harry Hyams did not orchestrate something,' says Sir Christopher. A year ago four associates of Mr Hyams, owner of 6.6 per cent of MEPC, challenged the payment of an increased dividend. Sir Christopher has few doubts about the strength of Mr Hyams' feelings. Shortly before last year's agm, Mr Hyams set out his thoughts on MEPC's philosophy and management style in a 40-minute telephone conversion with Sir Christopher which the MEPC boss describes as 'very critical and passionate'. In the exchange, Mr Hyams said he was 'incredulous' that Sir Christopher had the gall to describe MEPC's 1991 results as creditable. MEPC's pre-tax profits fell 4.3 per cent to Pounds 143.3m in 1991. The differences between Mr Hyams and Sir Christopher date back at least to 1987 when MEPC bought Mr Hyams' company Oldham Estates in a hostile Pounds 530m deal. 'The wounds have not healed . . .he is a very bitter man,' says Sir Christopher, although he professes to admire his critic. The substance of the argument between Mr Hyams and Sir Christopher is one of corporate strategy and philosophy rather than personality. Mr Hyams' policy has always been one of ensuring security of income by letting to tenants of undoubted quality. While the value of this strategy has become apparent over the past three years, it is sometimes dubbed as an uncreative, 'rent-collecting' approach. Indeed, Mr Hyams' refusal to take a more aggressive strategy in the redevelopment of his portfolio paved the way for MEPC's takeover of Oldham Estates. MEPC, by contrast, believes in trying to add value to its buildings. 'We want to take a building and do something to improve it. If it is not improvable we sell it,' says Sir Christopher. The clash between these two cultures became apparent in Mr Hyams' objection to MEPC's sale last year of a 1960s Croydon office building that was let to the government. MEPC sold it because it thought that the building had no prospects for rental growth and the company wished to contain its borrowing. Mr Hyams said the disposal amounted to selling good assets in a weak market for short-term gain. The difference of opinion over the sale of the Croydon site was not the first time that Sir Christopher has had to defend MEPC's strategy since he joined the board in 1974. His early years at the company were spent travelling the world persuading banks to back MEPC, which had overextended itself. Much of his time was also taken up troubleshooting in continental Europe and Australia. In the late 1970s, the company decided to expand its US portfolio, a decision which led to heavy losses when the Texas real estate market slumped in the early 1980s. 'The timing was exquisitely wrong,' admits Sir Christopher. More recently, MEPC's development programme in the City of London has also come under fire from analysts. 'The management's decision to expand in the City was clearly a major strategic error . . . While MEPC's financial management is very astute, the direction of its property activities seems to be badly flawed,' said Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, in 1991. The timing of MEPC's development programme and high exposure to office markets in general were widely criticised and its share price badly underperformed for much of 1991 and 1992. Towards the end of last year, however, MEPC's shares were re-rated after the company showed that it had sharply reduced its vacancy rate and was able to maintain its dividend payment. Perhaps the most important recent factor in improving MEPC's accident-prone image was the letting of a large part of Alban Gate, the MEPC development straddling London Wall which for a time looked like attracting the label of the City's largest white elephant. Alban Gate's fortunes revived last September when it signed up Chemical Bank as a tenant. The US bank had previously intended to move to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project in the London docklands. There is a certain irony in the fact that the recent success of Alban Gate has been at the cost of the docklands: Sir Christopher chaired the London Docklands Development Corporation from 1984 to 1988, a job for which he was awarded a knighthood. The mid-1980s was a period of rapid expansion for the docklands and Canary Wharf was the region's most ambitious development. The period was also one in which the pace of development in the docklands ran well ahead of the area's infrastructure development and demand from tenants. Despite his deep involvement in the docklands, Sir Christopher views the mid-1980s period with a curious detachment. 'I still have some difficulty with the speed of what happened,' he says. Sir Christopher's role at the LDDC prompted some City critics to suggest that he was spreading his time too thinly. Those criticisms and Sir Christopher's readiness to become involved in a host of companies continued after he gave up the managing directorship of MEPC in 1988. He took on the job of executive chairman of MEPC at the same time; this summer he takes his leave, to be succeeded by Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson (owner of the Financial Times). Although Sir Chris is retiring from MEPC, he will remain active in the City. In 1990 he became chairman of the Housing Corporation, the quango which supervises housing associations, and chairman of Boots, the UK chemist. He is also vice-chairman of Sun Alliance, the insurance company where he is tipped to become chairman.</p>

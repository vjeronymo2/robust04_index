At a meeting with representatives of political parties and  the Parliament, he said that Russia has "embarked on a new path".    Yeltsin suggested that a document be drafted to bring  together all political movements and representatives of the  state.    He said that the programs of all parties contained  provisions  concerning problems which "are important for the country and for  each Russian citizen.    He stressed that common provisions would be summarized and  incorporated in a memorandum on civil concord and peace.    Yeltsin also asked that a working group of five members be  set up to draft the text of the memorandum and submit it for  discussion in two weeks.    He asked that participants in the meeting discuss a  mechanism  for adopting this memorandum on civil tranquillity.    Yeltsin said that it was necessary to "involve the widest  possible range of representatives of parties and public  movements in the signing of this document".</p>

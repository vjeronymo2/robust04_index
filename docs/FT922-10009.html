			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Big capital increase sought by Asia bank THE ROLE of the Asian Development Bank is likely to be scrutinised closely by its shareholders in the industrialised world following the bank's request for a large capital increase to support lending over the rest of the decade. Bank officials say capital will need to be more than doubled to cope with projected demand for loans. However, the developed countries which provide the bulk of its capital backing are likely to question the bank's lending, which is principally to public sector projects in a few countries. Mr Kimimasa Tarumizu, the bank's president, told its annual meeting in Hong Kong yesterday that a capital increase was an 'urgent priority' and called on member countries to agree on its size and timing before the end of the year. Officials concede, though, that little real progress can be made during a US election year as the US is the largest shareholder, jointly with Japan, and allocation of new funds for international development institutions is traditionally difficult to secure in Washington. The bank has not needed a capital replenishment since 1983 as the rapid economic growth of some members has led them to stop, or significantly reduce, borrowing, and to speed repayments. As a result, its loan portfolio is concentrated among a relatively small number of countries. Indonesia alone accounts for Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 3.55bn), or 34 per cent of ADB loans outstanding, and India, Pakistan and the Philippines a further 44 per cent between them. China has recently stepped up its borrowing and accounts for 5 per cent. Although rapid economic growth is expected to continue in Asia, ADB officials forecast that demand for loans will grow at 12-15 per cent during the rest of the decade, particularly to support urgent infrastructure improvements. New financing demands will come from Vietnam when a US ban is lifted, and from Cambodia and Mongolia. This would necessitate a commitment of Dollars 25bn-Dollars 32bn by shareholders to replenish capital, since total loans outstanding of Dollars 21bn are now approaching subscribed capital of Dollars 23bn and ADB lending cannot exceed subscribed capital. The US and Japan have each subscribed 15 per cent of the bank's existing capital and each accounts for 12.3 per cent of voting power. Shareholders may seek a heightened commitment to promotion of private sector development from the bank. The bank's needs for capital to back concessional lending, received by a larger number of the bank's poorer members, are not covered by the latest request.</p>

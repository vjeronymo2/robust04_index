			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORDIQUES COACH BERGERON FIRED  </P> <P> Michel Bergeron was fired today as coach of the Quebec Nordiques, the NHL's  worst team last season.  </P> <P> No replacement was named, but Dave Chambers, a former assistant coach with the  Minnesota North Stars, is considered the leading candidate.  </P> <P> General Manager Pierre Page said Bergeron was offered a job as a broadcaster  for Nordiques games, and that the fours years left on his contract would be  honored -- at approximately $250,000 a year.  </P> <P> "We're not blaming Michel Bergeron," said Page, adding that he was uneasy  making the decision since he has been general manager only a month. "It's just  a question of the right time, the right place and the right people."  </P> <P> The team finished last in the overall standings last season with a 12-61-7  record.  </P></p>

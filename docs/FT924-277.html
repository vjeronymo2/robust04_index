			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Lebanon blocks UN mercy visit: Israel says 10 stranded Palestinian deportees can return LEBANON said yesterday it would prevent a United Nations envoy from crossing its territory to visit 415 Palestinians stranded in severe winter conditions for 11 days in no man's land in the south of the country. Mr James Jonah, a special envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, travels on to Beirut from Jerusalem today for talks with the government of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister. Lebanon still refuses to co-operate with Israel over the deportations and says Israel must take back the men. The Israeli army said early today that 10 of the deportees could return. It said the decision to deport the 10 had been found to be incorrect but some would have to face trial in Israel for hostile activities. Officials have also stressed that the deportees can appeal individually to the High Court. The High Court ruled against moves to stop the deportations last week, but has yet to rule on the overall legality of the expulsions. In spite of Mr Jonah's efforts, there were few signs of any substantive breakthrough in the crisis which has convulsed Middle East peace negotiations. Palestinian leaders, frustrated that Israel has repeatedly escaped reprisals for ignoring UN resolutions, told Mr Jonah at a meeting in Jerusalem yesterday that it should be forced to implement a Security Council resolution calling for the return of the deportees - alleged by Israel to be militant Islamic fundamentalists - to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 'We demanded that they should be returned immediately, that Israel should apply UN Sec-urity Council resolution 799 immediately,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman. 'Unfortunately, we explained, so far Israel has been given preferential treatment by the world community.' However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, ruled out any reversal of the deportations, undertaken after a spate of killings of Israeli soldiers by Moslem extremists, when he met Mr Jonah on Sunday. The deportees, camped in south Lebanon in an area between Israeli and Lebanese forces, have been forced to endure heavy snowfalls and freezing temperatures without adequate supplies of food and water, or access to proper medical care, as both Israel and Lebanon have refused to take responsibility for their welfare. Mr Rabin has maintained wide support within his government for the deportations. But his refusal to allow humanitarian aid to be taken to the camp through Israeli-held territory has come under strong opposition. Yesterday, France requested permission to do so and said it was awaiting a response. The Israeli government has acknowledged that the deportations have shattered the favourable international image fostered by Mr Rabin since he came to office in July. The military said deportees who were expelled due to mistaken identity could return if they appealed to a special army committee or the High Court. A meeting of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians at the weekend decided to seek UN action to enforce resolution 799. But it did not rule out a return to the peace talks after the new US administration takes over next month. Editorial Comment, Page 10</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: US waves sanctions stick at the Chinese - Clinton and Jiang to meet at Apec talks US officials insist they are ready to impose trade penalties on China even though President Bill Clinton has adopted a new policy of closer engagement with Beijing. Mr Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, listed three areas of trade negotiations in which the US expected China to take action in the near future: market access, textiles, and intellectual property rights. These issues and China's growing trade surplus with the US were due to be raised yesterday by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, with Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, as part of a series of bilateral meetings taking place during the annual ministerial meeting in Seattle of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping. Trade issues, as well as human rights and nuclear non-proliferation, are also likely to be raised tomorrow when Mr Clinton meets President Jiang Zemin in Seattle. A senior administration official said, however, that the Seattle meetings would not be negotiations but an opportunity to explain Mr Clinton's new two-pronged approach to China: that the US recognised China's importance and did not wish it to be isolated, but that serious points of disagreement needed to be addressed. The official said: 'We can either stand outside and lob our concerns over the wall, or we can engage face to face with the Chinese leadership and make clear that we recognise that China is a great country with enormous potential, but that for our relationship to continue to progress there has to be sensitivity on their part to the concerns that we have.' Mr Christopher, in a speech last night at the University of Washington, said the US was willing to negotiate conditions under which it would lift sanctions imposed over China's sale of missile components to Pakistan. This was part of the new US policy of deeper engagement with China, of which the goal was 'to build a comprehensive relationship that permits the resolution of our differences'. However, unless there was significant progress on human rights, Mr Clinton would not be able to renew China's most-favoured nation trading status next year. He hoped that a recent Chinese offer to open its prisons to the International Red Cross was 'a harbinger of sustained progress'. Ms Barshefsky said that on market access, China had agreed last year to reduce import restrictions but its 'offers. . . . have been inadequate'. The US would take action after December 31 if its requirements were not met. On renewal of a bilateral textile accord which also expires December 31, she said recent discussions had been more productive. However, agreement required significant movement by China, and the US was prepared to take unilateral action. On intellectual property rights, Beijing had enacted a 'world class' series of laws 'but there is no enforcement', Ms Barshefsky said. 'This is a very urgent issue which requires immediate attention by the Chinese,' she said, referring in particular to pirating of compact discs.</p>

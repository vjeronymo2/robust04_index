			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Electric car study launched A fleet of electric cars may be launched in Coventry in 1996. Warwickshire Institute is conducting a Pounds 50,000 feasibility study on the scheme for the city and Peugeot, the French car company. The project, backed by a consortium which includes PowerGen, IBM and East Midlands Electricity, is planned to coincide with the centenary of the British car industry and a redevelopment of the city centre. It is likely to provide electric cars hired for individual journeys using a 'smart card' electronic monitoring system.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Tennessee S&amp;L Closed: Federal regulators closed insolvent Valley Federal  Savings Bank of Dayton, Tenn., Friday, and the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corp. said it would begin a direct payment of $12.9 million to  insured depositors. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board directed FSLIC to begin  the payment of insured funds because a merger or an acquisition could not be  arranged. As of Dec. 31, Valley had $11.9 million in assets, $15.7 million in  liabilities, $12.9 million in deposits and negative regulatory capital of $3.5  million.  </P></p>

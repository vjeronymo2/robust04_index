			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Manufacturing falls to 1988 levels THE end of Germany's unification boom has pushed orders for west German manufactured goods and plant utilisation in factories back to mid-1988 levels, according to figures from the Ifo economics institute in Frankfurt. Industrialists expect stagnation 'at best' for the coming months, the institute says, and they are increasingly doubtful that use of existing capacity will reach 'satisfactory' levels in the year ahead. Investment goods makers, for example, which are now working at 84.8 per cent capacity, expect continuing contraction. The new data and opinions, assembled by Ifo from its regular business surveys, suggest that hopes of improvement depend more on increased overseas demand than any domestic upswing. The delicacy of the economic balance is underscored by a claim from the DIW institute in Berlin that west Germany's real gross national product fell by half a percentage point in the last quarter of 1991. If confirmed, this would be the third decline in succession. 'The latest industrial orders figures show that the western economy is going through a difficult phase,' DIW says in a report today. The institute, a recognised authority on east Germany, also claims that real GNP in the east fell 30 per cent last year, compared with the hitherto accepted estimate of 20 per cent. The correction stems partly, it says, from the discovery that increases in construction industry output have been 'clearly over-estimated'. Construction is one of the main motors driving the eastern economy towards officially forecast growth of 10 per cent this year. The DIW also accused the Treuhand privatisation agency of increasing liquidity loans to its ailing east German companies this year instead of using the money to modernise and restructure them. The institute said the Treuhand should stop guaranteeing liquidity loans to companies which were using them for 'uncontrollable purposes'. Instead, investment loans and company capitalisation should be increased - up to a fixed limit - and be tied to the level of non-guaranteed bank loans obtained by companies. They should also have to achieve profitability by a set date. According to the DIW, DM9.9bn, nearly a third of the Treuhand's budget, went toward restructuring its companies last year, while DM4.5bn was spent on guaranteed liquidity loans. These were largely used to pay wages, salaries and other running costs. This year the Treuhand plans to guarantee DM8bn in liquidity loans while boosting restructuring funds to only DM11.5bn, said DIW. It proposed that, instead of subsidising wages, the Treuhand should give decreasing wage subsidies for a limited period to companies which are to be restructured. It also suggested that old debts of companies be cancelled and transferred to the federal budget. Both Bonn and the Treuhand recently suggested that the east German state governments might want to invest in large companies which could not otherwise be rescued. But the governments themselves almost totally depend on funds from Bonn which faces a myriad of financial demands from east Germany. IG Metall union officials yesterday dropped a threat of mass protests against a merger of Fried. Krupp and Hoesch after a last-minute deal with Krupp giving workers 10 seats on the 20-seat supervisory board of the enlarged steel group, Reuter reports from Bonn. The board will not have a further 'neutral' member as other steel concerns do.</p>

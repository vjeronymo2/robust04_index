			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Nation awaits an administration THREE months after winning the US election, President Bill Clinton is still struggling in his attempts to install an administration in Washington. The elimination of Judge Kimba Wood on Friday night as a candidate for the post of attorney general has left the Justice Department - arguably one of the federal departments most in need of renewed leadership - rudderless. And although all of Mr Clinton's other cabinet secretaries have won confirmation from the Senate and started work at their departments, only three of the 14 deputy secretaries have been confirmed - and these, at State, Treasury and Veterans' Affairs, are the only deputies selected by Mr Clinton and announced at the same time as their cabinet superiors. At the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior and Justice, no deputy secretary has even been nominated. Candidates for these positions, as well as appointees who have already been confirmed, will now face additional scrutiny over whether they ever employed an illegal alien in their households, or neglected to pay the appropriate social security taxes - an obligation for an employee paid over Dollars 50 in a quarter. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown acknowledged yesterday that he had failed to pay social security taxes for a cleaner, and two candidates for governor of New Jersey have been torpedoed by the 'nanny question', which seems likely to replace youthful marijuana smoking as the most fashionable test for political fitness. Vice-President Al Gore, trade representative Mickey Kantor and Texas Senator Phil Gramm, a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996, all denied yesterday they had any problems with domestic help. New US administrations are always beset in their early months with tales of disarray as they attempt to fill the 9,100 federal positions open to political appointees, including 600-800 posts with significant policy-making roles. It is no surprise that the Democrats, returning to power after 12 years out of office, have faced the same problems. This is little consolation, however, for the businesses, agencies, foreign governments and citizens who have to deal with an administration operating on autopilot.</p>

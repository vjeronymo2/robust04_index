			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Japanese urban farmers turn their hands to property development JAPAN'S urban farmers have fuelled a sharp rise in house building over the past year by turning their hands to property development, writes Charles Leadbeater. These would-be-property developers are the main force behind last year's 17 per cent increase in apartment building, which is one of the brightest spots in an otherwise depressed economy. Large swathes of Japan's big cities are still reserved for agriculture, mainly rice paddies and fruit trees. About 13 per cent of Tokyo's land is classified as farmland, worked by about 300,000 families. It is estimated that about 500,000 homes could be built upon this land. A surge in apartment building in cities over the past year is largely due to urban farmers turning over their land to housing to take advantage of the tax changes of September 1991. These changes affected the capital gains tax on land sold for residential development and lowered the tax exemptions for farmers who promised to farm their land for at least 10 years. As the farmers want to hold on to their land holdings they have built apartments for rent rather than condominiums for sale. The farmers have been queueing to borrow money from the official Housing Loan Corporation to finance their development plans. At their peak last year loans from the corporation were rising at a rate of about 600 per cent annually. A report by Credit Suisse securities says there is no sign of land prices bottoming out yet and an additional fall of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent is still possible in big cities.</p>

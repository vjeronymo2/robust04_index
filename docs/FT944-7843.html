			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Ministers study BAe's RAF offer An offer by British Aerospace to maintain the Royal Air Force's existing fleet of Hercules transport aircraft at a fixed price, with a set number of aircraft available at any one time, is to be discussed by a cabinet committee tomorrow. The proposal, which was sent to Mr Roger Freeman, the UK defence procurement minister, will be discussed with recommendations by a Ministry of Defence procurement committee to buy a number of C-130J Lockheed aircraft as an alternative to refurbishment. BAe has made the offer because it wants the MoD to buy the European Future Large Aircraft, for which BAe will build the wings. However, the FLA will not become available until 2002, while the RAF argues that its Hercules fleet will need replacement from 1996. Thus far many MoD insiders have strongly backed replacement of half of the 60-strong ageing Lockheed Hercules with the same company's C-130J rather than opting for refurbishment, which it had considered uneconomic. However, the Treasury is thought to be interested in BAe's proposals, which would not require the MoD to buy new aircraft or refurbish the existing Hercules fleet. Both departments will be represented at the committee meeting on Thursday, as will the Department of Trade and Industry and the Scottish Office. BAe has offered to maintain a fleet of 50 Hercules aircraft, 70 per cent of which would be available at any time, at a fixed cost 20 per cent lower than the RAF's current maintenance costs. The company is also undertaking to complete any refurbishment work which is needed at no cost to the RAF. BAe puts the cost of maintaining the Hercules fleet at Pounds 52m a year. In a separate note BAe has also suggested that the MoD sells its Hercules fleet to BAe and leases it back to further improve the department's finances. The RAF is thought to have only half of its 60 Hercules available for use at any time. It is also thought to be intending to reduce the size of the fleet to 50 in 1996 even if its opts for replacement rather than refurbishment. BAe's document claims that its offer would thus mean an increase in the number of aircraft available at a lower cost. The MoD confirmed that it had received an unsolicited approach from BAe which it was considering. However, it could not confirm how quickly any decision would be made. The MoD has said it intends to make a decision about the Hercules fleet before Christmas. In its document BAe says that its proposal will 'deliver real value for money to the MoD and RAF while transferring risk to the private sector'.</p>

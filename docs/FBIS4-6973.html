			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The departure of the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the ruling coalition is  expected to make it extremely hard for the new administration of  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to steadily carry out economic  policies. SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama said his party will do  whatever it can to enact the fiscal 1994 national budget when he  said at a news conference early Tuesday [26 April] morning that  the party will leave the coalition.    However, rough going is expected in Diet deliberations on  the  budget, political sources said.    Murayama told reporters the SDP will consider a recent  coalition agreement on tax reform, including a hike in indirect  tax, "with a clean slate."    This indicates discussions on tax reform may hit a snag,  making it difficult for the Hata administration to pass the 1994  budget bill through the Diet before the July summit of the Group  of Seven economic powers in Naples, Italy, political analysts  said.    They forecast the SDP may be strongly opposed to a hike in  the 3 percent consumption tax to finance 6 trillion yen worth of  cuts in income and residential taxes for the current fiscal year.</p>

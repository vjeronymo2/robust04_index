			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Local polls set to strengthen Ciller: A strong law and order platform appears to have paid off for Turkey's beleaguered premier Turkey's embattled prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, appeared to have strengthened her position yesterday, as her centre-right True Path party (DYP) headed for a narrow victory in nationwide local elections - but the Moslem-backed Refah party was poised for sweeping gains. Last night, with about three quarters of the votes counted for the provincial assemblies, the DYP was leading with 22.6 per cent of the vote, compared with 21 per cent for the conservative Motherland party (Anap). However, in a shock result, the pro-Islamic Refah, with 18 per cent of the vote nationally, seemed poised to win Istanbul, the largest city, and was running neck-and-neck for control of the capital, Ankara. Feeding on disaffection with the mainstream parties in the two main cities, Refah had polled 25 per cent of the vote in Istanbul compared with Anap's 22 per cent. In Ankara, Refah was competing for victory against the secularist Social Democratic Populist party (SHP). The national result, while having no direct bearing on party strengths in parliament, will provide Mrs Ciller with a badly needed electoral mandate. The outcome is a particular blow to the political ambitions of Anap's leader, Mr Mesut Yilmaz, who billed the elections as a referendum on the government's performance. Despite almost universal criticism of her economic policies, yesterday's polls suggest the rural voter still believes Mrs Ciller is the best hope for national revival. The result strengthens her hand on reform as her coalition partners, the Social Democratic Populists, who have been routinely obstructive on tax and privatisation moves, suffered widespread losses, winning around 13 per cent. However, Mrs Ciller has only won herself a breathing space, and still has to convince the market she can assemble a team and administer spending restraints and other economic reforms to narrow the fiscal deficit and restore confidence in the currency. She met her key economic advisers for four hours earlier in the day, and last night was said to be finalising details of reforms. In the end, what probably clinched the result was Mrs Ciller's decision to fight on a strong law and order platform - particularly her legal moves against Kurdish MPs. This appears to have been strongly endorsed in rural Anatolia and the Aegean region where the DYP is traditionally strong. The military, which is preparing for its long heralded spring offensive against rebel positions, will also take comfort from the vote which would appear to back up the security forces' hard line against the Kurds, despite the international criticism. Another notable element in the results was the Refah party's strong showing in Kurdish areas. The markets welcomed the results yesterday, with the lira steadier at around 24,900 to the dollar.</p>

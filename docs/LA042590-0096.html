			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> $265,000 OKD FOR 'DRUG BABY' PROJECT  </P> <P> Supervisors on Tuesday approved without comment $265,060 in federal funding for  Orange County's first comprehensive program to treat and study children born to  mothers who abused drugs during pregnancy.  </P> <P> The program, in operation a little more than a year at UCI Medical Center in  Orange, has been monitoring the health and behavior of 60 drug-exposed  children, offering them checkups and teaching their mothers or foster parents  how to care for them.  </P> <P> Around the nation, estimates of so-called "drug babies" vary widely, with  different studies reporting from 13,000 to 375,000 such children born last  year.  </P> <P> In Orange County last year, hospital directors and nursing managers estimated  that 1,248 Orange County children were exposed to marijuana, heroin,  amphetamines and other illicit drugs at birth, but many health experts believe  the problem here is greater.  </P> <P> A memo from the County Health Care Agency to supervisors described the problem  here as alarming. For instance, 20% of all protective custody cases involve  infants exposed to drugs or parents involved with drugs, it said, and county  juvenile detention memos from January, 1988, to May, 1989, showed that 270  newborns tested positive for drugs.  </P> <P> Len Foster, the County Health Care Agency's division manager for adult and  child health services, called the UCI project a start at tackling an important  problem.  </P> <P> The federal grant allocated by the supervisors covers UCI's care to  drug-exposed children from March to September of this year. Cheryl Milford,  developmental psychologist at UCI and a founder of the project, and the  project's pediatrician, Lynn Hunt, said they plan to expand their program to  monitor and treat 400 drug-exposed children to age 5.LANIE JONES  </P></p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Feast your eyes on an Asian opportunity - American-style fast food is catching on in a region hungry for western tastes Kenny Rogers, the US country and western crooner, rode into Kuala Lumpur recently. He wasn't playing his guitar or singing a tear-jerking song. He was cooking chickens. Kenny Rogers Roasters boasts of being the fastest-growing fast-food chain in the US, with more than 1,000 restaurants opened or about to start operations across the country. In May the first Roasters store in Asia opened in the Malaysian capital. The crowds who wait in line in Kuala Lumpur for one of Rogers' chickens, marinaded in a special herb sauce and cooked on a wood-fired rotisserie ('It's wood that makes it good') testify to one of the marketing phenomena of Asia: American-style fast food is catching on as fast as it can be cooked. The Florida-based Roasters chain was founded three years ago by Rogers and John Y. Brown Junior, a former Kentucky governor. Earlier this year Berjaya, a Malaysia-based conglomerate, bought a 24 per cent stake in Roasters for Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m). Berjaya paid Dollars 10m for a 50 per cent stake in the chain's Asia Pacific operations. 'We've only been open a few weeks and already we are selling far more chickens per day - about 1,400 each Saturday and Sunday - than stores in the US,' says Syed Ghazali, general manager of Roasters in Kuala Lumpur. 'We plan to open eight more stores in Malaysia this year with further openings in Singapore and the Philippines. South Korea and Indonesia will follow after.' It's the same story all over Asia. At one time the sceptics said that Asians would never give up their diet for the blander tastes of American fast food. But the traditional corner coffee shop selling chicken, rice and noodles is disappearing and being replaced by McDonald's, Pizza Hut or Kentucky Fried Chicken. The taste of the food is only one element in the success story. 'Our marketing people tell us that people here love the American way. People come to the stores not only for the food but to enjoy American style and American service,' says Syed. The region's economic success has brought about the rise of an increasingly affluent middle class. A plate of chicken and rice might only cost MDollars 2.50 (95 cents) in Kuala Lumpur. But more and more city dwellers have the money to pay twice or three times as much for a Roasters meal. Karl Faux runs the south-east Asia operations of Tony Roma's, a Texas-based chain specialising in ribs. The chain's 140-seat restaurant in Singapore serves up to 800 meals per day. 'Anything that's American sells well. Business is better than we ever dreamt it would be,' he says. Faux, an Austrian hotelier who manages Tony Roma's regional operations on behalf of Indonesian franchise holders, says a vital ingredient in the attractiveness of US-style fast food is that it caters for the family. 'Asians like eating as a family. It's a very important part of the business.' Fast-food chains make some adjustments to local conditions. Kenny Rogers Roasters cost about half as much in Malaysia as in the US. Some chains use local sauces and ingredients. Others insist that all supplies come from the US. Tony Roma's has expanded into Indonesia. It now ships a container of US pork ribs each month into the world's largest Moslem country. McDonald's opened one of its first outlets in Asia in Singapore in 1979. Now, eight of its 10 best-selling restaurants in the world are in Asia: seven of them are in Hong Kong while the recently opened outlet in Beijing is the company's top performer. In Malaysia, where the fast food industry is growing at an estimated 10 to 15 per cent each year, Kentucky Fried Chicken outsells McDonald's. Chicken is the one mass consumption meat that all Malaysians - whether Malay, Chinese or Indian - can happily feast on. By the end of this year Colonel Saunders will be smiling over 150 branches throughout Malaysia. Not everyone is happy about the US invasion of Asia's high streets. There are suspicions that along with the food, US values are being imported. Asia's leaders worry about a directionless, undisciplined younger generation lounging at eating joints. Perhaps the tourists will be the most disappointed. If Asia continues on its present course the visitor will soon be able to walk down the road in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta - only to find the same restaurants as at home.</p>

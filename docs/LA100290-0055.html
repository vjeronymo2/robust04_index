			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ASIAN BIAS FOUND IN UCLA PROGRAM;  </P> <P> DISCRIMINATION: UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR SAYS U.S. DEPT. OF EDUCATION'S CLAIMS ARE  THE RESULT OF FAULTY REASONING AND POLITICAL PRESSURE.  </P> <P> UCLA's graduate department of mathematics discriminated against Asian  applicants in 1987 and 1988 in violation of federal civil rights law, the U.S.  Department of Education announced Monday after a 30-month investigation. The  government said 75 other UCLA graduate departments showed no anti-Asian bias in  admissions and that an additional eight programs kept inconclusive records.  </P> <P> UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young denounced the conclusions about the  mathematics department, saying they were the result of faulty reasoning and  political pressure. The university plans to appeal the findings within the  Department of Education and, if need be, take the matter to court, he said.  </P> <P> The government is asking that UCLA change its admissions policies in graduate  mathematics programs and offer admission to five Asian-American applicants  allegedly denied entrance because of bias. The government could deny UCLA all  federal grants, not just in mathematics studies, if the matter is not settled  to Washington's liking.  </P> <P> U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos said in a prepared statement that  he was encouraged by much of what the probe by his department's Office of Civil  Rights had found at UCLA. He added, "Although only one program was found to  discriminate, that is one program too many."  </P> <P> The study determined that there was a disparity between the rates at which  Anglos, particularly Anglo women, and at least equally qualified Asian-American  applicants were admitted to the graduate mathematics department and concluded  that the disparity "appeared to be race related." About a third of the 150  mathematics graduate students at UCLA are Asian, either American citizens or  foreigners, campus officials said.  </P> <P> The five rejected applicants allegedly discriminated against do not know that  they are the object of such controversy and have not been contacted by federal  authorities, said Michael Williams, assistant secretary for civil rights in the  Department of Education. He said he did not know the identities of the five and  would not name them if he did.  </P> <P> The issue of alleged entrance bias against Asians in the UC system has prompted  several inconclusive state investigations over the past five years. The  controversy had begun to die down because of significant increases in the ranks  of Asian-American students at prestigious campuses such as UCLA and UC Berkeley  this year and last. Asian students now comprise 36% of UCLA's freshman class.  </P> <P> Asian-American activists said Monday's announcement is expected to renew  suspicions.  </P> <P> A similar federal investigation into undergraduate admissions at UCLA could be  concluded later this year, Williams said. The results of a probe of Harvard  University's undergraduate entrance policies may be announced later this week,  he said.  </P> <P> At a press conference on campus Monday, Chancellor Young contended that federal  investigators relied too heavily on numerical measures, such as grades and test  scores, and did not take into account how much UCLA considers the reputation of  applicants' undergraduate schools and the strength of personal recommendations.  </P> <P> Some Asians who are U.S. residents but not citizens were denied admission  because certain government-funded fellowships require the recipients to be  citizens, Young said. He added that federal officials did not properly consider  that different disciplines within mathematics, such as statistics and applied  mathematics, make separate judgments on applicants.  </P> <P> Young alleged that investigators were under pressure from U.S. Department of  Education officials to announce the results by Monday and to make sure UCLA  received some criticism.  </P> <P> "We believe the study and the results are in error. We believe there is no  basis for the findings they have reached," he stated.  </P> <P> Asked for a response to Young's charge about political pressure, Williams said,  "I take a great deal of, I have to admit, offense at that. It challenges my own  integrity." Williams said he had placed an Oct. 1 deadline for the study's  release because the matter had dragged on for so long.  </P> <P> UCLA's insistence that it will appeal disappointed some Asian-American  activists, who said energies might be better spent on a campus study of the  issues.  </P> <P> "We are hoping that UCLA will conduct a more in-depth review to come up with  more systematic admissions guidelines," said Stewart Kwoh, executive director  of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center in Los Angeles and president of the  Asian alumni group at UCLA.  </P></p>

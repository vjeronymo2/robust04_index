			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Free to be held captive: Britain's tough immigration laws are unfair and carry an economic price More than two centuries ago Lord Justice Mansfield established the doctrine that any human being who set foot on English soil automatically enjoyed the rights of a free man under English law. First and foremost among those rights is the one enshrined in the Habeas Corpus Act, passed in the reign of Charles II, which forbids the detention or imprisonment of anyone unless due cause is established in court. But Lord Mansfield's doctrine took a severe knock when parliament passed the Immigration Act in 1971. That law gives immigration officers the right to detain anyone arriving in the UK for as long as it takes to decide whether that person has a right to enter the country and, if not, whether he should be given leave to do so. Under this provision, people can be detained indefinitely. There is one person now in HM Holding Centre Haslar (a prison near Portsmouth) who has been in detention for a year and four months - and even that is not the record. After visiting Campsfield Detention Centre near Oxford earlier this year I received many telephone calls from people held there who have requested political asylum. One of them, Appolinaire Egny - a computer technician who defected from the ruling party in the Ivory Coast, and fled the country after his brother was arrested last autumn - wrote me a letter of such eloquence that I felt I must try to help him. On the advice of the Refugee Legal Centre I sent a fax to the chief immigration officer at Heathrow airport, where Mr Egny's file is kept, asking that he be spared further detention and offering to have him as a house guest pending a final decision on his case. In reply I got a courteous phone call. The officer regretted he could not grant temporary admission to Mr Egny at this stage, 'for reasons I am not at liberty to disclose'. I asked if Mr Egny's lawyer was aware of those reasons. 'No. It's not our policy to give reasons. Our powers are discretionary.' The officers of Charles I or Charles II could not have put it better. As for Lord Mansfield, he must be turning in his grave. If Mr Egny had been arrested for a crime, the police would have had to convince a magistrate that there were good reasons to remand him in custody; otherwise he would be entitled to bail. But the Bail Act does not apply to people held under immigration law. To such complaints there is a standard reply: 'If you don't like it you are free to go'; that is, to be deported to your country of origin. But that begs the question which is being examined, namely whether the applicant can safely return home. 'Alas,' wrote Mr Egny in his letter to me, 'today, if I could return home I would, with fanfares and hymns of joy.' But to do so 'would be bold to the point of madness'. The same catch 22, or a similar one, has overturned Lord Mansfield's judgment even more directly. There are people in Britain today who are to all intents and purposes slaves. They are domestic servants whose passports are in their employer's possession. In some cases they do not even have passports of their own, but enter the country on their employer's passport, as if they were his or her child. They work up to 18 hours a day for very low wages, and sometimes are not allowed out of the house or flat for weeks on end. In most cases they dare not complain, for they know that if their employer dismisses them they have no right to be in the country, and therefore no chance of finding any other legal employment. Mr Dudley Fishburn, a Tory MP, went to the Home Office last week to try to win some protection for these people. But any protection they are offered will be meaningless unless it includes the right to stay in the country and seek work. Their situation is only an extreme form of the jeopardy in which millions of illegal immigrants live throughout the industrialised world. Such immigrants frequently work in health and safety conditions far below the legal standard, but dare not complain for fear of being deported. Thus tough immigration laws create a kind of apartheid between the legal residents of a country, who enjoy various human, civil and social rights, and the illegal residents who do not. Such laws also interfere with economic freedom. According to Allan Findlay, director of the Applied Population Research Unit at Glasgow University, 'the UK government's negative attitude to immigration has sold the country short. It has failed to reap the economic benefits from selective skilled migration, foregone the investment and jobs which entrepreneurs could provide, and prevented companies from benefiting fully from inter-company transfers.' That is one of the conclusions of a recent study by the Institute for Public Policy Research*, which exposes the protectionist reflexes behind current British immigration policy. In trade policy the UK government is rightly sceptical of the notions that economic activity is a zero-sum game, that there is a finite pool of jobs to be shared out, and that rewards for foreigners necessarily mean losses for UK citizens. Yet those are precisely the assumptions that dominate immigration policy, and which are so unquestioned that Home Office officials approached by the IPPR could not even see 'what purpose new research would serve'. Ministers 'had already decided what immigration policy should be,' and 'they doubted that ministers would reconsider their approach'. Perhaps new ministers are needed, as well as new research. *Strangers &amp; Citizens. A positive approach to migrants and refugees. Edited by Sarah Spencer. (Rivers Oram Press, Pounds 14.95)</p>

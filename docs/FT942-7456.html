			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec ahead 23% after hard winter Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest electric power utilities earned CDollars 643m (USDollars 465.9m) in the first quarter, up 23.7 per cent from a year earlier, because a harsh winter boosted domestic and export demand. Electricity sales rose 8.4 per cent by volume and revenues 8.2 per cent to CDollars 2.3bn. Sales in Quebec rose 3.8 per cent by volume and revenues by 6.4 per cent. Revenues from power exports, mainly to the US but also other provinces, were up 4.4 per cent to CDollars 144m. Spending rose 3.3 per cent mainly because new generating and transmission equipment came on stream, increasing depreciation and amortisation. Hydro-Quebec, 100 per cent owned by the Quebec government, invested CDollars 629m in the quarter, down from CDollars 755m a year earlier. Total investment in 1994 will be CDollars 3.86bn, against CDollars 4bn last time, mostly for James Bay hydro expansion and for the distribution system.</p>

The dietary  structure of the population determined by studying the family  budgets carried out by the Gomel oblast statistical  administration in 1985-1987 was used in analyses. The mean [.sup]137[/]   Cs concentration in the food sold to the  population by retail and public food service outlets in Gomel  oblast, in Ci/kg, the structure of the diet used in computing  the [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr dietary intake, the  average daily [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake with  basic foodstuffs in individual rayons of Gomel oblast in  1986-1989, the likely mean levels of daily dietary [.sup]137[/]  Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake (ignoring  rejects), the actual mean levels of daily dietary [.sup]137[/]  Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake (allowing for  rejects), and the [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr daily  dietary intake of the population living in an area with a unit  contamination density are summarized. The findings show that the  food contamination levels decrease gradually with time (after  the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident). In particular, the [.sup]137  [/]  Cs intake decreased by threefold from 1986 to  1989. A rayon-by-rayon analysis reveals that Narovlyansk rayon  which used to be the most contaminated with cesium is now in  second place (a 206 to 60 10[.sup]-10[/] Ci/day drop) while  in Vetkovsk rayon, the [.sup]137[/]Cs level dropped from 185  to 62.

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tecs hail work training scheme - Apprenticeships A new apprenticeship scheme to put work-based training on a par with academic qualifications will gradually replace the Pounds 700m a year Youth Training as the main scheme for 16-19 year olds. The announcement yesterday gave only a very broad framework for the scheme, the bones of which will be created in discussions over the next few weeks between the Employment Department, employers' bodies and Training and Enterprise Councils which will administer it. Tecs yesterday said they were 'delighted' by the initiative. The Confederation of British Industry said it was pleased but it would have to examine the detailed funding arrangements before being able to fully endorse the scheme. the The new apprenticeship, which echoes Mr Major's policy of going back to basics, will cost about Pounds 1.25bn over the next three years, taking up much of the YT budget. It will be on offer to up to 150,000 young people at any time. The new apprenticeship will seek to train young people to National Vocational Qualification level 3, a higher level than the NVQ level 2 that is presently gained by most young people on YT. Total planned expenditure at the Department of Employment's programmes next year will be Pounds 3.770 million, including a transfer to the department of Pounds 117 million for the Careers Service, compared to Pounds 3.625 million this year. Tecs, which administer YT and Training For Work, said they believed their budgets would be cut by about Pounds 100m and that TFW would be the main victim. However, Tecs said new flexibilities, including arrangements that will offer them a three year licence guaranteeing their core administrative funding, went some way to mitigate the Budget effects. Mr Hunt said 18-25 year olds will have priority access to Community Action, that pays Pounds 10 extra to unemployed people taking up voluntary and charitable programmes.</p>

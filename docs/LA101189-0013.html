			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHING EVOLUTION  </P> <P> Regarding the issue of evolution being the only "scientific" view presented in  California science textbooks ("Textbook Panel Bolsters Stand on Teaching  Evolution," Part I, Sept. 29), most of the heat in the argument is generated by  the secularists refusal to acknowledge that science is neither conducted nor  taught in a philosophical/ideological vacuum.  </P> <P> Honest creationists and evolutionists both recognize that their basic  philosophical/ideological views will color their conclusions. For instance, all  of man's experience to date has shown that design demands a designer. To the  creationist, this is perhaps the most profound evidence for the existence of  God and his supernatural work in the origin of all things. Because the secular  evolutionist presupposes that natural things can have only natural causes, he  concludes that design in the universe must have come about by chance.  </P> <P> Those conclusions are at the heart of this whole controversy. There are  thousands of "facts" or observations that appear to support both positions.  </P> <P> All that the honest, Bible-believing Christian has ever wanted is fairness in  the teaching of evolution. Since evolution is the only position secular  humanism can take regarding origins, it is obvious that evolution will be  taught. I believe that it is only just that all the facts be presented,  including those that create serious doubt about many of the arguments for  evolution. To deny that right to teachers only proves that the state is taking  an unscientific and dogmatic position.  </P> <P> DEAN A.

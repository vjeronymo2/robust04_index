			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Rudolf Scharping, the SPD [Social  Democratic Party] leader and candidate for the chancellorship,  has described the dispute, now resolved, over the farewell  ceremony for the Russian troops as "incomprehensible and  harmful." Following a talk with Yeltsin in Bonn today,  Scharping said the German Government bears sole responsibility  for the unncessary irritations which have arisen. The SPD has  from the beginning insisted on a "worthy" farewell for the  troops in Berlin. The talk at the Petersberg near Bonn was also  attended by North-Rhine Westphalia Premier Johannes Rau (SPD),  and SPD Bundestag group leader Hans- Ulrich Klose.    Scharping accepted an invitation from Yeltsin to visit  Russia. An appropriate date for the visit still has to be  discussed.    Scharping said that in his talk with Yeltsin he referred to  the special importance of the "good" German-Russian relations.  It is important for other Western states to become as strongly  involved in Russia as the Federal Republic to lend support to  Yeltsin's policy of political and economic reform. The SPD  leader described economic relations between the two countries as  "capable of being developed." He cited as examples the  scientific, research, and technology spheres. Yeltsin stressed  that his country wants to be a partner with equal rights in  international organizations.    Yeltsin will also meet this morning with Theo Waigel, CSU  [Christian Social Union] chairman and federal finance minister.  Afterward, Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl will set  off on a tour of the Palatinate district. The two politciains  are to visit Speyer Cathedral this afternoon. Yeltsin has also  been invited to Kohl's home in Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim.    Yeltsin will go to Baden-Wuerttemberg tomorrow, the third  and  final day of his visit to Germany.</p>

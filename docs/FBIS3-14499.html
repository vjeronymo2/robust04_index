			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command, PFLP-GC, has issued a communique  subsequent to the military communique it issued on the martyrs  of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque operation that was carried out by  the PFLP-GC's commandos on 21 March 1994. Based on information  from commandos who returned from the operation, the communique  confirms that the operation against the enemy forces targeted 15  Zionist paratroopers and infantrymen from the Engineering Corps.    The communique says: When the enemy patrol arrived at the  controlled area, our comrades detonated two explosive devices  that resulted in the wounding of all of the patrol's personnel.  Afterwards, our comrades ambushed the enemy patrol and showered  them with bullets, grenades, and rockets. They took full  control of the situation in which the enemy soldiers could not  fire a single bullet. Afterwards, fatal bullets were fired at  the enemy soldiers who ran away, trampling over their comrades'  heads.    More than 30 minutes later, the Zionist enemy sent out  military rescue teams to the scene of the battle in order to  remove the bodies of their soldiers. The enemy also sent out  its tanks and infantry rescue teams to surround and chase our  comrades. However, a number of antitank and antipersonnel mines  blew up in the faces of the enemy forces, which further  increased the enemy's losses.    The enemy admitted that two noncommissioned officers [NCO's]  were killed and that three of its soldiers were wounded. As it  always does, the enemy tries to hide the number of its losses  for well-known political and moral reasons. Then it attributes  the killing of their soldiers to road accidents and other  reasons.    The communique continues to say: Hours after the  al-'Ayshiyah operation, the enemy radio announced that a truck  turned over, killing two soldiers and injuring three others. It  later announced that three of its soldiers were injured when a  missile exploded by mistake in the same area as the operation.  Hours before that, it was announced that an NCO died of his  wounds.    We, in the PFLP-GC, stress that the enemy's losses exceed 15  soldiers and tanks--which like to kill women and children, to  perpetrate massacres against our defenseless civilians inside  Palestine, and to barbarically shell southern Lebanon and the  camps inside it.    Through the operations carried out in the past few days, it  has been proven that the occupation army is unable to face the  mujahidin on the battlefield and that it quickly collapses amid  the crying and screaming of its soldiers.    On this brave operation carried out by our heroic comrades  in  broad daylight, and in view of the sacrifices of our people  inside occupied territories and the strikes by the national and  Islamic resistances, we, in the PFLP-GC, reaffirm that the  option of confrontation and jihad for the sake of liberation and  of ousting the Zionist invaders is our one only option. We also  reaffirm that the treasonous and capitulatory agreements in Oslo  and Cairo will vanish. Moreover, this will also be the fate of  the one who signed these agreements as this is the fate of all  the treasonous ones in the history of the struggling nations.  The massacres being perpetrated against our people inside the  occupied territories will only add to our strength, solidity,  and determination to continue the jihad until the liberation of  land and man.</p>

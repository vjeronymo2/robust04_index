			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Nationalism prompts split in Slovak party SLOVAKIA'S ruling right-wing party, the Christian Democratic Movement, splintered at the weekend after two powerful leaders left to create their own nationalist-based party. The division will further weaken the position of right-wing parties in the Slovak republic in advance of June's general elections in Czechoslovakia. It also highlights the growing nationalism pervading all political parties in the Slovak republic. Both the Christian Democratics, led by the Slovak prime minister Mr Jan Carnogursky, and their coalition partner in the Slovak government, ODU-VPN, support the economic reforms drawn up in Prague and the disputed federal system in Czechoslovakia. But their popularity has been ebbing as Slovaks, faced with greater economic hardship than their Czech neighbours, prefer to back nationalist parties increasingly critical of Prague. The Christian Democrats agreed to allow Mr Jan Klepac and Mr Wilhem Oberhauser to set up a rival party based on a more left-wing and nationalist platform.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Management: Tying the knot in red tape - Top managers have been queueing up for jobs in Britain's Civil Service Who would want a top management job in the Civil Service? Long hours, poor rewards, excessive red tape and always in the public eye. You get the blame when things go wrong but ministers steal your thunder when it's a success. The answer is - perhaps surprisingly - that top managers are queueing up to run the new executive agencies which are responsible for key government services such as the payment of social security benefits and high-tech defence research. Most of the 81 chief executive posts have been opened to outside competition, and almost a third of the new agencies are headed by people from outside the Civil Service. It certainly is not the salary that attracts them. The highest-paid agency chief executive is John Chisholm, head of the Defence Research Agency, who earns Pounds 140,000 a year. While this is rather more than the Pounds 108,940 earned by Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Civil Service, it is in the lower division by the standards of the electronics industry whence he came. The rewards come in other forms: for Chisholm, it was the prospect of 'leaving my footsteps in the sand' which lured him away from the private sector. There he had built CAP Scientific from a standing start to a company employing 1,200 staff which had then merged with the French company Sema Metra to form a 7,500-strong European computing services group. Addicted to change management, Chisholm was intrigued by the size of the Defence Research Agency job, which involved merging four armed forces research wings into a single 12,000-strong organisation capable of providing scientific and technical services to the defence ministry. He also cites the importance of the job: 'The defence of the nation depends to an important extent on the services of the DRA, which makes it a very different task from making confectionery.' Recruits from the private sector such as Chisholm remain rare in the Civil Service. More commonly, the new agency chiefs come from other parts of the public sector. Michael Bichard, for example, spent 21 years in local government before becoming head of the Benefits Agency, responsible for paying out social security benefits worth more than Pounds 52bn each year. After six years as chief executive of the London borough of Brent and four years running Gloucestershire county council, Bichard felt that his experience of managing local council services gave him the skills to help the Benefits Agency offer a better service to its 20m customers, many of whom depended on it for survival. He also had invaluable experience in dealing with politicians, not least from his spell at Brent, a council closely associated with the epithet 'loony'. 'If you can survive in the politics of Brent, you can survive anywhere,' says Bichard. Working in a political environment requires skill, plus understanding of the needs of politicians who face different pressures to those on managers. 'Many people think that the politics is a bit tacky. But the real fun of working in the public sector is understanding the political process and what makes politicians tick.' Another source of new managerial talent has been the National Health Service, which began its management revolution in the early 1980s. Ros Hepplewhite, one of the first NHS general managers, is chief executive of the Child Support Agency which from next year will ensure that single-parent families are supported by their absent partners. She also brings experience of the voluntary sector, having been director of Mind, the National Association for Mental Health, before joining the new agency. Like Chisholm, Hepplewhite was attracted by the prospect of building something new. Her agency next year takes over work on maintenance previously done by the social security department, the courts and family solicitors, with quasi-judicial functions in addition to its more straightforward money transfer functions. She must recruit 5,000 staff, set up three different computer systems, open 450 offices and establish new procedures. She places customer satisfaction at the top of her priorities. 'Our aim is to achieve a result - an amount of money passing between two adults for as long as 16 years. If we can establish a good relationship with our customers, it will help us win their co-operation in what is a delicate matter, without having always to resort to our powers. 'Only a third of lone parents receive support from the missing parent at present. If we offer courteous, prompt and accurate customer service, that proportion can be increased very rapidly.' Bichard is also fluent in the language of customer satisfaction. He has launched a programme to make the agency's 470 benefit offices more customer-friendly and accessible. Front-desk staff now wear name badges and the corporate uniform; they are also trained to give claimants information on the whole range of benefits and even to advise them on which benefit to go for. Central to his strategy is empowering managers to create a 'bias for action'  -a high-risk strategy in a sensitive area such as benefits payments: if customers in one part of the country are treated differently from those in another, the politicians will soon be breathing down the agency's neck. Bichard sees it as an important element of his job to convince ministers that the risk that something will go wrong - which is smaller than many fear  -must be weighed against the greatly improved service which newly empowered managers can offer to customers. The Defence Research Agency may not have customers in the street in the same way as the Benefits Agency. But Chisholm is well aware that it must become much more responsive to the civil servants in the Ministry of Defence who buy its advice and consultancy and will soon be free to shop around. That means moving the DRA away from the traditional Civil Service model of rationing out services in line with priorities decided in Whitehall. 'When I came to the DRA, we were seen as being the organisation which said no,' he says. 'The challenge is to turn the whole organisation upside down, so that it is the customer who decides what is needed, and managers are empowered to meet those needs.' Chisholm has no regrets about his move into the Civil Service (though on his last day in the private sector, he felt he was making the worst mistake of his life as he signed 17 letters of resignation from various boards he sat on). Interestingly, he feels less constrained by outside pressures working in the Civil Service than when he was at the head of a public company. 'In a plc, you are at the whim of two masters: the customers and the capital markets. 'You are constrained by the expectations of the shareholders, with life focused very much on the next half year's results, cash constraints as well as what you can achieve in the market place. In an agency, the main priority is to satisfy the customer.' The biggest 'shock to the system' for Bichard was the number of generalists in the Civil Service: the world of local government is dominated by professionals such as lawyers, architects, educationalists and so on. One of his early moves at the Benefits Agency was to bring in an accountant as finance director, an estates manager and a training manager. For Hepplewhite, it was the immense speed at which things must be done in Whitehall that she noticed as the biggest change. 'Although I probably worked longer hours in the voluntary sector, the pace was much less intensive. But I am enjoying every moment at the Child Support Agency - it is a wonderful opportunity to get it right,' she says. And so long as the Civil Service can offer such benefits to its top managers, it should have no difficulty in attracting excellent people from outside its ranks.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOWN &amp; DIRTY  </P> <P> Thousands of military personnel and civilians competed Friday in the ninth  annual Tustin Marine Corps Air Station Volkslauf, better known as the  10-kilometer mud run. The course includes several stretches of flat running  areas, "belly busters," a low-crawl pit, a "Rambo Death Ditch," the "Sandbags  of Iwo Jima" and strategically placed fire trucks that spray the runners, who  are clad in trousers, T-shirts and boots. The winning all-male military team  from the Naval Special Warfare Center, Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, covered  the course in 45 minutes and 10 seconds, the best time of the day, but not a  record. Other winning teams were: all-female military team -- Navy Nurses,  Naval Hospital, San Diego; all-male civilian team -- Team Kilroy, Hash House  Harriers, Seal Beach; all-female civilians -- Hash House Harriettes, Hash House  Harriers, Seal Beach; mixed military -- Weekend Warrior Supporters, Marine  Aircraft Group 46, Detachment E, El Toro; mixed civilian -- Clean Fun, Quintana  Roo, Westminster; college -- Bonzai Team, University of San Diego Naval Reserve  Officers Training Corps; high school -- Mud Dogs, Chosan Young Marines, El  Monte. Proceeds benefit Orangewood, Orange County's shelter for abused and  abandoned children.  </P></p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Divided France NEVER CAN a vote in France have been followed with such attention by the rest of Europe as last Sunday's referendum. But to those who looked to France to determine their future the French electorate returned a Delphic answer, lending itself to opposite interpretations. Is the glass half full or half empty? Is the Maastricht treaty alive or dead? Time will answer that question. Meanwhile the French, by the way they divided on this difficult question, have given a remarkable portrait of themselves to their fellow Europeans, and to their own political class - those trying to govern them now and those aspiring to do so in the future. It is a portrait such that the task of providing them with leadership for the years ahead might well daunt even the most ambitious. That France should be evenly divided is nothing new in itself. As it celebrates its 200th birthday this week, the French republic can look back on a history of division into right and left, which have often been very finely balanced. But the division revealed by Sunday's vote was quite different. Among political leaders, only Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front took more than 90 per cent of his followers with him into the No lobby. Eighty one per cent of communist supporters voted No; 78 per cent of Socialist ones voted Yes. Sixty one per cent of Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing's UDF supporters (moderate conservatives) joined him in voting Yes, while Mr Jacques Chirac could only get 41 per cent of Gaullists to do so. Those who voted Yes were older (especially the women among them), more prosperous, above all better educated than those who voted No. Typically they were white-collar workers, managers or members of the professional middle class. People on low wages, farmers, artisans, shopkeepers and the unemployed overwhelmingly opposed the treaty. Such findings make the political conclusions from the vote very difficult to draw. What they reveal - and it is a fair guess that other European countries are not very different in this respect - is that the great social and economic movements of our time are affecting different social categories very unequally. Roughly half the population is doing well enough to feel optimistic, and to see the rapid opening of France's economy and society to outside influences and competition as an opportunity. The other half feels it is being trampled on and left by the wayside, and seizes a chance to shout 'stop'. Everyone is saying that Europe has to hear the message from those who voted No, and to take account of their views. Yet it is far from certain that making European institutions simpler and more transparent, or slowing down the process of European integration, or transferring powers back from Brussels to national governments will actually make many of these people feel better. Perhaps they will be cheered up, momentarily, by the landslide defeat that President Mitterrand's Socialist party is all but certain to suffer in parliamentary elections next March. But unless the material benefits of increased trade within Europe begin to be felt by these categories of the population, no merely political change is going to reconcile them to their rulers. Unfortunately, given the current performance of the German economy, and the monetary policies that imposes on governments striving to achieve economic convergence, there is little prospect of that happening at all soon.</p>

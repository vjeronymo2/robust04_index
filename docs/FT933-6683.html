			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tackle new standard before it hurts Sir, Peter Carty highlights the bureaucracy likely to be created by BS7750 ('Struggling with new standards', August 24). The bureaucracy will be particularly severe for small and medium-sized companies. Rather than increasing their international competitiveness it could decrease it, as a direct result of increased administration costs. Perhaps this would be acceptable if it led to improved environmental performance. But this is not the case: the best we can expect is improved monitoring of environmental performance. The UK government is consulting about both BS7750 and its European Community variation, the environmental management and audit scheme. However, the assumption is that the bureaucratic route to improving environmental performance has an important role to play. This seems an unnecessary dilution of the government's attempt to relate the environment directly to the marketplace. This can and should be done rather than allowing the the accreditation and certification industry (which includes the British Standards Institution) to add a further level of non-productive costs to our hard-pressed businesses. Let's deregulate this one before it does any harm. A S Hearne, managing director, RPS Group, Centurion Court, 85 Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire OX14 4RY</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source has categorically denied that the  aircraft belonging to the forces of unity and legitimacy bombed  the Aden refinery or targeted any of its installations today,  Sunday. The source said this refinery and other economic  installations are the property of the Yemeni people and will  never be a target of the forces of unity and legitimacy.  Instead, they will be protected and defended by these forces.    The source said the hysteria of the elements of the  rebellious secessionist gang has reached such an extent that  this criminal gang does not hesitate to commit the most heinous  crimes against the people, the homeland, and their achievements.    The source said these criminal elements are currently  destroying vital economic installations in the areas they  control, including the shelling of the Aden refinery with a  missile today in order to destroy it, arouse public opinion, and  evoke an increased sense of grudge and hatred among the sons of  the one Yemeni homeland.    The source said this secessionist gang did not hesitate to  strike cities and innocent people with missiles in the  densely-populated residential areas in Sanaa, Zinjibar, 'Ataq,  and al-Hudaydah. Being in the last throes of death, this gang  carried out the same criminal conduct by destroying and damaging  economic installations and targets in many of the areas it used  to control, as an expression of the sense of grudge and despair  overwhelming it.    The source warned this criminal gang against committing more  criminal actions against the people and the homeland. He said  this gang will never escape punishment. He denounced the  continued acts of aggression this gang is carrying out against  the citizens and our valiant Armed Forces, thus violating UN  Security Council Resolution 924 and defying both the national  consensus and the international will.</p>

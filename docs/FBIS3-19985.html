Based on selected interviews with 848 persons, representing  48 million Italians over 18 years of age, CIRM found that 48  percent felt that the economic situation will improve over the  next six months, while only a week ago a similar poll showed  only 39 percent so optimistic. This was slightly offset by 21  percent who thought the economic situation would get worse.    While optimistic over the economy in general, Italians  remained less optimistic over their own family budgets with 52  percent of those interviewed, against 60 percent a week ago,  expecting no change for their personal budgets, although the  percentage of optimists rose from 27 percent last week to 34  percent in the more recent poll. The number of those expecting  things to get worse remained at 14 percent.    On more political matters, the CIRM poll showed how a  growing  number of people see the formation of a coalition government,  one of the two poles plus outside forces, with 61 percent  holding this view compared to 54 percent a week ago.    According to 28 percent of those interviewed, however, it  will take between one to three months to forge a new executive,  while 23 percent thought it may take more than three months,  compared to 29 percent last week.    The die-hard optimists, who saw a new government in less  than  a month, accounted for 12 percent of those interviewed, while 19  percent saw no hope for a government and thus new elections.    The general uncertainty over the political-economic  situation  was also reflected in how Italians treat their money with many  preferring temporary "parking" investment until a new political  scenario and guarantee greater security and opportunity.    According to the CIRM poll, in fact, 42 percent of those  interviewed said they held checking accounts, 22 percent held  state bonds, 19 percent were home owners, 15 percent invested in  mutual funds and 13 percent in the stock market.    The CIRM poll also found how 46 percent of those  interviewed,  against 52 percent a week ago, did not expect to be spending  more, while those seeing their spending on the upswing rose from  28 percent to 33 percent.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: Amnesty report on women in Tunisia baseless Sir, With reference to your summary of the Amnesty International report on women in Tunisia ('Amnesty says women tortured in Tunisia', June 3), I wish to state the following. The report is totally irresponsible and completely without foundation. It is based almost entirely on the content of propaganda leaflets from illegal extremist groups whose declared objective is to undermine the Tunisian government. Therefore, we reject and deny its allegations, most of which have been refuted in previous government re-sponses while others pertain to women who have been subjected only to measures authorised by law. They have never been maltreated, tortured or been the victims of any other form of abuse. Other testimonies contained in the report were given by women whose identities were not revealed, but who belong to two extremist movements, both of them banned. Amnesty has repeated and endorsed the allegations but, under the pretence that it is fearful of reprisals, has not checked any of them through the usual procedures. This pretence is intended to harm Tunisia's reputation and undermine its judiciary. Also, no prior notice about the report was given to the Tunisian government as is usually done by Amnesty. It is ironic that Tunisia, of all countries, should be singled out for criticism in connection with women's rights when the country is widely acknowledged to have achieved more progress in that area than any other country in the developing world and is often called upon to chair human rights committees in regional and international forums. Tunisia has in the last few years signed and ratified the UN convention against torture without reservations and has set up a higher committee for human rights and fundamental liberties, and a commission of inquiry into earlier allegations received from Amnesty. The president of the republic has also nominated a counsellor for human rights while units were set up in various ministries to deal with human rights. Furthermore, an ombudsman has been appointed with a full team to support him in his job. All these measures testify to the strong commitment of Tunisia towards human rights.

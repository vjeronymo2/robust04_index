			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Boardroom battle at Fife Indmar A minority group of shareholders at Fife Indmar, the engineering and distribution company, is leading a boardroom rebellion aimed at unseating Mr Gavin Hepburn, the long-time chairman. The shareholders, who claim some 10.5 per cent of the shares, have requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to replace Mr Hepburn and fellow director Mr Michael Munro with Mr Guido Crolla, a Scottish businessman, and Mr David Chassels of BDO Binder Hamlyn. The rebels are claiming that the current management had failed to 'make best use of the acquisitions in the last few years', according to Mr Crolla, who made Pounds 1.7m earlier this year when he sold his Citylink bus business to National Express. In the last decade, Fife has diversified from marine engineering into distribution and catering. The rebels include director Mr Charles McDonald, who holds about 8 per cent of Fife. He joined the board in 1988 following Fife's acquisition of Jack Scot, his North Sea hire firm. If successful, the rebels intend to appoint Mr McDonald as chairman. Mr Crolla, who would become managing director, said he had approached Fife with proposals in June, but had been rejected. A detailed statement would soon be sent to shareholders setting out his proposals, which are likely to include asset disposals.</p>

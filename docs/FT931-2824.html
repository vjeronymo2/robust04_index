			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Beijing's sound and fury may well signify something IT IS perhaps the beleaguered Mr Chris Patten's misfortune that the unseemly row that has erupted over his plans for democratic reforms in Hong Kong came on the eve of an important session of the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament. In this hothouse atmosphere, Chinese leaders appear to have sought to outbid each other in their criticism of the colony's governor, and in the process a good deal of sound and fury has been heard, signifying less perhaps than assails the senses; although there is no question that the diplomatic row is beginning to assume worrying proportions. Among slightly ominous developments was the revival yesterday by China's senior official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Mr Lu Ping, of proposals for a 'new kitchen' to deal with Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule in 1997. This was interpreted by some as indicating that Beijing was considering a shadow authority to co-ordinate steps towards China's takeover of the colony, although another and perhaps more plausible explanation was that he was merely talking about a 'fresh start' after Britain's withdrawal. 'When we say we will start a new kitchen we only mean that we will construct a new kitchen in accordance with the design of the Basic Law,' the urbane Mr Lu told several hundred reporters. The Basic Law, approved by China's parliament in April 1990, is in effect a blueprint for the constitution of the Hong Kong 'Special Administrative Region' after 1997. It deals specifically with such issues as the shape of government and legislature, and complements a Joint Declaration signed by London and Beijing in 1984 that covers the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong. China's claim that Mr Patten's plans for relatively broad-based democratic elections in 1994 and 1995 contradict understandings reached with London is hotly contested by British officials. But there is no doubt that Beijing fears that these elections will yield a rump of bothersome representatives who would be sitting in Hong Kong's Legislative Council after 1997. This is not the well-equipped 'kitchen' Beijing had in mind when it drafted the Basic Law, hence Mr Lu's threat to construct a new one. Chinese officials have been insisting that their argument with Mr Patten is not over an extension of democracy, but one of principle. Cynics might observe: the Chinese would say that, wouldn't they? But it is also true that once Beijing takes a stand on principle, even if, in the view of some, these principles may have peculiarly Chinese characteristics, resolution of the dispute becomes much trickier. The fact that this week two of China's most senior leaders have joined very publicly and vehemently in the argument will also not make things easier to unravel. In Beijing, British officials seem at a loss to predict where the issue may go from here. No early diplomatic contacts are scheduled, and with each passing day circumstances appear to become more complex. There is little sign of China easing up in its criticism of Mr Patten, and Chinese anger is likely to intensify if and when he introduces his democracy-extending legislation to the Legislative Council for debate. British officials are drawing some comfort from the fact that Mr Lu repeated China's wish to co-operate over the transition to Chinese rule and his insistence that Beijing would continue to honour agreements over Hong Kong. They expressed the hope that Beijing and London could sit down and resolve their differences, but the chances of this happening while Mr Patten's reform bill remains on the table are slim. The sound and fury seem unlikely to abate for the time being.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Japan's jobless rate in  February rose 0.2 percentage point from the previous month to a  seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent, the highest level in six years  and eight months, the Management and Coordination Agency  reported Tuesday [29 March].    In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of  job offers to job seekers, an indicator of labor demand, fell  from January's 0.67 to 0.65 in February, showing there were 65  jobs for every 100 people seeking employment. The February  jobless rate represents a rise of 0.6 point from a year earlier  and the highest since June 1987 when it stood at 3.0 percent,  the agency said.    The unemployment rate among women hit a record high at 3.2  percent, topping the previous high of 3.1 percent marked in may  1987. The latest figure compares with a 2.7 percent jobless  rate among men.    Officials of the agency and the ministry said the nation's  employment data is likely to worsen further in the months ahead  although some bright signs can be observed in the economy as a  whole.    The number of jobholders in February rose 0.3 percent or  160,000 from a year earlier to 63.02 million, down from a climb  of 0.5 percent or 300,000 in the previous month. The number of  unemployed workers jumped 23.6 percent or 370,000 to 1.94  million.    In the manufacturing sector, jobholders declined 3.2 percent  or 480,000, continuing the streak of declines since November  1992. Manufacturers are shifting their production overseas to  stay competitive amid the appreciation of the yen on the foreign  exchange.    Jobholders in the construction industry grew 2.5 percent or  160,000.    Improvement was seen in the wholesale, retail and food  sectors, with jobholders there growing 0.8 percent or 120,000.  The climb in employees in the service sector, however, was  trimmed, at 1.6 percent or 240,000.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (53 FR 45190, 45193, November 8, 1988). Thus, a case-by-case approach is necessary in determining the applicability of the Utah program to public roads. Utah's proposed amendment, as discussed under part IV.A.3. of this notice, provides guidance that is no less effective than that specified in the Federal definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' at 30 CFR 700.5 regarding which public roads are subject to Utah's jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter suggested that the Utah term ``public road'' additionally include roads to which the public has access. As indicated in finding No. III.C.3., Utah adds language that limits the use of this term to parts R645&hyph;103&hyph;200, R645&hyph;301&hyph;521.123, and R645&hyph;301&hyph;521.133 of Utah's rules, which pertain only to designating lands unsuitable for coal mining and reclamation operations. While OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion, it cannot require Utah to amend its definition further because the proposed definition has been determined to be no less effective than the corresponding Federal definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Definition of ``Road'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters stated that Utah's proposed definition of the term ``road'' is so broad that it includes almost any road that carries coal in intrastate and interstate commerce, and should be amended to clarify that the term ``road'' does not include ``public roads'' or roads excluded under the term ``affected area.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with these comments. Utah's proposed definition of the term ``road'' is substantively identical to the Federal regulatory definition of that term at 30 CFR 701.5. Both of those definitions of ``road'' are clear on their respective terms as to which roads are to be regulated as surface coal mining operations. The determination as to whether a particular road will be regulated as part of a surface coal mining operation must be made on a case-by-case basis by the regulatory authority, and must be based upon the mining-related use of the road (53 FR 45190, 45192, November 8, 1988; 56 FR 58846, 58848&hyph;9, November 22, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Application of Mining-Related Use of Roads as Criteria To Determine Whether a Road Is Subject to SMCRA Permitting Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter stated that OSM's application of the extent and effect of the mining-related use of roads as criteria in determining whether a road is subject to SMCRA permitting requirements is contrary to OSM's announced deference to State decision making, whereby States with primacy should be allowed to determine, on a case-by-case basis, which roads must be included within the permit area. Specifically the commenter asserted that nothing in SMCRA or the Federal regulations grants OSM the authority to make case-by-case determinations in primacy States of which roads must be included within a permit area. The commenter next stated that OSM has no standards in place that define the point at which mining-related use requires the inclusion of a road within a permit area. The commenter further stated that there are no Federal standards defining what constitutes a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  use of a road. Instead, OSM has allowed States to determine the point at which jurisdiction begins and ends through individual State permitting decisions. Thus, the commenter concluded that the Federal regulatory definition of ``affected area'' no longer provides relevant guidance in light of OSM's deference to State decision making. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the first comment that OSM relies on the extent and effect of the mining-related use of roads as criteria in determining whether a road is subject to SMCRA permitting requirements, OSM wishes to emphasize that the regulation of public roads as part of a surface coal mining operation is not solely dependent upon the use of a road. Factors such as the purpose and time of its construction, the extent to which the road is directly part of a surface coal minng operation, the degree to which the road is altered to accommodate mining operations, and the impact of mining operations on the road and its surrounding environment may be major considerations in determining whether a road is subject to regulation under SMCRA. In addition, under the Federal definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' at 30 CFR 700.5, a road may be subject to regulation under SMCRA notwithstanding the lack of demonstrable impacts associated with its mining-related construction, maintenance, and use. Therefore, even in the absence of such evidence, it may be appropriate to regulate a road in order to ensure, through the SMCRA permitting, inspection, and enforcement processes, that the purposes of SMCRA are achieved (56 FR 58846, 58852, November 22, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minister of Economy Maks Tajnikar organized talks  today on the problem regarding the seizure of electricity by the  Croatian Electrical Power Generation Industry. Taking part in  the talks were, among others, Energy Secretary Boris Sovic; Savo  Trepse, duty official of the Slovene Electricity Board; and  Ostoj Kristan, director general of the Slovene Electricity  Board. After the meeting, Joze Skok interviewed Mr. Kristan:    [Begin recording] [Skok] Mr. Kristan, let us first ask the  following question: Is neighboring Croatia, or more  specifically, its electrical power generation industry, taking  the electricity from our network into its system?    [Kristan] Well, the two systems are connected and they are  synchronically operating [words indistinct]. After we had been  told by the nuclear power plant that it is giving us the  (?entire) power from the beginning of its operation after the  repair, we have made the appropriate programs and sent them to  our partners because it was [words indistinct] that they do not  get energy from the (?nuclear power plant), certainly not this  quantity. As of that time, they have been taking electricity as  if one-half belongs to them, therefore they have not been  respecting the (?schedule).    [Skok] Therefore, we can say that they have been (?taking  the electricity) from the very beginning of the work of the  nuclear power plant?    [Kristan] They are taking the electricity without  unauthorization. We are registering this as deviation from the  program of operation and are warning them every hour in written  form, by a faxed message.    [Skok] What quantity, (?that is) for how long the Croatian  Electrical Power Generation Industry is [words indistinct]  unauthorized seize of electricity?    [Kristan] That (?deviation) amounts to (?80) megawatts,  which is approximately one-half of the production of the nuclear  power plant. This is no technical problem for us, but is  certainly a commercial, expense problem. A decision should be  made certainly [words indistinct] their reaction. We are going  to warn them tomorrow, [words indistinct] stand, to give us back  this electricity next week. And if [words indistinct] in  interstate relations, the programs will be changed. And if they  refuse to give electricity back next week, that is, if that  deviation exceeds a bearable level we should certainly take  measures with a view to protecting our reserves and our network  [end recording]</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / AirTouch and US West merge cellular businesses in the US AirTouch Communications, the California-based cellular telephone company, and US West, the Baby Bell regional telecommunications group, are to merge their domestic cellular telephone businesses in a joint venture. The venture will create the third largest provider of cellular phone services in the US. It will have cellular licences in 16 of the top 30 markets and serve more than 1.7m customers. The deal, which requires the approval of federal regulators, is the latest in a line of alliances within the fast-growing mobile communications business. Analysts see this as part of a restructuring of the US telecoms industry in the face of regulatory upheaval, technological change and the erosion of boundaries between local, long-distance and mobile services. AirTouch is the former cellular arm of Pacific Telesis, while US West is a Denver-based operator covering 14 mid-western states. While neither companies' international operations will be included in the joint venture, the two groups will work together to develop non-US business. In Europe, AirTouch has a stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the second cellular network in Germany, and in the consortium behind Italy's second network. US West's overseas interests include a half-share in Mercury One-2-One, the third-largest UK cellular operator. Under the terms of the deal, AirTouch will own 70 per cent of the joint venture and US West 30 per cent, with US West allowed to convert its stake into direct ownership of AirTouch stock subject to certain conditions. For regulatory reasons the two operations will initially be kept separate, with a single entity providing management and support services. The announcement of the joint venture came on the day the US government began auctioning licences for 'narrowband' personal communications services (PCS) such as paging and voice messaging. AirTouch and US West said yesterday they were also creating a joint venture to pursue PCS opportunities.</p>

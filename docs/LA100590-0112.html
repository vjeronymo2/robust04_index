			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> ROBINSON NAMES GARY AS STARTER  </P> <P> The inevitable is finally official. The heir has gotten the job. Cleveland  Gary, finally sound again after back problems, Thursday was named the starting  tailback for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> "He's back to where he was before he went down," Coach John Robinson said. "The  reason we haven't played him is because if you miss a month, it takes time to  get back to 100%."  </P> <P> Robinson said that although all three tailbacks -- early-season starter Curt  Warner and Gaston Green are the others -- will play Sunday, it's likely that  Gary will carry the load.  </P> <P> It appears that the Rams will put newly signed running back Marcus Dupree on  the injured-reserve list as early as today, giving Dupree four weeks to get  used to competitive football after a five-year layoff, and freeing a roster  spot for the activation of cornerback Jerry Gray, who will be leaving injured  reserve today.  </P> <P> "I think the month (off) would be just about right for (Dupree)," Robinson  said. "I think he needs more time."  </P> <P> Injury report: Ram receiver Aaron Cox, nursing a twitch in his right hamstring,  did not practice Thursday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game.  </P> <P> Bengal deep threat Eddie Brown probably will not suit up Sunday because of a  knee injury suffered in Monday night's game.

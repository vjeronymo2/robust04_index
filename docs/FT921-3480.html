			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Downturn at Dayton Hudson DAYTON HUDSON, the large US retail group and viewed as one of the nation's more competent stores, yesterday disappointed Wall Street with a fall in profits, to Dollars 301m after tax, in the year to February 1. This compared with Dollars 412m in 1990-91, and included a drop in fourth-quarter profits from Dollars 235m to Dollars 192m, again after tax. Dayton Hudson admitted that the figures, scored on annual sales of Dollars 16.1bn compared with Dollars 14.7bn, were disappointing, and its shares slid Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 at close of trade. Dayton Hudson takes in three main operating units: Target, its discount store chain, Mervyn's, which operates discount department stores mainly on the west coast, and the traditional department store chain, which takes in Marshall Field's, bought from BAT Industries of the UK. The company said that all three saw a decline in operating profits last year. Target, which competes head-on with the fast-growing Wal-Mart chain, saw profits fall from Dollars 466m to Dollars 458m, with gross margins down 'significantly'. The company has been pushing hard to match Wal-Mart and K mart, and said that its new 'value strategy' had hit margins. However, same-store sales were up by 4 per cent, and the group said that Target should see 'a strong performance' in the current year. Mervyn's was hurt by the sluggish Californian economy, with operating profits down from Dollars 366m to Dollars 284m, and same store revenues declining 1 per cent. The department store business, meanwhile, saw operating profits decline from Dollars 183m to Dollars 168m, with same store sales up 1 per cent. Overall, same-store sales improved by 2 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikos Marakis: "Athens' Realpolitik"] </F>   [Text] Despite some of the different positions sometimes  adopted by the prime minister and the competent ministers on the  "Macedonian" issue, Andreas Papandreou's basic approach can  essentially be summarized in two points. First, consigning the  issue of the name to the future, and second, settling existing  practical problems with Skopje on condition that the irredentist  demands in that state's constitutional preamble be taken out and  the Veryina star be expunged from its flag. If the conditions on  the irredentist terms are fulfilled, Mr. Papandreou is willing  to negotiate with K. Gligorov, even if in the past, when he was  in the opposition, he had adopted an essentially different  position.    The needs of the government's tactics in the Balkans are one  of the reasons for the readjustment of the country's  international alliances. Athens' "Atlantic shift" was obvious  from the very first days of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist  Movement] government's accession to power. While since then the  conviction that Greek interests are generally served by  Washington's policy has remained strong, public statements have  been toned down on account of the European reaction and the  recognition of the level of dependence of the Greek economy from  the EU [European Union]. However, first indications from the  other side of the Atlantic raise some questions on the  profit-loss relationship resulting from the reorientation of  Athens' policy.    The "Macedonian" issue is a first criterion. It is expected  that the State Department, within the context of the periodic  policy review at the beginning of March, will propose to the  U.S. Government the establishment of diplomatic relations with  Skopje. Additionally, there has been reaction on the part of the  United States to the European initiative to establish embassies  in the new state. A harbinger of future moves is the decision to  create a "liaison office" in Skopje, even if it lacks a  diplomatic identity. Be that as it may, Greek credibility  diminished after Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yiorgos  Papandreou brought certain messages to Washington during his  visit there, only to suffer a loss of prestige as soon as he  mentioned their content publicly. The questions formulated by  the U.S. side were many and have not all been answered.    U.S. support was also one of the most significant factors,  which was seriously taken into account by the government's  diplomatic officials in their efforts to build a "Balkan" role  for Greece. The U.S. diplomats who visited Athens recently  provoked some disappointment when they characteristically  repeated their traditional stance on the very important  geopolitical role of Turkey. For itself, Athens maintains its  expectations because of Ankara's impossibility to efficiently  manage the "fronts" it keeps open around its periphery. However,  even today the Greek side has a clear difficulty in describing  the "role" that Athens expects to undertake in the Balkans.    Of course, certain answers have already been provided: Greek  diplomacy now clearly moves within the framework of a general  attempt at appeasement and "lower tones." The development of  economic relations with neighboring countries acquires higher  priority and is seen as the cornerstone of any political  influence in the region. At the same time that the logic of the  establishment of an axis in the area is being rejected, a more  "systemic" approach to intra-Balkan relations is being drawn up,  within which is integrated the strategically important  relationship with Belgrade, while communications with Croatia  and Slovenia are becoming normalized.    While these measures constitute the necessary steps to leave  the multiconflict period Athens has recently created in the  Balkans behind, they are far from representing the description  of a "role." The necessary system of goals of Greek foreign  policy, the ways and means of implementing them, the acceptable  obligations, and the expected competences remain subjects for  which answers remains pending....</p>

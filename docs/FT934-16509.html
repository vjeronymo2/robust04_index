			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Recruitment: The source of effective innovation - Why the setting of clear-cut goals when seeking new business ideas can end in little net profit QUITE who first cut spiral grooves up the inside of a musket barrel in Germany 500 years ago, nobody knows. Nor, while the longer and more accurate shots resulting from the 'rifling' grooves led others to follow suit, did anybody then know why the new rifles outperformed smooth-bore guns. So in 1547 the Archbishop of Mainz did an experiment to find out. He got riflemen to fire at targets with two sets of bullets. One set was made of silver, almost as sacred as gold by religious tenets, and the rest of unholy lead. The lead bullets hit the bull far more often than the silver, which mostly fell short. Why? The conclusion now would be that the bullets made of silver, a hard metal, resisted the grooves of the rifling and so were held back; whereas the soft lead kind yielded to the grooves, taking on the spin which did the trick. But that wasn't what the Archbishop concluded from the experiment. His conclusion was that rifle bullets must be guided by devils. And that - in a society which believed the air was filled with invisible angels and demons fighting one another - served as a perfectly scientific explanation. What brings the said episode to the Jobs column's mind is an uncanny coincidence which may betoken that I'm being guided by something (although which side of the fight it's on is another question). The sequence began at Spain's Instituto de Empresa management school, when I was hearing about the way the school teaches would-be top executives how to be successful innovators. The method is first to analyse markets to find a niche for a new product, then devise a product to fit the niche. The description of same reminded me of some research into the matter which I'd reported, as I thought, about four years ago. So on returning I leafed back to January 1989, only to draw blank. That meant a long search, which miffed me because I wanted to get on with reading about a fairly new development in psychology I'd chanced upon, called reversal theory. Among its suggestions is that, when taking action, people can be in either of two distinct frames of mind. In one of them, which the theory terms the telic state, the action is undertaken solely as a means to some pre-set end. For example, when the goal of passing an examination causes you to delve into a textbook, you are reading in a telic way. The other kind of action, termed paratelic, consists of things you do simply because you want to do them. When you get the feeling that you'd like to read and settle down with a book, you're reading in a paratelic way, probably with no clearer goal than just to see what happens. Moreover, while we can change (or 'reverse') from one to the other, we tend to be either telic- or paratelic-biased in our actions. But, as I said, my own reading of the theory was interrupted by the hunt for the research report, which turned out to date from 1987. The study, by Dr Rolf Berth, was of 73 successful innovations in companies. It found that only nine of them had been achieved by the method, essentially telic, taught in the Spanish school. The rest resulted from someone just having an idea and developing it to see what happened. After reporting as much in the 1987 article, I went on to hazard a guess that folk with the clear-cut ambition needed to climb to the top of companies 'have minds which operate in fundamentally different ways from those of effective innovators'. Hence my feeling of awe on returning to the book on the theory, and reading of a trial in which some telic-biased people and others with a paratelic bias were individually set to work on a problem while wired to a device measuring the electrical activity in their brains. Not only was the activity greater in the paratelics' case, but the pattern differed. Their whole brain was directed towards a single focus, whereas the telics seemed to be applying different bits of their brain in separate directions. Gorblimey] That is unfortunately all I can tell you about the theory until I've learned more. Even so, it's surely enough to raise a question about the widespread belief that the best way to run a company is to fill all its influential positions with people of the decisive, goal-orientated telic mentality. Doesn't it smack of the sort of belief which led the Archbishop to his conclusion about rifle bullets?N OW to the table below, which gives the going rates of pay for British managers as shown by the Reward company's latest six-monthly survey. Anyone wanting to know more about it should contact Vivienne Copeland at Reward House, Diamond Way, Stone, Staffordshire ST15 0SD; tel (0)785 813566, fax (0)785 817007. My extracts relate solely to managers just below director. To update to October 1, all pay figures should be increased by 0.44 per cent. Regional variations from the median base salary of Pounds 31,058 were: higher - London by 16 per cent, Scotland by 6.8, South-east England by 3.0, and Northern Ireland by 0.2; lower - South-west England by 1.9 per cent, West Midlands by 3.2, North-east by 6.1, North-west by 7.2, and Eastern counties by 8.8. Variations by company turnover were: higher - Pounds 500m-plus by 41.9 per cent, Pounds 200m-500m by 12.8, Pounds 100m-200m by 10.5, Pounds 50m-100m by 4.3; lower - Pounds 20m-Pounds 50m by 2.6 per cent, Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m by 3.2, Pounds 3m-10m by 10.7, and under Pounds 3m by 15.9.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Lower quartile                                                      Total Rank One = Most senior                   Basic       money executive below                         salary      reward rank of director in:                    Pounds      Pounds  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company secretariat                     30,375      30,675 General management                      28,597      29,239 Marketing                               27,820      29,048 Finance &amp;

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / First fall for ten years in Japan's motor sales A 3.9 PER CENT fall in motor vehicle sales last year in Japan, the first decline in a decade, has highlighted the impact of slower domestic growth and the difficulty faced by foreign manufacturers attempting to expand their sales. The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association (Jada) said 5.74m vehicles were sold last year, 199,920 of them foreign (10.7 per cent down on a year earlier). Car sales fell 6.5 per cent to 4.03m, trucks rose 3 per cent to 1.69m and buses were down 4.5 per cent at 23,796. Apart from blaming slower economic growth, Jada said that tougher parking legislation had restricted sales in large cities. Parking fines have been increased sharply and potential purchasers must now provide more evidence that they have a parking space before they can take delivery of a car. The decline in sales has hurt the profits of leading Japanese makers, who, in turn, have put extra pressure on their suppliers to cut costs. Motor manufacturers are hoping that the recent decline in Japanese interest rates will stimulate sales. However, the December figures were not encouraging, with total vehicle sales of 423,825, down 8.5 per cent on the same month in 1990. It was the eighth consecutive month of decline. Car sales were down 10.9 per cent; those of imported vehicles were 16.6 per cent lower. Jada said, that Toyota sales fell 5.9 per cent to 2.35m vehicles, and those of Nissan, the second largest manufacturer, fell 4.2 per cent to 1.34m units. Strong demand for luxury models was shown in a 42 per cent increase in sales of cars of above 2,001cc. Construction orders received by domestic contractors last November fell 15.7 per cent from the same month in 1990, the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors said yesterday. Orders from the private sector fell 24.3 per cent, reflecting the the impact of an oversupply of apartments, while public orders rose 13.4 per cent.</p>

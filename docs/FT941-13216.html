			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (4): Solutions are starting to emerge - Data Transmission For the portable computer user who needs to exchange data with the office, plugging a modem into a telephone socket is fine when one is available. But on the move, wireless telecommunications provide the only real solution. Indeed, the success of new lightweight handheld computing devices such as personal digital assistants is likely to depend to a large degree on the effective integration of data processing and telecommunications functions. It has been possible for some time to transmit data over an analogue cellular telephone system such as the Cellnet or Vodaphone networks in the UK, though it is generally more difficult, slower and considerably more expensive than over the fixed public switched telephone network. These factors, together with concerns about line quality and dropped calls, have meant that relatively few business customers use cellular telephone systems to transmit data. For those cellular voice customers who do require data communications, one solution has been to use a special cellular modem. For example, in the UK Vodafone's mobile data service uses a special cellular data link control (CDLC) modem to enable customers to transmit and receive error-free data over its network. It is also possible to use a device called a cellular line interface (CLI) in conjunction with a standard modem and a some mobile telephones manufactured by NEC and Motorola. This was the solution chosen by Mercury Mobile Services for its client, Unisys, when the US computer group needed to 'bolt on' a data transmission service for its UK-based team of field engineers who already had car telephones linked to the Vodaphone network. Using their notebook computers and plug-in Multitech PCMCIA card modems, the engineers can now call up and download a manual page from the roadside at a data speed of 4,800 bps. Data transmission over the new generation of digital cellular telephone systems, such as the Global System for Mobiles services in Europe which have just started up, should be even simpler, faster and more reliable. The GSM specification includes a facility which will eventually allow any terminal - for example, a portable facsimile machine or a notebook computer  -to be plugged directly into the handset. Another option for those customers who want the benefits of both voice and data communications from a moving vehicle is to use a two-way public access mobile radio service such as the UK's National Band Three. Users buy their own communic- ations equipment and then pay a fixed monthly subscription - there are no call charges. Nevertheless, for those mobile computer users who require a high speed, high quality wireless data link, dedicated packet-switched data networks such as Ardis - a joint venture between IBM and Motorola - and Ram Broad- casting in the US, Ram Mobile Data in the UK and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom's Datex-P argue that they offer a more efficient service. This new breed of dedicated data telecommunications networks has been spawned by the wave of liberalisation sweeping through telecom- munications regimes in the US, Europe and elsewhere, and it already looks like being fiercely competitive. In the US market, aside from Ardis and Ram Broadcasting, AT&amp;T's cellular subsidiary, McCaw Cellular Commun- ications, is upgrading its network to carry packet- switched data communications and expects to cover more than 100 cities by the end of this year. The McCaw network is expected to be used for wireless data communications by personal digital assistants manufactured by EO, another AT&amp;T subsidiary, which is building PDAs in competition with Apple's Newton. In the UK five companies were originally awarded 25-year mobile data network licences in October 1991. However after a shake-out there are now three mobile data network operators, Cognito and Ram Mobile Data, a joint venture involving US-based Ram Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues, and Paknet which is now owned by Vodafone and was awarded a mobile licence in addition to its existing fixed data licence. Although subscriber growth has been slower than many analysts expected, Mr John Jarvis, Ram Mobile Data's chief executive, says he met his forecasts last year. Ram is attempting to attract new business customers by taking a lead in developing applications software for the mobile data market - viewed by many as the key to future growth. 'We have about 40 applications of one sort or another,' says Mr Jarvis, of which about a dozen are finished. Ram also believes that its use of Ericsson's Mobitex network hardware, which is beginning to emerge as a de facto standard in Europe, will help attract a growing number of multinational business customers and should event- ually enable its subscribers to 'roam' throughout Europe as well as generating economies of scale. The cost of radio modems for network use has already fallen to about Pounds 300 each when purchased in volume, several hundred pounds cheaper than just eight months ago. Thus, even though mobile data has had a sluggish start, most analysts still expect dramatic growth in the market over the next five years - fuelled largely by the growth in mobile computing and the next generation of PDAs.</p>

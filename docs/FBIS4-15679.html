			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eriks Matulis: "Problems With Puduri Station </F> Arose Due to Uncertain Latvian-Russian Border"]    [Text] Riga, 24 Mar -- Today, in compliance with a  proposal by the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction, the Saeima  [parliament] conveyed a request to Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs  asking him to clarify the circumstances under which the Puduri  railway station situated on Latvian territory, at the village  Baltinava, was turned over to Russian administration, and what  steps the government intends to take to resolve problems  connected with this issue.    In Autumn 1991, the structure of "Soviet Railways" was  liquidated. It was then that "Baltic Railways," which was part  of the old system, turned the Puduri railway station over to  Russia. The board of "Baltic Railways" made this decision  without discussing the matter with the Latvian Government,  Robert Milbergs, head of the parliamentary Commission on  Investigation, told DIENA.    As Vladimirs Zacharovs, chief of the Latvian Prosecutor's  Office Transport Department, who is investigating the case, told  DIENA today, after the annexation of the Abrene district by  Russia in 1946, the border dividing the two states was not  precisely delineated. It was only mentioned that the border  follows the river, but the river course has changed after  drainage operations.    A high-ranking official of the joint stock company "Baltic  Railways," who did not want his name mentioned, stated that he  thinks the "Fatherland and Freedom" request is baseless, as in  1991 the administrative borders clearly showed that Puduri  station is situated on Russian territory. This can be confirmed  by simply looking at a map.    The Saeima will investigate the controversy over Puduri  station and all problems related to the borders, during its  spring session, after it receives clarification from the Cabinet  of Ministers.</p>

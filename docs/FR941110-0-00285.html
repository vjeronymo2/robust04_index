			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1912, Joseph F. Rock collected the first specimens of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (mehamehame) from Kapua on the island of Hawaii (Rock 1913). Based on his specimens, he established the monotypic genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neowawraea, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  named for Dr. Heinrich W. Wawra, a colleague of Rock's. He named the species  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neowawraea phyllanthoides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because of its apparent resemblance to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phyllanthus, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a member of the same family (Euphorbiaceae). Earl Edward Sherff (1939) later transferred the taxon to the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Drypetes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  W. John Hayden (1987), upon further investigation, placed the species in the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because retention of the specific epithet would result in a later homonym, Hayden chose to maintain the tribute to Wawra in the new epithet,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> neowawraea. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a member of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), is a large tree up to 30 m (100 ft) tall and 2 m (7 ft) in diameter with white oblong pores covering its scaly, pale brown bark. The thin, papery, oval leaves, 4 to 14 cm (1.5 to 5.5 in) long and 2 to 9 cm (0.8 to 3.5 in) wide, are green on the upper surface and pale green on the lower surface. Plants are usually dioecious (having separate male and female plants) with unisexual flowers lacking petals. Male flowers, on stalks less than 4 mm (0.2 in) long, have five green sepals with brownish tips. The female flowers, on stalks 1 to 2.5 mm (0.04 to 0.1 in) long, have sepals of unequal length with irregular margins. The two-lobed stigma is positioned atop a 2.5 to 3 mm (0.1 in) long, round ovary with a nectary disk. The fleshy, round fruits, about 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter, are reddish brown to black and contain two slightly curved seeds about 3 mm (0.1 in) long that are somewhat triangular in cross section. This species is the only member of the genus found in Hawaii and can be distinguished from other species in the genus by its large size; scaly bark; the shape, size, and color of the leaves; flowers clustered along the branches; and the size and shape of the fruits (Hayden 1990, Linney 1982, Neal 1965). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was known from Waihii near Kapuna on Molokai, but is now presumed extinct on that island (HHP 1992d25, Hayden 1990). This species was also known from Kealia Trail, Kahanahaiki Valley, and Pohakea Gulch in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1992d5, 1992d10, 1992d33). Currently,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is known on Kauai from Limahuli Valley, Kalalau, Pohakuao, and from the Koaie and Poomau branches of Waimea Canyon (HHP 1992d17, 1992d18, 1992d30 to 1992d32; HPCC 1990b; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Also, three individuals (some of which may be dead) are known from the two adjacent valleys of Mahanaloa and Paaiki, near Makaha Point, on State-owned land (HHP 1992d9, 1992d13). Only one unhealthy individual is known from Limahuli Valley on privately owned land (HHP 1992d17). One tree is known from Kalalau and 10 from Pohakuao on State-owned land (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Sixteen trees are known from the Poomau branch of Waimea Canyon, and 40 to 80 individuals are known from 4 scattered populations along the Koaie branch of Waimea Canyon on State-owned land (HHP 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31; HPCC 1990b; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Oahu,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is currently known from 15 locations with approximately 33 individuals in the Waianae Mountains. The populations are spread from East Kapuahikahi Gulch to Puumaialau Gulch over a distance of about 15.5 km (9.6 mi) on Federal, State, County, and private land (HHP 1992d1 to 1992d4, 1992d6 to 1992d8, 1992d11, 1992d12, 1992d14 to 1992d16, 1992d19, 1992d20, 1992d24, 1992d26, 1992d29; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, one or two individuals are known from Auwahi on the southwest slope of Haleakala at approximately 850 m (2,800 ft) elevation on privately owned land (HHP 1992d23). Five populations are known from the island of Hawaii in South Kona and Kau, extending over an area of about 10 by 5 km (6 by 3 mi) from Papa to Manuka, and numbering approximately 20 individuals, on State and private land (HHP 1992d21, 1992d22, 1992d27, 1992d28, 1992d34, 1992d35; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1990). A Hawaii Island population on private land at Huehue Ranch in North Kona consists of an unknown number of individuals (Hayden 1990). Statewide, the species totals 28 populations containing approximately 127 to 167 known individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occurs in dry to mesic forest at 250 to 1,000 m (820 to 3,280 ft) elevation (Hayden 1990). Associated plant species include alahe'e, lama,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aleurites moluccana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (kukui),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Antidesma pulvinatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (hame), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Streblus pendulina <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a'ia'i) (HHP 1992d3, 1992d7, 1992d9, 1992d12 to 1992d19, 1992d30, 1992d31, 1992d34). The primary threat to the continued existence of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the black twig borer ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Xylosandrus compactus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), that has affected all known  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flueggea neowawraea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  plants. Other major threats include habitat degradation by feral and wild ungulates (pigs, goats, deer, and cattle), competition with alien plant species, and fire. The small number of individuals within any population and the scattered distribution of populations, compounded by a requirement for cross-pollination because the species is dioecious, must be considered a serious threat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

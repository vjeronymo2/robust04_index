			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. The purpose of the meetings was to ``provide for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning the implementation'' of certain parts of Public Law 102&hyph;325. In addition, attendees of the regional meetings were asked to nominate individuals to act as negotiators in the negotiated rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri during September 1992. Each participant at the regional meetings was assigned to one of six groups which were asked to discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. Each group at the regional meetings prepared a report of its discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented to the Department for consideration during the preparation of the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At each regional meeting, groups discussed the statutory changes relating to repayment of loans that are addressed in these proposed regulations. The Department considered the comments received during the regional meetings in preparing draft proposed regulations. Below is a summary of the information received and the proposals made to the Secretary during the regional meetings relating to these proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Repayment Plans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Public Law 102&hyph;325 amended section 428(b)(1)(E) to require that borrowers be offered income-sensitive repayment plans. Participants at all of the regional meetings discussed whether lenders were required to provide both graduated and income-sensitive repayment plans to all borrowers or whether lenders had some discretion, but none of the groups reached an agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants at the meetings also discussed what documentation should be considered in determining an income-sensitive repayment schedule. The participants at the Atlanta and Kansas City meetings recommended that the lender be permitted to rely on the borrower's self-certification of income, while participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that the borrower be required to submit documentation reflecting income to the lender every three years. Participants at the Atlanta and San Francisco meetings also recommended that borrowers be permitted to change repayment plans during the repayment period, but participants at the Kansas City meeting recommended that the lender be given flexibility to determine the borrower's repayment schedule without regulatory restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deferments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Public Law 102&hyph;325 substantially modified the deferments available to borrowers under the FFEL Program. The deferments for borrowers who are in school or unemployed were only slightly modified, but the other specific deferments in prior law were eliminated and replaced by a deferment for periods (up to three years) in which the borrower has or will have an economic hardship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was extensive discussion at all of the regional meetings regarding the appropriate criteria for an economic hardship deferment. Participants at each of the regional meetings supported a different standard for economic hardship: participants at the New York meeting concluded that income below the minimum wage should be used as the standard for economic hardship; participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that borrowers who relied on public assistance and borrowers whose income did not exceed certain levels or whose debts exceeded their income should be considered as satisfying the economic hardship criteria; the San Francisco attendees recommended that the Department consider a variety of factors in defining economic hardship, including the ratio of debt payment to income, poverty level based on family size, and any disabilities the borrower may have. The Kansas City participants also recommended consideration of poverty level and analysis of debt and income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants at all of the meetings generally recommended that the deferment be approved for one year at a time. However, there were significant differences in the recommendations relating to the documentation requirements. Participants at the Atlanta meeting identified specific documents that the attendees believed should be submitted to support a request for an economic hardship deferment; participants at the New York meeting recommended that the Department require ``reasonable, appropriate'' documentation; the attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that the regulations not require the borrower to provide documentation with the application for a deferment but permit the lender to require supporting documentation; and attendees at the Kansas City meeting recommended that the borrower be allowed to self-certify eligibility for the deferment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

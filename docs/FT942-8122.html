			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: The plight of the Prado - This great museum is being allowed to rot Last century a Madrid journalist dramatically informed an unsuspecting public that the Prado museum had burnt down. It was a spoof article based on a disturbing fact: such was the official neglect of the art collection that its reduced staff of watchmen regularly lit fires within the building in order to cook their meals and to keep warm. A new Prado director, archaeologist Jose Mara Luzon was appointed yesterday  -the fourth incumbent in the past three years - and he will find that not much has changed. Nobody burns charcoal alongside a Goya these days but nine months ago the museum's roof sprung a leak and rain water poured into strategically placed buckets in the main Velazquez room. The plight of the Prado, arguably the finest art collection in the world, is a damning indictment of political meddling in cultural institutions. Directors come and go at the whim of the minister of culture while the museum's pressing need to acquire adequate funding and a stable institutional framework is ignored. An internal memorandum drawn up the Prado's board of trustees in 1992 warned that the museum 'continues to suffer a slow deterioration. Its problems are almost the same as those that existed at the end of the 19th century.' Art historian Francisco Calvo Serraller, who resigned as the Prado's director a week ago, complained that the museum 'systematically lacked the most elementary means' to improve its lot and that there was 'not the slightest sign' that the government intended to correct the situtation. The conservative opposition party tabled a parliamentary motion in February calling on the Prado's director and curators to prepare a wide-ranging report on the state of the museum. The motion, which also called for a parliamentary hearing to examine the report, was defeated by the governing socialist party. The key issue, which the report and the hearing would inevitably have addressed, concerns the independence of the museum to run its own affairs. 'The Prado cannot be a toy in the hands of whoever happens to be the minister of culture,' said Miguel Angel Cortes, the conservative opposition spokesman on the arts. A semi-autonomous status is probably the most that can be hoped for. 'No minister of culture is going to give up lording it over the Prado,' said a member of the museum's board of trustees, who asked not to be named. If the Prado's senior staff members, with the backing of independent trustees, were allowed to have a greater say in the running of the museum, their first decision would be to increase their numbers. The Prado has only seven curators, only three of which have tenure. Although the museum possess the finest collection of 17th century Venetian paintings under a single roof, and a leaky one at that, it does not have an senior Italian art specialist. Nor can it afford to publish a comprehensive catalogue. The culture ministry has, in contrast, been lavish with its allocations to Madrid's Reina Sofa arts centre, a modern and contemporary art museum which has been inaugurated on three occasions by successive ministers in the past decade. The Reina Sofa's most recent re-opening, in 1992, also marked one of the Prado lowest hours; it followed extensive refurbishing to house Picasso's Guernica and its 63 accompanying sketches, all of which were transferred from the Prado. According to opposition arts spokesman Cortes, the Reina Sofa has an annual maintenance budget from the ministry of Pta169m (Pounds 186,000), four times more than the allocation for the upkeep of the Prado. Luzon's first words on his appointment were hardly reassuring for those concerned about the future of the Prado: 'there are people who become impatient when they get a top administration job but this is not a Formula One race,' he said. 'It is a very slow process.'</p>

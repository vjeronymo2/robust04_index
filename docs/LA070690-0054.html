			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> CORONER REPORTS MAN WAS STRANGLED  </P> <P> A Port Hueneme man who was found dead in his seaside condominium died of  strangulation, but authorities could not locate the businessman's family to  notify them of his death, the Ventura County coroner's office said Thursday.  </P> <P> Bruce Eugene Pope, 62, was a self-employed, free-lance business consultant,  whose severely beaten body was found Wednesday in a condominium in the 900  block of Lighthouse Way, Investigator Jim Wingate said.  </P> <P> "We've exhausted our resources finding relatives," Wingate said, explaining why  Pope's name was released before his relatives were notified.  </P> <P> Port Hueneme police will not release the method of strangulation and are not  certain what objects were used in the beating, Wingate said.  </P> <P> This is the second homicide in Port Hueneme since 1988, said a spokeswoman for  Port Hueneme Police Chief Bob Anderson. It is at least the ninth slaying in  Ventura County since January. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

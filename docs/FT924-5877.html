			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE fails to hold new trading peak SUCCESSFUL progress at the GATT negotiations took the UK stock market to a new trading peak early in yesterday's session but gains were reversed as new uncertainties in European currencies undermined confidence in prospects for another one point cut in domestic base rates before Christmas. Dealers said there was little selling pressure, however, despite a sudden plunge in share prices on rumours that a rise in Value Added Tax was in the offing. The stock market opened lower, unsettled by the devaluation of Spanish and Portuguese currencies over the weekend and by the expected pressures on the Irish punt which was countered by a huge rise in interest rates in Dublin. But share prices quickly turned higher as stock index futures came in firmly and equities caught up with the better news from the GATT talks, followed by plans for a meeting on Tuesday of the Uruguay Round members. The FT-SE Index quickly broke through to a new trading peak of 2,745.2, just one point above the previous peak reached in May. But, with currency markets continuing to dominate attention, genuine investment support for equities proved lacking and the 12.8 gain in the Footsie was first whittled away and then reversed. Disclosure that the UK's current account deficit had increased to Pounds 1.1bn in October brought no comfort to the stock market, and share prices extended their losses in response to similar, but sharper, falls in some other European bourses. At worst, the Footsie was down by 12.7 points but still 20 points above the 2,700 benchmark and suffering little more than intra-market selling as marketmakers sought to pass stock between one another. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,722.9, for a loss of 9.5 which left the previous closing high intact at 2,737.8. London was helped at the close by Wall Street which recovered an early loss during London market hours. Seaq volume drifted away to 461.3m shares compared with 546.7m on Friday, supporting the traders' view that little of consequence had happened in the market yesterday. However, retail, or customer, business in equities was worth Pounds 1bn on Friday, maintaining the relative improvement of recent weeks. Against the background of currency nervousness, the international blue chip stocks made little headway, ICI remaining depressed by last week's bearish reviews of the proposed demerger of the bio-science interests. Some brewing stocks continued to respond to the likelihood of a settlement of the GATT negotiations. But a report, from economists at the Manchester Business School and Cambridge University, that retailers would see improved consumer spending next year had little effect on store and other retail issues. Strategists appeared unperturbed by the equity market's repeated failure to push convincingly through its previous highs. The market is consolidating but now showing signs of improving confidence, according to Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank and investment house. Nikko believes that only renewed corporate earnings growth could drive the market higher.</p>

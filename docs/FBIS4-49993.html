			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing and Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] In another apparent concession to the United States  to win renewal of most favoured nation (MFN) trading status,  China is allowing a dissident scholar to visit New York after a  two-year battle. Yu Haocheng -- who was officially accused of  "plotting and instigating the counter-revolutionary rebellion"  in 1989 -- said the authorities issued him with a passport this  week and all he needed was a U.S. visa. He expected to depart  at the end of the month. "I'm very happy, of course. I've been  applying for permission for the past two or three years. I want  to go out and learn new ideas," Mr Yu said yesterday.    He will accept an invitation from Columbia University to  spend up to a year there as a visiting scholar researching law,  his field of expertise. He said he was not sure what role the  MFN debate had played in his new-found freedom but observers  said the permission was an attempt to prove that China was  making the "significant progress" in human rights required by  U.S. President Bill Clinton for extension of the special trade  status.    A diplomat in Washington said Mr Yu's case was one of the  major "blocked-passport cases" that U.S. officials had discussed  with Beijing.    A dissident in Beijing said the development might be part of  efforts to kick dissident leaders out of the country.    Hong Kong-based lobbyist John Kamm yesterday welcomed the  news, saying Mr Yu's had been "the most important case the US  has been pressing" with China in the past few years.    Mr Yu, 68, was arrested soon after the June 4, 1989, Beijing  massacre, and held under round-the-clock guard at a school run  by the paramilitary People's Armed Police for 18 months. He was  eventually released with no charges being laid. A former  director of the China Legal System and Social Development  Research Institute, he incurred political hardliners' wrath  after appealing in May 1989 for the student movement to be  declared "patriotic." Shortly afterwards, the Chinese  Government included him on a list of 40 "anti-party coalition"  supporters of ousted Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang.    Mr Yu, a member of the New York-based Human Rights in China  group, said he was likely to meet Chinese human rights advocates  in the U.S. But he said he believed it would be best for China,  the U.S. and human rights advocates in China for MFN to be  extended.    Sources said a brother and a sister of former Tiananmen  Square student leader Chai Ling were also likely to be given  passports to leave the country.</p>

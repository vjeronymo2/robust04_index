			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Purves warns on bid from Lloyds HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank yesterday gave a preview of the battle it is likely to fight to pursue its Pounds 3.3bn bid for control of Midland Bank, if Lloyds decides to challenge the offer. Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong Bank, warned that Midland could be damaged if Lloyds made a bid - and that Midland's shareholders would be better off accepting the Hongkong Bank offer rather than contemplating any Lloyds proposals. His argument is that a Lloyds bid could not be consummated for many months, because any offer from Lloyds would almost certainly be vetted at length by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which assesses takeovers for their effects on competition. Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief executive, is concerned that the innate value of the bank would be damaged if staff quit or lost enthusiasm. Mr Purves admitted it was possible that Midland's shareholders might have 'more to gain' if their bank were taken over by a UK rival rather than by Hongkong Bank. Lloyds estimates if it buys Midland it could make cost savings greater than Pounds 500m. However, leading institutional shareholders in Lloyds and Midland say they want Lloyds to make an offer, because they believe there is strong commercial logic for such a deal. Lloyds will decide whether to bid at the end of the week. After its annual meeting tomorrow, its board will meet over dinner to discuss whether to make an offer. The following morning it will have a formal debate. Hongkong Bank is aware that many of Midland's shareholders are disappointed that the offer is not worth more and that they are being asked to take Hongkong Bank shares and loan stock rather than cash. However, there were indications from China yesterday that the government indicated it would be unhappy if Hongkong Bank raised its offer. The semi-official China News Service said it would be 'unfair' to Hongkong Bank shareholders if it bettered its offer. China urges, Page 26</p>

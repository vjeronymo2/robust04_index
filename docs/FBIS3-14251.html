			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pakistan was compelled to withdraw its resolution on  Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission -- a very unexpected  incident. The withdrawal clearly showed that the process of  forging a new political alliance in the region has begun. As  little as 12 hours before the withdrawal, international news  agencies did not give any hint that the resolution would be  taken back. Rather, the news agencies reported that the Kashmir  resolution might be passed. In the resolution, Pakistan  condemned human rights violations in Kashmir and called for  sending a UN Human Rights Commission fact-finding mission to the  state. Pakistan considered this resolution very important.  Prime Minister Bhutto sought the support of each of the member  countries, but she failed even to win the support of the Muslim  countries. Pakistan was asked by China and 10 Muslim countries  -- including Iran -- to withdraw the resolution. Pakistani  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali said it was very difficult for  his country to refuse a request made by China and Iran. Only  Saudi Arabia and Bosnia-Herzegovina supported Pakistan's  resolution. Bangladesh remained aloof, saying it would abstain  from voting on the resolution. It did not side with the 10  Muslim countries led by Iran or with Pakistan. It should be  mentioned that neither Saudi Arabia nor Bosnia have any voting  rights in the 52-member UN Human Rights Commission, but they  have a large number of supporters.    Bangladesh's stand on this issue is not transparent. For a  long time, Bangladesh has been raising its voice against human  rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. It has always supported  UN resolutions on Kashmir, but it did not support this  Pakistani-sponsored resolution.    Diplomatic sources told this correspondent that Bangladesh  does not have any strategy of its own. Its foreign policy has  no specific goals. It is difficult to say whether there is any  logic behind the nonaligned foreign policy currently being  pursued by Bangladesh following the end of the Cold War between  the United States and the former Soviet Union. It should be  mentioned that Bangladesh does not want to support either India  or Pakistan on this issue. India has described Pakistan's  resolution as interference in its internal affairs. The  resolution proposed that a delegation from the International Red  Cross Society or any reliable representative of the UN Human  Rights Commission be sent to Kashmir. Before the withdrawal of  the resolution, India allowed a group of diplomats from Muslim  countries to visit Kashmir, and officials briefed them on the  situation in the state. During the visit, the Kashmiri people  observed a strike and held protest demonstrations. The diplomats  observed these events from bulletproof cars.    Foreign diplomats based in Dhaka have said that this the  visit India arranged for the Muslim envoys was aimed at  countering Pakistan's diplomacy on Kashmir. India achieved  tremendous success in this regard, as the 10 Muslim countries  led by Iran agreed to ask Pakistan to withdraw its resolution.  Thus, India was able to win a diplomatic victory over Pakistan.  This was possible because of the Muslim countries. It must be  concluded that India has strong ties with the Muslim countries.    It may be recalled that when Indian Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao visited Iran toward the end of 1993, Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani proposed that China, India, and Iran form an  alliance. India did not reject this proposal, and China did not  voice any opposition to it.    Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali gave an interview  to THE TELEGRAPH during his visit to Bangladesh in which he said  it is impossible for India or China to form such an alliance.  He said that Iran made this proposal because of its  anti-American stand.    The undeclared alliance among these three countries became  clear with the withdrawal of the Pakistani-sponsored resolution  on Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission. China's policy is  that other countries should not have any say regarding the human  rights situation in this region. The current Iranian policy is  anti-American, while Indian policy is to overcome the present  crisis by any means. India does not support Western  interference in the country's human rights situation. It is  therefore quite likely that these three countries may forge an  alliance at any time. If this is done, the alliance will be  very strong. In the near future, this alliance will also be  able to influence Pakistani policy. China not only wants to  compete with the United States by forming an Asia-Pacific  Economic Council, it also wants to form a regional bloc. After  pulling out of Vietnam and Cambodia, China tried to establish  ties with the ASEAN countries. In view of its strained  relations with ASEAN, China is now in search of new allies. For  this reason, China is saying that the small countries in the  region should form an independent bloc. It is not clear what  stand small countries such as Bangladesh will take toward the  new bloc China is considering proposing.    The nonaligned policy is gradually losing significance. A  meeting of the nonaligned G-15 group scheduled for New Delhi  last December was not held. The South American member countries  did not attend the meeting. These countries -- including Chile,  Brazil, and Argentina -- are eager to join the North American  Free Trade Association [as published]. The other members of  this nonaligned group -- including Malaysia, Indonesia, and  Zimbabwe -- emphasize the importance of this grouping because  they have anti-American stands. The pro-American members are  unhappy about this.    Under the prevailing circumstances, the countries of this  region feel it is necessary to form an alliance. Pakistan's  resolution on Kashmir led to a diplomatic debacle for that  country. China believes that Pakistan's resolution had the  backing of the United States. Beijing is not willing to  tolerate U.S. interference in the region. It is not clear what  sort of understanding China would like between India and  Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. If China wants regional problems  to be resolved on a regional basis, then we have nothing to say.  If it wants to achieve its own objectives, however, the small  countries should consider the matter. We have seen that India  is unwilling to resolve problems bilaterally. Hence, any  alliance between India and China would be a cause of concern for  the small countries.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Arts: Armstrong's Last Goodnight - Theatre in Edinburgh Scottish Nationalists who have been complaining about the paucity of native culture in the official Edinburgh Festival may be appeased by a slice of Scots history from an English playwright. Certainly, Armstrong's Last Goodnight by John Arden, unveiled at the Lyceum Theatre 30 years after its Glasgow premiere is a tough experience for non-Caledonians. Most of it, conducted in an accent that makes Rab C. Nesbitt sound like Brian Sewell, is unintelligible; and when intelligible, uninteresting. The story is set on the Anglo-Scots marches, among the reivers, those freebooting lairds who cocked a snook at authorities on both sides of the border; cattle-rustlers, pillagers and gangsters whose favourite form of protection money came in the original 'black mail'. The central character is John Armstrong of Gilnockie, a historical figure in the time of James V and his uncle Henry VIII. His execution by the Scottish king is the subject of an old ballad. The modern playwright has fleshed out this violent episode with what I suspect are reflections on the nature of politics, trust, responsibility and probably nouvelle cuisine, DIY and formula one racing for all I could gather from the incomprehensible dialogue. What is clear from William Gaskill's indeterminate direction is that characterisation is almost totally absent. The play is less a think piece than a talk piece. For the most part these are pawns who come on, talk politics and walk off. When something more engaging is called for the result is embarrassing. The courtesan mistress of the smoothie troubleshooter and man of letters Sir David Lindsay is a terrible cliche, and so Alison Peebles plays her, strenuously roguish, hand on hip, with much swishing of skirts and knowing oeuillades at the audience. Fairly typical of the writing's inability to rise to the theatrical challenge is the scene where the roistering Armstrong and his followers are revealed as converts to a reforming evangelist, with no hint of how, when or why these bandits turned into witnesses of faith that Billy Graham would be proud of. The conversion has been done off-stage with the chastity of a an ancient Greek disaster. On second thoughts perhaps one should be thankful. The ideas are not only banal but confused: sophisticated realpolitik is set against - what? For the main weakness of this production is the void at its centre. Stuart Hepburn's dowdy Armstrong is so glumly uncharismatic as to verge on the invisible. His final tragedy, lured to a treacherous end in his finery with the king's false safe-conduct, leaves the impression of the death of a strutting clown since it has been preceded by no characterisation whatever. The vast cast-list suggests that Arden had seen Osborne's Luther - there are hints of an attempt at the same historic scope, which may have prompted the 1965 National Theatre production with Albert Finney. That must have been more gripping. Or more decipherable.</p>

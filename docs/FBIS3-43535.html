			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The minister of state in the Office of the  President, Honorable John Tembo, has denied allegations printed  in today's edition of THE MONITOR newspaper that an intelligence  unit of the Malawi Young Pioneers [MYP] which used to operate at  (Seramara) in Blantyre is now operating from (Jaya) building  where his offices are.    Reacting to the article at a special press conference, Hon.  Tembo expressed concern that the author of the article did not  confirm the allegations before publication. He added that the  allegation was baseless. The minister explained that he has  never commanded any unit of the MYP and that it was impossible  for such an intelligence unit to operate from his offices, where  he said were small. [as heard]    The managing director of THE MONITOR newspaper Mr. Clement  Tambul has acknowledged the concern expressed by Hon. Tembo, but  pointed out that his paper has had problems in the past in  contacting the minister on issues affecting him for  clarifications.</p>

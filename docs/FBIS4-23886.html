			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Following a short lull yesterday, fighting  resumed at dawn today in the center of Kigali with RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] forces shelling several positions held by  government forces. [passage omitted]    The RPF has repeated its position that it opposes French  intervention in Rwanda. Paul Kagame, the RPF military leader,  said this earlier this morning when he spoke to Christophe  Boisbouvier:    [Begin Kagame recording, in English fading into French  translation] We intend to oppose the French intervention in  this conflict by all means available to us because of the role  played in Rwanda by the French in the past. We believe that  they want to intervene for reasons other than those they claim,  and we believe that UN forces on the ground can fulfill the  mission the French want to carry out.    I think their presence here is going to have an escalating  effect on the conflict; they are claiming that militias and  government forces are murdering civilians, but they supported  the so-called interim government responsible for all the  massacres, so they are simply coming here to protect these  people.

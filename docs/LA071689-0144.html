			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LONDON KIDNEYS-FOR-CASH SCANDAL PROMPTS ACTION TO BAN SALE OF ORGANS  </P> <P> A government effort to ban trade in body parts was prompted by a  kidneys-for-cash scandal at a private London hospital this year.  </P> <P> "The concept of organs being bought and sold for money is entirely unacceptable  in a civilized society," Health Minister Roger Freeman told a House of Commons  committee during debate on proposed legislation outlawing organ sales. The bill  is expected to pass Parliament later this month.  </P> <P> Not all lawmakers agree.  </P> <P> "The bill will cause death where there could be life, and to prolong suffering  where we could provide relief," said Sir Michael McNair-Wilson, a Conservative  Parliament member awaiting a kidney transplant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reimbursed for Costs  </P> <P> The legislation will make it a crime to pay or receive payment for a human  organ, act as a broker in such transactions, or solicit buyers or sellers. It  will, however, permit voluntary donors to be reimbursed for the costs of  removing a kidney.  </P> <P> British lawmakers acted after news reports in January that Turkish peasants  were paid to donate kidneys for transplant surgery at the private Humana  Wellington Hospital. Turkish authorities said donors were paid $3,200 to  $5,600.  </P> <P> After the disclosures, Humana Hospital barred two doctors and the General  Medical Council, the disciplinary body for British physicians, opened an  investigation.  </P> <P> Freeman said a Gallup Poll commissioned in February by the British Kidney  Patients Assn. found that 87% of the respondents opposed commercial  transactions in human organs.  </P> <P> "Whether they would think the same if faced with the choice of paying for an  organ or of one not being available, thereby causing death or prolonged  suffering for a member of the family or a close friend, is another matter,"  McNair-Wilson said in committee debate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'List Is Growing'  </P> <P> "We are discussing a shortage of organs for transplant, particularly of  kidneys. The waiting list stands at 3,500 people, but the list is growing," he  said. "Many people are suffering considerable discomfort for long periods. Many  people, who could survive if they had a new kidney, die without cause."  </P> <P> Freeman conceded that donations, which average 1,500 a year, were falling short  of demand and noted that health authorities had been ordered to find ways to  identify potential donors. The government has also asked health workers to  record every death in intensive care and analyze why usable organs were not  transplanted.  </P> <P> After publicity about his plight, McNair-Wilson said a woman in Australia wrote  to offer a kidney for $20,000. According to McNair-Wilson, the woman said she  had lost her home in a fire, had no insurance and was sick of "pulling myself  and my children up by the bootstraps."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dilemma Posed  </P> <P> Neil Hamilton, who cast the only vote against the bill in committee, said he  had pondered the dilemma facing one Turk who allegedly sold a kidney.  </P> <P> "His daughter was suffering from a medical problem which threatened her life,  but it could not be solved in Turkey without money," Hamilton said. "If he did  not get the money for the operation, his daughter would die."  </P> <P> A similar argument for the right to sell organs was advanced by Royden  Harrison, emeritus professor of social history at Warwick University, in a  February letter to the Times of London.  </P> <P> "What possible objection can there be if one person, of their own free will and  without duress, should sell their kidney to someone else?" he asked. "Nor is  there any wrong done by the middleman who makes a profit out of this  transaction. The seller is able to indulge in a few of the good things in life.  The buyer may well be paying to survive."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETRO;  </P> <P> BERLE AND BALL  </P> <P> Milton Berle, a.k.a. Uncle Miltie, a.k.a. Mr. Television, recently was going  through the 390 hours of his legendary TV se ries, specials and shows and came  across a real treasure: a one-hour special he did for NBC starring Lucille Ball  and Desi Arnaz and not seen since it first aired in 1959. The special, "Milton  Loves Lucy," features Lucy and Desi as themselves, not as Lucy and Ricky  Ricardo.  </P> <P> TV viewers will get the opportunity to see the comedy for the first time in 31  years Tuesday night on KTTV Channel 11.  </P> <P> "It is still in good shape," Berle said the other day. "It has nothing to do  with 'I Love Lucy.' We shot it in Las Vegas. I was appearing there at the time  at a hotel called El Rancho Vegas.  </P> <P> "It is very, very funny. If you notice, the writing is completely different  than the writing is today for sitcoms. They had more time, and it's Lucy,  myself and Desi. It is a story of intrigue. And she is the brilliant Lucy. I  think it is one of the best shows we ever did together."  </P> <P> Arnaz also directed the comedy. "I have to compliment Desi a lot," Berle said.  "He was really the big brain behind the Desi-Lucy setup. He was a wonderful  comedy director, and when I did the Lucy shows he directed a few. So I said,  'Hey, Desi, I want you to direct this show,' and he did an excellent job."  </P> <P> Berle met Ball during the mid-'30s when both were under contract to RKO. "She  was gorgeous," Berle said. "We met each other at parties and we had a few  dates, but nothing serious. She is basically the funniest woman I have ever  known and a wonderful actress."  </P> <P> And how many times did the two work together?  </P> <P> "Oh my God," Berle said, laughing. "I guested on 'I Love Lucy' about nine times  and then I did 'The Lucy Show' about 10 times. And I don't know how many times  she guested with me."  </P> <P> Ball, Berle said, was a tremendous perfectionist. "She had to do it right," he  said. "She would rehearse and rehearse and rehearse. When you see the show, you  will notice the glibness and rapport between Lucy and myself."  </P> <P> After "Milton Loves Lucy," KTTV Tuesday night is airing "Lucy Hides Milton," an  episode of the one-hour "Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show" that followed "I Love  Lucy."  </P> <P> "That is the one when I was in drag," Berle said.  </P> <P> "Milton Loves Lucy" airs Tuesday at 8 p.m., followed by "Lucy Hides Milton" at  9 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11.  </P></p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / SA approves transitional executive SOUTH AFRICA yesterday took a further historic step to end exclusive white rule when parliament passed a bill to establish a multiracial Transitional Executive Council, a move which will trigger the lifting of all remaining non-military sanctions. Passage of the bill marks the symbolic end of white hegemony and economic isolation. The transitional executive, which will bring blacks a share of power for the first time, will boost black morale, while the removal of 30 years of economic sanctions will help the morale of most whites. However, right-wing whites have vowed to fight the transitional executive. Members of the ultra-right Conservative party walked out of the chamber yesterday after President F W de Klerk's ruling National party passed the bill by 211 votes to 36 in a parliament which excludes blacks. Parliament's assent followed an accord two weeks ago at the multi-party constitutional negotiating forum. The African National Congress had, however, said the passage of the bill through parliament was a condition for the lifting of non-military sanctions. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, is expected to call for the removal of remaining sanctions - apart from the international arms embargo - when he addresses the UN today in New York. Lifting remaining sanctions is likely to have little practical impact, as foreign investment is severely constrained by political violence which has left 10,000 people dead since political reform began in 1990. However, passage of the transitional executive bill should permit Pretoria to re-establish normal relations with the International Monetary Fund, which is likely to provide some Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m) from its compensatory and contingency financing facility to compensate South Africa for losses incurred as a result of severe drought in 1992. Good relations with the IMF will also improve South Africa's ability to borrow commercially overseas. The council, which will include one member from each of the 20-odd parties negotiating a new constitution, will take office only after agreement has been reached on a new constitution - a process which could still take some months. Although Mr Roelf Meyer, constitutional development minister, said the TEC executive could be in place by next month, installation in November or even December seems more likely. The TEC could provoke a further upsurge in violence, with the Conservative party and the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi vowing to oppose it. The council will have legally binding powers to act, but only in areas directly affecting the coming multiracial elections planned for April 27 next year.</p>

TRT correspondent  Yavuz Yorulmaz reports on President Suleyman Demirel's contacts  in Ukraine:    [Begin recording] [Yorulmaz] This is the palace where the  agreements were signed with Ukraine. Demirel declared that the  agreements will encourage the development of bilateral  relations. Demirel, currently on an official visit to Ukraine,  is continuing his contacts. The talks between the delegations  of the two countries headed by their respective presidents were  also concluded. The joint communique pertaining to the talks  was signed by Demirel and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.    In a statement at the signing ceremony, Demirel said that  the  cooperation between Turkey and Ukraine will benefit world peace  as well as the region. The aim is to increase the existing  $500-million bilateral volume of trade to $1 billion, Demirel  stated. Stressing that Turkey is in favor of continued peace in  its region and in Europe, Demirel noted: We are opposed to  gaining territory through the use of force or to interfering in  the internal affairs of other countries. As with other  countries, we support the territorial integrity of Ukraine.    Demirel expressed the belief that bilateral relations will  develop even further in the future, adding that the necessary  political will exists to this end. Answering a question  concerning Crimea, Demirel said that this is Ukraine's internal  matter.    Kravchuk, in reply to a question of whether the protocol on  the oil pipeline project can be interpreted so as to support  Turkey's view that the straits not be used in oil  transportation, declared: As far as we are concerned, this is  not an issue only between Turkey and Ukraine. It concerns the  whole of Europe from an environmental aspect.    Meanwhile, highway transportation and tourism cooperation  agreements were also signed between Turkey and Ukraine in Kiev.  The agreements were signed by the foreign and transportation  ministers of the two countries. Kravchuk also hosted a dinner  in honor of Demirel.    In his dinner toast, Kravchuk described the visit as a  natural extension of the constructive dialogue between the two  countries. He remarked that Ukraine is still at the beginning of  the path seeking the right place among democratic countries, a  path long ago discovered by Turkey. He added: What brings us  together is not just geographic proximity and history. We are  brought closer together by the economic reforms introduced for  the people's prosperity and the struggle waged for the  development of the democratic society.    Kravchuk explained that bilateral relations have been based  on a sound legal foundation and concrete steps were taken in the  fields of economic, commercial, cultural, and scientific  cooperation. The two countries must establish closer ties to  ensure peace and stability in the region and in the whole of  Europe, Kravchuk said. This visit, he noted, will open a new  page in the relations between Turkey and his country.    Demirel, for his part, declared that a brand new period has  begun with the reciprocal visits of the two leaders.    [Demirel] Turkey believes that the Cold War period should  not be replaced by a cold peace period. We must now experience  a period in which nations reach out for one another, [as heard]  with the most the common history of the human race should become  one of peace, friendship, solidarity, and cooperation. The fact  that Ukraine, an important country of our region, shares these  views with us gives us confidence.    [Yorulmaz] The president stated that Turkey is exerting  great efforts for the peaceful solution of all the problems in  the region, adding that it is pleasing that Ukraine also takes  part in these efforts. Pointing out that the Black Sea Economic  Cooperation brings Turkey and Ukraine closer together, Demirel  said that it is beneficial for the Black Sea countries to join  their efforts for the development of friendship and cooperation.  Turkey sincerely supports Ukraine's goal for modernization as  well as its independence and territorial integrity, Demirel  concluded.    Demirel laid a wreath at the unknown soldier's monument in  Kiev today. He will continue his contacts in Ukraine tomorrow  as well. [end recording]</p>

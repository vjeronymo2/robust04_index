			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / MoD offers contract deal to potential shipyard buyer The Ministry of Defence would be in a position to award a contract to Swan Hunter, the stricken Tyneside shipyard, if a potential purchaser was willing to underwrite the bid, it emerged yesterday. Since Swans went into receivership in May the MoD has said the yard can tender for orders, but an award can be made only if it is on a sound financial footing. It became apparent yesterday, however, that a potential bidder would have the option of backing a bid for an order before committing itself to buying the yard in the north east. Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, said after a meeting yesterday with defence procurement minister Mr Jonathan Aitken, that the minister had confirmed that if a potential purchaser were willing to offer the guarantees the MoD required it would be possible for the department to place a contract with the yard. Mr Brown said: 'This gives the company the chance to make the transition from receivership to private ownership on the back of an award of a contract from the MoD.' Swan Hunter's remaining 1,080 employees are fitting out its last orders  - two Type 23 frigates. The company's sale prospects could be greatly enhanced if it could win the refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary supply vessel Sir Bedivere, for which the MoD has invited tenders by the end of March. The refit will cost about Pounds 30m. At the meeting with Mr Aitken Mr Brown and Mr Stephen Byers, Wallsend Labour MP, expressed concern that rival bidders might try to delay the tendering process, knowing that the order could be critical to Swan Hunter. Mr Aitken said he would be sensitive to delaying tactics. Mr Ed James of receivers Price Waterhouse welcomed the suggestion that potential purchasers' involvement could help win MoD orders. But he added: 'The receivers still believe they will only gain work from the MoD if the yard is financially stable, and that means finding a buyer.'</p>

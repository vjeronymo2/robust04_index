			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Observer: Comic turn US ambassadors to Mexico are in the habit of stirring things up, but has Jim Jones, who is stepping down as chairman of the American Stock Exchange to take up the top diplomatic post in Mexico, set a record? Even before he had set foot in the country, Jones was heard agreeing to check figures on drug hauls as well as to broach the ticklish question of electoral fraud. That may have satisfied his interlocutor during confirmation hearings, right-wing republican senator Jesse Helms, but the nationalist Mexican press immediately branded Jones an interventionist would-be proconsul. Even the normally sedate Excelsior newspaper urged his replacement. Jones, a former democrat congressman from Oklahoma, complains that he merely said yes to Helms's leading questions and was misunderstood. Still, if he is to avoid the fate of John Gavin, the former movie star appointed Mexican ambassador in 1981 by Ronald Reagan, he had better smarten up his act. Gavin's willingness to break all the rules of diplomacy went down well with the likes of Helms, but his period in office coincided with a low point in relations between the US and its important neighbour. Gavin so incensed the locals that the Mexican press suggested that Cantinflas, the comedian who made his name in Around the World in 80 Days, should be sent as Mexico's ambassador to Washington.</p>

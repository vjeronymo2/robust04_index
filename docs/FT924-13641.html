			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (5): A workforce of good repute - Michiyo Nakamoto follows the drive towards high-tech Famed for its rolling hills, spectacular coastline and picturesque villages, Devon may seem an unlikely location for high technology industries. In contrast to its image, however, the county, together with its neighbour Cornwall, has over 70 companies involved in high technology employing more than 11,000 people. The Devon and Cornwall Development Board (DCDB), which is responsible for the region's inward investment, has targeted electronics and precision manufacturing as two industries it hopes to attract to the region. Devon and Cornwall account for some 3.3 per cent of total electronics employment in the UK, even though it has only 2.7 per cent of the total population, according to a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, commissioned by the DCDB. Many of those companies, ranging from British Aerospace Systems and Equipment to Toshiba Consumer Electronics of Japan and Harris Semiconductors of the US, are based in Plymouth, Devon. 'We are beginning to build a base of high-tech companies,' says Mr Ken Martin, DCDB's chief executive. 'You build a reputation, like Silicon Glen.' Devon's reputation is built on a number of factors, foremost of which is the availability of a skilled, hardworking and loyal workforce at competitive wages. 'Because of other high-tech industries there is a pool of labour that's used to working in high-tech conditions,' says Mr Jeff Salter, worldwide marketing communications manager for GEC Plessey Semiconductors, which has a manufacturing facility in Plymouth. The Coopers &amp; Lybrand study showed that over 70 per cent of companies interviewed considered labour turnover to be low or very low while absenteeism was not regarded as a problem. 'I've worked in Singapore and New York and from those experiences I had expected higher absenteeism and turnover but I am very happy with what I have seen so far in Devon,' says Mr Yoshitsugu Fujiwara, managing director of Murata, the Japanese manufacturer of electronic components which has a manufacturing operation in Plymouth. Furthermore, for historical reasons, because it was predominantly agricultural, the region has been spared much of the labour unrest that has rocked other parts of the UK. From a cost perspective, the region's labour costs are about 25 per cent below levels in other regions of the southeast. And where staff suitable for a particular task are not available locally, the beauty of its natural environment helps the region to attract the necessary people to move there. Another important asset is the presence of academic institutions. Exeter University's science faculty - the largest there - specialises in microprocessor systems, power electronics, and Digital Signal Processing, while Plymouth University, formerly Polytechnic Southwest, is one of four centres in the UK awarding a Master of Engineering degree in information engineering. But the DCDB has had to work hard to spread the word that Devon could provide the desired intellectual climate. (There is a general feeling abroad that the UK has only two universities, Cambridge and Oxford, says Mr Martin.) Increasingly, Devon faces intensified competition for inward investment by high technology companies because of recession, and the changing circumstances of a Europe marching towards a single market. The recession has undoubtedly slowed the pace of investment, admits Mr Martin. While roughly the same number of companies has been expressing interest in Devon, the time between a company expressing interest and doing something about it has grown longer. And for companies looking to supply the wider European market one of the problems the region faces is the availability of local suppliers and the time it takes to distribute goods to the rest of the UK and Europe. Competition for the European market is growing and the speed with which a company can bring its product to market is becoming a more critical factor in electronics and other high technology industries. As a result, access to high quality suppliers and speedy distribution channels can make the difference between winning and losing. The Coopers &amp; Lybrand study found that availability of local suppliers was seen as bad by 5 per cent of respondents, poor by 42 per cent and as only satisfactory by 30 per cent. The remaining 23 per cent thought availability was good, rather than excellent. Nevertheless, 12 per cent of respondents felt that the quality of the services was excellent, with a further 60 pre cent saying it was good, and that the main problem was the lack of choice of suppliers and services within the region. Furthermore, it was felt that for the sourcing of supplies and the distribution of products to other parts of the UK and Europe, the transport infrastructure could be improved. 'If you need a part from South Wales, our competitor will get it in two hours while we will get it in five,' says one Japanese manufacturer. Mr Fujiwara at Murata says the company has been encouraging the Plymouth authorities to build a larger airport. Another area that could be improved is the overall level of education. 'The general level of education, which is not as high as in Japan, is a problem for the whole of the UK,' he says. If Devon is to continue attracting a high level of inward investment in competition with a growing number of continental European locations, improvements to the infrastructure, the development of local suppliers and services and a high quality educational system are some important areas it will need to work on.</p>

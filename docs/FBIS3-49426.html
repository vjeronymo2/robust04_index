			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During today's news conference of the Democratic  Convention of Romania [CDR], CDR Chairman Emil Constantinescu  presented the stance of that political alliance with respect to  the evolution of the domestic political affairs over the past  weeks, our correspondent, Iulia Gherman, reports.    After emphasizing the fact that, owing to the self-willed  and  rigid stance adopted by the ruling coalition, the political  dialogue is currently blocked, Constantinescu pointed out that  there are only two ways to overcome this situation, namely  either the establishment of a new parliamentary majority or the  holding of early elections. Talking about the first alternative,  he asserted that the CDR will solely participate in the  government together with the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR] if the latter political grouping gets rid of the  extremist parties and adopts a concrete anticrisis program.  Related to the issue of holding early elections, Constantinescu  said that this represents a constitutional and democratic method  to solve the crisis caused by the lack of confidence in the  current state power. If that solution will be really selected,  that will be a direct consequence of the policy totally lacking  imagination that is being promoted by the ruling party and its  allies.    Constantinescu mentioned the fact that, tomorrow, the CDR  Executive Council will meet in a conference to debate issues  related to the current political, economic, and social situation  in the country in view of the talks that are to be held on  Tuesday [11 January] at Cotroceni Palace among President Ion  Iliescu and CDR leaders.</p>

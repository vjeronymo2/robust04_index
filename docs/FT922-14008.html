			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Church divided - Ballot Box The Tories may be relieved to hear that there will be no eve-of-poll message to the nation from Lambeth Palace. Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has decided, after some contemplation, to stay out of the election campaign. A radio broadcast a few weeks ago calling on politicians of all parties to show moral vision was enough. The Church of Scotland, however, orders these things differently. It has just issued a report highly critical of Conservative economic and social policies  - much to the annoyance of the Scottish secretary, Ian Lang, who has enough on his plate.</p>

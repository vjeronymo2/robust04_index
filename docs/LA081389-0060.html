			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MAGDALENA &amp; BALTHASAR BY STEVEN OZMENT YALE UNIVERSITY  PRESS: $9.95, ILLUSTRATED  </P> <P> The letters Balthasar Paumgartner, a traveling merchant from Nuremburg, and his  fiancee and later wife, Magdalena Behaim, exchanged between 1582 and 1598 offer  a rare look at daily middle-class life in the 16th Century.  </P> <P> Ironically, their mundane stolidity makes them interesting. Balthasar obviously  hated his work and left an increasing number of details to be overseen by his  capable spouse. Magdalena's concern for her husband's health (she urges him to  be bled regularly), her requests for a toy horse for their son, her sad list of  friends who die of plague and other diseases, resonate through the intervening  centuries and provide a personal counterpoint to the deeds of kings that fill  conventional histories. Steven Ozment's thorough notes provide useful  background, although he tends to repeat information contained in the letters.  </P></p>

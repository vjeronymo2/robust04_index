			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Filing in your tax return? Here's the form - The yearly chore of Revenue form-filling is here again. Scheherazade Daneshkhu provides a user-friendly guide IF YOU have not yet received a tax return from the Inland Revenue, you are unlikely to get it now. Those who have must find time to fill in their return for 1992-93, which covers income for the year ended April 5 1992. It should be sent back within 30 days, although in practice the Inland Revenue will not levy penalties unless the form is still not returned by October 31. Those who have received a form will usually either be self-employed or have earnings from sources other than their full-time employment. Sometimes the Revenue sends a tax return form - usually a blue P1 form  - to employees to check that their circumstances have not changed. Otherwise, most employees will receive a brown P11 form and those who have their own business, a blue 11 form. Partnerships will receive a pink form 1. Several key issues need to be addressed: Do you need an accountant? Employee: If you are employed with a salary of up to Pounds 50,000 and receive few benefits, you probably do not need help in filling in the form, unless you are very busy and know that you will never get around to it. However, if you are a high earner with many perks it may be worth getting professional help, according to Jennifer Ainsworth, tax partner at Moores Rowland chartered accountants and president-elect of the Institute of Taxation. In such circumstances, Ainsworth says there is more room for technical error and for the Inland Revenue itself to make mistakes. Perks include a company car, private medical insurance, payment in the form of gold bullion, or part payment through incentive schemes such as holidays or clothes. Your employer will have to fill in a P11D form detailing benefits paid to you but you must also list these benefits in your own form. Those with a lot of investment income will also need advice. An alternative to employing an accountant full time is to make a one-off visit. For a fee, the accountant should check that you have filled in the form correctly and should spot whether you are missing out on any entitlements. Self-employed: The self-employed will almost certainly need an accountant. The self-employed generally have two sets of tax returns to file - their personal tax return and that of the business. These may be at different times of the year, depending on the date chosen to make up the business accounts. Businesses with an annual turnover of Pounds 15,000 or more have to produce accounts to the Revenue. Those who have a part time business, such as consultancy, will find it worthwhile to have an accountant in order to establish allowable expenses. The type of accountant you need depends on the complexity of your accounts. Large City firms may be highly competent but will be expensive for those with relatively straightforward needs. Steven Coleman, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, suggests finding an accountant from one of its 22 district societies. Call the ICA on 071-606-7060 and ask for the telephone number of the district society nearest you. Select two or three firms in your area and 'see them all,' says Coleman. 'Ask what they are going to charge, how quick they will be in dealing with your accounts and see if you like them.' The Institute of Taxation on 071 235 9381 will also give details of tax advisers in your area. Accountants' fees vary widely according to the firm's size and location. Fees start at about Pounds 20 to Pounds 25 an hour for country practitioners and go up to about Pounds 100 an hour or more in the City. Filling in the form Peter Wyman, tax partner of Coopers Deloitte and chairman of the Tax Faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, says there are two main problems. The first is that many people do not claim their full entitlements; the other is that 'people leave things out, usually innocently. For example, they forget about a building society account. The Revenue picks it up and asks them to review their return.' If their memory is not jogged, the Revenue can take a harder line, assuming that you have other sources of income similarly left undeclared. The following points should be borne in mind: Review the form upon completion to check that everything necessary has been declared. Taxpayers are obliged to give the Revenue as much information as necessary for it to judge how much tax they should be charged. Ainsworth says that sometimes employees fail to list the benefits given to them by their company. They insert instead 'as returned by the company' (in the P11D), but this answer risks incurring a penalty because you must list the benefits you are receiving in your own form. Ask your company for a copy of the P11D which it will be returning to the Revenue. Only list details of income for the tax year from April 6 1991 to April 5 1992. Claim all the reliefs and allowances to which you are entitled. Do not rely on the Revenue to have the information. Check your tax assessment for the previous year and if you want to challenge it, write stating your reason and the amount of tax in dispute within 30 days of the date stated. Employment income. List all your sources of income, regardless of whether tax has already been paid on it or if it seems too small to be taxable. Keep a file containing dividend counterfoils, monthly payslips and the P60 form your employer sends you listing your total income for the tax year and the amount of tax paid. Benefits in kind must be listed separately from total income. Investment income. If you do not receive bank statements or do not have the time to add up interest earned during the tax year, your bank or building society will do this for you and may send you a certificate stating the amount of interest earned during the year. Most current accounts are interest-bearing and this will also have to be declared. Ainsworth points out that for 1991/92 onwards you can reclaim the tax deducted on bank and building society interest if you are entitled to gross interest or if the tax was overpaid. Previously, this interest was subject to composite rate tax which was non-refundable. If you are a non-taxpayer and have not already registered as such, ask your bank or building society for form R85 which will allow interest to be paid at gross rates. Tessas do not have to be declared unless they have been closed, in which case the interest is taxable and should be recorded. List the dividends from shares or unit trusts received during the tax year - if you have kept the vouchers, this will be simple. It can sometimes be difficult to understand whether the figures quoted on some unit trust vouchers are gross or net of tax. Wyman suggests calling the broker or going back to the registrar of the unit trusts to check. Pensions. Pension income is taxable and should be declared. Details will be on the P60. Certain state benefits, such as unemployment benefit and the old age pension, are also subject to tax and must be declared. If you have a personal pension plan you will be entitled to tax relief, at your highest rate, on contributions. Ask the company for the personal pension contribution certificate and send this to the Revenue, or enclose the contribution receipt issued to you by the company. Similarly, higher rate taxpayers making free-standing additional voluntary contributions to their company pension can get tax relief on these by filling in the details on the form and enclosing either the contribution receipt or the voluntary contributions certificate. Property income. This can be complicated. If you are letting a house and have expenses relating to its upkeep, you and the Revenue might disagree about what is an expense and what is an improvement. For example, you might repair the window frames and put in double glazing at the same time - the Revenue might challenge you on the double glazing. Expenses in employment. These are defined by the Revenue as 'expenses you had to pay which arose wholly, exclusively and necessarily in carrying out your work.' In practice, 'it is hard to think of expenses for your work that are not paid by your employer,' says Wyman. However, if there is a work-related expense which you think you are forced to incur and for which your employer will not reimburse you, you might as well claim it and see what the Revenue says. Loans. Basic rate tax relief is obtainable on mortgage interest on loans, subject to a ceiling of Pounds 30,000. The Revenue will obtain details of the loan from building societies but if the mortgage is from a bank, you should ask it to give you the details (Form MIRAS 5) and send this to the tax office. Ainsworth reminds those who have made a loan, for example, to a business, that they may be entitled to higher rate relief on it. To claim the relief, obtain a certificate from the company you made the loan to and send it to the Revenue, stating what the loan was for. Capital Gains. You have to list details of disposals of assets liable to CGT, such as property (other than your main home) and shares. Wyman says many people forget that they can list expenses related to the sale, such as stamp duty and commission. However, if your total chargeable gains for the last tax year do not exceed the CGT ceiling of Pounds 5,500 (and the total proceeds are not more than Pounds 11,000), you can simply write, 'Gains not exceeding Pounds 5,500 and disposals not exceeding Pounds 11,000'. If you have sold a second home you are entitled to deduct improvement expenses from your gains, as long as you have not already had income tax relief on these. You are also entitled to indexation - you can get the Revenue to work out your indexation allowance simply by writing 'indexation?' as a claim. Married couples. Make sure you make full use of both personal allowances. Minimise paying higher rate tax by using both lower-rate tax bands. Norman Lamont's Budget measure regarding the transferability of the married couple's allowance will not come into force until 1993. However, if a married man's income is less than the married couple's allowance, the unused part can be transferred to his wife. Finally, remember to photocopy the return before sending it off.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: BHP buys Mexican stake Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, has acquired a 14 per cent interest in Grupo Ferro Minero. GFM's main interest is an 82.7 per cent stake in Minera Autlan, a Mexican manganese ore miner and ferro alloy smelter. Autlan is based in Mexico City, and its local operations have the capacity to produce more than 500,000 tonnes of ore and up to 200,000 tonnes of ferro alloys per year. No purchase price was given for the GFM stake, but BHP described the deal as a 'strategic alliance' which would back up a five-year ore sales contract to Autlan. During this period, BHP Manganese will supply all of Autlan's imported manganese ore needs. BHP said this could be up to 80,000 tonnes a year.</p>

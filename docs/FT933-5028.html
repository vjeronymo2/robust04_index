			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (7): Crumbling monoliths offer new opportunities - As centralised control is swept away, Latin America and the ex-Soviet bloc become expanding markets AT A time when global reinsurance capacity has been contracting at record speed, in Latin America and the former Soviet bloc relaxation of state control over the insurance industry is eroding the domination of nationalised reinsurers. Most of Latin America, including the most attractive markets, is opening to foreign direct investment in insurance, as is central Europe, while most of eastern Europe has seen a rapid increase in new insurers with domestic or joint venture capital. For the economies of Latin America, the 1980s was 'The Lost Decade' afflicted by political instability, high inflation, capital flight and the burden of debt service. International financial institutions are now prepared to invest once again. In the north, Mexico will become even more attractive with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), while in the south economic integration is being fostered through Mercosur, the planned common market linking Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur will eventually introduce freedom of insurance services, creating indigenous impetus for the dissolution of the still-monopolised Brazilian and Uruguayan reinsurance markets. Argentina has abolished its state reinsurance monopoly, as Chile did at the beginning of the 1980s. Other measures of market deregulation have been implemented in, for example, Colombia and Peru, and also in Brazil, where last month a board for the first time made up of professional insurers rather than purely political nominees was appointed to the monopoly IRB. In Venezuela, measures to open up the market have been delayed by political instability. Mr Egbert Willam, board member responsible for the region at Cologne Re, says that 'As a reinsurer, we now have many things we could wish for. We think it represents an opportunity for us.' A measure of the degree of underlying change is the fact that only two or three years ago Cologne Re was considering withdrawing from the region, but this December will establish a new operation in Buenos Aires to service the Southern Cone. At the end of July, Transatlantic Reinsurance Co announced the formation of a new division in Miami to underwrite Latin American business. While the number of direct insurers operating will decline, those which remain will be financially stronger and technically more sophisticated and demanding, the divisional head Javier Vigil says. He adds that as a new entrant to the market unburdened by the effects of past losses, Transatlantic aims to be 'a premier player in Latin America' beyond the year 2000. It is not a reinsurer's Eldorado, however. A prime concern is catastrophe exposure, particularly in the north which is subject both to earthquake and windstorm. In August last year, Cologne Re advised its clients that it would cease providing catastrophe cover on a proportional basis by 1997. 'A non-proportional basis is the only reasonable way to reinsure catastrophes,' Mr Willam comments. Mr Georg Daschner, deputy executive manager with responsibility for the region at leading provider Munich Re, expresses similar concerns regarding catastrophe exposure and points out that deregulation does not bring automatic benefits. In Chile, when tariffs were freed along with the abolition of the reinsurance monopoly, 'many reinsurers only saw the fantastic statistics, thought the market must be sound, and offered high levels of capacity and commissions,' he recalls. As competition, premium levels plummeted and fear of competition delayed the required underwriting adjustments. Reinsurance market conditions are not conducive to an exact repetition of that scenario, but Mr Daschner warns that the freeing of tariffs and controls on policy conditions has also led to a collapse in original premium levels in Colombia and Mexico, for example. The inadequacy of property insurance rates becomes particularly apparent, he adds, when the portion to cover earthquake is removed. 'We need to separate this price out,' he emphasises, so that a premium commensurate with the risk can be obtained by reinsurers. For the next renewals, Munich Re will demand additional measures to be taken to limit further accumulated liabilities from natural perils and to increase the respective reinsurance prices. The company will maintain its close but cautious relationship with the region, working together with those companies which it believes can underwrite on a proper technical basis and are interested in a long-term link, Mr Daschner says. Eastern European state insurers always placed substantial volumes of marine and aviation business, as well as hard currency property risks, in the international market. In much of both regions, there is a shortage of experienced underwriting staff, the former because insurers were few, the latter because they were many but effectively insulated from technical decisions by set tariffs and compulsory cessions. In the past, developing insurance markets with a shortage of local capital such as eastern Europe have been able to rely upon proportional reinsurance support, now in short supply while non-proportional cover is expensive. Subsidiaries of major western insurers or joint ventures - Allianz, Generali, AIG and Alte Leipziger are among the most active - can rely on their parents and their existing relationships with leading reinsurers. Others buy such protection as they can afford and run the remainder on a net basis. In Poland, which has a comparatively large number of small insurers, co-insurance is developing, and a new local reinsurer is being formed by market leader PZU, which is awaiting privatisation. The problem of reinsurance is greatest in the former USSR. Russia has well over 1,000 new insurers, most of them already licensed, who are nowadays trying to cover their rouble reinsurance requirements on the local market. Ingosstrakh, the former Soviet hard currency insurer, provides some, as do the now emerging new local reinsurance companies all over the country. Cologne Re (which also owns 10 per cent of the largest Russian privately-owned insurer, ASKO), and Munich Re also do so selectively, although both are more active in providing the markets of the former USSR with scarce hard currency reinsurance. An area in which reinsurance support has had important local impact is in cover for motorists abroad. Uniquely in Europe, states of the former USSR (with the exception of Estonia) have no motor liability insurance legislation, and have been unable to join the Green Card system. French market leader UAP reinsures Green Cards underwritten by PZU which are marketed by the state insurers of Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus, as well as by private sector insurers in Estonia. Last month UAP and its partners, together with Polish broker Grupa Polska, opened a motor claims bureau in Warsaw.</p>

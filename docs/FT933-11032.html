			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: ERM: Arguments favour giving priority to monetary policy and a large realignment (1) Sir, The economic case argued by the 'MIT Six' (Personal View, July 29) for the burial of the exchange rate mechanism is as welcome as it is irrefutable. The Six, however, were late in changing their views. One of them, Rudiger Dornbusch, is on record at a G7C meeting only 14 months ago in claiming that there was nothing wrong with the ERM that a lira devaluation would not cure. The Six indeed have to explain away their erstwhile support of the ERM. They thereby assert that the ERM in its early years was a good system in inducing reductions in inflation but somehow it became rigid and perverse. As you know, together with a very few others, I have argued that there is no evidence that the ERM countries reduced inflation any faster than the outsiders, that the ERM was and is inherently perverse and unstable, and that the political-market forces would induce the same sort of rigidity that we saw in Bretton Woods. All these dynamics, masked until 1990 by exchange controls, became quite clear over the last three years. Black Wednesday was merely one culmination; there are others to come. But what concerns me in the MIT Six article is the stress they appear to put on targeting unemployment - 'putting unemployment at the top of the list (of priorities)'. So we may well risk falling out of the ERM frying pan into a Keynesian inferno. Targeting unemployment, as we know from the post-second world war years, gave us eventually even higher levels of unemployment and rampant inflation. Surely the first priority should be stable monetary policy, not unemployment. At the very least a stable monetary policy should save us from the exacerbations of inflation and recession that we have experienced, either outside or inside the ERM, by pegging sterling to the D-Mark.

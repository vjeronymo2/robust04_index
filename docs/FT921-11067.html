			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Charges hit CanPac offshoot CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products suffered a loss of CDollars 571.5m (USDollars 492.6m), or 13 cents a share, in 1991, after special pre-tax charges of CDollars 528m to cover mill shutdowns and a write-down of its packaging business, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Most of the loss came in the fourth quarter. In 1990, the company lost CDollars 9.4m, or 21 cents a share. CPFP, 80 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific, is one of Canada's three top newsprint producers. It was this sector that caused most of the problems. CPFP is closing one new mill permanently near Montreal this year, and its packaging business is for sale.</p>

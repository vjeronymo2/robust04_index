He told the BBC that candidates for appointment to the  police  force are selected in accordance with Palestinian law and draft  regulations. He indicated that out of approximately 11,000  candidates who have applied to join the Palestinian police  force, 3,000 have so far passed the medical test. I have no  right to ask any applicant about his affiliation, he stressed.    Muhanna indicated that the spread of arms carries grave  risks  for the Palestinian people. When Palestinian police are  deployed in the occupied territories, they will operate under a  Palestinian penal code, and law breakers will be prosecuted.

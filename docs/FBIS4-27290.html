			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- The World Federation of  Trade Unions and foreign public figures denounced the anti-DPRK  campaign of the United States and its followers.    Jaroldo Rima, chief of the group of the communist members of  the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, in his speech at a session of  the National Congress on May 17 said that the United States is  scheming to take sanctions against the DPRK through the UN  Security Council, clinging to military means under an  unreasonable pretext. "This is an open attack on the socialist  system of Korea," he added. "We denounce the U.S. imperialist  policy and express solidarity with the government and people of  the DPRK in their struggle to defend the sovereignty of the  country and the dignity of the nation," he stated. He demanded  that the government of Brazil maintain an independent and fair  stand towards the situation prevailing in the Korean peninsula.    The World Federation of Trade Unions in a statement on May  18  hoped that the row over "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK and  the aggravation of tensions on the Korean peninsula by the  United States and South Korean authorities would be terminated.  "The workers and trade unions of the world would fight to this  end," it declared.    Abdul Malik, secretary general of the Karachi branch of the  Pakistan-Korea Friendship Association, said in his writing  addressed to the U.S. President, the U.N. secretary-general, the  general director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the  puppet president of South Korea, political and public figures of  Pakistan and diplomats of different countries in Pakistan on May  22: "The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a matter to be  resolved between Korea and the United States because it was  caused by the United States."    He stressed that the United States should act with  discretion, though belatedly.</p>

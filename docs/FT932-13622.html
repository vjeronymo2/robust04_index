			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas improves to Dollars 216m MCDONNELL Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in first-quarter earnings - in spite of falling US military spending and a troubled world airline industry. It announced net earnings of Dollars 216m, or Dollars 5.51 a share, including Dollars 122m of gains from the resolution of tax issues and the sale in the UK of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International. Excluding these gains, earnings totalled Dollars 94m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, compared with Dollars 20m, or 52 cents, last time. Revenues dropped from Dollars 4.06bn to Dollars 3.62bn. The company also reported a 10 per cent reduction in the debt of its aerospace business, from Dollars 2.76bn at the end of 1992 to Dollars 2.48bn, due to asset sales and improved operational cash-flow. It hopes to achieve Dollars 1bn in free cashflow in 1993 and cut debt to around Dollars 1.8bn by year-end, which would lower its debt to total capital ratio from 48 per cent at the end of 1992 to around 35 per cent. The results were better than the market expected and McDonnell Douglas's shares, which have risen from Dollars 48 at the end of last year, jumped a further Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr John McDonnell, chairman, said there were two fundamental reasons for the strong performance: 'Programmes that were doing well have continued to do well or even better. Second, there were no write-offs or major losses.' He said this included the controversial C-17 military cargo aircraft programme, which was close to break-even for the first time in eight quarters and was expected to see profit later this year. General Dynamics, the US defence contractor which is shrinking through asset sales, announced first-quarter earnings after taxes of Dollars 41m on sales of Dollars 878m, up 37 per cent on the Dollars 30m of earnings a year ago on sales of Dollars 848m.</p>

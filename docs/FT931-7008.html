			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / British Gas sheds 2,400 jobs after fall BRITISH Gas said it would make 2,400 job cuts over the next two years after last year's profits dropped sharply following an increase in competition in its core UK market and a tough new pricing formula which forced the company to cut prices. Profits were also hit by warmer weather. British Gas's profit for last year almost halved to Pounds 681m from Pounds 1.16bn the previous year. An exceptional charge of Pounds 320m to pay for redundancies, environmental clean-up provisions and restructuring the corporate centre, accounted for a large part of the decline. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the job cuts would 'slim down the contract trading side and respond to the squeeze on margins in the tariff sector'. He emphasised that the reduction would be achieved through voluntary redundancies and natural wastage. The planned cut in the workforce follows the loss of 800 jobs last year and an announcement earlier this year that the company would reduce its headquarters staff by 1,200. Unions have blamed the job reductions on the regulator, which has imposed the tough new pricing regime and forced British Gas to give up much of its industrial market share. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, which represents most gas workers, criticised the company's management for mishandling its relationship with the regulator, by 'adopting an arrogant attitude'. However, Mr Brown said the company's relations with the regulator had improved. One of the fruits of this was the publication yesterday of a joint document by British Gas and Ofgas on proposals for the operation of the company's pipeline and storage business from October, when it becomes a separate subsidiary. Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, said: 'We've been making progress, but there are inevitably points which flare up: it's not bayonets drawn, but it is not all sweetness and light.' British Gas's plans, including the job cuts, could be upturned in April when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission will report on the structure of its business. Mr Brown said yesterday the job cuts 'do not anticipate the outcome of the MMC inquiry'. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 25</p>

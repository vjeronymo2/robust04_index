			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DELAYS IN AIRPORT CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> Re coverage of terminal construction at John Wayne Airport (Dec. 2): I am flat  out baffled by The Times' cursory coverage of the delays and cost overruns  associated with the construction of the new terminal at John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> Without fail, story after story plunges into an oversimplified pasting of the  alleged ineptitudes of the consultants, architects and construction  professionals the county retained to plan, design and construct the terminal.  That's not to say that these groups have not made errors over the course of the  project, or that those errors should not be reported to county taxpayers who  are paying for the building. Quite the contrary.  </P> <P> But why do you continue to focus on the outrage of the county supervisors and  those officials administering the job? Why do you play lap dog to their threats  of investigation and levying of fines against consultants? Is it merely because  it makes for good copy?  </P> <P> Has no one at The Times asked how the county's inexperience with such a complex  public works project (the largest in the county's history) contributed to the  budget busting and delays? Has no one at The Times pondered how that  inexperience might have contributed to the county's failure to make timely  decisions during critical phases of the development schedule? Or how that  failure contributed to delays and excesses of budget?  </P> <P> Better yet, why no analysis of the terminal's delays and cost overruns in  relation to other public works projects of similar magnitude? Did anyone stop  to think that the extent of such "problems" associated with such jobs might be  the historical norm?  </P> <P> The point is this. If The Times wants to get its dander up about what a  "fiasco" the construction of the terminal has been, do it on the editorial  page. But when it comes to covering the project as a story, do us all a favor  and take a look at the people who "doth protest too much" as well. You may find  that some of their own actions are the subject of their scorn . . . and  embarrassment.  </P> <P> In the meantime, let's all give thanks that the opening date for the terminal  has been pushed to September, 1990. I'd much rather be inside a terminal that  is the product of non-hurried, well-executed construction standards than an  unreasonably ambitious schedule framed by a public relations agenda and a  standing invitation to a former president.  </P> <P> BYRON L.

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EIGHT PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO MURDER IN N.Y. SUBWAY  </P> <P> Eight young men said to belong to a gang whose members must commit a mugging to  be admitted were arraigned Wednesday on murder charges in the slaying of a Utah  tourist who was stabbed during a robbery in a subway station.  </P> <P> Each of the men pleaded not guilty and all were remanded to jail without bail  by state Supreme Court Justice Judith Levitt. They were scheduled to appear in  court Friday to hear the conclusions of a grand jury investigation.  </P> <P> The eight suspects, ages 17 to 20, were charged with murder, robbery and  assault in the death of Brian Watkins, 22, a tennis buff from Provo, Utah.  </P> <P> Watkins, visiting New York with his family to attend the U.S. Open, was slain  Sunday night while trying to defend his mother and father against a gang of  muggers in the Manhattan subway station.  </P> <P> All eight suspects in the Watkins slaying were said to be part of the  Queens-based FTS gang, a graffiti crew whose members are required to mug  someone in order to join, according to a report in the New York Times.  </P> <P> Police said they were unaware of the FTS gang, even though the group's name can  be seen scrawled on the walls of subway stations and other buildings in the  Flushing neighborhood of Queens.  </P> <P> "They have not come to the attention of the Police Department as a group that  has committed an illegal act," said John Galea, a retired sergeant and former  head of a police gang intelligence unit.  </P> <P> Neighborhood residents and friends of the suspects told the newspaper that Yull  Morales, 19, who police believe did the stabbing, was the founder of the FTS  gang and the one who imposed the mugging initiation rule.  </P> <P> At its peak several years ago, FTS had a membership of about 250 youths who  pursued dancing and spray-painting graffiti as hobbies, the Times reported.  </P> <P> Detectives have said they believe the suspects took $200 from Watkins' father  to pay for a party at Roseland, a popular dance hall near the subway stop.  </P></p>

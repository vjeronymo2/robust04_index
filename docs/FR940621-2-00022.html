			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Policy Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 27, 1993, the President outlined a major principle of U.S. nonproliferation policy:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Our national security requires us to accord higher priority to nonproliferation, and to make it an integral element of our relations with other countries.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The policy further states that the U.S. will:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Seek to eliminate where possible the accumulation of stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium or plutonium, and to ensure that where these materials already exist they are subject to the highest standards of safety, security and international accountability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the President called upon the Government to:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Initiate a comprehensive review of long-term options for plutonium disposition, taking into account technical, nonproliferation, environmental, budgetary and economic considerations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's objectives in furtherance of this policy include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To strengthen national and international arms control efforts by providing an exemplary model for storage of all weapons-usable fissile materials and disposition of surplus weapons-usable fissile materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To ensure that storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials is carried out in compliance with environmental, safety and health standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To minimize the prospect that surplus United States weapons-usable fissile materials could be reintroduced into the arsenals from which they came and therefore increasing the prospect of reciprocal measures by Russia and other nuclear powers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To minimize the risk that surplus United States weapons-usable fissile materials could be obtained by unauthorized parties; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To accomplish these objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose of, and Need for, the PEIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Energy (DOE), the agency responsible for management, storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials from United States nuclear weapons dismantlement and weapons production processes, proposes to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to evaluate alternatives for long-term storage of all weapons-usable fissile materials, and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials declared surplus to national defense needs by the President.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of the environmental analysis in the PEIS, information from technical and economic studies, and national policy objectives will form the basis for decisions regarding long-term storage of all weapons-usable fissile materials and the disposition of surplus weapons-usable fissile materials. The PEIS may be followed by project-specific NEPA documents to the extent necessary to implement any decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this NOI, which is the initial step in the NEPA process, is to inform the public of the PEIS proposal, to solicit public input, and to announce that a scoping process will be conducted so that the public may express its opinions and views regarding the alternatives to be considered and the scope of the issues to be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In early 1994, the National Academy of Sciences published a report,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management and Disposition of Excess Weapons Plutonium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This study, commissioned by the President's National Security Council, provides information regarding management and disposition of surplus nuclear materials, in particular plutonium. Copies of this National Academy of Sciences report are available upon request to the address stated above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the United States, weapons-usable fissile nuclear materials are currently stored at several DOE sites, including Pantex (Amarillo, Texas), Hanford Site (Richland, Washington), Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (Idaho Falls, Idaho), Rocky Flats Plant (Denver, Colorado), Savannah River Site (Aiken, South Carolina), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, California), Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, New Mexico), and Oak Ridge Reservation (Oak Ridge, Tennessee).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is currently performing vulnerability studies to determine the environmental, safety, and health (ES&amp;H) risks associated with the current storage of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and other weapons-usable fissile materials. These studies will form the basis for Departmental actions to ensure safe, secure interim storage of weapons-usable fissile materials until the long-term storage or disposition actions are implemented. In addition, plans for bilateral or International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection and verification of the surplus material in storage are being developed and may require action. If any actions required to establish these interim conditions are considered major federal actions that might have a significant impact on the environment, appropriate NEPA analysis will be prepared and documented prior to proceeding. The results of these efforts will establish the interim condition of safe, controlled, inspectable storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 6 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting German  Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Carl-Dieter  Spranger on Sunday blasted as "unrealistic" the proposed ban on  the import of tropical wood products and said the ban will  impede the conservation of tropical forests which serve as the  lung of the earth.    "If the ban on the import of tropical wood products is  effective, these forest products might give no economic  advantage to countries which have tropical forests, and that  they will find it difficult to conserve their forests," Spranger  told the press at the Sukarno-Hatta airport a moment before he  left for home.    Environmentalists in the United States and Europe have  proposed that their governments impose a ban on the import of  tropical wood products from developing countries.    Spranger said he had seen for himself Indonesia's  well-planned efforts to conserve its forests without necessarily  sacrificing the ecosystem.    It was natural for Indonesia which had huge tropical forests  to utilize its natural resources, including tropical forests, he  said.    Earlier, Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo briefed  the German minister on the management of Indonesian tropical  forests. Spranger also visited tropical forests in East  Kalimantan during his stay.    According to Spranger, the Indonesian Government was  determined to conserve its tropical forests while exploiting  part of them to gain foreign exchange earnings.    He said he was in support of Indonesia's efforts to  disseminate objective information on the management of tropical  forests in developing countries.    In 1993, Indonesia exported an estimated nine million cubic  meters of tropical wood worth U.S.$6.5 billion. Japan was the  biggest market for Indonesian tropical wood, followed by the  United States and European countries.    Spranger said Germany was prepared to provide the Indonesian  Government with technical assistance to manage its tropical  forests.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity at Pounds 183m and lifts dividend by 15% EASTERN Electricity yesterday produced the largest profits increase in the regional electricity results season so far with a 28 per cent rise at the pre-tax level. It declined, however, to join the dividend race which has seen REC pay-outs soar. The dividend increase of 15 per cent, bringing the total to 19.2p, was less than the 15.9 per cent set by Seeboard on Tuesday, but still at the upper end of the range. Mr James Smith, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our operating strength has been reflected in benefits to both shareholders and customers. 'The value of our shareholders' investment has increased, while customers are benefiting through competitive energy prices and continuing improvements in services.' Pre-tax profits at the Ipswich-based company amounted to Pounds 183.4m in the year to March 31, up from Pounds 143.1m. Turnover was Pounds 1.92bn (Pounds 1.88bn). Earnings per share jumped 30 per cent, from 38.6p to 50.1p. The gain came partly as a result of an attack on costs; 1,100 jobs went during the year, and 400 more are due to go this year, contributing to cost savings of Pounds 20m a year. There was also a sharp turnround in the electricity supply business: last year's operating loss of Pounds 9.7m was transformed into a profit of Pounds 31.4m thanks to a Pounds 17m reduction in earlier under-recovery of costs because of regulatory controls. The electricity distribution business saw operating profit fall from Pounds 175.9m in 1992 - when it was boosted by Pounds 15m of over-recovery - to Pounds 158.4m. There was a net loss of Pounds 1m on retailing activities, and the loss on contracting widened from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 4.9m because of a poor market. A strong cash flow enabled gearing to be reduced from 31 per cent to 17 per cent. Mr Smith said the dividend increase was 'warranted by the profit stream' and was 'a statement of confidence in the future'. Dividend cover was raised from 2.3 to 2.6 times. Customers benefited from frozen prices and a Pounds 5 energy efficiency rebate in the year. COMMENT Eastern used its strong results to improve its low dividend cover rather than set a new pay-out record, which was prudent, if disappointing for shareholders. Analysts will be looking for signs of fresh strategic direction as Mr Smith hands over the chief executive reins to his chosen successor John Devaney, who inherits a heavy agenda of cost-cutting and structural work in loss-making areas like retailing and contracting. Although the market pushed the shares up a few pence on the result, they settled back to close the day unchanged at 472p on a prospective yield of about 5.6 per cent, close to the sector average.</p>

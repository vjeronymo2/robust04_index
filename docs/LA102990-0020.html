			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Volunteers of America Sues State: Volunteers of America of Los Angeles Inc.  sued the state for breach of contract, alleging that it botched a planned work  furlough center by failing to award the contract in time. The Los Angeles  Superior Court lawsuit alleges that the charitable organization leased a  Chinatown building at $3,600 a month and renovated it at the urging of the  Department of Corrections.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the DOC was to deliver the operating contract within two  months of Volunteers' pricing proposal. But the DOC did not meet the deadline,  and in the meantime, the city rezoned the property so that it could not be used  for a work furlough program, the suit said. It seeks unspecified general  damages. (Case No. BC013391. Filed Oct. 23, 1990)  </P></p>

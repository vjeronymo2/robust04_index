			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Market hampers Taiwan financial ambitions  -The Emerging Investor Taiwan wants to use its economic might to become a regional financial centre. However having a stock market that is highly restrictive to foreign investment, dominated by insiders and subject to political interference poses a formidable obstacle to such ambitions. The problem has been brought sharply into focus by a recent string of share payments defaults which upset the stock market and sparked accusations of lax regulation and involvement of politicians and officials. 'This kind of event has happened repeatedly. We hope this time the government can institute reforms to prevent it from happening again,' said Mr Daniel Chen, chief economist at ChinaTrust Commercial Bank. 'The authorities need to to re-examine the whole system, to re-examine the regulatory framework to see whether the securities and exchange commission has enough power and tools to monitor and regulate the stock market effectively.' Shares fell by nearly 15 per cent only to rebound 8 per cent last week following the crisis which involved 28 securities houses and a total of TDollars 7.6bn in bounced cheques. On Saturday the market rose almost 2 per cent. Mr Day Linin, chairman of the securities and exchange commission, called on the central bank to relax barriers to foreign investment, arguing that funds managed by overseas institutions had proven to be a force for stability in the market. Foreign investors continued buying heavily into blue chip shares, helping counter the index's slide, despite panic selling by domestic investors. Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the central bank, ruled out lifting ceilings on foreign investment, citing concerns over the effect of capital flows on the exchange rate. Analysts say government officials privately fear a covert influx of 'red' Chinese money and that foreign investors would take short-term profits. Taiwan is one of the biggest stock markets among the emerging economies of Asia with a total market capitalisation of Dollars 209.2bn at the end of September. At that time direct investment by government approved foreign institutions stood at Dollars 4.49bn or 2.15 per cent of total market capitalisation. The central bank imposes a ceiling of Dollars 7.5bn on foreign institutional funds which may be paid into the country for direct investment in local shares. Foreign individuals are barred from investing. As of October 14, Taiwan authorities had approved investment quotas for 76 foreign institutions totalling Dollars 6.44bn, of which Dollars 4.78bn had been taken up. Pending applications amounted to Dollars 3.31bn, mostly awaiting central bank approval. Speculative share trading by associates of Mr Oung Ta-ming, head of the Hualon group and the local market's most notorious stock player, triggered the recent incident. However evidence uncovered so far suggests that as many as thirty legislators, mostly from the ruling party, as well as government officials, may have played a part in the crisis. One of the main problems, according to analysts, is that the SEC, which falls under the ministry of finance, does not have the independence and authority it needs to regulate the stock market effectively. It cannot investigate or prosecute trading irregularities but must rely on the justice ministry's investigation bureau and the courts. And despite the best intentions of securities regulators such as Mr Day, who is widely respected and considered above reproach, investigations can be subject to political interference. 'It wouldn't matter so much if the government here took a hands-off approach, but on paper this is a heavily regulated market,' said a analyst at a foreign securities house. Calls for reform are largely drowned out amid the din of recriminations as political parties seek to discredit one another ahead of elections on December 3. Analysts say that reform is in any case unlikely in the absence of political will on the part of the ruling Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, which directly or indirectly controls much of the country's finance and industry. 'Everyone knows the KMT itself is the biggest insider trader in this market,' said a Taiwanese stock analyst. Furthermore, analysts say, the ruling party is spending vast sums to finance its candidates in elections, which it views as critical to countering the growing power of opposition parties. Some of the funds come directly from KMT coffers but legislators are tacitly encouraged to find their own financing, and the quickest way to make make money is from the stock market. Analysts say Mr Oung was in effect acting as fund manager for politicians, officials and other wealthy individuals who cannot be seen investing in the stock market under their own names. 'Oung Ta-ming is a magician with money. If you give him a dollar one day, he will come back two weeks later with ten dollars,' said a Taiwanese investment banker. The source of Mr Oung's magic touch is the wide and loyal following he has cultivated among the gambling-mad small investors who dominate trading on Taiwan's bourse. At the height of the market in the early 1990s, there were 4m trading accounts out of a population of 20m. Ironically, it was Mr Oung's reputation as the patron saint of the small investor that carried him to victory when he stood for election to parliament two years ago, just after a similar share payment default crisis linked to his group. The advent of foreign investment, first permitted in 1991, is slowly changing the character of the market, analysts say. The foreign-managed funds tend to buy blue chip industrials and avoid overpriced financial issues or speculative shares. Recently domestic investors have taken an interest in those stocks preferred by foreign investors, dubbing them 'foreign concept' stocks. 'Hualon is living in the past,' said Mr Ben Chen, managing director of the Taiwan office of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'They still believe if they ramp share prices high enough retail investors will jump in. But in the past year investors have mostly been pursuing stocks with a good fundamental story.' Analysts believe that as the proportion of institutional investment, be it foreign or domestic, in Taiwan's stock market increases, share prices will be less susceptible to the manipulations of a handful of speculators. It is hoped that small investors will learn from repeated scandals and avoid speculative shares. Meanwhile, the outlook for Taiwan's stock market is positive, marred only by uncertainties surrounding the demise of Deng Xiaoping of China. There are also concerns that both formal and informal lenders will tighten credit in the wake of the recent cheque defaults scandal. Nonetheless, the economy remains strong with economic growth forecast to top 6 per cent this year. Corporate earnings growth for blue chip companies should average 15 per cent in 1995, and in the near term the government is expected to sustain the index leading up to the elections in December.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Friday    Week on week change Stock                          Country   14/10/94     Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Eregli Demir Ve Celik           Turkey    0.1100       0.0229    26.29 Duta Anggada                 Indonesia    1.2420       0.1885    17.90 SM Prime Holdings          Philippines    0.3327       0.0397    13.56 Grupo Financiero Bancomer       Mexico    1.2736       0.1412    12.47 Ssangyong Oil Refining        S.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol, 22 Apr -- The Russian military  delegation has refused to sign any agreements based on the  results of the talks in Sevastopol on a stage by stage  settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue. A member of the  delegation told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that this is due to  an unconstructive stance adopted by the Ukrainian side on  questions relating to the basing of the fleets. In his words,  Russia said it will not agree to the Russian Black Sea Fleet  being deployed in Crimea merely on a temporary basis, or to the  proposal that the headquarters of both the Russian Black Sea  Fleet and of the Ukrainian naval forces being located in  Sevastopol.    It is impossible that the headquarters of the fleets  belonging to two states should be based in one and the same  town, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, said  at a news conference in Sevastopol after the two sides had  completed their dialogue. He said he is dissatisfied with the  results of the talks, where the participants came to an  agreement only with regard to the division of the Fleet.    However, according to Pavel Grachev, the process of dividing  it up cannot start without the question of basing being settled.  The Russian minister considers that Sevastopol should be  Russia's principal base, where no less than 70 percent of its  fleet should be deployed. In addition to Sevastopol, the Black  Sea Fleet is to be located in Balaklava, Feodosia, Kerch, and  Donuzlava. Pavel Grachev rejected the proposals of the  Ukrainian side on the Russian and Ukrainian fleets sharing the  same bases in Sevastopol.    Pavel Grachev flew to Moscow this afternoon without meeting  Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, the defense minster of Ukraine.</p>

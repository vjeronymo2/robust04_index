			<p>BFN     [Text]Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council  delivered here today a speech on the Chinese Government's policy  towards the Hong Kong issue at a luncheon given in his honor by  five local influential organizations. In his speech, Lu  briefed the Hong Kong people on the questions as how the Chinese  Government's policy of "one country, two systems" was formulated  and why it shall be implemented in Hong Kong after 1997. He  reiterated that the Chinese Government's policy of "one country,  two systems" towards the future Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region will remain unchanged for at least 50 years. Lu  elaborated on the contents of the policy of "one country, two  systems". "By `one country, two systems', we mean that the  main body of the country practices socialism, which is the  fundamental system of China, while Hong Kong continues to  practice capitalism, as a supplement to the socialist state," he  said. Therefore, he continued, "when we say there will be no  change in the principle of `one country, two systems,' there are  actually two aspects: the capitalist system of Hong Kong will  remain unchanged, but the fundamental socialist system of the  country will also not change." He pointed out that any attempt  to turn Hong Kong from an economic city into a political city in  order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics is  disastrous for Hong Kong. "The value of Hong Kong to China has  been and will be its economic value," he said. In the last  part of his speech, Lu reassured that the Chinese Government's  policy of letting the Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong and  allowing Hong Kong to enjoy a high degree Of autonomy shall be  adopted in order to put the principle of "one country, two  systems" into practice. He expressed his firm belief that Hong  Kong will remain prosperous with the practice of the "one  country, two systems" policy and the fully implementation of the  basic law. The luncheon was jointly held by the American  Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese General Chamber of  Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of  Hong Kong, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and the Hong  Kong General Chamber of Commerce. Lu Ping arrived here on May  1 to attend a meeting of the preliminary working committee for  the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, the first of its kind ever held in Hong  Kong.</p>

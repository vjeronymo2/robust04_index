			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / The noisy second coming of Ross Perot: Renewed interest in his populism reflects discontent with the US political elite AMERICA certainly knows that Ross Perot can dish it out. The suspicion is now growing that America is about to find out, for the second time in a year, whether the Texan businessman can also take it. If he cannot, then the weary look that comes into President Bill Clinton's eyes when he is asked about Mr Perot, independent candidate for president last year, may change. Now Mr Clinton mostly ducks questions, referring to aides, who also generally duck questions. But the White House is far from alone in determining that public silence is the best policy. Political Washington is running scared of the populist phenomenon who took 19 per cent of the vote in the election last year and is, according to most present polls, as popular a public figure as any in the country. The latest Perotian barrage has been aimed squarely at the president. Some of it has been cruelly funny - his Dollars 10 razor-shave crop contrasted with the presidential perm costing perhaps 20 times as much. But hardly a television morning or evening seems to pass without either a Perot interview or paid 'infomercial' damning the president either as personally unqualified ('you wouldn't figure him higher than middle management') or for advancing bad policies. Over the last two weeks he has suggested that Mr Clinton was contemplating a war in Bosnia to distract from his domestic difficulties, flirting with a national healthcare catastrophe ('every time you look the cost has gone up'), selling US interests out in the Nafta agreement ('the sucking sound of jobs heading south'), and deceiving the public with a wrong-headed approach to cutting the budget deficit by raising taxes. So virulent has been the onslaught on the Democratic president that speculation is now rampant that Mr Perot either is planning another independent candidacy or has it in mind to hijack the Republican party, more feasible now that the other president he loved to denigrate, George Bush, is in retirement in Texas. Discreet conversations with Senator Bob Dole add to this latter impression, even if it may not be on the Minority leader's agenda. Mr Perot himself brushes aside all such questions, repeating the eternal litany that he is only the servant of 'the people'. There is scattered evidence, too, that Mr Perot's grandiosely labelled quasi-political organisation, United We Stand, America, is becoming a grassroots force. Details of its membership (Dollars 15 a head) will not be published until the end of this year but already local chapters stage assorted conferences and talk-ins, which even such heavyweight politicians as the Majority leader, Senator George Mitchell of Maine, find impolitic to ignore (because Maine was Mr Perot's best state last November). Perot-styled candidates, operating so far without his endorsement and, generally, that of UWSA, have not done well in a handful of special elections, especially in his native Texas, though one Republican clone nearly captured a Wisconsin House seat. The Los Angeles mayoral election next month, however, features Richard Riordan, a conservative self-made businessman who talks Perotian. However, while the man stalks the airwaves at will, there are signs that the media, having bloodied Mr Clinton, are gearing up for the sort of scrutiny which got under Mr Perot's notoriously thin skin last year. His withdrawal from the presidential race in July followed negative reporting on his 'Inspector Perot' tendency to investigate the private lives of others; his late re-entry with only a month to go mostly avoided a second wave of hostile coverage. A growing compendium of media reports note disarray in UWSA chapters across the country, with leading local 'volunteers' at odds with the Dallas-based head office, described by several to the New York Times this week as 'dictatorial, secretive and duplicitous'. Newsweek magazine also questioned the secretiveness of 'a carefully crafted legal entity - a not-for-profit 'civil league' - that allows Mr Perot to raise funds and act the role of undeclared candidate without having to disclose his list of contributors'. ABC TV's Nightline, which collaborated with Newsweek on the Perot investigation, last week subjected several of the volunteers to a barrage of questions. The thrust of the replies was that many felt he was authoritarian by nature. Even former Perot intimates are now publicly sour. Mr Orson Swindle, nominal campaign chief in the run-up to the election, now insists Mr Perot and his tight circle in Dallas 'encouraged everybody to be heard and didn't have the capacity to listen'. Mr Ed Rollins, campaign guru in the first springtime run at the presidency, will say publicly and privately that he now thinks Mr Perot is 'the most dangerous man in America'. Even those who still give him credit for wakening the public to the magnitude of the budget deficit now think he is all blue smoke, mirrors and meaningless charts. A Washington Post editorial at the weekend, bemoaning a lack of substance, complained about his 'sweeping generalisation and slash-and-burn rhetoric'. Critical attention is also being drawn to the pattern of Mr Perot's courting of individual media outlets. If irritated by a tough interviewer (Mr Bryant Gumbel of NBC's Today) or a critical programme (last week's Nightline) he switches his attention to different networks and programmes. With his money and their need for revenues, appearances, paid-for and free, are easily scheduled. In one sense the second coming of Ross Perot, as with any pure populist, is a reflection of public discontent with the management of the nation by its establishment elite, now uncertainly led by Mr Clinton but also featuring an invitingly fractious Congress and a national media inclined to go head-hunting. But to endure he will have to know what it is like not only to chase but also to be hunted. Even Achilles, a phenomenon from a different age, had a fatal weakness.</p>

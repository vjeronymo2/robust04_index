			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PLANS FOR TENT JAIL ON NAVY SITE ARE DROPPED;  </P> <P> FACILITIES: THE PORT HUENEME PROPERTY IS EARMARKED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE  SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MAY SEEK ANOTHER LOCATION TO HOUSE RECREATIONAL DRUG  USERS.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has scrapped plans to build a "tent  city" jail for recreational drug users at the Naval Construction Battalion  Center in Port Hueneme because the Navy wants to use the location for  affordable housing, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department officials said they will seek another site for the  facility -- if the project receives federal financing. The county is asking the  Justice Department for $7.2 million to help support a facility for as many as  320 minor drug offenders, who would be housed in four large tents.  </P> <P> Last spring, Sheriff John V. Gillespie proposed building the encampment as part  of a new drug-enforcement policy he developed with Dist. Atty. Michael D.  Bradbury.  </P> <P> The new policy calls for stepping up efforts to curb minor drug offenses and  reduce the demand for drugs. According to Sheriff's Department officials,  jailing prominent citizens -- such as teachers, bankers and lawyers -- caught  using or possessing small amounts of drugs would deter others from using them.  </P> <P> Despite the loss of the Navy site, the project did not suffer a setback,  Gillespie said. Department officials said the Honor Farm near Ojai and the  proposed jail facility between Ventura and Santa Paula could be used, pending  approval of federal funding.  </P> <P> "We would certainly like to go ahead with it," Commander Bob Brooks said. "It  is a strong priority of the whole law enforcement community. . . . But with all  the federal budget problems, we are waiting."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Gillespie said he still believes the tent city concept is an  "excellent one."  </P> <P> The program is expected to cost $13.6 million in its first year, with the  county providing a portion of the funding. Much of the program's budget --  about $9 million -- would pay for personnel. Under the plan, 71 new county  positions would be added.  </P> <P> The program would concentrate on counseling and rehabilitation. But the inmates  would be taken daily to public areas such as beaches and parks to perform  maintenance work.  </P> <P> Gillespie had asked Navy officials last spring if the county could place the  facility at the battalion center, where they could use the land for free. But  the request raised a chorus of protests from residents in the area. A group of  Port Hueneme and Oxnard homeowners gathered more than 700 signatures of  residents who vowed to fight the plan.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, base officials said Monday that the secretary of the Navy recently  encouraged base officials to seek outside investors to help build affordable  housing on the bases.  </P> <P> As a result, Port Hueneme officials targeted the site as a possible location  for housing projects.  </P> <P> "We think it would be unwise to tie up this acreage at the present time when it  could otherwise be considered by a successful proposer for construction of  badly needed affordable housing for our junior enlisted personnel," Navy Capt.  R.J. Pearson III said in a statement.  </P> <P> "Because we don't anticipate that we will have successfully resolved all of our  housing options for at least the next year or two, the Sheriff's Department has  withdrawn its proposal."  </P> <P> Brooks said the Sheriff's Department was disappointed to learn of the Navy's  objections.  </P> <P> "We felt that it was a situation where the county and the Navy could have come  out winners," Brooks said.  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Quebecor ends offer talks with Hunterprint Quebecor, the Canadian publishing and forestry group, has ended its discussions with Hunterprint, the lossmaking UK printer. The Montreal-based newspaper publisher and commercial printer, announced last month that it was considering making an offer for debt-laden Hunterprint. In a brief statement yesterday Hunterprint's board said it understood Quebecor had decided not to proceed, 'as a result of a change in its strategic plans.' The statement added that Hunterprint was trading in line with the projections it had supplied to its bankers when it sold Hardy Printers, its only active subsidiary, to a management buy-out team for Pounds 1.85m in early August.</p>

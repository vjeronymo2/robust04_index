			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Export rise behind growth at Highland STRONG GROWTH in exports of Famous Grouse whisky drove Highland Distilleries' first half operating profits ahead 13 per cent to Pounds 13.3m. Famous Grouse exports during the six months to February 28 rose 11 per cent in volume and 21 per cent in value. Since the alliance with Remy Cointreau in 1990, which greatly extended distribution of Highland's leading brand, exports have increased from 25 per cent to 38 per cent of total sales, with significant growth in France, Sweden and Greece. Interim pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 21.2m, with Pounds 1.4m of the increase coming from the underlying business and Pounds 5.1m from a change to equity accounting of the company's 35.4 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky blender. Earnings per share benefited from the accounting change, rising from 7.7p to 11.2p. The interim dividend is raised to 1.6p (1.45p). Turnover advanced from Pounds 96.8m to Pounds 98.3m in what Mr John Goodwin, chairman, described as 'difficult trading conditions.' Sales of new malt whisky fell 21 per cent and mature whisky volumes were also lower, reducing profits by about Pounds 1m. Mr Goodwin said that volumes were likely to be 23 per cent lower this year and to remain flat in 1994. Highland's distilleries were working at 40 per cent of capacity this year compared to 50 per cent last year. Famous Grouse maintained its premium price position in the UK market at the expense of some volume, but improved market share from 13.7 per cent to 14 per cent. Because of exchange and interest rate uncertainties, the company repaid at an additional cost of Pounds 4.9m, a Pounds 30m loan, raised in French francs in 1990 to help finance its investment in Orpar, the Remy holding company. Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 2.8m.</p>

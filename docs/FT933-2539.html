			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Delors pushes for monetary 'fortress Europe' MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, is pressing for a monetary 'fortress Europe' to deter US and other non-EC speculators from targeting currencies inside the European Monetary System. After days of confusion, senior EC officials have confirmed that Mr Delors favours selective measures such as temporary capital controls on foreigners engaged in short-term speculation - such as Mr George Soros, the New York-based investor. Mr Delors called for collective EC action against speculators on Wednesday during a bitter and at times emotional speech to the European parliament in Strasbourg, in which he attacked 'Anglo-Saxon' critics of European Monetary Union and branded currency speculators as 'golden boys'. Many interpreted Mr Delors' remarks as advocating at least partial reimposition of capital controls. The president's chief spokesman, however, said the Commission president had been misunderstood and that the importance of the speech had been overestimated because it had 'only' been delivered to the European parliament. It emerged yesterday, though, that senior EC officials were privately shocked by Mr Delors' comments, since they left the impression that he sided with a minority of French and other continental commentators who have blamed the EMS collapse on a currency plot by 'Anglo-Saxons'. Other officials remain unimpressed at Mr Delors' suggestion of collective EC action to impose a so-called 'safeguard' clause allowing all member states to introduce temporary controls to deal with adverse capital movements affecting their currency and monetary policies. Senior Brussels officials emphasised yesterday that Mr Delors was not advocating reimposition of capital controls within the single European market, but was interested in targeting investors engaged in short-term speculation, operating from New York or Tokyo. 'Delors is drawing a distinction between what happens inside the EC and what happens outside,' said one. That interpretation looks like a direct threat to money market fund operators such as Mr Soros, who made Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) profit betting on a sterling devaluation last year. It is certain to provoke charges in the UK, Germany, Japan and the US - all of which favour the freedom of movement of currencies and are sceptical that governments can regulate the Dollars 1,000bn daily foreign exchange market - that Mr Delors wants to erect a monetary 'fortress Europe'. Officials close to Mr Delors defended the president's other chief suggestion to defend the EMS: a tightening of the rules governing short-term speculation, possibly by requiring that banks lending money to speculators should be required to deposit an equivalent amount at the relevant central bank. In his Strasbourg speech, which coincided with the first anniversary of Black Wednesday, when the pound and lira were forced out of the ERM, Mr Delors said Anglo-Saxons were dreaming if they believed that 'paradise' would have arrived sooner without fixed exchange rates between EC currencies. 'We should not under-estimate the effect of the past two or three years, when there has been this movement of ideas led by the Anglo-Saxons condemning as unrealistic or dangerous the objective of a single currency,' he said.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Text] Ulaanbaatar April 1 TASS -- Co-chairmen of the joint  Russo-Mongolian commission on checking the border between the  two countries met on Thursday to discuss verification and  demarcation issues.    The border is several thousand kilometers long, and only the  last 500 kilometers now await demarcation. The commission  members are to define more accurately geographical coordinates  of the remaining stretch and to legalize relevant documents.    We have agreed on all the technicalities, distributed the  tasks and confirmed mutual readiness to accomplish the  programme, Luvsandorjin Mundagbator, chairman of the Mongolian  delegation, told ITAR-TASS on Thursday.    We took on an important task: We must complete checking the  state border in 1995 and to report to the respective parliaments  about the results by the end of the same year, he said.</p>

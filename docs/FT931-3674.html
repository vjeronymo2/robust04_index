			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Election '93: Uphill struggle on the stump - David Buchan finds voters in Normandy griping about the EC UNDER normal circumstances, Mr Pascal Lamy, head of Mr Jacques Delors's private office, would have been in Hong Kong this weekend, scaling the heights of international diplomacy. As the European Commission president's 'sherpa', he would have been helping to prepare for the Group of Seven's June summit in Tokyo. Instead, Mr Lamy was in deepest Normandy, campaigning as the Socialist party candidate in the Eure department's fifth electoral district, but virtually certain to taste defeat in the elections for the French National Assembly next Sunday and on March 28. Why is he making his first bid for election when the prospects for the Socialists are so bad? 'Precisely because times are so terrible for the Socialists,' says Mr Lamy. When the incumbent Socialist deputy decided not to run, Mr Lamy, who has family roots in the region, was asked to take his place. His quixotic gesture will earn him credit in whatever is left of the Socialist party. But the candidate readily acknowledges his obvious handicaps. After eight years in Brussels, he is regarded as the outsider Eurocrat running against local politicians. All Socialist candidates have an uphill struggle in this election, but Mr Lamy is a natural target for complaints about the European Community in general and of the reform of its Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) in particular, in this half-rural constituency which voted 56 per cent against the Maastricht treaty in the referendum last September. Mr Jean-Claude Asphe, hard-line Gaullist RPR mayor of Vernon and expected to win the parliamentary seat, makes the most of this: 'We need a quick revision of the CAP reform to be able to present a very tough position in the Gatt (farm trade) negotiations with the Americans. These negotiations cannot be left to EC officials, but to elected politicians.' On Friday, Mr Edouard Balladur, the opposition's favourite candidate to be France's next prime minister, arrived in Vernon to rub in the point in: 'We cannot accept the CAP reform; we cannot accept the set-aside of so much land from production. France is the world's number two agricultural exporter, and there are not so many strong points in our economy that we can afford to ignore any of them.' The RPR leader goes on to demand 're-nationalisation of part of the CAP, so that all is not decided far from us (in Brussels).' For a French leader to urge even a partial break-up of the CAP strikes Mr Lamy as nonsense: 'I can imagine John Major (UK prime minister) calling for this but not Mr Balladur, because France has been a major beneficiary of the CAP.' However, he supports Mr Balladur's call for French farmers to get more compensation for price cuts and set-aside requirements. 'There are technical flaws which need correcting,' Mr Lamy says, because the yield of farmers of the Eure, and therefore their claim to compensation for not producing, has been under-estimated by Brussels. In more general terms, Mr Lamy detects a pronounced swing towards protectionism in France. 'France has never had a tradition of economic openness,' he points out in a living-room meeting with Socialist activists at Les Andelys. Protectionism in France is 'like a rheumatic ache - it always gets worse in bad weather', like the country's current recession. Like most other Socialist candidates, Mr Lamy prefers to find such domestic remedies as work-sharing to reduce France's jobless total, near 3m. The conservative opposition still has to overcome serious internal divisions if it is to agree on a more aggressive external policy in government. The rift over Maastricht is as evident as ever inside the RPR. Mr Asphe, among the 70 per cent of the party's rank and file which voted against the treaty, says he is still dead against this form of European union. Yet it was Mr Balladur, as finance minister in 1987, who first proposed a European central bank. At Vernon on Friday, Mr Balladur smoothly proclaimed there was party consensus that 'France should co-operate very closely with its partners, but remain master of its destiny.' Whether such words can continue to paper over the RPR's cracks may soon be tested in government.</p>

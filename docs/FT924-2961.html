			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Councils may pull out of YT REPRESENTATIVES of English local authorities including London and the six metropolitan areas have warned Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, that they may stop participating in Youth Training. Since 1988, local authorities have been among the main providers of places on the scheme, the main training programme for 16 to 19-year-olds, often heavily subsidising them. Now they say the recession and government curbs on spending will force them to curtail the scheme. They believe the recession has invalidated many of the assumptions behind YT.</p>

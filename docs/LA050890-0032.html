			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFSHORE DRILLING CONTROVERSY AND MEETING PETROLEUM NEEDS  </P> <P> Ask a class for the definition of the word cowardice, and I supply the answer:  The Times' editorial board.  </P> <P> The April 27 editorial asks "Want to Be Held Hostage Again?" But in the  cowardly reply, you say not a single word about either increased domestic  production or more nuclear power. Either or both of these will most certainly  reduce our scary future, but you are afraid to mention either for fear of  offending certain people.  </P> <P> Shame. How can you claim to speak for all the people when you permit the  calamity howlers (and I do mean howl) to deter you from speaking honestly?  </P> <P> Is it that tough to be honest?  </P> <P> EDWARD H.

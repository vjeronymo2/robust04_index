			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / This Week: Film/Video World peace is bad news for world cinema. As yesterday's villains become today's peacemakers - sometimes even as the films hit the screen (see Tommy Lee Jones' Irish terrorist in the recent Blown Away) - where do Hollywood and Harrison Ford turn? After Russians in The Hunt For Red October and the IRA in Patriot Games, the new Tom Clancy page-to-screen romp is Clear And Present Danger. Colombian drug barons are the baddies - no danger of detente there - and the action is brisk, if not intellectually stretching, with Ford in prime form. If you want art not action, there is Smoking/No Smoking. In a corner of a French studio that is forever England, director Alain Resnais gives us his five-hour, two-film version of Alan Ayckbourn's playlet series, Intimate Exchanges. Warm to the prettily eccentric visuals: France's idea of a seaside public school is out of Fragonard by Osbert Lancaster. But be warned: the film is also Very Long. You could stay at home by your VCR and see something short about British boarding-school life. The Terence Davies Trilogy, made in the late 1970s and now on video, is three dour, searing vignettes - barely making feature length together - about the agony and occasional ecstasy of institutional growing up. From the future director of Distant Voices, Still Lives, here is a calling card in black-and-white, with all the pained, pithy eloquence to come. In brief: Two National Film Theatre treats for September. One is a neatly-timed Alain Resnais season, giving us the Maitre's oeuvre from Last Year In Marienbad to this year in Ayckbournland. The other is a round-up of that other great time-juggler, Britain's Nicolas Roeg. Performance, Don't Look Now, Eureka ..All the fun of the subliminal flashback and eyeblink jump-cut, and of the once most inventive mind in British cinema.</p>

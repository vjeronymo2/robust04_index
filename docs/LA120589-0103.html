			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: GOLDEN WEST BUILDS CONFIDENCE UP NORTH  </P> <P> The Golden West College women's basketball team is off to an impressive start,  but that has happened before.  </P> <P> Golden West was the top-ranked team for most of the 1986-87 and 1987-88  seasons, but didn't win a state title either time, being eliminated in the  semifinals each year. Golden West was ranked in the top five last season, but  lost in the first round of the playoffs.  </P> <P> But this past weekend, Golden West (10-0) took what co-coaches Dick and Dave  Stricklin hope is a big step toward doing better in the playoffs.  </P> <P> The Rustlers won the four-day, 16-team Visalia tournament at College of the  Sequoias, site of the state tournament, which will be played the first weekend  in March.  </P> <P> In Sunday's final, Golden West defeated Sequoias, 63-54. It was the first loss  for Sequoias (9-1), traditionally one of the stronger teams from Northern  California.  </P> <P> Of course, the Stricklins -- Dick and his son, Dave -- know their team has a  long way to go to make it back to the state tournament, but a little success on  the floor before then won't hurt.  </P> <P> "It was a good deal for us to do well there," Dave said. "Several of the top  teams were there and it helps to build our confidence in that gym against  them."  </P> <P> Golden West was led by sophomore forward Claudette Jackson, who scored 20  points in the final game and was voted the most valuable player of the  tournament. Jackson leads Golden West with 16.6 points and 11.5 rebounds a  game.  </P> <P> Golden West is averaging 93.7 points a game thanks largely to the fast break.  Golden West is giving up only 63.4 points a game.  </P> <P> Men's basketball: Rancho Santiago and Cypress have had impressive starts this  season. During the weekend, the Dons (10-0) won their Tip-Off tournament and  the Grossmont tournament.  </P> <P> Cypress (6-O) has won its own tournament and will take part in the Golden West  tournament, which begins Wednesday with Cypress playing Glendale at 6 p.m. and  Cerritos playing Riverside at 8 p.m. On Thursday, Antelope Valley plays San  Diego Mesa at 6 p.m. and Golden West plays Citrus at 8 p.m. Friday's semifinals  will be played at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., and the championship game will be held  Saturday at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Wrestling: Cypress qualified seven wrestlers, Rancho Santiago six, and Golden  West four for the Southern California regional tournaments this past weekend.  </P> <P> The top three finishers in each weight division advance to the finals, which  will be Friday and Saturday at Fresno College.  </P> <P> Sam Lopez of Cypress and Eric LeGarreta of Golden West head the list, both  winning at 118 pounds in different regionals. The two are the favorites for the  state title. LeGarreta holds the edge, having defeated Lopez twice.  </P> <P> Also qualifying for Cypress: Greg Monteith (167), Ken Stegall (190), Brian  Bertrand (126), Doug Haring (142), Mike Robles (177) and heavyweight Trevor  Hargrave.  </P> <P> Qualifying for Rancho Santiago: Marc Aguirre (177), Rusty Espinoza (142), Pat  Kinney (126), Jeff Combs (143), Ryan Owings (158) and heavyweight Chris  Yagelener.  </P> <P> For Golden West: LeGarreta, Chris Shaul (167), Phil Meyer (190) and Russell  Corbin (177).  </P> <P> Community College Notes  </P> <P> Since this was the first year women played for a state soccer title, it's also  the first time a college has won both men's and women's titles. The Orange  Coast women's team defeated Cosumnes River of Sacramento, 1-0, Saturday at El  Camino. It was the 100th victory for the eight-year program and Coach Barbara  Bond. Orange Coast is 100-30-12 under Bond. The men's team defeated Fresno  City, 3-2, Saturday at El Camino.  </P></p>

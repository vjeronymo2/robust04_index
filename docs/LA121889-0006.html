			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN BLOC AND GORBACHEV  </P> <P> It's good to read something other than euphoric nonsense ("Bush, a Giving Guy,  Gets Nothing," by Patrick Buchanan, Opinion, Dec. 10) about the Malta summit.  As long as the Russians hold 11,000 warheads at our head, they can't be counted  as friends, no matter the rhetoric.  </P> <P> The Germans and the Russians have done more than any other peoples to cause  death and destruction in the 20th Century. Before we feel glee over the loss of  power of the communists in East Germany, before we praise the possibility of  German reunification, before we call Mikhail Gorbachev or any other Russian  friend, remember the basic casualty figure of World War II: 50 million dead.  That figure doesn't include the deaths of World War I or the Stalinist purges  of the 1950s.  </P> <P> JIM REAGAN  </P> <P> Norwalk  </P></p>

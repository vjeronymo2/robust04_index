			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent A. Peslyak; from the </F> "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Sergey] Yushenkov, [chairman of State Duma  Committee for Defense], said that comparison of the systems of  civilian control over the armed forces in the two countries  [United States and Russia] shows that our system is not  developed.    Russian Foreign Minister [Andrey Kozyrev] said that it is  not  democratic to lay down the condition that Russia should  unilaterally accept the obligation to end arms supplies to  certain regions in the country before talks can start. We are  for stability without conditions being laid down for one side.  The Karabakh conflict, which has destabilized the situation in  the Caucasus, creates problems for us on our southern border,  yet some people abroad see us as neo-imperialists here, rather  than as peacekeepers, and even regard Russia's efforts as being  opposed to those of the CSCE.</p>

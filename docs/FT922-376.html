			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Cookery: Soft and sybaritic FRUIT IS one of the great pleasures of summer eating. A scarlet trio (cherries on the stalk, unhulled strawberries and frosted redcurrants) provide an easy and lovely finale to lunch or dinner with bowls of fromage frais, whipped cream or yoghurt for dipping. I am also very fond of a scarlet compote of fruits in season: raw redcurrants, stoned cherries, thickly sliced strawberries and whole raspberries barely moistened with freshly squeezed orange and lemon juice (two parts orange to one part lemon) and a sifting of sugar. Toss everything together gently and leave in a cool place to macerate for about an hour, and toss again just before serving. The fruits will gleam like garnets and some of their juices will have mingled with the citrus and sugar to make a deliciously light syrup. A compote like this is just right for partnering coeur a la creme or snowy mounds of soft fresh cheeses. For a fatless alternative, serve the compote with a slice of angel cake or spooned over rosy slices of water melon. As for puddings proper, the best known and best loved for this time of year is, appropriately, summer pudding. Blackcurrant and gooseberry fool are probably joint second favourite, but others deserve an occasional airing. CHERRY BAKEWELL (serves 6-8) Generally I prefer cherries raw rather than cooked - and stoning them is a tedious little chore - but this way of cooking them is very good indeed. Unusually, this is a flan that is almost better a day or even two days after baking. Other fruits can be used in place of cherries. Raspberries are especially good. Shortcrust pastry made with 6-8 oz flour and aromatized with the finely grated zest of an orange;  3/4 lb ripe dessert cherries;  1/4 lb butter; 1/4 lb caster sugar;  1/4 lb freshly ground almonds; 1 teaspoon kirsch; 2 large eggs. Use the pastry to line a shallow 9in-10 inch fluted flan tin with a removeable base. Blind bake it and let it become cold. Stone the cherries and refrigerate them until needed. Dice the butter and barely melt it in a small pan over low heat. Away from the heat, stir in the sugar, then the ground almonds, kirsch and lightly beaten eggs, in that order. Tip the chilled cherries into the flan, spreading them evenly, and pour on the almond mixture. Bake this pudding for 35-40 minutes at 400`F (200`C) gas mark 6 until the fruit is hot and the topping is puffed up and golden. Serve it cold, with or without softly whipped kirsch flavoured cream. RASPBERRY AND REDCURRANT PUDDING (serves 6-8) This quick and easy variation of mine on the classic summer pudding made its first appearance on these pages a few years ago. In view of many requests, here it is again. 5 or 6 x  3/4 inch thick slices of good stale bread; 2 lb or more mixed raspberries and redcurrants; sugar; a little orange and lemon juice (optional). If, like me, you fail to bake or shop sufficiently far ahead for your loaf to go stale of its own accord, speed up the process by cutting fresh bread into cubes and spreading them out on a baking tray or cooling rack. Leave in a sunny spot, in a warm kitchen or in the airing cupboard for an hour or two, just turning the cubes occasionally, until the bread is somewhat dessicated. Put about half the redcurrants into a shallow pan with a tablespoon or two of cold water. Sprinkle a little sugar between layers. Cover with just under half the raspberries, adding sugar as before. Put on the lid and cook over a low flame until the fruit is warm and tender and the scarlet juices are flowing freely. Shake the pan gently, rather than stir, to encourage even cooking and minimise crushing the fruit. Slide the contents of the pan into a sieve placed over a bowl to separate fruit and juices. Taste the juices and add extra sugar or maybe a squeeze of orange or lemon. Drop the well staled cubes of bread into the liquid and toss to stain and flavour them. Sugar and warm the remaining redcurrants and raspberries as before, but this time barely warm them so they retain their shape really well. Pile the fruit-stained bread into a pyramid on a serving dish, scattering the fruits between layers (the slightly squashed berries and the better looking ones mixed together but save a good portion of the best fruits till the end for a decorative finish). Serve cold or while slightly warm and fragrant, with softly whipped cream, creme fraiche, yoghurt or fromage frais. RASPBERRY CHARLOTTE (serve 8-10) This looks pretty tied with a ribbon in the Russian manner. Stick candles on top and you have a birthday cake with a difference. Tayberries or loganberries can be used instead of raspberries, or blackberries or mulberrries in autumn. 1 lb raspberries; 6 oz unsalted butter, at room temperature;  1/4 lb vanilla or caster sugar;  1/4 lb freshly ground almonds; the finely grated zest and juice of 2 large oranges; the juice of half a lemon; 1/2 pt double cream; 6-7 oz sponge finger biscuits. Beat the butter until pale and creamy. Add the sugar and beat again until fluffy and light. Mix the orange and lemon juices together and pour 3 fl oz onto the butter cream. Add the finely grated orange zest and the ground almonds and blend well. Whip the cream and fold the mixture into it. Choose a 2-2 1/2 pt charlotte mould (or a souffle dish or any other straight sided container of the same capacity that is 3 1/2 -4 inches deep). Line the base with a circle of greaseproof paper. Spread one-third of the orange and almond butter cream over it. Cover with half the fruit, pressing it lightly into the cream. Repeat the cream and raspberry layers and finish with the remaining cream. Cover with greaseproof paper, put a small plate on top, add 2 lb weights and refrigerate for at least eight hours until firmly set. Loosen the pudding with a wet, round-bladed knife and unmould it onto a chilled plate. Dip the unsugared backs of the sponge fingers, one by one, into the remaining citrus juice. Shake off excess and stick them, upright, round the sides of the pudding to make a castellated wall. Decorate with extra berries and return the pudding to the fridge until almost ready to serve. (If left at room temperature for long the filling will soften and the castle may collapse as you cut it.) Serve the charlotte alone or with a puree of sieved raspberries to sauce it.</p>

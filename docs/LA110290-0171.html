			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACCOUNTING PARTNERS LIABLE IN LINCOLN CASE  </P> <P> A federal judge overseeing civil lawsuits relating to the failure of Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan ruled Thursday that the partners in three major accounting  firms are individually responsible for any damage awards that investors may  win.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby in Phoenix certified as class-action  defendants the partners of Arthur Young &amp; Co., Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.  and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. Only partners with the firms when they represented  American Continental Corp. -- roughly from 1984 to April, 1989 -- are included.  </P> <P> Arthur Young and Touche Ross have since merged with separate firms and are now  called Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche.  </P> <P> American Continental, which owned Irvine-based Lincoln, went bankrupt in April,  1989, and regulators seized the S&amp;L. Thousands of investors lost more than  $250 million from American Continental's collapse, and the thrift's failure is  expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> Bilby's decision puts at risk the assets of nearly 4,000 individual partners at  the three firms, giving plaintiffs -- many of whom lost their life savings in  American Continental bonds -- another avenue to recoup their investments.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers contend that the ruling was unnecessary because partners always  are liable for a partnership's debts, including any judgments. "I don't think  it really changes a thing," said Stuart L. Kadison of Los Angeles, a lawyer for  Arthur Andersen. "They still have to win a case against Arthur Andersen for  liability."  </P> <P> But the bondholders' attorney sought to make the partners defendants  individually because the insurance coverage available to the three accounting  firms would not cover all claims made in the cases.  </P> <P> The accounting firms are among a host of defendants sued in 17 class actions  consolidated in Bilby's court. The suits contend that American Continental's  former chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., with the help of other defendants and  politicians, perpetrated a securities scheme that defrauded bondholders.  </P> <P> Among that group are more than 17,000 small investors who bought nearly $200  million in bonds through Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches.  </P></p>

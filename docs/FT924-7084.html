			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / National Power ahead in spite of decline in demand NATIONAL POWER, Britain's largest electricity generator, increased interim pre-tax profits by 10 per cent in spite of half a percentage point drop in total electricity demand, the first fall for more than 10 years. The improvement to Pounds 201m from Pounds 182m was accompanied by a 10 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 3.3p per share. It reflected cost reductions including a 17 per cent cut in salaries during the period. Yesterday's figures were the first in the electricity industry's interim results season which will show above average profit increases. The figures are bound to fuel criticism that the electricity industry was overly protected by the government on privatisation two years ago, an issue which has recently become more sensitive because of the coal mining pit closures inquiry. Mr John Baker, National Power chief executive, also released figures which will enable an assessment of the amount of money being paid by electricity consumers as a result of long-term contracts between British Coal and the generators priced to bolster the coal industry. He said that over the past three years National Power had paid Pounds 1.7bn more for British coal under long-term contracts than it would have paid had it been buying at the world market price, all of which was passed on to the consumer. The figure for last year was Pounds 480m. On that basis one analyst estimated the total subsidy paid by UK consumers through electricity generator sales was Pounds 750m last year. Mr Baker said National Power hoped new agreements could be concluded with British Coal for further long-term contracts and said there was no reason why these could not be concluded before the government's forthcoming energy review. Although National Power has agreed contract terms with British Coal they cannot be signed until all 12 regional electricity companies agree back-to-back terms to take the electricity. Mr Baker said that if the deals were concluded before the end of the review they could be supplemented by additional contracts if the government decided a larger market for British mined coal should be sustained. The figures were largely in line with City expectations. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 23</p>

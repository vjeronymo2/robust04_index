			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Japanese coalition split on priorities DIVISIONS appeared yesterday in Japan's coalition government, as Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, was told by a coalition partner not to be distracted by economic and foreign policy at the expense of political reform. Mr Kazuo Aichi, director of policy for the Japan Renewal party (JRP), one of the seven coalition parties, said the government had promised to complete a reform of the electoral system by the end of this year, and Mr Hosokawa must devote his energies to this cause. 'The cabinet was formed to introduce political reforms. I don't think we have the time to deal with other issues,' said Mr Aichi, replying to a question on what changes in economic policy will be made in coming months. His answer reflects the difference in emphasis between Mr Hosokawa and the JRP, formed by defectors from the Liberal Democratic party, who see the present coalition as having a mandate only to introduce electoral changes. Some JRP officials say the coalition is intended to be temporary and oppose the growing ambitions of Mr Hosokawa to deregulate the economy, confront Japan's war history, and discuss a fine-tuning of US relations. Mr Aichi suggested that Mr Hosokawa should abandon plans to address the United Nations later this month, and spend his time thinking about political reform. The prime minister is planning to speak on foreign policy matters. The joint leader of the JRP, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former backroom operator at the LDP, made clear that he does not expect the coalition to have a long life by proposing that his party work towards the creation of a two-party system. 'This (the coalition) is not the final form. The establishment of the coalition was one step toward breaking up collusive politics, in which politicians lie and yet manage to get away with skirting responsibility,' Mr Ozawa said. However, Mr Ozawa said the coalition should attempt to end the practice of permitting bureaucrats to answer questions in parliament on behalf of cabinet ministers, who are often not well enough prepared to discuss their portfolio. The coalition parties generally agree that parliamentary rules should be changed to encourage debate. Meanwhile, an independent MP was indicted yesterday for misrepresenting personal details during an election campaign for the Upper House. Mr Shoji Shinma, 58, a former radio personality, claimed that he studied at prestigious Meiji University, but allegedly only took an entrance exam and failed to gain admission.</p>

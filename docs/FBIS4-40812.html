			<p>BFN     [Text] The Committee for International Affairs discussed  the situation on the Korean peninsula at the Russian State Duma  today. Son Sung-pil, the North Korean ambassador to Russia,  spoke to deputies.    [Correspondent Ivan Trefilov] North Korea will meet war with  war, and the specific measures will depend on the particular  sanctions that the world community takes against the republic,  the North Korean diplomat said. At the same time, the DPRK is  willing to come to talks at any time and to settle the nuclear  problem peacefully. In this connection, North Korea has  manifested some interest in the proposal by the Russian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs for an international conference to be held on  the nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula. However, if the  conference is intended to bring pressure to bear, the DPRK will  not be able to agree to this, the North Korean ambassador  stressed.    In the diplomat's view, there has been some progress in  settling the nuclear problem since the visit to the DPRK by  former U.S. President Carter. The American visitor handed over  an official U.S. proposal: the abandonment of sanctions; the  supply to North Korea of light water reactors; and a third round  of U.S.-DPRK talks. In return for this, the DPRK must retain  international monitoring at its nuclear facilities.    In the view of the North Korean diplomat, this proposal  could  form the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula.    Ivan Trefilov, for Ekho Moskvy at the State Duma.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (7): More will own shares / Assessing the stock market THE ISTANBUL Stock Exchange (ISE), Turkey's only one, plans to move next year from the building which used to house the company Eros, producing underwear, to modern premises with fully computerised facilities. The move is necessary because, although it is a comparatively small entity, with the shares in 143 companies being traded in October, the ISE is facing challenges that reflect the severe demands of the government's privatisation programme and a desire on the part of brokers to spread share ownership. The genealogy of the ISE stretches back to the Dersaadet Stock Exchange in the 19th century, when it was the country's most organised exchange. The Capital Market Board was established in 1982. Regulations governing the establishment of the ISE were approved by the government in October 1984. It opened late in 1985, and began operations the following year. The Interbank Market was initiated in February 1986, the Foreign Exchange Market in August 1988, the Gold Market in March 1989. The ISE's opening to international investors permitted free repatriation of dividends, and initial investment and capital gains were allowed. Taxes on capital gains were suspended. But foreign investment has still to take off. The Securities Market was established in June 1991. In May, amendments were introduced to the Capital Markets law, which aimed at providing greater investor protection against insider trading. These changes were intended to encourage local institutional investment and to boost liquidity on the ISE. In July, the government introduced tax reforms to revive (from January 1993) market activity, by giving encouragement to investors through tax exemptions, and to companies considering equity flotations. The daily average volume of trade in shares has increased considerably in the past five years - from Dollars 417,000 in 1988 to Dollars 3.2m in 1989, and over Dollars 34m by the end of 1991 (Dollars 37.8m January-September 1992). The total trading value rose from Dollars 16m in 1986 to Dollars 8.5bn in 1991 (Dollars 7bn in the first eight months of this year). The number of shares traded rose over the same periods from 3m to 4.5m (8.9m during January-September 1992). The major surge in activity was between 1989 and 1990, when annual trading volume rose from Dollars 818m to Dollars 5.9bn and the number of companies traded from 76 to 110. The ISE index - 100 in January 1986 - hit a peak of 5,384.48 in July 1990, and stood at 3,894.63 in the middle of last month. The growth in the capital markets is reflected by the fact that, while the ratio of stock market rights issues to annual gross domestic savings in the economy was 1.5 per cent in 1989, it had reached an estimated 8.1 per cent in 1991. However, Turkey's domestic capital markets have been dominated by government debt, with the result that private companies rely almost entirely on bank debt for financing. But while the ISE may have grown in real terms six-fold since 1990, this has largely been accounted for by the introduction in April of a second board for bonds, which effectively meant government paper. But there have been major fluctuations - notably in October last year, coinciding with the general election - to the extent that the Capital Markets Board felt the need to issue a new decree to discourage short-selling as a result of heavy daily speculative trading. The market recovered after the election, but broader price indices over the past two years indicate the extent that the ISE - hit by inflation and the depreciation of the Turkish lira against the dollar - is one of the more under-performing markets among developing countries, and one which, in spite of legislation, is still not attractive to foreign investors. Another factor affecting the market negatively is the trading volume of public-sector securities, which make up about 80 per cent of the total trading volume of the capital markets. The Turkish authorities - as recently as the spring of this year - were hoping that a growing number of institutional players on the ISE would reduce the market's volatility. Euromoney wrote that: 'Material produced by securities house Global Securities shows the wild fluctuations in price/earnings (p/e) ratios for the 140 stocks on the exchange. In September 1989 . . . the index p/e was 9.6. In 1990, the index went through an extraordinary roller-coaster ride, with p/es reaching 30.9 at its peak in September. Indeed, for a period between the end of 1989 and the third quarter of 1990, Istanbul was the world's best performing index. The Gulf war brought the index back to 1989 levels of 13 or 14, and today (May 1992) it stands at 10.5.' On October 16, it stood at 10.93. Dividend yield that day was 5.95 per cent. In terms of profitability, according to a study based on the performance of companies quoted on the ISE, the energy sector was in the lead, with Cukurova Elektrik and Kepez Eelektrik the outstanding companies. This sector, which recorded TL44.81 profit for every TL100 of electricity sold, was followed by the tourism sector (37.56 per cent), insurance/leasing (27.29), electronics (26.30), construction (23.44) and cement (20.37). More recently, the ISE saw a fall in July of 3.3 per cent in the composite index; but the index fluctuated between 3,900 and 4,200 points, and a further decrease of 2.5 per cent was recorded in lire terms in August (reflecting an eight-month decrease of 4.9 per cent in lire terms and 31.5 per cent in dollar terms). Trading volume in August fell strikingly by 47 per cent, compared with the previous month. Overall, during the first seven months of 1992, according to Global Securities, the Istanbul-based brokerage house, the ISE's composite index fell to 3,141.98 points, to rise as high as 5,128.91. Mr Haydar Serezli, general manager of Cars Securities, the largest brokerage company, with 5.2 per cent of total transactions in 1991, pleads for wider education in equity investment, to coax money out from under bedspreads and into the ISE. He regrets the lack of interest among foreign investors, and wants more involvement by institutional investors. He does not see a need for exchanges elsewhere in the country, for his company is able to provide information to 3,000 people a day in six different cities on any one working day. But he points out: 'It is not yet a mature market. There is a huge unfulfilled demand in the local market.' Once the ISE has moved and is fully automated, Mr Serezli expects to see much interest among the 60 per cent of the national population of potential shareholders who live in the main 15 cities.</p>

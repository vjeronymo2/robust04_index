For many industries the new Europe may mean a culture shock in trade and working methods, but not in the business of classical music - surely the first industry to have created its own single market, transcending all global boundaries. Those who complain that Maastricht will result in a loss of national identity might like to consider what has happened here. Since the war European opera companies have increasingly come to look and sound like each other, a point that has become particularly striking with the influx of Russian companies that still perform the way they always used to. It means nothing today to come across a recording of an Italian opera in which the total number of Italian principals in the cast is either one (Sony's new Don Carlo) or effectively none at all (DG's Lucia di Lammermoor). In these circumstances it is a losing battle to complain that the performances are hazy on matters of style, however high their general quality. The new set of Don Carlo, recorded in New York, is in many ways a high quality product. The playing of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra is exemplary; the version used is the full five acts, with an extra chorus of woodcutters thrown in at the beginning for good measure. The set aims well above the mediocre standard achieved by the previous releases - Aida and Luisa Miller - in this Verdi series. Unfortunately the often-cut Act 1, a court hunting-party at Fontainebleau, does not find James Levine, the conductor, at his happiest. French elegance is not really his suit. In essence Levine is an unstylish Verdi conductor, too up-front, too American in his determination to make every minor incident smack the listener on the nose. But this Don Carlo stays within reasonable bounds and it powers along with a convincing dramatic energy. In the title-role it also has an important newcomer. This is the tenor Michael Sylvester, already encountered at Covent Garden, who rises to the challenge here to make a bright, youthful-sounding Don Carlos with plenty of ring in the voice, some tightness at the top aside. (Is he perhaps an answer to the question, 'What are we going to do when Pavarotti and Domingo have gone?') In the fearsome role of Eboli, Dolora Zajick sings with the vocal electricity turned up to maximum. Vladimir Chernov as Posa is again Levine's virile Verdian baritone. The disappointments come at either extreme, as Aprile Millo's Elisabeth seems to me only marginally less wobbly than in her previous outings in this series and Ferruccio Furlanetto's soft-grained bass makes for an excessively weak Philip II. In his confrontation with Samuel Ramey's imposing Grand Inquisitor there is no contest at all. Perhaps it did not help that I had just finished listening to the same scene in EMI's re-issue of its 1955 Don Carlo under Gabriele Santini. The bass there is Boris Christoff - implacable, granite-voiced, truly a ferocious exterior hiding a crumbling heart within, and very moving, too. His halting comment 'She loves me no more' at the end of his aria could make grown men weep. For him and Tito Gobbi's well-characterised Posa the set is worth its mid-price. But the rest barely passes muster. The style is right (no lack of Italians here) but at a mediocre level of achievement. And too much of the opera is simply missing. Record collectors in 1993 will be shocked at how much Santini and his team felt happy to cut in those days - not only the first act (Verdi himself provided for that) but sizeable chunks out of many of the set-pieces. This is one of the great operatic scores and I want to hear as much of it as possible. For a good example of the current trend in opera recordings one only has to turn to the new set of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. Great voices populate the cast. (The tiny role of Lucy's companion - 'What do you say?', 'Why do you look around?', 'Here he comes]' - is taken by a singer who is a notable soloist in her own right.) The orchestral playing is spick-and-span; the recording quality is excellent. But the performance as a whole never makes any special contact with the opera. In the course of listening to this DG set I dipped into a live performance from Berlin in the 1950s, led by Maria Callas. Maybe the comparison was unfair, as performances on that level do not come round often, but very soon I found it difficult to tear myself away. The character of poor Lucy and the passions she unleashed came so vividly to life there that one felt compelled to follow the drama through to its conclusion. On the new recording everything is, by contrast, rather vague. Suffice to say that Cheryl Studer sings the music of the title-role with much beauty of tone and a virtuosity commendable in a soprano with a voice her size. It would have been preferable to have a Henry Ashton with more 'go' in him than Juan Pons, but Samuel Ramey offers recompense as an unusually lustrous Bide-the-Bent. In the crucial tenor role of Edgar, Placido Domingo is in his finest, burnished voice; the conductor Ion Marin displays plenty of energy. But it is symptomatic of the whole enterprise that they make nothing out of those heartrending sequences in Edgar's dying moments, where Italian tenors of the old school would stretch out the phrases and make the music really sing. That was the true bel canto and it seems a world away. Finally, a word of welcome - if that is the appropriate term - for the new Pagliacci. This Philips set has been given a rough ride elsewhere, mainly on account of Riccardo Muti's determination to rid the score of its traditional extra top notes, although some unattractive singing from Daniela Dessi's squally Nedda and Paolo Coni's strained Silvio does not help. The recording comes from a live performance in Philadelphia and the singers evidently did not get a second try. However, as it features Luciano Pavarotti as Canio, many people will consider buying the set and it is worth reassuring them that the tenor is on good form with nothing to fear from having the microphones in front of him at a live concert. So often tenors bawl their way through this music, but Pavarotti never forgets that he is there to sing. The role, in short, is gloriously, eloquently sung. He is our main link with the Italian tenor tradition and we shall miss him when he is gone.</p>

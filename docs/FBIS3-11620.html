Burelli Rivas will make his withdrawal  official at Miraflores Palace (government headquarters) this  afternoon, even though last week he insisted to foreign  journalists that he would continue his candidacy until election  day, this Sunday in Washington.    According to media reports, the Venezuelan foreign minister  had only received the support of the Haitian Government in  exile. With his withdrawal, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd  Niehaus and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria remain in the  competition for the hemispheric post.</p>

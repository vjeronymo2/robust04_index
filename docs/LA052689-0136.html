			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An ambitious plan to clean up the heavily polluted environment of the  Netherlands by the year 2010 was submitted to Parliament by the government.  However, it said 80% of that nation's forests may die even if the measures are  put into effect. Among the goals are removing 7,000 toxic waste dumps, cutting  pesticide and fertilizer use by 50% and reducing industrial discharges by 75%.  The cost by 1994 would be more than $14 per month per household, according to  Environment Minister Ed Nijpels. The plan, likely to be a major campaign issue,  will be taken up by the new government after elections in September. Cabinet  disagreements over a minor part of the plan brought down the government headed  by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers earlier this month.  </P></p>

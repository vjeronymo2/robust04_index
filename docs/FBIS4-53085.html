			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Three senior Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) legislators, widely dubbed the "YKK  Trio," on Monday [16 May] launched a new policy study group free  from factional shackles.    The three vocal opposition politicians are former  construction minister Taku Yamasaki, former chief cabinet  secretary Koichi Kato and former posts and telecommunications  minister Junichiro Koizumi. The name YKK trio is based on the  initials of their family names.    "The group new century," headed by Kato, aims to "reform the  party, create politics suitable for a new era and open up a new  frontier for the future Japan," according to the group's  constitution.    The group, which brought together over 60 LDP lawmakers,  openly lashed out at Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), the core  ruling party headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata but widely  believed to be controlled by Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition  strategist.    It blames Shinseito for inheriting the money-drenched  politicking style of the LDP and for trying to manipulate the  coalition government from behind the scenes.    The foundation of the new group within the LDP may  accelerate  moves toward a major reconfiguration of political parties in  Japan, political sources said.    As the YKK trio are deemed as the critics of the current LDP  leadership, led by President Yohei Kono, the group new century  may also help proliferate an antileadership sentiment within the  party, the sources said.</p>

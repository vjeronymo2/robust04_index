			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Vice Prime Minister, Economics Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin has said that Russia is offering foreign  investors lease of and concessions for exploiting fuel and raw  materials sites, land, forests and setting up joint ventures to  process natural resources and agricultural products.    Speaking at the constituent conference of a consultative  council on foreign investments in Moscow Monday, he pointed out  that creating a climate of trust in investment cooperation with  foreign countries was one of the main conditions for Russia's  involvement in the world economic order.    Shokhin put special emphasis on the fact that the Russian  government took into account foreign investors' opinion with  respect to the instability of Russian legislation. The  government has suspended the practices of legislating and  shaping up their own investment policies by individual  ministries and agencies, which would facilitate their relations  with foreign partners. At the same time, investors' proposals  on lessening investment risks were being considered, and  specific measures guaranteeing foreign investments from changes  in the legislation were being taken.    "We support creating a system for international arbitration  which would enable Russia and its partners to solve their  differences in a civilized way," Shokhin said.    According to Shokhin, the government planned to set up a  centralized collateral fund of federal property and create  analogous structures in the federation items in order to attract  foreign capital. This autumn, the government will consider  regulations for pledging land, underground, forest and other  natural resources as securities and retaining pawned property.    To facilitate the search for and assessment of potential  business partners, especially outside Moscow, a list of  investment projects with participation of foreign capital was  prepared. The list includes more than 500 entries each of them  is a specific project supplemented with brief business plans,  Shokhin said.</p>

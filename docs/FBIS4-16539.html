			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Aleksandr </F> Kondrashov]    [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr (TASS) -- To define a security  zone in the Gorazde area, to cease hostilities on all fronts and  to eliminate obstacles in the way of normal operation of the  personnel of UN forces -- these are the priority points for a  way out of the present critical situation in Bosnia. They were  formulated at the talks between Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which  have just ended here.    These agreements will lay a foundation for the forthcoming  multilateral meeting in Pale between the Bosnian Serb  leadership, the UN representatives, and the Russian president's  Special Envoy Vitaliy Churkin. The Russian foreign minister  announced that the meeting would take place today [17 April].    The meeting is to define clearly the boundaries of a  security  zone in Gorazde, to solve the questions of demilitarization of  this zone and of the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb troops, to  draw up conditions for observing a cease-fire between the Serb  and the Muslim sides on all lines of contact in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those attending the meeting will also have  to agree on ways to ensure freedom of movement for all  servicemen from the UN forces, who are now blockaded for various  reasons by local Serbian authorities.</p>

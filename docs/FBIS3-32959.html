In September 1992, there were  246,101 people without jobs, and in the same month last year,  that number had swelled to 276,081.    This was revealed in the National Administrative Department  of Statistics (DANE) National Household Survey, which polled  7,000 households in 148 municipal jurisdictions in the Atlantic,  Eastern, Central, and Pacific Regions. The former National  Territories were not included.    Rural unemployment rose by 0.5 percent between September  1992  and the same month of last year, from 4.4 to 4.9 percent. In  addition, the number of people who are able to work increased by  only 0.2 percent.    The number of employed people in the rural population  dropped  by 0.4 percent, from 5,382,837 to 5,362,768, between 1992 and  1993. The number of jobless workers climbed by 12.2 percent,  from 246,101 to 276,081 during the period studied by the DANE.    The working-age rural population grew by 2.3 percent, from  10,282,199 to 10,519,668.  <H5>  No Work on the Coast </H5>   The Atlantic Coast Region, made up of the departments of  Bolivar, Cesar, Magdalena, Cordoba, Sucre, Guajira, and  Atlantico, has the highest rural unemployment rate, 5.5 percent  of all working-age persons.    According to the DANE study, the number of jobless workers  in  this region of the country went from 64,499 to 70,049, out of a  total rural population of 3,317,941 as of September of last year.    The second-highest unemployment rate was found in the  Pacific  Region (Choco, Cauca, Narino, and Valle), although it was down  from 1992. According to the DANE, the jobless rate was 5 percent  in this region as of September 1993, while the rate had been 5.3  percent in the same month of 1992.    The unemployment figure for the Eastern Region (Boyaca,  Cundinamarca, Meta, and Santander) is still one of the lowest in  the country at 4.7 percent, although it has increased in the  last year.    The region with the least unemployment is the middle of the  country, comprising the departments of Antioquia, Caldas,  Risaralda, Quindio, Tolima, Huila, and Caqueta.    According to the DANE, the total population in the Central  Region grew by 52,000 people during the year, while the number  of working-age peasants rose 2.8 percent.

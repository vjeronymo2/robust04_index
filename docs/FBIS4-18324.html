			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["jl" report: "The Traffic Light Is Yellow"] </F>   [Text] Following the stabilization in western Germany,  indications of a nascent recovery are mounting. In eastern  Germany, growth has intensified; the upswing is no longer solely  supported by transfers, but increasingly by independent driving  forces. For the first time since the upheaval, investment  dynamism in the new laender is having an effect on the labor  market: The decline in employment and the increase in  unemployment have meanwhile stopped. Next year, there will be  more employed and fewer unemployed for the first time again.    In the old laender, one of the longest and most profound  recessions of the postwar period has been overcome. After  demand and production had followed a downward trend for the past  two to three years, in the course of last year the economy got  out of its slump thanks to comprehensive rationalization  measures, cost reductions, and first stimuli of demand, in  particular from the foreign markets. The traffic light of the  economic development is meanwhile yellow all over the economy.  It is, above all, export that has the best prospects. These  prospects have improved not only the expectations by companies,  but also the inclination toward investments. In contrast,  private consumption will probably remain "waiting" for the time  being: The decline in purchasing power because of continuing  tax increases is too big. Since further burdens -- such as the  nursing care insurance -- can be predicted and the expectations  for income are primarily oriented toward the still unfavorable  labor market prospects, private consumption can be expected to  provide stimuli probably only in the later course of the  recovery of the economic development.    For the development of industry, the FAZ [FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG] economic indicator, which unites early  indicators such as orders received, business climate, interest  structure, foreign value of the German mark, share index, and  offers of jobs, has been pointing upward for the past 10 months;  most recently it has pointed upward quite intensively. The  duration and scope of the upward movement now "clearly" indicate  "a change," the assessment says. The upswing became "visible"  first in the orders received from abroad, which have increased  since the beginning of 1993. During the first quarter of 1993,  orders from abroad were almost 9 percent higher in real terms  than during the same period of the previous year. At the  beginning of 1994, this development continued. As a result,  export deliveries stabilized, following the preceding serious  slump in the course of 1993, and slightly recovered during the  second half of the year. Research institutes and the Council of  Experts expect a clear real increase in exports this year.    In contrast, the production branches that are primarily  oriented toward domestic economy are mostly still in a period of  consolidation. However, domestic orders in the processing  industry have also pointed toward stabilization since the second  half of 1993. In January, they were 1.5 percent higher in real  terms than in December 1993. At the beginning of this year,  output in the producing industry was higher than at the same  time last year for the first time since spring 1992. Capacity  utilization, which had declined since autumn 1990, slightly  increased during the last quarter of 1993.    The "clearest increase in utilization" was noted by the  Munich Ifo Institute regarding preproducts, "an indicator of  industrial development, which was reliable in the past."  According to Ifo, the producers of preproducts look toward the  further development of business "with increased confidence." In  chemical industry orders received reportedly increased strongly  in January, following a slight recovery during the fourth  quarter of 1993. The latest official figures seem to confirm  the observation of the institute: in January, orders received in  the basic materials and producer goods industry increased above  average compared with December. In the two-month comparison  with last year (December/January), orders were 7 percent higher  in real terms. Output in the basic material sector exceeded the  corresponding level of the previous year by about 3 percent in  real terms.    According to the economic development test in January, in  the  investment goods sector, too, the positive expectations have  increase, above all because of the stimuli from abroad. While,  however, there was still "skepticism" in electrical engineering  and among the producers of delivery vans and trucks,  machine-building, which was particularly hard hit by the  recession until the middle of last year, now reports a further  increased number of orders received, precision mechanics/optics  seems to experience a gradual recovery. In the automobile  industry, following the slump last year, the production and  export of industrial vehicles seem to have been higher again in  January/February than during the same period the previous year.  The production of passenger cars for the first time stabilized  in February at a very low level. According to the association,  domestic orders received have improved slightly; however,  domestic demand for industrial vehicles remains low.    Volkswagen has affirmed that it intends to make the planned  investment of 5 billion marks [DM] in eastern Germany, even  though a bit delayed. According to the "Ifo investors  calculation for eastern Germany," the gross fixed investments of  west German, east German, and foreign investors all over the  economy will increase by another 15 percent in 1994. The  (expected) amount of more than DM160 billion will then be almost  twice as much as in 1991.</p>

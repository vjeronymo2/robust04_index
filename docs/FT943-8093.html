			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Hanson quits Treasury Ms Jean Hanson, Treasury legal counsel, resigned yesterday under pressure over her role in the Whitewater affair, Reuter reports from Washington. Ms Hanson's resignation came a day after the resignation of Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, who said he would leave as soon as a successor was confirmed. Both had been harshly criticised by the Senate banking committee for misleading the panel in February about the extent of contacts between the Treasury and White House over the Whitewater probe, involving President and Mrs Clinton's financial dealings. In her resignation letter to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, Ms Hanson said she was rejoining a New York law firm. She made no direct mention of Whitewater.</p>

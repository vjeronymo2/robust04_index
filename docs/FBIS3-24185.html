			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Korney: "Battles Over Reconciliation </F> Monument"]    [Text] Representatives of the Volgograd Oblast  organizations of the Russian Federation Communist Party, the  All-Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks, the Russian National  Union, and the Congress of Soviet Women held a special press  conference to announce that they had not changed their stance:  "The sacred ground of Stalingrad is not the place for the  so-called reconciliation monument." They were referring to the  scheduled dedication of a pillar--a "symbol of  reconciliation"--in Volgograd on 14 May, almost half a century  after the end of the war, in accordance with a Russian-Austrian  agreement. The campaign against the monument, according to the  organizers of the press conference, is being joined by the whole  leftwing and communist press. Petitions have already been  printed. Signatures will be collected by the party obkom.  Activists will also go to enterprises to collect signatures.    An open letter from the Central Council of the Officers  Union  "To the Veterans of the Battle of Stalingrad, Public Veterans  Organizations, Patriotic Movements, and Patriots of Russia" is  being distributed to protest "the erection of a monument that is  hostile to our people."    A delegation from Austria, headed by Vice President Walter  Seledetz of the "50th Anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad"  committee and Vice President Hugo Mueller of the "Black Cross"  society, was in Volgograd at the time. The "Black Cross," which  is leading the search for the remains of soldiers who fell in  battle, will also be erecting the pillar in Volgograd.    It is supposed to have the following inscription: "This  monument is dedicated to all of the victims of the Battle of  Stalingrad of 1942-1943. It is a reminder of the suffering of  the soldiers and civilians who fell here. The monument was  erected with contributions from the Austrian people. We ask that  the soldiers from Germany, Austria, and all other countries who  fell here be granted eternal peace on Russian land."    The Austrian delegation held a press conference to voice the  same request for "eternal peace on Russian land." There was one  other interesting detail: The "Black Cross," according to Hugo  Mueller, has learned the identity of all of the Soviet soldiers  who died in Austria. The number turned out to be much higher  than the figures in official records. More than a thousand  requests have already been received from people wishing to  attend the dedication ceremony for the "symbol of  reconciliation" on 14 May.    The organizers of the protest campaign are alleging that the  Volgograd administration decided in secret to erect the monument  and to locate it in the square in the center of the city.    "There was nothing secret about it," Volgograd  Administration  Deputy Chief Svetlana Antonova responded. "There was constant  coverage of the talks and the preparations for the dedication  ceremony in the local press. Apparently, however, the time is  right for a political campaign."    The leaders of the "opposition" to the reconciliation  monument are not certain they have the support of the majority  of people in Volgograd, however, and are willing to compromise:  They would agree to a monument, and even a chapel, outside the  city limits.    I do not wish to offend the veterans who bore the weight of  the war, but will the "symbol of reconciliation" and the request  for "eternal peace on Russian land" really diminish their  distinction? Nevertheless, the constant propaganda has even  divided the veterans themselves.    At the end of last week Volgograd Mayor Yuriy Chekhov met  representatives of public organizations and political parties to  discuss the issue of the reconciliation monument. The appeals of  the mayor and democratic parties for the avoidance of  confrontations were rejected. A new phase of the campaign  began--a move to the exertion of strong pressure on government  officials.</p>

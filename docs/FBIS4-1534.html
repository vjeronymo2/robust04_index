			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Police have detained Shanghai activist Zhu Fuming  for taking part in the waves of pro-democracy protests that have  hit the administration this spring. And security officials in  the east China city are trying to track down the identities of  the 54 signatories to a petition on political reform that was  sent to the National People's Congress (NPC) on Friday [25  March]. Sources in the dissident community said Zhu, who is in  his early 30s, was detained early this month following a spate  of run-ins with local security agents.    A college graduate and an employee in a company that  provides  information for citizens seeking to go abroad, Zhu is loosely  associated with the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights.  Before his detention, he was hauled in for brief questioning at  least twice this year. The first time was after police found  Zhu had secretly taped their conversation with him. The second  was at a Shanghai disco after Zhu shouted on the dance floor  slogans calling for overturning the verdict on the Tiananmen  Square crackdown.    Zhu's relatives indicated yesterday they had not been told  by  local police where he was being held or for what reason. Out of  fear of the authorities, however, the relatives have not taken  any action.    Meanwhile, Shanghai sources said police were investigating  the "background" behind last Friday's 19-point petition, which  called for constitutional amendments to introduce a multi-party  system. It is understood that, while the petition to the NPC  stated 54 people had signed it, only seven names appeared on the  document. "Police are trying to find out who the 47 unnamed  signatories are," a source said. "They also want to check if an  `anti-government' organisation is behind it."    The source said the local procuratorate yesterday tried to  get into contact with Dai Xuezhong, an activist who spent two  years in a reeducation through labour camp after the June 4,  1989, crackdown. It is understood that Mr Dai, now a private  entrepreneur, yesterday refused to respond when officers tried  to contact him through his pager.    Dissidents in Shanghai said the authorities were alarmed by  the petition because it was more radical than similar ones  organised this month by Beijing-based intellectuals such as Xu  Liangying, Wang Dan or Liu Nianchun. They said copies of the  petition had been sent by mail to intellectuals in the big  cities.</p>

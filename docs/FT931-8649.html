			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television Wandsworth is regarded as one of the toughest prisons in the UK but it has opened its doors to director Roger Graef and his camera team to record Turning the Screws, which begins a three part series on Channel 4 at 9pm. Graef's earlier investigation on the workings of the police force 10 years ago made such an impact that the approach to interviewing rape victims was changed. This time he examines life in prison from the point of view of the staff rather than the convicts, and arrives at Wandsworth just as a dispute is brewing about operating practices between a liberal governor and the Prison Officers Association. After successfully going their separate ways in TV comedy sitcoms, French and Saunders combine their talents again after a three-year break on BBC 2 at 9pm. The first show seems to be based around that easy formula, the lampooning of popular movies, including Silence of the Lambs and In Bed with Madonna. That is preceded by yet another series about skiing, with Muriel Gray as the presenter and the return of Top Gear, which concerns the launch of Ford's replacement for the Sierra, the Mondeo.</p>

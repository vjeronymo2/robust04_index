			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (8): Strong demand for clearer displays - Screen Technology CRISPER, clearer colour screens are increasingly in demand from portable PC users, who no longer see their machines as executive toys. Some users want to take advantage of more powerful colour software programs, some want to make a splash in business presentations and some simply want to join the in-crowd. Now a handful of personal computer manufacturers is trying to meet that demand with high-definition, flicker-free, active matrix displays. Until now, users have had to suffer a variety of slow, low-resolution liquid crystal displays (LCDs) using passive matrix technology. Among the active matrix coterie are Sharp, NEC and Toshiba with its 80486-based T6400 machines launched last month. The T6400s use the first active matrix screens from Display Technologies, the joint venture set up by Toshiba and IBM Japan, two years ago. So far, the duo is believed to have invested Pounds 214m in the technology and these 10.5 ins screens are the project's first offerings. The largest TFT (thin film transistor) screen so far manufactured, at 16.5 ins, was shown in Japan last month by Sharp, but neither this nor its 14 ins screen, seen two years ago, is yet in mass production. Both passive and active matrix displays work on the same principle. By illuminating the right combination of pixels behind red, green and blue filters, they create the illusion of colour in the same way that colour photographs do in a newspaper. But active matrix displays use three times as many pixels, each one controlled by a separate transistor. This independent control prevents light bleeding into neighbouring pixels to change the colour mix. Active matrix screens are also sensitive to tiny changes in voltage, so they can display many thousands of subtle colours, depending on the software drivers. This, combined with the independent control of one transistor per pixel, makes them brighter, with better contrast and colour saturation than passive matrix screens. But active matrix displays - using thin-film transistor technology - are difficult to make. To produce a TFT screen to VGA resolution (640 by 480 pixels) requires about a million individual transistors. Not surprisingly, manufacturing defects are high and the result is many dead pixels. Because light can pass through these, thin-film transistor screens become punctured with distracting points of light. Despite manufacturing improvements in the past six months, only 40-50 per cent of new TFT screens - which must be made in a single sheet - are usable. Sometimes the yield is even lower. Until recently more than 90 per cent of screens were scrapped because of pixel damage, even though some manufacturers allow up to 10 dud pixels per screen. As a consequence, the price of TFT portables is high: at Pounds 6,000-Pounds 7,000, two or even three times the equivalent of passive matrix machines. Besides passive and active matrix screens, there are two other relatively common technologies in use: gas plasma and electroluminescence. Unlike LCDs, which need back or sidelighting, gas plasma displays generate their own light. A gas discharge trapped between two layers of glass generates the characteristic copper-coloured text on an almost black screen. One particular advantage of the technology is that the screen refresh-rate is fast. This means users will not 'lose' their cursors in Windows-type applications. For the cost-conscious buyer, the price of gas plasma portables is considerably less than active matrix systems. Toshiba's gas plasma T6400 runs Pounds 2,000 cheaper than the TFT version, at Pounds 4,500. IBM, NEC and Grid still offer gas plasma machines. Electroluminescence (EL) is less popular even than gas plasma, as EL screens tend to be powerhogs. They do have certain advantages, though: the refresh rate of their yellow and black screens is particularly fast and they are cheaper than TFT screens. Electroluminescence can also support much larger resolutions than TFT: Toshiba's Sparc LT laptop workstation for programmers, for instance, with its 12 ins Sharp screen, has a resolution of 1,152 by 900 pixels. Two relatively new screen technologies - ferroelectric LCDs and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) screens - have yet to make their way into full commercial production, but could eventually supplant TFT technology. The first ferroelectric LCD, demonstrated last autumn by Canon, was a monochrome screen with a resolution of 1,310 by 960 pixels. Canon expects to manufacture colour screens, too, at an even better resolution and up to 24 ins in size. Although the mass production of ferroelectric LCDs (FLCDs) may be three years or more away, these screens are likely to be significantly cheaper than TFT systems. Sharp, one of the market leaders in screen technology, does not yet manufacture FLCDs, but has gone as far as to say that they will probably be the displays of choice for future portables. Portable personal computers, using metal-insulator-metal (MIM) screens, are likely to offer brighter whites and may eventually be cheaper than TFT machines. Again, however, mass production techniques for MIM screens have yet to be devised. The first prototype MIM notebook, from Seiko-Epson, was shown in the US last year with a price tag of about Pounds 4,500. As far as buyers are concerned, the precise technology behind portable screens is immaterial. But they do need to know what to look for: clarity, brightness and contrast control are important, to enable users to run the machine under different lighting conditions. Response time, too, is worth investigating, especially for power software such as Windows. Something else to look for, especially if the machine is needed for presentations, is a screen that can be seen from a wide viewing angle. Perhaps the key question buyers should ask is whether they need colour at all. The demand for colour is certainly high, say manufacturers, which will keep the cost of colour portables up for a year or two at least. 'Consumers are expecting the cost of these machines to fall quicker than it's going to,' says Mr Yan Edbrooke, product manager for Apple's notebook computers. 'Demand is stronger right now than the production technology can deliver, a phenomenon that'll last through 1992.' In many ways the intense demand for colour portables is illogical. Toshiba research shows that 70 per cent of portable users are interested only in word processing. So buyers should seriously consider monochrome portables before plumping for a colour machine simply because it looks good. Moreover, unless buyers can afford the best - which really means TFT at Pounds 6,000 plus - they will have to make do with dimmer, slower, fuzzier, passive matrix screens. And the colours on many of these are poor, says Mr Nick Phillips, professor of physics at Loughborough University of Technology. 'The screens on portables that I've seen are an insult to the intelligence,' he says. 'Those companies that have tackled the attempt to get good black and white have done the right thing.'</p>

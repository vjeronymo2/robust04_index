			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pellervo Alanen: "Study Commissioned by Industry </F> Interest Group Shows: Farmers' Net Incomes Do Not Collapse in  the EU"]    [Text] There has been much clamor in Finland about how farm  incomes would collapse if Finland were to become a member of the  European Union (EU). There has been less talk about how costs  will decrease almost in the same proportion. The result of this  may be that net farm incomes do not decrease very much.    The Central Federation of Industry and Employers (CFIE) has  commissioned a study of how Finnish membership in the EU would  impact farm costs in Finland. The results of the study, which  are available now, are quite surprising. When lower incomes and  lower costs are juxtaposed, net farm incomes will only be less  than 100 million markkas lower than the official figures for  1993.    The study has been based on agricultural gross revenue and  cost, according to calculations prepared in February of last  year, by the National Farm Price Advisory Committee. The  resulting difference between these two values is called  agricultural income.    Included in agricultural gross revenue are almost all  subsidies. Excluded are some agricultural sale revenues, such as  quality and seasonal surcharges. In addition, proceeds from  timber sales are not included in the sales revenue figures .  <H5>  Producer Prices Decreasing </H5>   The sales revenues, and simultaneously the agricultural  gross  revenue, decrease due to the fact that the farmers in the EU  countries receive lower prices for their products than the  farmers in Finland. On the other hand, the difference between  producer prices has significantly shrunk, as the markka has  weakened. The study commissioned by the CFIE estimates the  difference to be 25-30 percent.    The study has been conducted on the assumption that farm  subsidies will remain the same, as the government has made the  commitment in the EU negotiations to keep the support level for  farmers from decreasing. Prohibited subsidies such as price  supports (3.9 billion markkas and 50 million markkas in crop  failure support) can be supplanted by other forms of support.  The Finnish state and/or the EU will pay.  <H5>  Lower Prices of Fertilizers </H5>   The agricultural sector's share of surplus exports amounted  to 1.5 billion markkas. Membership in the EC would eliminate  this obligation.    Currently, when farmers buy supplies and equipment such as  machinery, fertilizers and feed, they pay hidden sales taxes, as  they have no right to deduct these. The amount of these hidden  sales taxes is estimated at 1.5 billion markkas.    The transfer to a system of value-added taxes means that the  above-mentioned costs will be removed from the agricultural  sector.    The industry sector that manufactures farming supplies and  equipment, operates, in part, on closed markets. According to  the study, the prices of, among other things, fertilizers and  animal feed on the common markets will come down.    Animal feed is mainly manufactured from grain, and the  decrease in grain prices will lead to lower animal feed prices.    According to the study, fertilizer concentrate prices may  decrease by 10-20 percent and the price of feed by 25-35 percent.  <H5>  Smaller Depreciation </H5>   In 1993, the depreciation value included in the producer  prices amounted to 3.4 billion markkas for machinery and  equipment and 640 million markkas for buildings.    It was noted in the study that, as farm sizes increase, the  capital invested in agriculture will decrease, which leads to  lower depreciation. The assumption made in the study is that  depreciation will decrease by a third.    Lower costs will result in a corresponding decrease in  producer prices, without any changes in agricultural income.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Effect of EU Membership on the Agricultural Sector                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Income From Agriculture  |As Member of EU, million |  |                         |in 1993, million markkas |markkas                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sales income             |20,740                   |14,518 (- 30 percent)    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Subsidies                |3,985                    |3,985                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other income             |1,006                    |1,006                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total Income             |25,731                   |19,509                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fertilizer concentrates  |1,230                    |1,045 (- 15 percent)     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Seed purchases           |308                      |216 (- 30 percent)       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Animal feed purchases    |2,548                    |1,783 (- 30 percent)     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Machinery and equipment  |                         |                         |  |expenditures             |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Depreciation             |3,406                    |2,282 (- 33 percent)     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maintenance              |1,055                    |739 (- 30 percent)       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Interest                 |2,026                    |1,418 (- 30 percent)     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other costs              |6,367                    |6,367                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total Costs              |16,940                   |13,850                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hidden sales tax burden  |                         |- 1,553                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Removal of obligation fo-|                         |- 1,500                  |  |r surplus exports        |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Corrected Total Costs    |16,940                   |10,797                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Income from agriculture  |8,790                    |8,712                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Under the heading "Income From Agriculture," specific  mention  is made only of those major cost items that are expected to  significantly change when Finland becomes a member of the EU.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Early fears of Maxwell pension misuse - Mirror fund threatened with liquidation after employee demands FORMER employees of companies owned by Mr Robert Maxwell said yesterday there were 'warning lights' about the possible misuse of pension fund monies as long as two years ago. Mr Glyn Evans, a former shopfloor worker at Floform, the Welsh automotive components company owned briefly by Maxwell Communication Corporation in the late 1980s, told the House of Commons social security committee that he had taken early retirement in February 1990 and applied to receive his full entitlement from the pension scheme. He was told there were no funds available. Mr Maxwell had sold Floform to the James Wilkes group in December 1989, but retained control of the pension fund. Mr Evans said he was not paid in full until 14 months later. No explanation was given. Other past and present employees of Floform and Mirror Group Newspapers warned Members of Parliament that thousands of people faced great uncertainty over whether pensions would continue to be paid and about the fate of contributions still being paid into Maxwell funds. Evidence from the Graphical, Paper and Media Union showed Mr Maxwell threatened to liquidate the Mirror Group fund when faced in May 1985 by demands to allow pension scheme members to nominate half the trustees and have an independent chairman. 'Mr Maxwell said that he would not be dictated to as to who would be trustees, he was the owner of the fund, and had full control of it,' the union's report said. 'If union rights to appoint trustees were insisted upon, he would liquidate the fund.' A catalogue of other complaints from the union included constant erosion of the representation of employees on the board of trustees, and difficulties obtaining information about the fund. When the union made a request for an actuarial valuation in September 1989, it was given one dated 1985. The 1988 valuation was made available only in March 1990, days before a court application was due to be heard.</p>

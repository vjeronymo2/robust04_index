			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus] </F>   [Text] Syrian Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman has  asserted that the recent escalation of Israeli attacks on  Lebanon is part of Israel's policy of organized state terrorism  against Lebanon's sovereignty.    In an exclusive statement to Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Salman  said the timing of these attacks is part of Israel's continued  attempts to undermine the peace process and obstruct U.S.  efforts to end the stalemate in the peace talks, which were  launched in accordance with the Madrid frame of reference. He  noted that the cause of the stalemate is Israel's hard-line  approach that rejects full withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories in return for full peace.</p>

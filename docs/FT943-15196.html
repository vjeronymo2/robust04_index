			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Swiss departure tax Some travellers to Switzerland will be less hard hit by the government's new dparture tax on flights from UK airports than they might have feared, writes David Owen. Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, has announced that flights to Basle and Geneva will be subject only to the lower Pounds 5 duty rate when the tax is introduced in October, and not the Pounds 10 rate applicable to non-UK or European Union destinations. The change is not due to a rare bout of Treasury generosity, but to the difficulty of enforcing the higher rate. As Sir John explains, the two airports are in 'the unusual position' of straddling Switzerland and France - an EU member-state - allowing passengers to choose into which country to exit the airport. 'It would therefore be impossible to charge the higher Pounds 10 duty rate, as there is no distinction on a passenger's ticket to indicate whether he intends to enter Switzerland or France,' Sir John reasons.</p>

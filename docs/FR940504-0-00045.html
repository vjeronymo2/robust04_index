On March 24, 1994, NHTSA issued an interpretation of the term ``daylight opening'' used in the final rule. Subsequently, NHTSA has learned that several school bus manufacturers had misunderstood this term and as a result, will not have designed many of their buses with sufficient exits to comply with the new requirement by the May 2, 1994 effective date. Because NHTSA agrees that this term could have been misunderstood, NHTSA is allowing manufacturers to continue certifying their buses as having the exits required prior to the November 2, 1992 final rule until September 1, 1994. All other requirements of the November 2, 1992 final rule will continue to be effective on May 2, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Effective Date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments made in this rule are effective May 2, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Petition Date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any petitions for reconsideration must be received by NHTSA no later than June 3, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Any petitions for reconsideration should refer to the docket and notice number of this notice and be submitted to: Docket Section, room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

Under the proposal, all school buses would have been required to have either a rear emergency exit door or a side emergency exit door and a rear push-out window. Depending on capacity, some school buses would have been required to have additional exits. The NPRM proposed two options regarding the means for providing the additional emergency exits. Option A would have required the use of emergency exit doors. Option B would have required a combination of emergency exit doors and emergency roof exits. The NPRM included a table indicating the additional exits required under each option for any bus with a designated seating capacity between 24 and 90. The determination of the number and type of exits used in the tables was based on crediting an emergency exit door with its minimum area (24 inches &times; 45 inches, or 1,080 inches2) and crediting two emergency roof exits as a single emergency exit door.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 2, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule increasing the amount of emergency exit area required on school buses (57 FR 49413). As in the proposal, the final rule required that the minimum emergency exit area on school buses be based upon the seating capacity of the school bus. However, the final rule differed from the NPRM concerning the calculation by which the need for additional emergency exits was to be determined. (On December 2, 1992 NHTSA published a technical amendment to the November 2, 1992 final rule. Both of these notices will be referred to collectively as the November 2, 1992 final rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The November 2, 1992 final rule specified that after calculating the total amount of additional emergency exit area [AEEA] needed for a school bus, using the formula proposed in the NPRM, each exit was to be credited with its ``daylight opening.'' ``Daylight opening'' was defined as ``the maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.'' The preamble to the final rule did not include a further discussion of what might constitute an obstruction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 8, 1994, Mr. Bob Carver of Wayne Wheeled Vehicles (Wayne) wrote to the agency requesting clarification of the terms ``daylight opening'' and ``unobstructed opening.'' The Wayne letter included Figure 5C from the November 2, 1992 final rule. This figure illustrates the permitted placement of a seat adjacent to a side emergency exit door. Wayne stated that agency personnel had indicated that only the area visually obstructed by the seat could not be credited, and requested confirmation of this interpretation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

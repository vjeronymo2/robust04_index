			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Howard floats idea of limit on benefits CHANGES to the social security system to encourage 'responsibility', such as limiting welfare benefits after the first child, were floated yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday. Speaking to a fringe meeting, Mr Howard highlighted pilot schemes in the US where, for example, New Jersey had capped the benefits available for second and later children. He told the meeting that policies across a range of areas - housing, moral education at school and adoption law - should be examined to ensure that they did not provide an incentive for irresponsible behaviour. Mr Howard said that in addressing the breakdown of discipline and authority the government must also argue strongly the case for the traditional family and try to create a spirit of independence in communities badly affected by crime. In contrast to some of the messages coming from the Tory party about the availability of welfare benefits, he said most girls 'probably don't get pregnant to get a council house or to receive an income from the state' but he said that for young men 'social security benefits all too often appear as an entitlement'. He argued that with few adult role models, children in one-parent families were more likely to succumb to peer pressure. 'The children, instead of learning the difference between right and wrong, may instead concentrate on how not to get caught,' he said. 'And since the state is educating, housing and feeding their children, the nature of parental responsibility may seem less immediate.' Far too often, offenders had appeared before the court to receive repeated conditional discharges and probation orders, Mr Howard said. Disintegration of what it sees as traditional family values is one of the issues the party is keen to address. Ministers are committed to ensuring that so far as possible the welfare state does not provide incentives towards 'irresponsible behaviour'. Mr Howard is to give the keynote speech today on law and order.</p>

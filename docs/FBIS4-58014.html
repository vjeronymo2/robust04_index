			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rothschild Francois] </F>   [Text] [Francois] On 27 May, the Tontons Macoutes formally  announced that the Volunteers for National Security [Volontaires  de la Securite Nationale (VSN)] have returned to the Haitian  political scene, eight years after being dissolved by Henry  Namphy and the Government National Council. They noted that the  move was prompted by the threat of intervention hanging over  Haiti.    Mrs. (Gerard Dessain), the VSN's new leader, explains that  the Tontons Macoutes have offered to help the Haitian Army fight  foreign troops in case of invasion. (Dessain) asserts that the  big Duvalierist lords or the big Tontons Macoutes lords are  behind this movement:    [Begin (Dessain) recording, in Creole] All VSN delegates  from  the nine departments that were sent here today say: No! No!  They will not accept an intervention. There will be an  intervention only over our dead bodies. We will be in front and  the Army will be behind. We offer our services to the Army  because we are not ungrateful. The Army trained us. We only  know how to use weapons because the Army taught us how to fight.  The Army taught us how to protect ourselves. We cannot betray  the Army. They think that the Army is alone today, but this is  not true. Some people have a conscience. Some people love  their country and side with the Army. We, the VSN, say we are  present. We make it a point of saying that we are on the field.  We stand beside the Army in defending our country no matter  when, no matter which day they wish to intervene. We know they  can kill us, but we will not die on our knees. We will not die  sitting down. We will not be disabled. We will die standing  up. [applause] [end recording]    [Francois] (Dessain), who was addressing correspondents at  the downtown headquarters of the neo-Duvalierist party known as  the Assembly of Democrats for the Republic, rose up against  military intervention in Haiti. (Dessain) also tried to make it  clear that Port-au-Prince slums would be destroyed by the  foreign forces in case of intervention. (Dessain) noted that  30,051 Tontons Macoutes have already been recruited in the  metropolitan area alone. She asked President-in-Exile  Jean-Bertrand Aristide to take an official stand against  military intervention in Haiti to solve the crisis. (Dessain),  who leads the VSN, also asserted that the Tontons Macoutes and  the VSN will be donning their blue uniforms nationwide very soon.</p>

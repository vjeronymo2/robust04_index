			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUAKES REAFFIRM URGENCY OF STUDY;  </P> <P> ENGINEERING: TWO IRVINE RESEARCHERS ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP A LASER TO DETERMINE A  STRUCTURE'S ABILITY TO TAKE A JOLT.  </P> <P> When a small earthquake rattled parts of Orange County two weeks ago, it did  not damage the offices of Cecil F. Hess and James D. Trolinger. But the jolt --  which measured 4.0 on the Richter scale -- delivered an uncomfortable reminder  of the urgency of their work.  </P> <P> "Every time there's an earthquake it reminds me that we're very unprepared to  deal with them and there is a lot of work for us to do," said Hess, co-founder  and director of engineering at MetroLaser, a small Irvine start-up firm.  </P> <P> The company is attempting to develop a laser that would help determine a  structure's ability to withstand earthquakes, such as last year's collapse of  Interstate 880 in Oakland during a major temblor.  </P> <P> Toward that end, the eight-employee firm recently won a $230,000 research grant  from the National Science Foundation to investigate how laser-generated  holograms can be used to determine structural stability.  </P> <P> In a two-year study in conjunction with the civil engineering department at UC  Irvine, Trolinger and Hess will attempt to determine if lasers can detect the  points in any structure that are subject to the most stress from ground  vibrations.  </P> <P> The laser would take a hologram -- or three-dimensional image of a structure  such as an office building -- by shining a laser beam on the object and  capturing its reflected image on light-sensitive glass slides.  </P> <P> A second hologram would capture the outline of the structure at another point  in time, and the two holograms could be compared to measure the distance the  structure has moved during the elapsed time.  </P> <P> With the data from the holograms, civil engineers would then use computers to  analyze where the most pressure is exerted on a building, find its structural  flaws, calculate the point at which the structure might collapse during an  earthquake, and measure damage after an earthquake.  </P> <P> Hess said the laser technology can improve upon current test instruments known  as accelerometers, vice-like devices that record the vibrations in a structure  at a single point.  </P> <P> While it would take many cumbersome accelerometers and months of work to  capture all the stress points in a large structure such as a bridge, a laser  hologram could theoretically detect the stress points throughout the bridge in  a single instant, Hess said.  </P> <P> Last year, MetroLaser proved the basic tenets of the theory in a joint research  project with civil engineers at UC Irvine. In that experiment, sponsored by the  National Science Foundation under a $50,000 grant, Hess and Trolinger built a  laser that recorded the effect of vibrations on a liquid storage tank.  </P> <P> Trolinger said any equipment developed from the technology will probably be too  expensive for individual homeowners to use to measure how earthquake-safe their  homes are. It will most likely be used by civil engineers who must measure the  safety of large structures, such as bridges, skyscrapers, hospitals or shopping  centers.  </P> <P> Jeff Jones, general manager at San Juan Capistrano-based Endevco, a subsidiary  of Allied Signal Corp. which makes accelerometers, said the laser technology  sounds exciting, but he said there is still room for the current technology.  </P> <P> "Accelerometers will still be used for measuring small objects," he said. "The  technologies are not necessarily competing."  </P> <P> It could be several years before MetroLaser markets a product, and it may be  even longer before civil engineers can understand and interpret the data it  produces. Its laser device, for example, may be able to identify weak spots on  a bridge, but how the span should be reinforced and at what point it will  collapse could take years to understand, Trolinger said.  </P> <P> "The technology for taking the measurements has been demonstrated," Trolinger  said. "But there's a big gap in understanding what the measurements mean. This  research is still high-risk in terms of commercial value."  </P> <P> Even so, MetroLaser has lined up agreements with several companies that may be  interested in manufacturing a product based on the technology: GenRad Corp., a  diagnostic instruments firm in Milpitas; Physical Research Inc., a  military-oriented optical diagnostics firm in Torrance; and Newport Corp., an  optical instruments manufacturer in Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Tom Galantowicz, president of Newport Corp., said his firm supports the  direction of MetroLaser's research and will be interested in manufacturing the  instruments if the research proves fruitful.  </P> <P> Hess and Trolinger have searched to find commercial applications for holograms  for more than two decades. Now that they believe they have found one, they are  racing against time to perfect an instrument before the Big One strikes, the  long-expected catastrophic earthquake.  </P> <P> "We're driven by the idea that we might actually save some lives with this  device," Trolinger said.  </P> <P> Illuminating Flaws With Laser Light  </P> <P> Using holograms created by shining laser beams on an object, MetroLaser hopes  to predict the eartquake safety of large structures such as a fuel storage  tank.  </P></p>

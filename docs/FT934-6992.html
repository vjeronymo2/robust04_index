			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Weak demand hits two Japanese audio makers Japan's audio makers were battered by a sluggish consumer spending and the sharp rise of the yen in the first half of 1993. Pioneer, the specialist audio and laser disc maker, suffered an operating loss of Y1.25bn, although foreign exchange gains helped it to report a pre-tax profit of Y3.35bn. Meanwhile, Kenwood, the specialised audio maker, reported a pre-tax loss of Y2.46bn, hit by the rise of the yen and downturn in consumer spending. The company is passing its interim dividend. Pioneer saw sales drop 16 per cent to Y173.4bn, compared with Y205.5bn previously, in the face of slow consumer spending in Japan and a decline in demand for its commercial use laser disc karaoke systems. Sales of audio products in North America and Europe and of car audio product in Europe were particularly depressed, the company said. However Pioneer's gains from currency hedging helped it to avoid a pre-tax loss. Kenwood saw falling demand in its audio and telecommunications business, which was particularly hard hit in Japan with a drop of 23 per cent. Overall sales totalled Y96.4bn, down 10 per cent from the Y107.2bn made previously. Pioneer is forecasting a 9 per cent decline in full-year sales to Y349bn and a 58 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y7bn. Kenwood expects full-year sales to fall to Y204bn from Y210.6bn and pre-tax profits to be Y1bn, down from Y4.0bn. Buoyant demand for mobile phones helped Kyocera, the maker of semiconductor components and electronic parts, report a 1.9 per cent rise in sales in the first half, Strong demand for electronic equipment from cellular phone companies helped that division push sales up 20 per cent. In contrast, demand for fine ceramics, semiconductor devices and precision instruments fell in the face of the economic slump. Overall sales came to Y150.4bn but pre-tax profits were down 6 per cent to Y17.4bn from Y18.4bn due to a decline in non-operating income. Operating profits were up 6 per cent to Y11.4bn from Y10.7bn. Kyocera forecast full-year sales of Y305bn, up 1.5 per cent from the previous year, and pre-tax profits of Y35.4bn, down 7 per cent.</p>

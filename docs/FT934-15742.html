			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Trophies of a dying art - Clive Fewins meets a taxidermist who keeps his stock in the freezers of his friends PAUL Draper will never forget the day he collected the carcass of an 8 cwt two-year-old male tiger from the owners of a large circus. He had ample help to lead the body on to his pick-up truck at the circus headquarters, but when he arrived back at his workshop he had great problems finding people to help with the unloading. The process that followed was rapid and rather unsavoury, but the beast now has a new role - mounted in a glass cabinet in the showroom at his home near Reading where he displays his taxidermy. The price is Pounds 3,000. As he paid only Pounds 250 for the carcass some people might consider taxidermy a lucrative business. But Draper points out that it is two years since he bought the tiger and it is still unsold. Further, about 160 hours of work went into mounting it and the glass case alone cost some Pounds 500. The tiger, together with a panther at Pounds 3,500, exotic birds, an anteater, a sloth's head, as well as the more common foxes, badgers, stoats and the odd kestrel and buzzard, forms the basis of the bizarre stock of mounted creatures in Draper's showroom. The stock is valued at Pounds 25,000 and is the main reason for the Pounds 1,500 a year insurance bill that is the principal outgoing of Draper's one-man business. Keeping a stock valued at Pounds 25,000 when the total turnover is unlikely to exceed Pounds 30,000 this year might not, on the face of it, seem a good basis for business. But that is not the whole story. In a dozen freezers in the garages of friends in and around Reading, Draper keeps some 150 or so other dead animals and animal skins. Any of them can be converted into fully mounted animals within a few weeks, and it is his ability to respond to demand in this way that is the mainstay of Animal Instincts. Draper has built up this macabre collection in the 10 years he has been a taxidermist. Over that time he has learned which animals sell and which are best left on ice until a specific request comes up. 'The reason for my large stock of mounted animals is that I need it as the basis of shows and as a permanent exhibit in my home to show people the quality of my work,' said Draper, 37. 'Two years ago when I gave up the shop in Reading that I had run for eight years I was carrying a stock of mounted animals worth Pounds 40,000. 'I managed to reduce that by selling off stock worth Pounds 30,000 to a film hire company, but it has gradually built up again.' A high street presence played a vital role in building up the business. Over the years the sales often barely covered the Pounds 10,000 a year rent. But the exercise was still worthwhile as Draper, who is a goldsmith by trade, also used the premises as the headquarters of the jewellery repair service he was operating as a parallel enterprise. 'I very much doubt if I would be as prosperous as I am now if I had not run the shop for eight years,' Draper said. In the same way he has had a stand at the annual Newbury show for the past five years, but it was only this September's event that made a good profit - Pounds 1,600 worth of sales over the two days, and lots of follow-up callers to his showroom. Two years ago he gave up the shop and sold the jewellery repair business. He invested the proceeds of the sale in converting the roof space of his Edwardian house into a showroom. 'It was a wise move,' Draper said. 'I am in an excellent position here, two minutes from junction 11 of the M4 and on the edge of the countryside. People are happy to drive here to view the stock. It saves me an awful lot of driving. 'Although it was necessary for a few years the shop was a treadmill. At times the rent was approaching half my turnover and there was constant pressure to sell at any price just to make money to pay the bills. I was working all hours, whereas nowadays I can choose. If there is a rush on I do not mind working until one or two in the morning, but if I choose not to and to earn less, I can do so.' Experience has made Draper far more choosy over the animals he goes out to collect. 'I am contracted to collect everything from the zoos and aviaries with which I have an arrangement. But nowadays I go out less frequently to collect animals offered to me by individuals,' he said. 'Overall only 20 to 30 per cent of all the carcasses I collect are usable. The rest have to be disposed of in a farm incinerator.' Draper said none of his specimens are killed for the purposes of taxidermy, though many of the carcasses that come to him have been killed for sport, while others such as foxes, stoats and weasels have been killed for vermin control. But who nowadays wants to buy stuffed animals? 'If they are really keen people rarely stick to one animal but generally try to build up small collections. Like me they tend to be people who are interested in animals and appreciate them for their beauty,' Draper said. 'There is also an ever-increasing market from the theatre, film studios, photographic and advertising agencies and the hire business. 'If I wanted to make a lot more money I would concentrate on that side of the business and also on making models and mock-ups. There is a high demand for these, but I find that sort of work less satisfying. The customers are generally less interested in quality than price. That sort of work gets away from the art of taxidermy, which that is what I really enjoy - plus the beauty of the end product. 'It is however - literally - a dying trade. This is because there is more and more control of the keeping of live animals, and on what you are allowed to do with them when they die. 'Because demand is steadily dropping and the work is so labour-intensive I never expect to be rich. But I reckon I make 60 per cent profit on turnover, and some aspects of the business, like repair work, which I enjoy, can be very profitable. 'If I were hell-bent on expanding fast the easy way I would be tempted to buy carcasses that had been killed illegally. But I am absolutely against this. Besides, I do not think there is a lot of money in it. 'For similar reasons I rarely pay for carcasses. It might encourage people to go out an kill deliberately in order to sell to me.' Draper says another reason why taxidermy is on the decline is that there is virtually no formal training. 'Most museum departments have closed down and I do not know of any technical colleges offering courses in taxidermy,' he said. 'Nearly all practitioners, like me, work on their own. Colleagues fear, as I do, that with so little training available standards will gradually get more and more amateurish. 'When people see animals mounted as though they have got coathangers stuck up their backs they will gradually cease to collect. 'Sadly, taxidermists are themselves becoming an endangered species.'

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Chevron to cut N Sea workforce Chevron UK is to reduce its workforce in the Ninian oil field 100 miles east of Shetland by 25 per cent as part of a wide-ranging reform of offshore manning levels and working practices. About 60 jobs will go - either through early retirement or redundancy. The shift pattern of 14 days on and 14 days off will be changed to a 21/21-day system, which will save Pounds 1m from Ninian's estimated operating expenses for this year of Pounds 85m. The company said the changes had been under consideration for some time, but the 20 per cent fall in oil prices over the past year had caused North Sea operators to seek additional savings. The lower staffing was made possible by combining some jobs, and should not affect safety. Contractors have often worked 21/21-day shifts, but Ninian will be the first North Sea platform where operator staff are on such a system.</p>

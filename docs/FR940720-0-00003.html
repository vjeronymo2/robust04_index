			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24065), the NRC published its proposed rule for FY 1994 establishing the licensing, inspection, and annual fees necessary for the NRC to recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority for FY 1994, less the appropriation received from the NWF. The basic approach, policies, and methodology used in the proposed rule were unchanged from those used to calculate the 10 CFR part 170 professional hourly rate, the specific materials licensing and inspection fees in 10 CFR part 170, and the 10 CFR part 171 annual fees set forth in the final rules published July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31477), July 23, 1992 (57 FR 322691), and July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), with the following exceptions: (1) The Commission has reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions; and (2) in this final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. Resources for these activities had previously been included in overhead, but are now assigned directly to the class of licensees that they support. Because this direct assignment results in a reduction of overhead costs allocated to each FTE, the cost per FTE is about 3 percent less than it would have been without the additional direct assignment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 19, 1994 (59 FR 26097) the NRC amended its fee regulations in 10 CFR part 171 to establish revised FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharges for NRC licensees. The revised surcharges reflect the revised method of allocating low-level waste (LLW) costs adopted by the Commission in the FY 1993 final fee rule published July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666). Refunds/credits totalling $2.2 million will be given to certain NRC materials licensees as a result of the revised surcharges for FY 1991 and FY 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Responses to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC received thirty-three comments on the proposed rule. Although the comment period ended on June 9, 1994, the NRC has reviewed and evaluated all comments received. Copies of all comment letters received are available for inspection in the NRC Public Document room, 2120 L Street, NW (lower level) Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the comments were similar in nature. For evaluation purposes, these comments have been grouped, as appropriate, and addressed as single issues in this final rule. The comments are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Fee Legislation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters noted that NRC had completed its report on fee policy mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and had sent a report to Congress with legislative recommendations. They expressed their agreement with the legislative recommendation in the report that OBRA&hyph;90 be amended to relax the requirement to recover 100 percent of its budget and remove certain costs from the fee base, thereby eliminating many of the burdens they deem to be inequitable. They urged the NRC to work with Congress to modify OBRA&hyph;90 to make the assessment of fees more equitable across the board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The need for legislation is beyond the scope of this rulemaking proceeding. The NRC will continue to work with Congress on fee issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters stated that it is very important for the NRC to control its internal costs in order for the nuclear industry to be successful in reducing overall program costs. One commenter suggested that the NRC consider staff reductions and other management improvements to reduce budget needs based on a decline in the number of materials licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter commended the NRC on its willingness and ability to hold the line on, and indeed reduce, its recoverable budget for FY 1994. While noting that the proposed FY 1994 annual fees for power reactors are lower than those assessed in FY 1993, commenters from utility licensees or their representatives believe that further reductions are possible, especially in the areas where power reactor licensees are required to unfairly subsidize cost recovery for activities that benefit all licensees or for activities that are unrelated to the power reactor class of licensees. While encouraged by the recent recommendations for legislative changes made by the NRC to Congress in the report required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, commenters recommended that NRC consider the following actions it can take now without waiting for legislative changes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Reduce costs by eliminating or deferring lower priority research and generic rulemaking activity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reduce the amount to be collected under part 171 by increasing part 170 licensing and inspection fees;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Raise the lower tier small entity fee; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Use an annual escalation, e.g., CPI or some equivalent index, of small entity fee limits which have stayed at $400 and $1,800 since they were set two years ago.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

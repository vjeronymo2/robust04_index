			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 7 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  is approaching a major crisis in its row over voting procedures  if it accepts new members, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros  Pangalos said here Monday [7 March].    Pangalos, chairman of the EU's Council of Foreign Ministers,  said they had failed to overcome a dispute over a change in the  balance of power if Austria, Finland, Sweden and possibly Norway  are admitted in 1995.    The issue is threatening to wreck the chances that the four  countries will be able to join the Union.    Pangalos said he would turn the matter over to EU heads of  state and government if the foreign ministers failed at another  attempt to resolve the dispute on Tuesday.    Italy on Monday joined Britain and Spain in insisting that  the entry of the three or four newcomers should not affect the  ability of a small number of countries to block controversial  decisions.    The Greek minister added that there had been no progress in  a  dispute between Norway and Spain which is blocking the  Norwegians' entry into the Union.    Spain is trying to gain catch quotas for Norwegian cod as  part of the price for Norway's membership of the EU, a price  which Oslo is steadfastly refusing to pay.    The European Union agreed with Austria, Finland and Sweden  last week on their terms of entry, a decision which will have  little effect if the enlargement process is torpedoed by the  voting quarrel.</p>

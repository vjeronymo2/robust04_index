			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Lagos still hopes to reach policy pact with IMF Nigeria has not abandoned efforts to reach a policy agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Mr Kalu Kalu, the country's finance minister, told a press conference in London yesterday. The minister, who meets British officials today on the first leg of a tour of the main western capitals to explain the government's policy, acknowledged there was little prospect of an early agreement with the Fund. The recent IMF mission to Nigeria had 'no problems on the objectives of the (1994) budget but they expressed reservations on how the objectives we have set ourselves would be achieved by controlling the foreign exchange rate and interest rates,' said Mr Kalu. But he said it remained an open question whether some of the direct controls recently imposed would continue in 1995. Western creditors last night saw this as a hint that the government might be prepared to reconsider its decision to fix the naira's exchange rate at 22 to the US dollar. The free market value is half of that. The minister said he was concerned by rise of arrears in service payments on the country's Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) external debt. Last year arrears reached Dollars 6bn and are expected to exceed Dollars 8.5bn by the end of this year. This assumes that Nigeria will allocate up to 30 per cent of its export earnings for debt servicing, and a projected oil price of Dollars 14 a barrel. If the price dropped below Dollars 14, said the minister, 'we will have to put another hole in our belts', adding that debt service payments were already at the 'barest minimum'.</p>

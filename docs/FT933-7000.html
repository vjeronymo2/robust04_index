			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Foods strong In a market that lacked strong features, the spotlight fell on Northern Foods, which turned out to be the best performer in the FT-SE 100 in percentage terms, following a broker's recommendation. Agency broker Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken visited the company last Friday and issued a strong buy recommendation, predicting 10 per cent earnings and dividend growth in each of the next two years. Investors sent the shares climbing 5 to 277p, an improvement of around 1.7 per cent on the day. Volume was, however, no more than average at 1.9m by the close.</p>

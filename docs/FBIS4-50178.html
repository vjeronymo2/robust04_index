			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] China and Britain are facing a battle over  passports issued to Hong Kong people before and after the change  of sovereignty in 1997. The Chinese Government is likely to  launch its own campaign to promote the special administrative  region (SAR) passports for local people before 1997, while  "ignoring" a British request for help in seeking visa-free  treatment for holders of British National Overseas (BNO)  passports.    China's SAR passport plan will be discussed at a two-day  Preliminary Working Committee sub-group meeting starting in  Beijing this morning. A discussion paper has been compiled by  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and distributed to  members of the sub-group on law and order, who arrived in  Beijing yesterday.    A source said the Chinese Government was almost certain to  reject an earlier request by Britain to help lobby other  countries for visa-free arrangements for holders of the BNO  passports after 1997. "The BNO passport is entirely a matter for  the British Government. It has nothing to do with the Chinese  Government. Also, it might not be appropriate for China to  lobby on behalf of the countries who issued the document," the  source said.    The source said that Beijing would expect SAR passports to  be  more acceptable than BNO passports to the people of Hong Kong  after 1997. "I don't see why the Chinese Government should give  a hand to the British side to lobby other countries over the BNO  passports. "The Chinese Government is confident that the SAR  passports will be accepted widely given that visa-free  arrangements are mutually beneficial. So long as Hong Kong is  still an international city people from all over the world will  expect to continue to have exemption from visas when entering  Hong Kong. If they want that they will also have to exempt  visas for holders of the SAR passports," the source said.    The source maintained that the British Government might  suffer if it decided not to give visa-free treatment to SAR  passport holders. "If they do so, the Chinese Government can  make similar requirements for British nationals when entering  Hong Kong after 1997," he said.    Speaking in Beijing, the Hong Kong co-convenor of the law  and  order sub-group, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, said the promotion work  for the SAR passports should be launched as early as possible to  secure a visa-free deal for its holders. She said preparations  for issuing SAR passports could be made before 1997 but stressed  that the document would only become valid after formal  endorsement by the SAR government. Mrs Fan said it would be  difficult for China to make a commitment that holders of the  British-issued BNO would have entry to the SAR, which was part  of China.</p>

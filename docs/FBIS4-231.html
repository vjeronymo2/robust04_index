			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- The elections should be  postponed -- not only in kwaZulu but in the whole of South  Africa, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] said on Wednesday. IFP  Transvaal political Director Themba Khoza said parties like the  Pan Africanist supported the postponement of the elections. "It  is impressive that the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]  has finally realised the going is too tough to hold elections,"  Mr Khoza said.    He was responding to the conclusion reached on Tuesday by a  joint working committee of the IEC and the South African and  kwaZulu governments that elections could not be held in the  current political climate in kwaZulu.    "But the Transvaal IFP can never support an election  postponed only in Natal and not the rest of the country," Mr  Khoza said.    There were two major obstacles hindering the conduct of  elections -- violence and the constitutional impasse over  regional powers.    "The IEC has finally realised that there is violence. But it  is not only in Natal, it is gripping the whole country. There  are no-go areas everywhere and therefore there can be no free  and fair election throughout South Africa.    "We will need to go flat out to finally defuse the tension  and this cannot be achieved in a short time," Mr Khoza said.    He said unless the dispute over regional powers was  addressed  and the IFP demands for provincial powers were met, there would  always be conflict between political organisations.    "It is important that these two obstacles be addressed  before  we all go to the polls."    IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said in reaction to  the joint report that the political climate in kwaZulu should be  changed and not the election date. He said two inspectors would  determine the effects of the state of emergency in kwaZulu and  would report back to the IEC by Friday.    He said that a decision on further action would be taken on  Saturday.</p>

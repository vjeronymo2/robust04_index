			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY LOST A BROTHER TO BULLETS, TRUCK TO BUREAUCRACY  </P> <P> The family of a Mexican-born man who was shot and killed on an Orange County  freeway in August now faces the loss of the pickup truck that police impounded  for evidence in the case.  </P> <P> City of Orange police had the truck towed from the family's apartment the day  Juan Pedro Trujillo was killed. Now the towing company says the family owes  $300 in accumulated storage fees. If the money is not paid, the family has been  told, the truck will be sold at auction on Oct. 13.  </P> <P> "When they took the truck, we were told that it wouldn't cost us anything  because the towing was going to be paid by the police who took the truck as  part of an investigation to find out who shot Juan," said Trujillo's sister,  Carmen Saragoza.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Police Blame Family  </P> <P> Orange police blame the relatives, saying that when the truck was released by  the department on Aug. 11, the family failed to claim it. However, Saragoza  said the family -- whose members speak little English and have trouble  understanding the legal system -- was told by the towing firm that because of  contracts with the Police Department a $120 fee had to be paid before the truck  could be released.  </P> <P> "What someone should have done was to call us to get the truck out," said  Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo. "They should have complained to us about it and we  would have helped them."  </P> <P> Since then, the storage costs have risen to $631, but Romo said that he  contacted the towing company and they agreed to reduce it to $300. Family  members, however, say they do not have the money to pay even the reduced  amount.  </P> <P> Saragoza said she and her husband, Juan, and their six children share a  two-bedroom Anaheim apartment with another family and "we barely make ends meet  here as you can see."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope to Visit Mexico  </P> <P> The family would like to sell the 1973 Datsun pickup to help pay for a trip to  Mexico to visit Trujillo's grave. Saragoza said they did not attend her  brother's funeral in the rural Mexican village of El Juamuchil because they  could not afford the air fare.  </P> <P> Trujillo, a tire store employee, was struck and killed when someone fired  several rounds from a semiautomatic assault rifle into the truck as he drove on  the Santa Ana Freeway. His passengers -- his brother, Jose, the registered  owner of the truck, and a cousin -- were not hurt. Despite dozens of tips,  police said they have no leads and are continuing to look for a blue Oldsmobile  Cutlass they believe was involved in the shooting.  </P></p>

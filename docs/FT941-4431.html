			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Plan to turn Independent private revealed The consortium bidding for Newspaper Publishing, which owns The Independent, wants to turn the company private, shareholder documents show. The consortium, which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mirror, plans to call an extraordinary general meeting on winning control of the newspaper to seek permission to re-register the company as a private one, adopt new articles of association and appoint Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, main founder of The Independent, as chairman for three years. The documents make clear the consortium does not envisage minority shareholders, and imply that there will be no board representation for Independent Newspapers of Ireland, the largest individual shareholder in the company. The 29.9 per cent stake held by the company chaired by Mr Tony O'Reilly could make it difficult to carry out many of the changes the consortium is planning. The stake could be used to block a range of special resolutions, including plans to take the company private. Apart from MGN, which will be responsible for running everything at The Independent apart from editorial, the consortium includes a group of founders led by Mr Whittam Smith, and two large existing shareholders, El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy. Journalists at The Independent say that in more than 100 pages covering the agreements between the consortium and its members there are no guarantees that existing agreements with staff or conditions of service will be honoured. The main mention of editorial independence in the agreements says: 'Each of the parties agrees with the other parties that it would not be in the commercial interests of itself or the company to alter or attempt to alter the editorial positioning and stance of political independence developed by the company.' Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is expected to decide early next week on whether to refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Labour last night urged the government to attach strict conditions to ensure the continued editorial freedom of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. Mr Robin Corbett, shadow minister for press and broadcasting, wants Newspaper Publishing to have an uneven number of directors with Mirror Group Newspapers entitled to only a minority of them.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Back to work a speedier way: The EC is seeking to redress the balance between worker protection and labour market flexibility When a Spanish businessman has a profitable year he does not invest in plant and equipment to expand his business and create jobs. Instead, he puts money aside to cover the cost of sacking workers when the market wanes. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, sometimes tells this story to businessmen to illustrate how the high costs of labour protection have contributed to his country's unemployment level of 22 per cent, the highest in the European Community. For the leader of a socialist government to suggest reducing labour protection as a key to job creation is indicative of a new openness in the EC unemployment debate - which has spread to the European Commission as it prepares a study of the link between jobs and competitiveness. The Commission is examining whether the high cost of employment and high protection of European workers is one reason why so few people have jobs. Only 60 per cent of people of working age have jobs, compared with 75 per cent plus in the US and Japan, and half of Europe's 17m unemployed have been without work for more than one year. While the Commission is not considering abandoning its commitment to minimum employment rights as enshrined in the social chapter, an increasing number of officials are searching for a new balance between protection and deregulation. 'Relaxing the rules governing hiring and firing is not the only answer but some countries do need to loosen up a lot more,' says a senior Commission official. For the past decade, much of the EC has been experiencing growth virtually without any net increase in jobs. Even countries which have had above average growth, such as France, Italy and Ireland, have seen no significant increase in employment. Given the gradual increase in female workforce participation, the Commission estimates that merely to reduce unemployment from 11 per cent to 7 per cent requires the creation of 10m jobs before 2000. The rise in EC unemployment since the early 1970s has as many causes as there are countries. There are also significant differences between countries in the way that unemployment is counted. In Spain only those on the unemployment register qualify for free health care, thereby inflating the jobless figure. Nevertheless, EC countries do share several problems and could learn from each other's experiences in trying to tackle them. Debate across Europe is now focused on four main areas of reform: The high costs of firing and the restrictions on part-time and temporary work. It may seem perverse to make it easier to fire people when the aim is to increase employment levels. But in increasingly open and competitive markets, employers, large and small, will only hire if they know they can fire when the going gets tough. The average cost of firing someone in the EC is 22 weeks' pay (26 weeks for white-collar workers and 16 for blue-collar), and most countries require statutory consultation with unions or the state. Denmark, Ireland and the UK have fewest restrictions; Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal and the Netherlands have the greatest; Belgium, France and Germany lie in between. Many southern European states with their low workforce participation rates and high long-term unemployment illustrate the point that the more regulation there is to protect full-time jobs, the fewer employers will offer. 'The legacy of regulation in southern Europe stems from a time when product markets too were highly regulated, but with the liberalisation of markets the full-time employment guarantee has to be loosened too,' says Mr David Grubb, a labour market expert at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Spain and Italy, where it can cost more than two years' pay to sack someone from a large company, are in the process of cutting that amount and making the negotiating period shorter. There has also been some reform of the tight regulations that southern European countries have inherited governing part-time and temporary work. In France and Spain, where temporary contract work was liberalised in the 1980s, more than half the long-term unemployed found part-time work. In Spain, nearly 40 per cent of all employees are now on temporary contracts compared with an EC average of 9 per cent. Some labour market economists argue that increasing part-time work does not increase employment overall but repackages a given number of full-time jobs into a larger number of insecure part-time or temporary ones. This argument still finds strong support in Italy, which has the least part-time and temporary work in the EC, and which until last month banned private employment agencies such as Manpower. It may, indeed, be undesirable to allow temporary work to reach the level it has in Spain, where the government is now offering employers subsidies to convert temporary jobs into permanent ones. But the evidence from France and the Netherlands shows that part-time and temporary jobs are a useful way for employers to test out employees and that they can often lead to full-time jobs. The relatively high cost of labour and, in particular, the burden of high payroll taxes. One of the most straightforward reasons for the EC's inferior performance on job creation compared with the US and Japan is pay. The pay of EC workers increased at an average of 4 per cent a year in real terms during the 1980s while in the US and Japan it was virtually static. The French government has just come up with a novel scheme to offer subsidies to companies where the workers take a cut in real wages to preserve jobs; but it is difficult, in the short-term, for governments to have a direct impact on wage bargaining. They can more easily do something about the high health and social security contributions paid by employers, as well as reducing their own role in wage setting. The Italian government, for example, has recently abolished the Scala Mobile which linked pay rises to inflation, while the French minimum wage scheme which, according to many studies, has reduced youth employment, is gradually being phased out. Payroll taxes on employers, which add on average 30 per cent to the EC's wage costs, are coming under scrutiny everywhere. In Denmark the payroll addition is only 3 per cent and in the UK 13 per cent, but in France, Italy and Belgium the average figure is 45 per cent and often much more for higher paid employees. 'For historical reasons some countries loaded a large part of the social security burden on employers - there was no other way to collect the revenue,' says Mr Peter Burgess of UK pay analysts Incomes Data Services. But the burdens on employers are increasing, not diminishing, the spread of informal employment in many EC countries, especially Spain, Greece and Italy. Few recession-hit European governments are in a position to carry the burden of payroll taxes themselves. But the Belgian government is trying to reduce the social security contributions of employers in export industries by introducing a national energy tax, and the French government intends to cut employers' contributions to family allowances. As UK ministers point out, the model for many reforms is the low payroll tax, easier hire and fire, British labour market. For the low-productivity/low-wage economies of southern Europe the UK may hold lessons. Arguably, the UK has developed a highly deregulated labour market because of its historically open-market economy. Southern European countries have tended to mimic this pattern since joining the EC, and their once highly regulated labour markets are following suit. UK-style flexibility can also offset disadvantages such as poor education and training and low labour mobility, which beset the southern countries However, the British way is less relevant to the high pay and high productivity northern European countries, according to Mr Terry Ward, an economic adviser to the European Commission. In the Netherlands and Germany, long-term employer-employee commitments at the workplace and centralised pay bargaining, plus the regulations which accompany them, may have contributed to their high value-added economies. While employment in the UK has been riding a roller-coaster - up in the late 1980s and down in the early 1990s - the three countries with the lowest unemployment - the Netherlands, west Germany, and Luxembourg - have all been severely regulated. The low labour-intensity of the service sector. With unemployment rising fast in most northern countries, there is still a case for targeted deregulation, especially in the service sector, which is much less labour intensive in the EC than in Japan or the US. Unless the service sector can absorb the jobs lost in manufacturing, Germany could face persistent structural unemployment, as a result of unification and competitive adjustment. Loosening the regulations governing some jobs - for instance, electricity repairmen and other domestic service providers - could lead to job creation. 'We have cut ourselves off from many of the labour-intensive service sector jobs in Europe by importing immigrants to do them. You just have to compare refuse collection in France, where it is a low status job done by immigrants, with the same job in Sweden, where it is dignified and well paid,' says Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of Unice, the European employers' body. More efficient targeting of state aid and active labour market policies. The OECD says there can still be an important role for the state through active measures such as spending on training the unemployed, and on financial support for job-sharing. The Dutch government has led the way on job-sharing by insisting that all new employees in the public sector are limited to a 32-hour week. The Belgian government has just agreed that workers over 55 can work half time, receiving a mixture of pay and pension, thereby releasing jobs for the unemployed. The UK government has abandoned incentives, introduced in the early 1980s, for public sector employees to split jobs, and has been suspicious of wage subsidies, a relatively inefficient form of job creation. But as the country with the highest overtime in the EC, the UK could examine how to convert some of the overtime into new jobs without upsetting low-paid employees who need the extra money. Where labour policy activism is higher, long-term unemployment tends to be lower, according to some labour market economists. For example, compulsory interviews and counselling for the long-term unemployed have had positive results in Britain and France, where nearly 30 per cent of those interviewed found either a job or a training place. Job clubs, self-help clubs for the unemployed, have also been a successful British innovation now being copied in Portugal. An examination of different responses to long-term unemployment in the EC, under the Ergo programme, concluded recently that the creation of businesses and the encouragement of self-employment was more worthwhile than 'make-work' schemes - which may come as a surprise to some member states. It also found that counselling measures were the most cost-effective means of getting people back to work. Counselling is particularly effective in those EC countries where unemployment benefits do not run out after a period of time. Such open-ended benefits, unless carefully designed, can throw up a web of disincentives to work, especially in part-time and temporary jobs. Some people can be dissuaded from taking jobs by the high initial cost of giving up their benefits, and they need 'back to work' grants to bridge the gap, as in Japan. Getting Europe back to work requires more than renewed economic growth. No EC government wants to emulate the harsher aspects of the US labour market, where two-thirds of employed workers are subject to instant dismissal and far fewer unemployed workers than in Europe qualify for benefits. But all the signs are that the trend of the 1980s towards deregulation is picking up speed. Governments as well as Brussels have grasped the importance of labour market reform and are groping towards a new balance between employment protection and flexibility.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports from Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, say  Portuguese police are cooperating with their Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] counterparts.  Reports even say that Portuguese police are preparing to  compete with Spanish in the training of personnel and, if  possible, to reequip the MPLA-PT's Riot Police.    The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel learned from  reliable sources today that a Portuguese National Republican  Guard, GNR, team made up of two senior officers visited Luanda  earlier this month to discuss concrete cooperation proposals.  This source also disclosed that (?10) MPLA-PT policemen left  for the Portuguese capital soon afterward and are currently  undergoing training at the GNR Training Center.    Observers believe that Portugal and Spain are already  involved in a war of influence over the Angolan police force.    One thing is certain: In the midst of all this, the Angolan  people do not have food, but they can now count on a beefed-up  police corps, which should ensure intensified intimidation and  repression.</p>

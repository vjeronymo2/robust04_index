			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Sema Group Buys Swedish SKD"] </F>   [Text] The French-British Sema Group has just bought a 75  percent interest in Sweden's third-largest software house, SKD  Business, for 250 million kronor (about 175 million francs). The  SKD's activities are mainly in the field of facilities  management (FM) and system integration. The deal had been under  discussion for some time. It was felt as early as the end of  August that the Sema Group would be the only remaining suitor.  It appears that reasons of state were the only thing holding up  the transaction, since the SKD was still under the control of  the Swedish Government, which is involved in a privatization  process. There was a year of negotiations during which Swedish  authorities first rejected Cap Gemini Sogeti, whose vague  impulses in the direction of external growth had a cooling  effect on the government. Then they turned down the EDS, which  did not provide sufficient guarantees that it would retain the  SKD's existing structures. For the final six months, the Sema  Group was the only company still in the running, and the Swedish  Ministry of Finance eventually gave its approval. Besides its FM  activities and its services as a consultant on system  integration, which account for 57 percent and 29 percent  respectively of the Swedish firm's turnover (1.126 billion  kronor [as published; possibly ECU's intended] in 1992, or 7.96  billion francs), the Sema Group is also taking over the  information services division (14 percent of turnover). Not to  mention a customer list that includes such multinationals as ABB  and Volvo and even the Swedish Government. As far as the  French-British software house is concerned, a direct consequence  of this operation is that FM will now account for over 20  percent of its turnover, compared to 15.5 percent previously.  Based on the SKD's performance last year, that will increase the  Sema Group's business by approximately 90 million pounds. Last  year the Sema Group's turnover was 416 million pounds, or about  3.88 billion francs. The Swedish market for information  services, which now becomes the Sema Group's third-largest  geographic area after Great Britain and France, is dominated  essentially by outsourcing and system integration. Those two  sectors account for over half the turnover, which this year is  estimated at 1.27 billion ECU's (about 8.4 billion francs),  according to the Ovom market study firm, which is forecasting a  growth rate of 10 percent until 1996. There will be no turning  to the market or calling on stockholders to finance this  transaction, whose "modest" cost is therefore being financed by  the Sema Group directly. But an unanswered question is the fate  of the remaining 25 percent of the SKD's stock, one notable  owner of which is Transpac Scandinavia, an SKD subsidiary in  which France Telecom has a 40 percent stake. This might be a  good opportunity for the state-owned firm as part of its joint  venture with the Sema Group.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (13): Salvation sought from US - Multi-media offers hope of a Japanese electronics revival To the bureaucrats in the deep, dark halls of Kasumigaseki, where Japan's ministries are concentrated, the idea of a national information infrastructure, first proposed by US Vice-President Al Gore, must have seemed inspired. For the past few years, as the country's leading corporations suffered falling profits, business leaders and bureaucrats have been hard-pressed to come up with a solution to reviving the slumping economy. The consumer electronics and car industries, which until recently had been significant engines of growth, are deemed unlikely to assume that role again, if and when the recession ends. The recovery in these industries, where demand has matured, is expected to be gradual and mild. As the yen's sharp appreciation has forced consumer electronics companies to move more production to lower-cost regions and encouraged car makers to localise manufacturing, their impact in spurring domestic growth is likely to be subdued. An information superhighway, as proposed by Mr Gore, is increasingly seen as providing the best answer to boosting economic growth. To the delight of the bureaucrats, it has all the ingredients of a grand national project: potentially enormous social benefits for a wide public, regulatory implications, capacity to provide large numbers of jobs, huge investment spending and an opportunity for industrial policy-making. The plan, according to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, is to have fibre-optic cable laid throughout the country by the year 2010, for Japan's very own information superhighway. This will probably (more likely than not) be the job of NTT, the telecommunications company that is 66 per cent owned by the government. The MPT forecasts that by that time the market for multimedia - the convergence of consumer electronics, computing and telecommunications which will spur demand for using the advanced information infrastructure - will be worth Y123 trillion and employ 2.4m people. For its part, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry calculates that in six years multimedia will grow into a market worth up to Y70 trillion, or 5.9 per cent of total GNP. 'The source of economic value is shifting from manufacturing activity to intellectual activity,' Miti said in a report on its advanced information technology programme published in May. But since Japan has been relatively slow to make use of advances in information technology, much more needs to be done before the country can reap the benefits of the new information age. Indeed, compared with the US, Japan appears still to live in the stone age of information technology. Bringing the country into line with the US will be a formidable task. Take computers and cable TV, for example, which are expected to play a significant role in the spread of multimedia in the US. While PC penetration is 42 per cent in the US, it is only about 10 per cent in Japan, says Mr David Kellar, an analyst at IDC, the information technology consultancy. And while 66 per cent of PCs in the US are hooked up to local area networks, the figure drops to just 17 per cent in Japan, according to Miti. The situation is similar for cable TV with only 4.5 per cent of Japanese homes connected to cable networks, compared with over 60 per cent in the US. Without greater penetration of such equipment and networks, and a greater familiarity among potential users with such advanced communications and broadcasting services, the expensive network of fibre-optic cable which the MPT wants to see built could be wasted. 'The MPT has announced ambitious plans for investment in multimedia, but it has not considered sufficiently whether the equipment will actually be bought by consumers,' worries Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice president of Matsushita. Mr Murase is concerned that Japanese consumers have not had sufficient experience with data networks, for example, to make use of all the fancy new services that would become available through multimedia. 'Access to networks has to be made much easier,' he notes. Similar doubts exist with respect to the new kinds of services that multimedia is expected to generate. 'No matter how much technology advances, what matters is whether there is a use for that technology,' says Mr Akira Kuwahara, vice president of Toshiba. Like many other executives in the Japanese electronics industry, Mr Kuwahara, lacks confidence in Japan's ability to come up with creative uses for multimedia. Although Japanese companies have the skills to make the advanced hardware that multimedia will require, the country lacks an environment that can nurture the creative talent and entrepreneurial spirit needed to spawn the software and services that will make multimedia practical and stimulate demand for its use. 'Toshiba is staffed by people who wear blue business suits and graduated from the science, technology and law departments of universities. If you go to the Time Warner offices in California, people wear black suits with long hair tied back in a pony-tail and have studied things we've never heard of,' he exclaims. 'The vitality in the US is extraordinary.' Japan lacks a dynamic software industry, such as Hollywood; the mobility of talent that is found in the US, which is crucial to generating new ideas for new businesses, is lacking in Japan. 'That is Japan's handicap,' says Mr Kuwahara. At the same time, deregulation of the information and telecommunications sectors will be crucial to creating an environment in which such new services can thrive. The bureaucrats also recognise the many obstacles that Japan faces in becoming an advanced information society. 'In Japan, the problem is that compared with the hardware, high quality contents and applications have not been supplied sufficiently,' Miti states. 'In order to develop multimedia software, it is important to nurture talented people who can combine creative expression with information processing skills.' The bureaucrats' solution is to set up pilot experiments in multimedia, encourage its use in public institutions such as town halls, hospitals and schools, and gradually build a base for the spread of new multimedia services. Businesses have a more short-term answer. To overcome the disadvantages Japan faces, 'we need to tie up with those who have what we don't have,' Toshiba's Mr Kuwahara says. Toshiba already has a stake in Time Warner, which gives it an entry into the emerging US multimedia market. Other electronics companies as well as NTT, the telecommunications company, have been busy in forging links with US software companies from start-ups such as 3DO to well-established giants such as Microsoft. The pace may be much slower in Japan than in the US, but as such moves gather pace, MPT says, 'the year 1994 can be considered the first of the Multimedia Era'.</p>

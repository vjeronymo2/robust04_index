			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Nigerian crisis may delay handover NIGERIA'S military rulers opened talks yesterday on an electoral crisis that has increased fear that their plan to hand power to civilians could end in chaos, Reuter reports from Abuja. Officials in Abuja, the capital, did not rule out the possibility that President Ibrahim Babangida might delay his January 2 departure. But they said other options were likely to be studied first. 'It depends on what the NEC (National Electoral Commission) recommends. But there is a climate building up (for Gen Babangida) to extend,' one official said. 'If he did that, it would not be of his own volition. He would be compelled by circumstances,' the official added. Any extension of military rule is likely to be viewed with concern by the west, at a time when Nigeria is seeking loans for ambitious industrial projects, including a big liquefied natural gas complex. Gen Babangida and the 21-member Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) were discussing an electoral commission report on fraud allegations in recent party-run presidential primaries. Widespread charges of cheating led the military to suspend the primaries in which Nigeria's two government-created parties were selecting their candidates for presidential elections on December 5. Some officers, supported by Nigeria's 30 civilian state governors, are known to be ambivalent on Gen Babangida handing over to civilians in the present atmosphere of acrimony among civilian politicians. The governors on Wednesday ended a two-day meeting in Lagos, with a statement saying they opposed 'a chaotic and uncertain handover that may lead . . . to another military intervention'.</p>

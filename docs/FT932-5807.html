			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Accounting for Chance in matters professional Michael Chance has been appointed executive counsel to the joint disciplinary scheme, the accountancy profession's highest body in the UK which considers matters of public interest. His post has been created as part of a restructuring of the operation of the scheme. As counsel, he will be responsible for examining cases to establish those worth pursuing. He will coordinate the work of investigating accountants employed to study the issues, and will act as prosecutor on behalf of the scheme in front of a committee of inquiry if he decides action should proceed. The new procedure will, for the first time, permit cross-examination of witnesses. 'I see my role as one who must take action where it is needed, but also be robust in deciding when action isn't needed, despite the pressures,' he said. The same debate is taking place at the Serious Fraud Office, which Chance helped set up and of which he was deputy director in 1987-90.</p>

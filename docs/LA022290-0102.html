			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLY COACHING LEGEND IS BACK, SHOOTING FOR CHAMPIONSHIP AGAIN  </P> <P> Poly High School is driving for another CIF Southern Section basketball title  under Coach Ron Palmer, just as the Jackrabbits did in 1984 when they were 31-2  and also tacked on a state championship.  </P> <P> Morlon Wiley, Terry Stallworth and Chris Sandle were the main players then, and  Palmer was winding up a highly successful 11-year career. He would soon leave  for Cal State Long Beach, making the almost unheard-of jump from high school to  college Division I, a jump that would turn out to be disastrous.  </P> <P> Now, the stars are Willie McGinest, Roderick Hannibal, Melvin Jones and Tyus  Edney, who have the talent for which Poly has always been known. They looked  sharp Tuesday night in a 74-59 victory over Simi Valley in a quarterfinal  playoff game at Lakewood High.  </P> <P> And Palmer is back, still wearing his dark green sports coat, sitting hunched  over with elbows on knees, holding up signs that read "time out" or "1-3-1" and  offering sharp advice to his players and the officials.  </P> <P> "Hey, ref, what did he do? This is a contact sport," he complained when a foul  was called on a Poly player.  </P> <P> "Three seconds? Oh, come on," he said in disbelief, shaking his head and  breaking into his familiar smile when an official ruled that a Jackrabbit was  in the free-throw lane too long.  </P> <P> "Why is that so hard to remember?" he asked his team sternly after someone  missed an assignment.  </P> <P> During his first tenure at Poly, Palmer's record was 270-51. He won nine Moore  League titles and was in seven CIF championship games, winning three. He went  out with the state crown in 1984.  </P> <P> "I kind of remember that team, I remember coming to the games," said McGinest,  a preteen then but now an imposing 6-foot-7 center, after he scored 20 points  and 11 rebounds against Simi Valley.  </P> <P> McGinest is also a football linebacker who is going to USC. Some think he might  be the next Lawrence Taylor.  </P> <P> "I just remember how good they were," McGinest went on. "And I remember Palmer.  I had heard a lot about him. He was like a legend, a famous coach. But I never  met him until he came back this season."  </P> <P> Palmer, after three seasons and a 23-64 record at Cal State Long Beach, was out  of basketball the last two seasons. He returned to Poly last May to replace  Chris Kinder, who was forced out.  </P> <P> Kinder was 79-52 in five seasons, but his sin was not winning the CIF  championship, something not easily forgiven at Poly, a school that has a  basketball reputation as a junior UCLA.  </P> <P> "It's been an exceptional year," Palmer said Tuesday morning at the storefront  school near downtown Long Beach where he teaches junior high students who have  had discipline problems.  </P> <P> He looked fresh and relaxed, unlike the day three years ago when he resigned  under pressure at the university. Beaten down by the losing, he was tired and  thin, and his stomach hurt.  </P> <P> "That was an aging experience," he said. "This is a totally different world  than the college world. I felt my age, I don't feel it now. I'm 52 and I feel  like I'm 30 something, doing what I've always done, coaching."  </P> <P> Poly is 24-2 this season and has won 17 consecutive games. The Jackrabbits'  only losses have been to Artesia and, in a December tournament in Texas, to  Denton (Tex.) High.  </P> <P> Palmer was 4-23 and 7-22 his first two seasons at Cal State Long Beach before  improving to 12-19.  </P> <P> The losses came with such regularity at the university that they eventually  numbed Palmer. "In high school losing hurts more because you're always in the  game, especially at Poly," he said.  </P> <P> With the 49ers, Palmer was at first plagued with mediocre talent. When he did  get some athletes, they had a difficult time scoring, just as the good athletes  do at Cal State Long Beach today.  </P> <P> "People out-jumped us and out-quicked us (at Cal State Long Beach)," he said.  "Here, we can jump over your heads and put it in the basket.  </P> <P> Palmer believes that the big, talented players who can do everything on the  court continue to go to schools such as North Carolina, Nevada Las Vegas and  Georgetown.  </P> <P> "At Long Beach State you get some athletes, but guys who can do it all,  including shoot, are at other schools.  </P> <P> "I found out there was a vast difference in ability across the country. On the  East Coast you have guys 6-7 and 6-8 dribbling the ball like a guard. They have  more skills. And they play a more physical style that helps players adjust from  high school to college. Here (in high school) a player gets touched and it's a  foul."  </P> <P> Palmer points to several reasons for his failure at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> "I always thought we probably tried to achieve too much too soon, playing  Georgetown and other nationally ranked teams," he said.  </P> <P> He also complained about having had to play the first 13 games on the road his  second season and not being able to hold full-team practices because a gym  renovation forced night practices, which some of the players could not attend  because of classes.  </P> <P> And he was distressed because he said he could never guarantee decent-paying  summer jobs for his players.  </P> <P> In his last season at the university, which ended with eight consecutive  losses, team morale had broken down and his quiet style was often criticized by  players and team boosters.  </P> <P> "It was getting to me," he recalled. "I hold everything back, I think it was  ready to come out. When you lose, all those things start to surface, nerves are  frayed. If you have problems, winning will take care of all of them, and  unhappy kids will be happy."  </P> <P> Now Palmer is back where he is comfortable and where defeats are rarely a  problem.  </P> <P> "I appreciate winning more now than I did at Poly before," he said. "I took it  for granted before."  </P> <P> Despite the travails of the intervening years, changes in Palmer are  indiscernible.  </P> <P> "You can tell his college experience has added to his coaching ability, but  he's basically the same type of coach," said Erroll Parker, a Poly assistant  coach. "He's very well organized, he's a good teacher and he's blessed with  talent and good support."  </P> <P> And so the legend has come home, although it seems like he never left.  </P></p>

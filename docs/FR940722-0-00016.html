			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA disagrees that shareholders would be unable to understand and assess the senior officer compensation disclosures. In addition to reporting ``dollar amounts'' of compensation paid, institutions are required to provide a discussion of the compensation plans to aid the reader's understanding of the disclosures. Moreover, nothing in the regulations prevents an institution from providing explanations of the market or any other factors used in the determination of compensation. Management always has the discretion to provide such explanations if they feel they are needed to fairly portray the amounts being paid to senior officers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA Board recognizes that it should, to the extent possible, balance shareholders' needs to receive meaningful information concerning their institutions and individual privacy concerns. As expressed in the FCA Board's Policy Statement on Regulatory Philosophy, ``The FCA Board is mindful that most regulatory activities will involve competing considerations and is committed to considering and weighing those competing considerations and arriving at thoughtful regulatory judgments''. (Published June 22, 1994 at 59 FR 32189) Therefore, in reaching a balance between the competing considerations regarding the proposed regulation, substantial modifications were made to the senior officer disclosure requirements and are more fully explained in the section-by-section discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Section-by-Section Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 611.400_Compensation of Bank Board Members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters generally expressed support for proposed &sect;611.400, Bank Director Compensation. The FCC stated that the proposed procedure for adjusting the bank directors' compensation ceiling and the approval process for exceeding the statutory limitation in ``exceptional circumstances'' seemed to be both fair and well-considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA is adopting the amendments to &sect;611.400 as proposed with two modifications. The proposed rule included a 25-percent cap on the amount by which the FCA Board would approve a waiver of the statutory limitation on bank director compensation. The FCA received two requests for waivers of the statutory limitation since publishing the proposed rule. Based on its operational experience in reviewing those requests, the FCA Board determined that a 30-percent cap on the amount by which it would approve waivers of the statutory limitation would be more appropriate. In addition, the requirement in proposed &sect;611.400(c)(3) that the FCA respond to requests for waivers of the statutory limitation within 30 days was modified by extending the agency's self-imposed response time to 60 days. The FCA will respond to requests for waivers as quickly as possible and anticipates replying to the vast majority of requests in well under 60 days. Nevertheless, there may be unusual circumstances that would necessitate a longer period to gather and analyze pertinent information related to the request, and the longer response period should reduce the frequency of formal extensions of the response period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA recognizes the difficulty in predicting all the exceptional circumstances under which a bank may desire to seek a waiver of the statutory limitation on bank director compensation. Therefore, the FCA would like to clarify that &sect;611.400(d)(3), pertaining to a bank's policy on bank director compensation, need only address exceptional circumstances that the bank's board is able to identify. The policy should also include a procedure for evaluating, on a case-by-case basis, other extraordinary circumstances that may arise where the bank's board would consider seeking a waiver of the limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

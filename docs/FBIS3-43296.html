			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the African National Congress issued in </F> Marshalltown on 3 January]    [Text] The ANC is appalled at the apparent refusal of the  government to deploy security forces in northern Natal. This  follows a request to the government from the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] to deploy security forces in four areas of  northern Natal to defend lives and property against the  deteriorating security situation in the area.    In his response, Law and Order spokesperson Craig Kotze is  quoted on as stating that the TEC has no powers to order the  government to deploy security forces in Natal and that such  deployment would amount to an invasion.    Kotze's reaction is based on narrow petty political  interests  that seek to curry favours with the National Party political  allies. Coming in the wake of today's media reports that over 38  people were killed in Natal in violence related incidents over  the New Year weekend, his statement is both insensitive to the  plight of victims of violence and arrogant to the extreme.    The ANC [African National Congress] is shocked that despite  police reports that the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] had launched  a campaign to drive ANC members from some areas and more  violence was likely in the run-up to elections. It will be  unfortunate if the perception is to deepen that the government  has allowed the violence in Natal to escalate because it views  black lives as cheap.    As far as the ANC is concerned, all self governing  territories are bound by the provisions of the TEC act. In this  context we expect these provisions to apply to all  self-governing territories without fear or favour.    The primary duty of maintaining law and order in all areas  of  the country, including self-governing territories lies primarily  with the South African security forces.    In terms of the Self-governing Territories Constitution Act  21 of 1971 the homeland governments have no right to interfere  with the "powers, entry into and presence of the South African  security forces in the maintenance of public peace and order and  the preservation of internal security in and the safety of the  area concerned and the Republic".    The act further places the onus for the maintenance of  order,  peace and internal security in such areas (self-governing  territories) on the South African Police (SAP). Clearly the  government has a moral and legal obligation arising from the  self-governing territories act to bring peace and stability to  Natal.    It is ironic that the government which over the past years  found it possible to detain, maim, and murder anti-apartheid  activists residing in such areas should today find it  politically inexpedient to bring about peace and stability in  the same areas. We ask: What interests does the National Party  government have in the escalation of violence particularly in  the run-up to elections in Natal?    The ANC and the public will hold the South African  Government  accountable for the escalation of violence as a result of the  IFP plans to drive out members of the ANC from certain areas of  Natal.</p>

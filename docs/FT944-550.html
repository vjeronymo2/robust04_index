			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Lone Star state outshines NY It has not been a great year for New York. Not only did the state vote out of office the most distinctive US governor, Mr Mario Cuomo, but it will wake up today to the news that it can no longer call itself the second most populous state in the union after California. That honour, say estimates from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, now belongs to Texas. The Lone Star state added a net 356,000 residents in 1994 to reach 18.4m. New York's nugatory 16,000 growth left it at 18.2m. The reasons for the advance of Texas were broad-based, showing the extent to which it has recovered from its early and deep recession in the 1980s. Its residents were the second most fecund in the country, with births outstripping deaths by 188,000. It was also among the most attractive to immigrants, adding a net 86,000 from other states and a further 75,000 from overseas. New York recorded a natural increase of 114,000 and a foreign immigrant rise of 101,000, but this was almost entirely offset by the more than 200,000 leaving the state for greener pastures elsewhere. But at least New York had the consolation of discovering that California is no longer the golden land of opportunity, at least for US citizens. Its net loss of residents to other states rose to 426,000 (1.4 per cent of its population), a testament to the seriousness of its recent economic problems. California still grew overall, by a net 214,000 to 31.4m, on the strength of a natural increase of 258,000 and foreign immigration estimated at 272,000. This last figure only refers to legal immigrants. California's loss mostly stayed out west. Eight of the ten fastest-growing states were in the region. Neighbouring Nevada was the US leader with a growth of 5.4 per cent, followed in order by Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana and Oregon. Most of these states are underpopulated, which means that the largest numerical increase (a net 1.3m people) was recorded in the geographic South. Texas was followed by Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, all in the US top ten as measured by new heads. At the other end of the scale of attractiveness, Connecticut, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia all suffered population loss. The US capital, losing a net 9,000, brought up the rear and, as its hopes of statehood fade further, has fewer people than even Vermont.</p>

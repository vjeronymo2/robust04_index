			<p>BFN     [Text] Trade Minister Satrio Budiarjo Yudono has told  newsmen in Jakarta that Indonesia hopes all developed countries  will be united in observing the agreement on liberal, fair, and  non-discriminative international trade based on the GATT  framework.    He said that following the signing of the final act of the  Uruguay Round trade talks, Indonesia and other developing  countries hoped their export products could gain more market  access in the developed countries.    According to the minister, it is important for developed  countries to open their markets to goods from developing  countries considering that Indonesia, one of the developing  countries, had already adopted a liberal trade policy in line  with the outcome of the Uruguay Round talks. He said that apart  from that, the developed countries should provide technical  assistance to developing countries instead of attaching other  conditional clauses to the trade agreement.    It is hoped that the Uruguay Round trade talks on textiles  and agriculture could create a trade policy that is not  contradictory to the agreement reached at Uruguay Round talks  and that trade discrimination against developing countries will  be eliminated.</p>

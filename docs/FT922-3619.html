			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Senior executives deny Pounds 14m Eagle Trust theft MORE than Pounds 14m was stolen from Eagle Trust, the Midlands mini-conglomerate, by former senior executives after the company's 1987 rights issue failed following the stock market crash, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard yesterday. The money was laundered through offshore companies before being used to help repay the Pounds 15m underwriting commitment entered into by Mr John Ferriday, the former Eagle Trust chief executive, Mr John Rogers QC said. When shares in Eagle Trust were suspended in May 1989, it was suspected that a fraud had taken place that had left the company insolvent. 'Those suspicions were justified,' Mr Rogers said. 'For more than 12 months there had been substantial thefts of money and other assets belonging to the company by senior employees.' He was opening the prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud Office against Mr Ferriday; Mr Richard Smith, a former Eagle Trust managing director; Mr Martin Baker, a former Eagle Trust finance director; and Mr Leslie Goodwin, a former chairman of Connect Parcels, a delivery company. Mr Ferriday faces 11 charges including the theft of Pounds 12.25m and Pounds 1.7m in shares, false accounting and providing false information. Mr Smith faces four charges of theft involving Pounds 11.5m and one of deception. Mr Baker faces four theft charges involving Pounds 12.25m. Mr Goodwin faces two theft charges involving Pounds 11.5m and one of providing false information. All deny the charges. The fraud took place after Eagle Trust's takeover bid in October 1987 for the Samuelson group, a supplier of photographic equipment, Mr Rogers said. Eagle Trust made a shares-and-cash offer for the company supported by a rights issue to raise extra money. However, the stock market crash of Oct-ober led to the Eagle Trust share price falling from 30p to 20p. Samuelson shareholders chose the cash option, while the rights issue failed. Mr Ferriday was left with a personal sub-underwriting commitment of Pounds 15m, Mr Rogers said. The fraud centred on three thefts, he continued. In December 1987, Pounds 13.5m was stolen from the company by Mr Ferriday and Mr Smith. They were assisted by Mr Baker and Mr Goodwin, who passed the money through Connect Parcels. The money then passed through two offshore companies before being returned to the UK to help pay off Mr Ferriday's debt. In January 1988, Mr Ferriday stole shares in the Howden engineering group worth Pounds 3m from Eagle Trust, Mr Rogers said. In the autumn of 1988, helped by Mr Baker, Mr Ferriday stole a further Pounds 1.25m from Eagle Trust, he added. The trial is expected to last about six months.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / US backs Yeltsin move to serve full term RUSSIAN political groups yesterday denounced President Boris Yeltsin for going back on his commitment to stand for re-election next June, but the US pledged support for the Russian leader 'as long as he is promoting democracy'. Mr Yeltsin confirmed at the weekend that he intended to serve out his full term until June 1996, but added, according to the Interfax news agency, that he would not stand again. 'Everyone knows how many fateful blows I have suffered. It's too much for one man,' he said. Opponents and some supporters of Mr Yeltsin criticised the president's decision, which he announced to media editors on Saturday. His supporters conceded that Mr Yeltsin was now set to serve as a 'very strong' executive president under a newly agreed constitution. However, in a US television interview, President Bill Clinton said: 'As long as he continues to promote human rights, democratic and economic reforms, the US should still support him.' Mr Clinton expressed uncertainty as to what Mr Yeltsin had said and meant on Saturday, but declined to criticise his decision. Mr Yeltsin understood, he added, 'that he is not the only source of democratic power in Russia' - and next month's parliamentary elections should demonstrate this. The Russian president's decision, which appeared to take his closest aides by surprise, was part of a series of important alterations to the constitution agreed privately between Mr Yeltsin and regional leaders last week. It means the reversal of a concession he made to opponents in September when he dissolved parliament and called for fresh parliamentary elections in December. Criticism came from those in parties opposed to Mr Yeltsin, including Mr Viktor Aksyuchits of the Christian Democratic Movement and Mr Mikhail Lapshin of the Agrarian party - who described it as 'a real deception of the people'. Some of the president's supporters were also critical. Mr Konstantin Borovoi, leader of the Party of Economic Freedom, said the president 'cannot cancel his decision . . . because it is a commitment to the citizens of Russia and to the world community'. Mr Borovoi said the presidential elections could only be called off by the parliament to be elected on December 12 - a point which Mr Yeltsin has himself made in the past. In defence of Mr Yeltsin, Mr Sergei Stankevich, a presidential adviser, said a continuation of the presidency was essential if the 'substantial powers' which the new constitution gives the president were to be effectively implemented. Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, conceded that the new constitution, to be published on Wednesday and to be voted on in a referendum at the same time as the parliamentary elections, would usher in 'a republic with a very strong executive power'. In the past week, Mr Yeltsin has agreed with regional leaders that parliament will serve for only two years in its first term, and that after these two years the upper house, or Federation Council, will be appointed by regional leaders rather than elected, as in these elections. Twenty-one political parties and groups succeeded in gathering the 100,000 signatures needed to register for the December elections by Saturday's deadline. These included most of the main groups: the liberal groups Russia's Choice, the Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and the Party of Unity and Accord of Mr Sergei Shakhrai, as well as the centrist Civic Union bloc of Mr Arkady Volsky, Mr Sergei Baburin's Russian Peoples Union and the Russian Communist party. The Central electoral commission now has five days to check the list of signatures, about which numerous allegations of bribery and forgery have been made, before confirming which parties can run in the campaign.

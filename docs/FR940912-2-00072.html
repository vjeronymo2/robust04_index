			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent Order from Rite Aid Corporation (``Rite Aid'') under which Rite Aid would divest pharmacy assets in three (3) geographic locations in northern New England where they face limited competition. Rite Aid operates the nation's largest drug store chain under the name Rite Aid Discount Pharmacy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested person. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 30, 1994, Rite Aid and LaVerdiere's Enterprises, Inc. (``LEI'') entered into an agreement whereby Rite Aid would acquire all of the stock of LEI. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in the following towns: Bucksport, Maine; Lincoln, Maine; and Berlin, New Hampshire (hereinafter ``relevant geographic area''). The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors in the relevant geographic areas where Rite Aid and LEI are direct competitors and here they face limited competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, Rite Aid shall divest all assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in Rite Aid or LEI retail stores in the relevant geographic areas. The divestiture of the Rite Aid or LEI pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are not limited to: Owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area; persons previously employed by Rite Aid or LEI; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that Rite Aid has not divested the Rite Aid or LEI pharmacy assets in the relevant geographic areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that Rite Aid shall consent to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Rite Aid is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until Rite Aid has completely divested its interest in the assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit Rite Aid, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas or any assets used for the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Rite Aid will be required to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Rite Aid to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of Rite Aid resulting in the emergence of a successor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

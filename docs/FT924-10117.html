			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Polling stations With the outcome of the US presidential election so uncertain, many investors have withdrawn to the sidelines. But some trends seem clear, whoever wins tomorrow. The German and Japanese economies continue to slow, so lower interest rates in the two other large economies are only a matter of time. That should help bolster the dollar, even if the Federal Reserve decides to cut interest rates another notch. Oddly enough, with Bill Clinton seen as the candidate more likely to produce growth, and ultimately higher short-term interest rates, the dollar may rally more strongly on a Democratic victory than a Republican one. Bond market reactions are likely to diverge more sharply. In recent weeks long yields have moved up from 7 per cent to more than 7.6 per cent in anticipation of the spending plans of a victorious President Clinton proving more concrete than his revenue-raising measures. On current projections, Mr Clinton's strategy might increase the budget deficit from about Dollars 300bn to Dollars 360bn: as a result, long bond yields could rise by a further 0.5 to 0.75 per cent. However, it is always possible that the extra spending could boost growth, and thus government revenues, more than expected. If the market took that view, bond yields might stay under 8 per cent. Should the unexpected happen and President Bush get back, long rates might edge back towards 7 per cent. As with the dollar, US equities may rally on either outcome if for no other reason than prospects are poor elsewhere. International funds may be attracted by relatively high economic growth of 2 to 3 per cent in 1993. But the performance of stock market sectors is likely to vary. Pharmaceutical profits are a well-known Clinton target and prices may already have over-reacted. But capital goods and construction companies would benefit from increased infrastructure spending and capital goods tax allowances. Cyclical stocks would stand to gain from higher growth. It seems clear that with consumers still heavily indebted, capital investment will have to provide a large part of any initial US recovery. A Bush victory would be less likely to produce that.</p>

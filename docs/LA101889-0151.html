			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULLDOZER PARADE;  </P> <P> CONVENTION CENTER EXPANSION GETS ROARING SEND-OFF  </P> <P> A parade of giant bulldozers carrying hard-hat-clad dignitaries, including Los  Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, made for a roaring ground-breaking Monday as the Los  Angeles Convention Center began undergoing a $390-million expansion that will  make it one of the largest such facilities in the nation.  </P> <P> "A few shovels of dirt didn't seem right," said Dick Walsh, general manager of  the downtown center after a bulldozer scooped up a huge bite of earth.  </P> <P> The long-planned expansion of the city-owned and -operated facility is the  second-largest redevelopment project ever undertaken by the Community  Redevelopment Agency, ranking behind only the downtown Bunker Hill Urban  Renewal Project of the 1960s, CRA officials said.  </P> <P> The project will nearly double the size of the center from 1.5 million to 2.5  million square feet over 35 acres of land bounded by Pico Boulevard, Figueroa  Street, Venice Boulevard and the Santa Monica and Harbor freeways.  </P> <P> The expansion has involved the relocation of 408 families and the demolition of  an entire neighborhood of mainly run-down apartments and commercial buildings.  </P> <P> A five-acre open plaza, a two-story conference center spanning a block of Pico  Boulevard, and two 150-foot glass pavilions reinforced with structural steel  tubes will be included in the expanded center.  </P> <P> "When you see this tremendous facility in the heart of downtown L.A. you will  stick your chest out with pride," Bradley said after climbing down from the  seat of a huge earthmover loaded on an 18-wheel flatbed truck.  </P> <P> For more than five years, the city has lost tens of millions of dollars in  convention and trade show business because the downtown center is not big  enough or modern enough to compete with new facilities in other major cities,  including Dallas, New York, Chicago, Las Vegas and New Orleans, officials said.  </P> <P> These cities compete for large conventions because they attract visitors who  spend dizzying amounts of money that fuel local economies and make the national  trade show business a $12-billion-a-year industry, said Darlene Gudea, editor  and publisher of Tradeshow Week, a convention and exhibitors trade publication.  </P> <P> "The expansion is critical for Los Angeles because the city has been losing a  number of huge shows simply because it does not have the space," Gudea said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles recently lost a men's apparel convention that moved to Las Vegas,  taking with it 48,000 participants who spent about $14 million over four days  at hotels, restaurants and shops, she said.  </P> <P> When the Los Angeles expansion is completed in late 1992, the center will be  the ninth largest in the country, and it is expected to generate $504 million  annually for the local economy by 1994, officials said. The center will also  bring 3,000 additional jobs to downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The City Council approved the sale of $390 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds  to finance the expansion four years ago. In addition, the CRA spent $126  million, which was revenue generated through bond sales and property taxes on  new downtown developments.  </P> <P> The agency bought the 35 acres and relocated 1,500 people and 68 businesses  that occupied the aging apartments and other buildings at the site. Families  who once lived in substandard conditions were given the opportunity to move to  newer and cheaper housing.  </P> <P> Tough state relocation laws that protect tenants and the intervention of  public-interest attorneys who negotiated on tenants' behalf made for a  surprisingly smooth transition that ended in late 1988, officials said at the  time.  </P> <P> "The decision to go ahead with this was a bold one," said CRA Chairman James M.  Wood. "But the economic impact of this center will be enormous. And we had to  do this if we wanted to compete with other cities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Construction of the 2.5-million-square-foot expansion of the Los Angeles  Convention Center will begin in February, 1990. The massive project will  include the construction of two 150-foot-high glass pavilions. Upon completion  in late 1992 the center will be the ninth largest facility in the nation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE RELIEF TRICKLES IN; HOPE FADES FOR THOSE TRAPPED;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: MEDICAL OFFICIALS WARN OF EPIDEMICS. BLOCKED ROADS STALL HEAVY  EQUIPMENT.  </P> <P> Rescue crews and relief supplies began to trickle into this stricken resort and  university city Wednesday as hope faded for hundreds of people believed trapped  under collapsed buildings as a result of Monday's earthquake.  </P> <P> Medical officials warned of possible epidemics as tens of thousands of  residents huddled for a third day in tattered tents and makeshift shelters in  parks and streets. Drenched by daily rains, many complained that they had no  food, water or medicine.  </P> <P> By Wednesday, doctors working under umbrellas and sheets of plastic had treated  nearly 800 of the injured in muddy outdoor areas. The city's three hospitals  were all damaged and without power. Aftershocks continued throughout the day.  </P> <P> A grim silence lay across Baguio, a mountain city of 200,000 people, as  grief-stricken families stood and stared while rescue teams searched, mostly in  vain, for survivors in the rubble of two hotels, the Hyatt Terraces and the  Nevada.  </P> <P> Without electric power, the delicate work stopped as daylight faded. Almost no  rescue operations were evident at the 20 other hotels and at schools, office  buildings and factories brought down by the quake. Hundreds of homes also were  damaged or destroyed.  </P> <P> Brig. Gen. J. M. Aquias of the Philippine army, who is directing relief  operations, confirmed 186 deaths in the Baguio area. He estimated that the toll  may reach 400 to 600, but others put it even higher.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Robert Plunkett, commander of Camp John Hay, a U.S. military  recreation facility that has become a staging area for relief operations, said:  "I personally believe it's going to be in the thousands, but it's going to be  weeks before we know." Plunkett said about 1,500 Americans live in Baguio.  </P> <P> Civil defense officials reported 315 dead and 86,000 homeless across Luzon  Island as a result of the quake, which was measured at a magnitude of 7.7.  President Corazon Aquino, who flew into Baguio by helicopter Wednesday to  inspect the damage, ordered area schools closed for a month and declared a  state of emergency throughout central Luzon.  </P> <P> In Cabanatuan, near the quake's epicenter, workers began using heavy cranes  after hope died for up to 30 students still buried in a six-story college  building. Sixty-two students and teachers are known to have died in the  collapse.  </P> <P> Hardest hit was Baguio, about 110 miles north of Manila, and the surrounding  province of Benguet. The city's airport was closed, and landslides blocked all  access roads.  </P> <P> Philippine officials said they hoped to clear a coastal road by early today.  Ambulances and trucks with food, water and relief equipment waited at San  Fernando while crews used bulldozers and dynamite to clear the debris.  </P> <P> Until the bulldozers arrive, rescuers had little but their hands and simple  tools to search for survivors. A crane was at work at the Hyatt Terraces, but  it was dwarfed by the 12 giant concrete terraces, which had toppled sideways  and then sandwiched together.  </P> <P> One casino worker was pulled out bloody but conscious early Wednesday. Heinrich  Maulbecker, the hotel's general manager, said 80 people, including 30 tourists,  are still unaccounted for.  </P> <P> Nearby, volunteers cooked huge vats of rice under a parachute rigged as a  shelter.  </P> <P> A series of aftershocks rocked the area about noon Wednesday, sending rescuers  scurrying. Later, all rescue work was stopped for several hours because of a  report that another quake was imminent. None occurred.  </P> <P> One of the Hyatt survivors, Ed Feist, an Australian, said he was holding a  meeting in a second-floor conference room when the quake hit. He and 11  associates managed to get out a window. Two others disappeared.  </P> <P> "It was horrible, horrible," he said. "I told everyone to be calm. But the  shaking wouldn't stop. Then we felt everything cave in. And we just dropped two  floors."  </P> <P> Three other people were rescued bruised but alive from the five-story Hotel  Nevada, which twisted and split before it crumbled. Local miners, assisted by  U.S. military engineers, burrowed into the debris after hearing voices.  </P> <P> Ed Nevada, the hotel's owner, said about half of the 75 guests are still  unaccounted for.  </P> <P> Up to 170 people were feared dead in the city's Export Processing Zone, where a  giant three-story factory building collapsed and caught fire Tuesday afternoon.  The building was still smoldering Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We were in voice contact with several people until the fire," said Michael  Raeuber, a German who heads one of the six companies that used the building.  "Now, of course, there's nothing."  </P> <P> Ramon Farolan, the company's director, said 20 are known dead and up to 150 are  believed still inside. He said none could have survived the chemical fire.  </P> <P> "We need heavy equipment to pry the concrete floors apart," he said. "There's  nothing we can do until the equipment comes up. And it can't come until the  road is cleared."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.S. military helicopters landed on a fairway at Camp John Hay's  golf course, carrying body bags, hospital supplies and about 250 engineers,  technicians, doctors and other personnel.  </P> <P> A medical evacuation center with a dozen beds was set up. Doctors there sent  more than 30 of the most seriously injured to a hospital at Clark Air Base.  </P> <P> "The ones who are trapped are running out of time," said Capt. Kim Lowe, head  of the trauma unit. "After 72 hours, they get dehydrated and start to die.  We're fast approaching that point."  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy announced that a special 21-member disaster relief team had  arrived from Washington with four dogs and power saws, rope, medical supplies  and other gear. Other supplies were airlifted in from Guam.  </P> <P> Japan sent medical and rescue teams and $300,000 worth of relief supplies.  Canada, Thailand, Israel, England and at least eight other countries also  offered assistance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE TO SEND CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> Here are some of the relief organizations collecting aid for the victims of the  earthquake in the Philippines:  </P> <P> American Jewish Distribution Committee, 711 3rd Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017;  Telephone: (212) 687-6200  </P> <P> Catholic Relief Services, P.O.

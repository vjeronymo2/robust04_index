			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We recognized that the cost to the applicant of gathering evidence of injury to support a relatively small refund claim could exceed the expected refund and thereby cause some injured parties to forego an opportunity to obtain a refund. In view of these difficulties, we proposed adopting a number of injury presumptions which simplify and streamline the refund process. The simplified procedures reduce the burden that would have been placed on this office had we required detailed injury showings for relatively small refund applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Presumptions of Injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Set forth below are the presumptions of injury that have been adopted for each class of applicant likely to submit refund applications in this proceeding. These presumptions are not unlike injury presumptions adopted by OHA in many other refined product proceedings. Each presumption turns on the category of applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small-claim Presumption.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have adopted a small claim presumption of injury for resellers, retailers and refiners whose claim is $10,000 or less, exclusive of interest. A small claim threshold of $10,000 has been adopted, even though we established a lower threshold amount of $5,000 in many prior proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gulf Oil Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 16 DOE &para;85,381 (1987) (establishing a $5,000 threshold). The $10,000 threshold is more appropriate here because the volumetric established for each one of the 15 retailers covered by this proceeding is significantly higher than the volumetric set in Gulf and in most other subpart V refund proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If we were to adopt a lower threshold amount for this proceeding, then the number of very small firms that would be burdened with the requirement to make a detailed injury showing would increase substantially.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The small claim presumption of injury for this proceeding, exempts applicants whose claims are $10,000 or less, exclusive of interest, from the requirement to prove injury. Such an applicant need only document the volume of motor gasoline he or she purchased during the audit period from one or more of the retailers named in the Appendix to be eligible to receive a full refund.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Enron Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 21 DOE &para;85,323 at 88,957 (1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mid-range Presumption.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mid-range applicants; that is, applicants seeking refunds in excess of $10,000 but less than $50,000, excluding interest, are eligible to receive 40 percent of their allocable share without proving injury. Like small-claim applicants, these applicants will only be required to document the volume of gasoline they purchased during the audit period from any one of the firms named in the Appendix to be eligible to receive a refund.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Shell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17 DOE at 88,406.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> End-user Presumption.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have presumed that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry and were not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price and Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760h, were injured by each of the firm's pricing violations. Unlike regulated firms, end-users were not subject to price controls during the audit period. Moreover, these firms were not required to keep records that justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. An analysis of the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of non-petroleum goods and services is beyond the scope of a special refund proceeding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See American Pacific International, Inc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 14 DOE &para;85,158 at 88,294 (1986). End-users seeking refunds in this proceeding will therefore be presumed to have been injured. In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document the volume of gasoline they purchased during the relevant audit period from any of the 15 retailers whose name appears in the Appendix following this Decision. Meritorious applicants are eligible to receive their full allocable share.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Shell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 17 DOE at 88,406.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Refunds in Excess of $50,000 and Other Applicants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Applicants seeking refunds in excess of $50,000, excluding interest, will be required to submit detailed evidence of injury. These applicants must show that the overcharges were absorbed, not passed through to their customers. They will therefore be unable to rely upon injury presumptions utilized in many refined product refund cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not anticipate that other categories of applicants, such as, regulated firms, cooperatives, indirect purchasers or spot purchasers, would have obtained products from the firms covered by these procedures. Such applicants may nonetheless submit refund applications if they purchased motor gasoline from any of these firms during the relevant audit periods. Any such applicants must demonstrate that they purchased products from one of these firms during its audit period and show they were injured as a result of their purchases to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding. Regulated firms and cooperatives are exempt from the requirement to show injury. They must, however, show that they will pass any refund received through to their customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> (4) How to Apply for a Refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To apply for a refund from one or more of the firms' settlement fund, an applicant should submit an Application for Refund containing all of the following information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> (1) The Applicant's name; the current name and address of the business for which the refund is sought; the name and address during the refund period of the business for which the refund is sought; the taxpayer identification number; a statement specifying whether the applicant is an individual, corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship or other business entity; the name, title, and telephone number of a person to contact for additional information; and the name and address of the person who should receive any refund check. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  If the applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the applicant should specify those names. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the submission of a social security number by an individual applicant is voluntary. An applicant who does not wish to submit a social security number must submit an employer identification number if one exists. This information will be used in processing refund applications. It is requested pursuant to our authority under the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 and the regulations codified at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. The information may be shared with other Federal agencies for statistical, auditing or archiving purposes, and with law enforcement agencies when they are investigating a potential violation of civil or criminal law. Unless an applicant claims confidentiality, this information will be available to the public in the Public Reference room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

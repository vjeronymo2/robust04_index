			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> COMMUNIST VICTORY IN SERBIA MAY SIGNAL START OF YUGOSLAV BREAKUP;  </P> <P> NATIONALISM: INCUMBENT'S REELECTION PUTS REPUBLIC AT ODDS WITH THE GOALS OF  FEDERATIONS' OTHER STATES.  </P> <P> Communism's sweeping election victory in Serbia may have eased fears of a  military coup, but it sets up what observers say is a worst-case-scenario for  durable peace and Yugoslav unity.  </P> <P> The only hope for avoiding a breakup of the federation was for Serbia to elect  a democratic president or a Parliament willing to negotiate a more equitable  relationship with Slovenia and Croatia. Yugoslavia's two most prosperous  republics plan to secede unless they are granted economic and military  autonomy.  </P> <P> Instead, Serbian voters gave strong endorsement to incumbent President Slobodan  Milosevic and the nationalist policies of the former Communists, now renamed  but little reformed as Socialists.  </P> <P> "If the results are such that the opposition has failed even to win a majority  in the Assembly, then it means the end of Yugoslavia," said a senior Western  diplomat.  </P> <P> The choice of Milosevic and what amounts to hard-line communism isolates  Serbia, the largest republic, from four other Yugoslav states that have elected  center-right governments and set about repairing the economic damage inflicted  by half a century of Marxism.  </P> <P> The Socialists have remained popular in Serbia despite an anti-Communist mood  in Eastern Europe because Milosevic used his political monopoly to reassert  Serbian authority over ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province and by threatening  to use force to prevent Slovenia and Croatia from seceding.  </P> <P> Sunday's vote showed that Milosevic enjoys broad support in his efforts to  subjugate Kosovo Albanians and for his tough talk against independence for the  northern republics.  </P> <P> Balkan bureaucracy continued to delay full returns even two days after the  polls closed, but government and opposition sources concurred Tuesday that the  Socialists appeared to have won by a landslide.  </P> <P> Milosevic had 62% of the presidential vote in the precincts where the count was  deemed official, and those figures appeared to be consistent with preliminary  results from other districts, according to Election Committee spokesman Zoran  Djumic.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders said their independent counts suggested that the former  Communists might win as many as 200 of the 250 seats in the Serbian Assembly.  </P> <P> The Socialists won because of a widespread fear of change and their complete  control of the state-run media, according to leaders of the main opposition  group, the staunchly nationalist Serbian Renewal Movement. They have lodged  numerous complaints of voting fraud and manipulation, but they accepted the  Socialist victory as valid.  </P> <P> "The Communists stole a lot of the vote, but we feel they couldn't have stolen  as much as they won by," said Stanko Kustrin, a campaign activist and Belgrade  businessman.  </P> <P> Vuk Draskovic, the movement's presidential contender, won only 17% of the vote,  according to the partial returns.  </P> <P> The bearded novelist, who had been considered a strong challenger to Milosevic,  was visibly shaken by the loss and denounced the electorate for choosing  "bondage and Bolshevism" over the democracy and economic reform championed by  his anti-Communist movement.  </P> <P> Draskovic and his party share the same radical views as the Socialists on the  Kosovo conflict, but the opposition has been more conciliatory toward Slovenia  and Croatia.  </P> <P> Milosevic has refused to negotiate a realignment of relations within the  federation or to reduce the economic burdens placed on the two northern  republics.  </P> <P> Slovenia and Croatia accuse the Socialist-controlled federal government of poor  economic management, blaming Belgrade -- the capital of both Yugoslavia and  Serbia -- for the federation's $16-billion foreign debt, rising inflation and  unemployment that has left nearly one in five Yugoslavs without a job.  </P> <P> The northern republics also have sought to distance themselves from the human  rights abuses repeatedly registered in Kosovo, where the population, 90% ethnic  Albanian, has been under Serbian police siege for nearly two years.  </P> <P> Before Sunday's voting, opposition activists said they feared that the  Socialists would stir up trouble in Kosovo if they failed to win decisively.  They speculated that provoked violence would draw a military crackdown by  Belgrade and create sufficient unrest to warrant postponement of the second  round of elections set for Dec. 23.  </P> <P> The Yugoslav defense minister, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, said a week before the  vote that the army preferred a Socialist leadership, which triggered fears of a  military coup in the case of an opposition victory.  </P> <P> "We expect calm in Serbia now, but I fear for Yugoslavia," said Alexander Ptic,  a recent UC Berkeley graduate who returned to campaign for Draskovic and his  anti-Communist movement.  </P> <P> Now that Socialist rule has been legitimized in Serbia, the northern republics  will more easily win backing from the West for their secession efforts, since  there is no hope of uniting democratic and Communist governments, he said.  </P> <P> "It's the worst thing that could have happened for Yugoslavia as a nation," he  concluded. "What can we say to the West now? Only that Serbs are still stupid."  </P> <P> Western diplomats agreed that the Socialist victory will accelerate the  secession efforts but noted that the victors now have to prove they can correct  colossal economic mistakes of their own making.  </P> <P> An official with Yugoslavia's largest bank, who did not want to be identified,  said Serbia has recently run up debts in excess of $4 billion.  </P> <P> "The Communists raised workers' salaries to create an atmosphere that  everything was fine in the republic," said Dejan Lucic, Belgrade leader of the  Serbian Renewal Movement. "But the money is not there to cover those debts, and  there's not going to be any help from the West for a Communist government."  </P> <P> Several opposition figures said they hope that Serbia would be financially  isolated by the West, to hasten what they expect to be broad disenchantment  with the Milosevic leadership within the next few months.  </P> <P> "There will have to be new elections soon," predicted Mihailo Mladenovic,  president of the Serbian Royalist Bloc. "Yugoslavia is bankrupt -- Serbia as  well -- and we can't expect help from anyone because we have already squandered  our credit."  </P> <P> Diplomats and opposition figures said they worry that Serbia, and Yugoslavia by  extension, was headed for a "Bulgaria scenario." Disillusionment with the  elected Socialists in Bulgaria mounted in the months after the June election  there, eventually bringing down the government in late November.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia will face the additional pressure of its most prosperous republics  trying to bolt from the federation, undermining any hope of economic recovery.  </P> <P> Slovenia plans a referendum on secession on Dec. 23, which is expected to gain  at least 80% support and set the independence juggernaut in motion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Slovenia and Croatia, Yugoslavia's two most prosperous republics, have said  they plan to secede unless they are granted economic and military autonomy.  Slovenia plans a referendum on secession on Dec. 23. It is expected to gain at  least 80% support, which could start the wheels of the independence movement  turning.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING FIRM CUTS GROWTH  </P> <P> American Health Services Corp., a major national operator of medical diagnostic  imaging centers, said Wednesday it is sharply scaling back its growth plans,  resulting in a loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.  </P> <P> E. Larry Atkins, who took over as the Newport Beach-based company's chief  executive in August, said in a meeting with industry analysts that as a result  of this move the company will take writedowns of $2.5 million leading to an  unspecified third-quarter loss.  </P> <P> The writedowns, he said, are related to severance arrangements and the  termination of projects that no longer meet the company's strategic goals.  </P> <P> Atkins said he wants to slow American Health Services' growth to about 20% a  year. The company has more than doubled in size in the past 14 months,  increasing the number of centers it operates to 37 from 18.  </P> <P> Atkins said the company now plans to add eight to 10 new centers in 1991, in  contrast to its former plan to add 20 centers.  </P> <P> "We want to focus on (increasing) earnings," he explained. "Our after-tax  earnings haven't been satisfactory to the management or the shareholders. We  think we can do better if we focus more on operations and less on growth."  </P> <P> In the first six months of 1990, the company had net earnings of $771,000 on  revenue of $15.5 million.  </P> <P> Atkins, who previously was chief operating officer of American Health Services,  assumed the top executive position Aug. 6 upon the resignation of S. Lewis  Meyer, who had served six years as chief executive.  </P></p>

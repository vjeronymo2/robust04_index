			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (16): Investors urged to behave like owners - Corporate governance is taking hold in the consciousness of UK pension funds AFTER YEARS of determined passivity, UK pension funds are finally waking up to their own power. With over Pounds 250bn in assets, they provide the largest single source of working capital for British industry. Thus, it should come as no surprise that pension funds are finally coming around to the view that they should act like owners, rather than simply passive investors. The issue of corporate governance - the way companies are governed by their directors - has slowly taken hold in the consciousness of UK pension funds in a way unimaginable just a few years ago. Shareholders are beginning to demand that managements tell them more about how their companies are run, and seeking the right to do something about inefficient, profligate or arrogant managers. In the US, where the corporate governance movement has been in full swing for years, pension fund activism has been assisted by the US Labour Department, which in 1988 determined that voting rights are an asset of pension fund trusts which must be exercised on behalf of members. Meanwhile, in Britain, the National Association of Pension Funds last year highlighted the passivity of its members, when it conducted a survey showing that fewer than 20 per cent of them regularly exercised their proxy rights. Mr Clive Gilchrist, deputy chairman of the NAPF and chairman of BesTrustees, a company which acts as an independent trustee on pension boards, has repeatedly urged members to use their voting rights. A survey conducted in 1990 showed that some 23 per cent of NAPF members did not even know whose responsibility it was to make voting decisions. 'By 1991, the numbers were only very slightly better,' he said. To encourage members to vote, the NAPF has just established a proxy voting service. In its initial stages, it will track all the companies in the FT-SE 100 index, preparing reports on matters to be voted at each annual general meeting. The reports make no effort to advise pension funds on how to vote; they simply inform readers whether or not the matter in hand is consider contentious. It will also inform readers whether they are being asked to approve a development which does not conform with NAPF guidelines on best practice on corporate governance. Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, acknowledges that the group has not been deluged with demands for the new service, but says that, at Pounds 2,000 per participant, response has been better than expected. Currently, about six large institutions have signed up. 'So many of then haven't even given the matter of voting any thought,' said Mr Matheson. The debate about corporate governance has been spurred on by the recession of the past three years, which has exposed many managerial weaknesses covered up by the go-go years of the late 1980s. Shareholders began asking hard questions only when managements proved themselves unable to cope with the downturn in business. The NAPF, among other shareholder groups, has been busy developing codes of practice intended to promote shareholder influence and make companies more responsive to the interests of their owners. As a member of the Institutional Shareholders Committee, it has participated in the drafting of codes outlining the rights and responsibilities both of directors and of shareholders. Also, the NAPF has held discussions with the Accounting Standards Board, to urge new rules which would require companies to disclose more about their operations in their annual accounts. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of demands for better corporate governance is likely to get a boost from a report to be issued at the end of this month by the so-called Cadbury Committee. The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, is expected to recommend a wide range of measures, aimed at improving the quality of information offered to shareholders and improving board accountability. For hawks on the corporate governance issue, the report is likely to be disappointing, because it will have no enforcement mechanism other than a new rule from the London Stock Exchange requiring companies to disclose the extent to which they comply with its recommendations. But the report will underline the growing seriousness of investors in seeing to it that boards are held accountable for their own performance. But if those codes are to be any more than self-righteous posturing, shareholders will have to use their muscle in the form of votes to put their recommendations to the test. Mr Matheson notes that, for those pension funds that use external managers, the sheer mechanics of voting mitigate against it. 'For a large external manager with several hundred clients, there's quite a lot of paper to be signed,' he said. A manager unable to contact pension fund trustees may have to forgo a vote on their behalf. Also, many pension fund trustees may feel they are not well informed enough about each company's affairs to use their votes wisely. Thus, such decisions are better left to professional money managers who are paid fees for their judgments. Mr Matheson said that the NAPF's effort to encourage members to vote has been helped by the Institutional Fund Managers Association, a trade group, which urges the adoption of a standard management agreement authorising the manager to make voting decisions on the pension fund's behalf. Ann Simpson, co-director of the Pensions Investment Research Council, which largely advises local authority pension funds, notes that, when fund managers need to seek trustees' permission to vote, the typical 21-day notice period offered by most companies is inadequate. The PIRC has for some time been running a proxy voting service similar to that newly established by the NAPF. However, the PIRC's bulletins include a discussion of matters not on the agenda - such as companies' refusal to offer their executive directors for periodic renomination - and suggests that shareholders raise the issue with managements. Meanwhile, Mr John Wilcox, chairman of Georgeson, a US-based investor relations consultancy, argues that UK laws actually offer far more freedom to domestic institutions to influence managments than is offered to their US counterparts. US securities laws, for instance, prevent institutions from discussing joint courses of action without filing certain documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'The barriers to the exercise of power are much lower here in the UK,' he said.</p>

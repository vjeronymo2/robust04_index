			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 3 May.    Marco Antonio Slim Domit, director of the leading financial  group Segumex-Inbursa, has said the implementation of NAFTA will  result in growth in the assembly plant industry. He said "30  new industries have already opened this year, and it is expected  140 other plants will open before the end of the year." This  represents a 19.2-percent increase over 1993.    Industrial specialist John Christman has reported the  industry "could be worth approximately $28.5 billion" by  December. The big winners, he added, "will be the auto  industry, textiles, and garments," the exports of which are  expected to hit $20 billion by 1999. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 26 April 94 p 22)    Carlos Eduardo Represas, president of the Private Sector  Economic Studies Center, has said economic growth and investment  projects for 1994 have already been affected by interest rate  increases and pressure on exchange rates. Following his  participation in a seminar entitled Mexican Industrial Policy,  he proposed the government devise a number of economic, social,  and political measures aimed at restoring confidence. Represas  denied, however, the current conditions forecast a drastic drop  in the currency exchange rate. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in  Spanish 27 April 94 pp 1, 31)    Herminio Blanco, under secretary for international trade  negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial Development  Secretariat, Secofi, has reported Mexican exports to the United  States increased 23 percent during the first quarter of 1994.  This, he said, "is a result of NAFTA." The assembly industry,  for its part, increased exports by 28 percent during the same  period. Blanco said Mexico deems workers' rights and the  environment to be very important issues, but "we will never  accept their being used for the imposition of measures for  commercial protectionism." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish  27 April 94 p 22)    Secofi Secretary Jaime Serra Puche has said foreign  investments reached $5.22 billion during the first quarter of  1994, 89 percent higher than the same period in 1993. During an  impromptu news conference following his participation at the  seminar on Mexican Industrial Policy, he said oil exports were  20 percent higher in March and could reach 25 percent under  NAFTA. He reported, however, foreign investment in general  dropped approximately 50 percent in March with regard to January  1994. While U.S. imports from other countries rose 11 percent,  imports from Mexico grew twice as much. Serra Puche concluded  generally speaking, "implementation of NAFTA and lower import  tariffs have produced encouraging results for the country."  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 7)    Imports of computer technology increased 28 percent,  following the implementation of NAFTA and the lifting of trade  tariffs. Mexican computer and software exports, meanwhile, are  relatively low in comparison to imports. Industrial leader  Antonio Medina Mora said the industry will require more  financial support to reach its goals. Projections for 1995,  under the present free trade market conditions, show $2 billion  in sales. Software is expected to grow by 28 percent, services  by 18.9 percent, and hardware by 16.6 percent. (Mexico City EL  FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 26)    The financial group Asemex-Banpais has stated $4.95 billion  was transferred out of the country during March. He added  international reserves dropped to $24 billion compared to the  $29 billion available in January and February. The main routes  were through the Mexican stock market, with 36.24 percent of the  total, and the currency exchange market, with 34.69 percent.  Banking notes, negotiable documents, and open shares followed.  The group noted, however, that "even if all economic agents  were to trade in their pesos for dollars, the reserves would  still be sufficient to cover the demand;" therefore, the  document concludes, "there is no call for a devaluation of the  peso." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 17)    The Bank of Mexico has reported loans granted to the  manufacturing sector dropped 3.5 percent during the first month  of the year. The bank granted loans totaling 60.43 billion  pesos in December 1993. That amount dropped to 58.17 billion  pesos in January 1994; this, the report states, affected other  areas such as insurance, accounting services, rentals, and other  related activities. Credit requests from these fields dropped  proportionally. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p  19)    The government and private sector's firm control over labor  unions has prevented Mexican workers from freely and  democratically organizing unions, while 5 to 6 million people  are unemployed, and approximately 12 million have part-time  jobs. This information was disclosed by the Authentic Labor  Front, FAT, and corroborated by the Confederation of Mexican  Workers (CTM). Furthermore, according to FAT, workers' buying  power has deteriorated, and their meager participation in  nongovernment unions proves there is a lack of freedom in that  respect. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0943 GMT 28 April 94)    The National Chamber of Electrical Appliance Manufacturers  [Caname] has disclosed the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE)  has substantially reduced its local acquisitions to control its  budget and reduce its foreign loans, which dropped from 2.8  billion new pesos in 1991 to 1.4 billion pesos in 1992 and 1.2  billion pesos in 1993. Caname says that due to the problems  that emerged with the implementation of NAFTA early this year,  the CFE's local purchases totaled 132 million pesos, which is an  insignificant figure. Meanwhile, CFE imports in 1993 totaled  453 million pesos, down from 665 million pesos in 1992. (Mexico  City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 32)    The Mexican Telephone System (Telmex) has reported the loss  of 718.75 million pesos during the first quarter of 1994 due to  fluctuations in the exchange rate and a substantial increase in  interest rates in the United States over the past few months.  In its quarterly report, the company has disclosed its net  profits during the same period amounted to 1.850 billion pesos  (approximately $560 million), 14.3 percent less than it earned  in 1993. An EL FINANCIERO study indicates investors recovered  some of their confidence, but the uncertainty of the past few  months still had an effect; nevertheless, Telmex sales, up until  March, totaled 6.630 billion pesos (approximately $2.09  billion), 13 percent more than during the same period in 1993.  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 10)    A report by the Indosuez Bank presents Telmex as the most  attractive telecommunications company on the Latin American  market. Indosuez says compared to other Latin American telephone  companies in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru, Telmex  offers the best value. The comparison was based on the  macroeconomic conditions of each country, the possibilities for  growth, corporate efficiency, debt, and the flow of funds. The  purchase of Telmex shares was strongly recommended in the report  because the company is rapidly replacing its old lines with  digital equipment. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28  April 94 p 10)    In an immediate response to the reduction of treasury bond  interest rates, the Mexican stock market closed with an increase  for the second consecutive day, thus accumulating a two-day  advance of 6.38 percent. On 27 April, the index of prices and  quotations increased 48.65 points, 2.13 percent, closing at  2,332 points and 78 trading units. Financial analysts have said  the stock market is reacting favorably to the agreements signed  by the economic secretaries and ministers of Mexico, Canada, and  the United States to strengthen the currency. (Mexico City  Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 28 April)    The Mexican Network of Action In Response to Free Trade has  said the first quarter of NAFTA negatively affected Mexico. The  agricultural and forestal sectors suffered adverse economic  effects, the country's trade deficit increased by 20 percent,  and there was an unexpected increase in imports of consumer  goods. The group adds complaints of labor rights violations  were also filed at the NAFTA Labor Commission based in Dallas.  Network representative Bertha Lujan says her organization will  demand the renegotiation of NAFTA. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in  Spanish 29 April 94 p 59)    Today during a meeting with the leaders of small- and  medium-sized businesses in Mexico City, Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said Mexico's exports to  the United States increased 22 percent during the first two  months of 1994. He explained this is due to NAFTA and is very  encouraging for Mexico. Serra Puche said that during the first  quarter of 1994, foreign investment in Mexico amounted to $5.2  billion, which will increase as Mexico increases its products on  foreign markets. He added Mexico intends to strengthen trade  with the Central American nations. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in  Spanish 29 April 94 p 57)    A report by the Presidency of the republic indicates that  thanks to NAFTA, nonoil exports increased during the first  quarter of 1994, achieving a growth rate of 23.9 percent.  Imports increased overall by 19.7 percent, surpassing overall  exports, which increased by 17.5 percent. The report indicates  the effect of releasing tariffs was reflected in the growth of  bilateral trade with the United States, which increased 22.4  percent, and trade with Canada, which increased 48.5 percent.  Meanwhile, nonoil agricultural exports in January and February  surpassed those of the same period in 1993 by $1.4 billion.  (Mexico city EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 29 April 1994 p 24)</p>

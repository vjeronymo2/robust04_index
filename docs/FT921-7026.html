			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: France and Mexico gain from buoyant US Significant movements in second-line markets were disguised by a muted global equity performance last week. According to the FT-Actuaries World indices, the world index rose just 0.2 per cent in local currency terms. France was the week's biggest gainer, advancing 4.5 per cent and returning to levels seen just before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The market accelerated during the week in big volume as foreign and domestic investors aggressively bought stocks with exposure to cyclical industries and to the US economy, ahead of the close of the February account on Friday. Analysts attribute the bourse's bullish mood to Wall Street, which reached a record high on Thursday, the stronger dollar, and to the sheer weight of money as international investors switched funds out of Germany and into France. The market has also been encouraged by positive comments on the economy from the finance minister and by signs that the government is committed to improving the stock market's fortunes by creating personal equity plans and further privatisations. There is a general belief among analysts that French equities have further to run. Mexico followed France with a 3.6 per cent rise in local terms, also buoyed by Wall Street, the prospect of lower interest rates, and foreign buying pressure. News on Friday that foreigners will be allowed to buy financial shares is expected to keep the market strong in the near term. Hopes of cheaper money produced a 3 per cent gain in Malaysia, where cuts in deposit rates by local banks undermined efforts by the central bank to keep interbank rates above 8 per cent. Malaysia was also lifted by speculative buying in the gaming sector. Tanjong was heavily bought on reports that its controlling shareholder planned to develop Kuala Lumpur's race course into a 'city within a city'. By contrast, South Africa was the week's worst performer, losing 4.2 per cent in the wake of the government's defeat in a local by-election and President FW de Klerk's announcement of a referendum on his reform programme. Lower gold prices, which took 7 per cent off the local market's all-gold index, were also to blame. One analyst says the market is unlikely to recover from the weight of rights issues currently under way until well into the next quarter. Some R6.7bn (Dollars 2.4bn), a large sum for the South African market, has already been raised in cash calls so far this year. South African equities are also depressed by the effects of the worst drought in decades, which is likely to slow economic growth to 1.5 per cent, down from previous forecasts of 2 per cent, and reduce the trade surplus this year. A downturn in consumer spending is a further weight on the market. The week's second worst performer was Norway, which fell 3.6 per cent, depressed by weaker oil prices following the Opec meeting and by a record net loss in 1991 from Norsk Hydro, the market leader.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change    % change                  % change in local currency*     sterling* in USDollars*              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                            1992     1992       1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +2.40    +14.41    -6.01   +21.07    +18.96     +11.08 Belgium       +1.34     -0.49    +2.14    +4.08     +2.61      -4.19 Denmark       -0.11     -2.87    +2.88    +0.66     -0.49      -7.09 Finland       +1.30     +6.13    -5.31   +21.95    +19.44     +11.52 France        +4.48     +5.31   +14.80   +10.37     +9.19      +1.96 Germany       +1.41     +2.85    +4.91    +9.05     +7.40      +0.28 Ireland       -0.30     -0.27    +7.80    +4.79     +3.75      -3.12 Italy         +1.33     -2.21    -4.12    +7.27     +6.58      -0.48 Netherlands   +1.09     +0.99   +16.32    +6.78     +5.25      -1.73 Norway        -3.60     -7.40   -12.95    -0.79     -2.08      -8.57 Spain         -0.23     +2.23    +3.49    +5.22     +5.28      -1.70 Sweden        +0.40     -3.48    +0.82    +4.00     +3.27      -3.57 Switzerland   +1.57     +2.14   +16.09    +8.15     +5.12      -1.85 UK            +1.20     +1.36    +9.27    +2.42     +2.42      -4.37 EUROPE        +1.56     +1.80    +8.31    +5.58     +4.79      -2.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +0.22     +0.06   +16.95    -2.86     +2.94      -3.89 Hong Kong     -0.86     +3.19   +38.25   +11.21    +19.37     +11.46 Japan         -0.28     -2.60   -19.41   -10.11     -6.54     -12.73 Malaysia      +2.98     +8.23    +4.06   +10.90    +24.80     +16.53 New Zealand   +2.10     +0.16    +7.71    -2.21     +5.13      -1.83 Singapore     +1.64     -2.00   +11.50    +2.30     +7.99      +0.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -1.03     -2.39    +0.05    +1.16     +5.82      -1.19 USA           -0.29     -0.93   +13.56    -1.18     +5.82      -1.18 Mexico        +3.60    +10.93  +191.11   +22.56    +30.42     +21.78  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -4.22     -2.54   +28.75    +2.58     -4.81     -11.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.16     -0.61    +1.36    -1.92     +1.96      -4.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Based on February 21st 1992.

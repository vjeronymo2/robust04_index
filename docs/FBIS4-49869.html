			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said here today that China appreciates  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's attitude toward the  history of Japan's aggression against China, saying that his  attitude is sensible and is in accordance with the trend of  history.    Commenting on the letter from Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu  Hata to Chinese leaders here this afternoon at the weekly press  conference, the spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said that on May 10,  Japanese Ambassador to China Kunihiro Michihiko conveyed to  Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan a message from Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata to Chinese Premier Li Peng on the remarks  made by former Japanese minister of justice, Shigeto Nagano, in  which Nagano distorted the history of Japan's aggression against  China.    "We have taken note of the profound introspection expressed  by Prime Minister Hata that Japan's aggression and colonial rule  in the past have inflicted unbearable suffering on many  peoples," Wu said.    In the letter, the Japanese prime minister promised that  history shall be treated correctly and the young generation  shall be educated with the correct historical views and  determined to prevent the past unfortunate history form being  repeated.

Most likely, it can be regarded as an intermediate  step in the correction of the balance of power inside the  governing assembly of sectorial lobbyists.    Mr. Shokhin has recently spoken a great deal about  transforming the Ministry of Economics into the "headquarters of  reforms." However, his appointment to the vacant post of chief  head of former reform is unlikely. It is not difficult to note  that, as a result of changes in the political situation,  Aleksandr Shokhin, one of the leaders of the temporary  opposition election bloc PRES [Partiya Rossiyskogo Yedinstva i  Soglasiya--Party of Russian Unity and Accord], has become one of  the most persistent translators of the ideas of "selective  structural policy" through moderate emission pumping. At the  same time, Mr. Shokhin uses formulations of the type of  "stagnation trap," in which he himself, according to experts'  opinion, in no way can believe.    Perhaps Mr. Shokhin has already demonstrated that it is  impossible to judge his present views by his past views and  actions. However, the miraculous transformation of a  "monetarist" into a banal "trapper" is not a sufficient basis  for holding a key post in the government.    The point is that the existing balance of forces between  representatives of sectorial lobbies was disrupted quite  unexpectedly for participants in the high assembly. It was  assumed that the premier quite efficiently lobbied for the fuel  and energy complex, Mr. Soskovets not without the help of the  Ministry of Defense lobbied for industry, and Comrade Zaveryukha  extorted financing for his eternally hungry agrarians. And  everyone was more or less satisfied.    The unforeseen happened. Serious people, in response to the  "vile" monetarist reform, have fostered a system of nonpayments,  which proceeds from the fact that in Russia everything, except  goods, is for sale. Mild demand restrictions concentrated on the  budget are the basis for such a system, which makes it possible  "to unload" unsalable goods; speaking in Russian, to scorn  effective demand if the budget pays for everything.    However, it turned out that not for everything. Quite  unexpectedly Viktor Chernomyrdin, having broken away somewhat  from the lobbyist team, began to exert pressure from above on  the desired "mild restrictions." Problems not envisaged by  participants arose inside the government. On the other hand,  industrial lobbyists formally gained unique positions in Russian  upper circles: the Ministry of Defense got hold of talented  Andrey Kokoshin, chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic  Reform, Sergey Glazyev was and remains an ardent advocate of  goal-oriented financing for scientific research and experimental  design work (it is clear to anyone where this work is performed  in our country), and, in the end, metallurgist Oleg Soskovets,  the only first vice premier, expanded his potential lobbyist  interests to the scale of the domestic industry as a whole,  including the military-industrial complex, which considers  itself infringed upon. This was manifested in Mr. Soskovets'  latest attack on the positions of the fuel and energy complex.  Since agrarians do not need a special additional support owing  to the parasitic way of life characteristic of them and the  premier himself tries to distance himself as far as possible  from the fuel and energy complex that gave rise to him, it would  be natural to restore the balance in the government through the  appointment, to counterbalance Soskovets, of a person from the  fuel and energy complex, which, taking into consideration the  nature of the government and the real role of the fuel and  energy complex in the Russian economy, is more than natural. Mr.  Shokhin in no way is suitable for this role, because no one  needs a second Soskovets in the government. Even Mr. Soskovets  himself.    Most likely, however, for tactical considerations the  premier  is not yet ready to take this natural step, fearing accusations  of corporative engagement. Therefore, obviously, with Aleksandr  Shokhin's appointment an intermediate action was carried out.  With regard to the personality of the reappointed vice-premier  himself, Mr. Shokhin has recently uttered very good words about  Russia and the foreign policy it needs and very bad words about  his former colleagues, Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov. Aleksandr  Nikolayevich's excessive zeal in flinging mud at his former  partner indicates that Mr. Shokhin is a vulnerable and, in his  own way, a decent person. Sensing the extreme awkwardness of the  situation, he tries to erect, first of all, for himself some  structures, which enable him to consider himself such a person.  The concentration in the ministry entrusted to him of people  from the Gaydar team, whom Mr. Shokhin cannot permit himself not  to shelter, confirms this. It only remains to add that a reverse  transformation of a "trapper" into a normal person during the  next turn of the wind is extremely difficult. This is already an  irreversible process, like the loss of professional virginity.</p>

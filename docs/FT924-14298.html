			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Bush sets the stage for series of bitter debates PRESIDENT George Bush continued to impugn Governor Bill Clinton's patriotism yesterday, setting the stage for what could be an acrimonious confrontation as he tries to rescue his faltering re-election campaign in the first debate between presidential candidates in St Louis tomorrow night. Mr Bush insisted in a morning television interview that he was only questioning his opponent's 'judgment' in helping to organise demonstrations against the Vietnam war while a student at Oxford 23 years ago and in visiting the Soviet Union at the same time. But he then implied that such activities rendered suspect his opponent's fitness to be commander-in-chief. Mr Clinton counter-attacked and said the president was in the grip of 'extreme rightwingers'. Senator Bill Bradley from New Jersey, a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford a few years before Mr Clinton, accused Mr Bush of practising the worst form of McCarthyism. The president said yesterday such 'red baiting' charges were 'ridiculous'. The question for Sunday night is whether Mr Bush, whose campaign has been digging into Mr Clinton's private life for months and who also has access to confidential intelligence files, will brandish some concrete information about the Democrat's activities a generation ago. The president gave warning of his intent in an interview in which he said the rule of politics this year is 'be ugly, be nasty, everything goes'. This, in effect, concedes that he will lose the election if the remaining 24 days of the campaign remain focused on bread and butter issues, such as the state of the economy. If Mr Bush pulls a rabbit out of the hat, it will have to be a big one. Polls suggest that the more intense the negative attacks on Mr Clinton's character over the past 10 days, the greater his lead has grown. One such survey, published yesterday by USA Today/CNN, had him up by 16 points, with 50 per cent, against 34 per cent for the president and 9 per cent for Mr Ross Perot, also present at the debate. Mr Bush has brought in some noted Republican 'hard men', such as Mr Roger Ailes, the political consultant, to help prepare for the debate. Mr Clinton, whose basic task is to talk about the economy, avoid serious errors and look the part, has recruited the Washington lawyer who 'played' Mr Bush as part of Mr Michael Dukakis's training four years ago. For Mr Bush, this is make-or-break time. His best, probably only, hope is to breach Mr Clinton's defences on Sunday, have vice-president Dan Quayle follow up on Tuesday in his debate with Senator Al Gore, and ram home any advantage in the final two debates.

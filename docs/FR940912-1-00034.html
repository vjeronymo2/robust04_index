			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second approach to achieving emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves emission suppression and treatment of wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams to remove or destroy the organic compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volatile organic compound emissions from SOCMI process unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater can be effectively reduced on a nationwide basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the following control approach: (1) Identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams with significant VOC emission potential;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) recycle or treat those wastewater streams to remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their potential for emissions; (3) prior to treatment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recycling, manage those waste streams in units that suppress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions or are equipped with air emission controls;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) recycle any treatment residuals or treat any residuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to destroy VOC; and (5) control air emissions generated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential for VOC emissions from wastewater can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed based on the characteristics of the wastewater at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its point of generation. A reference test method, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 25D (40 CFR Part 60, appendix A), provides a relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicator of wastewater emission potential and is used as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tool to implement air emission standards for wastewater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This method, when applied to a wastewater stream, yields a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatile organic concentration for the stream. While not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> true indicator of absolute emissions, the volatile organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of a stream provides a relative indicator of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential emissions of that stream as compared to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams that are similarly managed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are three primary treatment technologies that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally applicable and effective in reducing the VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of SOCMI wastewater streams. These are steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stripping, air stripping, and biological treatment. There  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also are several other technologies or methods of treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are equally effective in their particular situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but are limited in their applicability within SOCMI. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other technologies include chemical oxidation, carbon and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ion exchange adsorption, membrane separation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquid-liquid extraction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Steam stripping is the most universally applicable VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removal technology for treating wastewater streams generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by SOCMI process units, and this treatment technology has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been selected as the basis for standards for SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater. The VOC removal efficiency of steam strippers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depends on the characteristics of both the steam stripper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the wastewater stream. Data collected by the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to steam stripper performance for the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters indicate that organic removal efficiencies of up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 99.9 percent have been demonstrated on wastewater streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at SOCMI plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA selected steam stripping as the BDT because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the most universally applicable treatment technology for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing organic compounds from wastewater streams with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential to emit VOC and achieves the highest VOC emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction among demonstrated VOC control technologies. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is aware that many SOCMI facilities employ biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment units for wastewater treatment. However, not all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the compounds regulated under the proposed NSPS are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly biodegradable, while most of the compounds can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be treated more readily by steam stripping. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of emissions reduction achieved by biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, even for biologically degradable compounds, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vary among SOCMI sources because of the ranges in operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and design parameters, such as the biological degradation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate, surface area of the unit, aeration rate, hydraulic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residence time, and the active biomass concentration. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing biological treatment as the potential BDT, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that the variability in performance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant across the industry. Although a well operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maintained biological treatment system can achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions as high as 99 percent, the variability in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance makes quantifying emission reductions for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of setting a standard more difficult than for steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stripping. Emission reductions for biological treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems can only be determined on a site-specific basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the EPA emphasizes that SOCMI sources using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological treatment, or any other treatment technologies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can comply with the rule by consistently achieving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required emission reduction (i.e., 95 percent when using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biodegradation or 99 percent for other technologies).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

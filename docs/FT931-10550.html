			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Economists still gloomy on growth THE LATEST reduction in interest rates and falls in the value of the pound have done little to alleviate pessimism among economists working in industry. After last week's turmoil on the foreign exchanges and arguments over the government's decision to cut base rates to 6 per cent, they remain uncertain about the strength and direction of economic growth. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, the UK's biggest chemicals company, said he has detected no discernible sign of recovery in industry. 'Exports have picked up a bit,' he said. 'It is very important that the pound does not rise too much from where it is now as we have got to make sure we maintain our competitiveness.' Ms Valerie Burton, chief economist at the Bass drinks, hotels and leisure group, said fear of unemployment is still constraining spending. 'Low inflation hasn't really had much of an impact on people,' she said. 'We will be bumping along the bottom for some time although I see a pick-up towards the end of the year.' At the Engineering Employers' Federation, Mr Ian Thompson, chief economist, said a rise in confidence may have been registered, but with no corresponding increase in actual business. 'The outlook for exports is mixed. It is good as far as cost competitiveness is concerned, but our European markets are stagnant. I think there is more gain than loss overall, but it is finely balanced.' Mr Leslie Gunde, chief economist at the GKN engineering components group, said: 'I have been encouraged by the apparent upturn in the car industry and also by the Bundesbank's moves on interest rates. But apart from this the signs about recovery are extremely patchy. Any tax increases in the Budget would be unwise as they would hardly help confidence.' Activity among retailers is similarly depressed. 'We have seen no sign of economic recovery,' said Mr John Randall, finance director of MFI, the furniture retailer. 'A lot of people are looking and a lot are inclined to spend, but not quite to the point of putting their hands in their pockets.' He believes people will need to feel comfortable about their job prospects and the value of their homes before spending can recover properly. Mr Barry Scott, head of economics at British Gas, was slightly more optimistic: 'I remain confident that the lower pound and reduced interest rates will have a powerful effect in helping recovery. But it's difficult to see any discernible sign of this right now.'</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: The dividend case How much of the recent fall is mere bottom-of-the-cycle pessimism is open to question. Certainly, there is pressure for change from disgruntled institutional shareholders. Historically, the rationale for buying Japanese equities has been capital appreciation. Growth opportunities being what they were, it made excellent sense for companies and shareholders to plough everything back into the business. But if the growth is not there any more, say the institutions, neither is the capital appreciation. It is up to the companies to make good the difference by shelling out. There are several flaws in this approach. First, the competitive behaviour of Japanese corporations is a function of the markets in which they operate. It would be nice to respond to tougher market conditions by easing competition and raising margins. It is less clear how this is to be achieved. Second, the stock market bubble was the fault, not of companies, but of investors. Certainly, some Japanese corporations wallowed in greed and chicanery with the best of them. They also took advantage of high stock prices to raise huge quantities of cheap capital, much of which they then squandered. But it seems odd to suggest that they should transform their operational strategies simply because their shareholders made fools of themselves.</p>

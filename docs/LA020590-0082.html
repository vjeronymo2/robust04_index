			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: A MISSING FRONT LICENSE PLATE IS NOT AN ARRESTING SIGHT  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> My car was in an accident at the end of December. I was rear-ended and the  front of the car was quite demolished when I was shoved into a huge pole.  </P> <P> My car is almost ready to be returned. My back license plate is OK, but the  front one is creased, torn and looks too awful to put back on my nice car. I  happen to like my license number, "2GGE. . . ," which I laughingly call "two  eggs over easy," and I don't want to get another plate. Will I be penalized if  I only have a license plate on the back?  </P> <P> My family disagrees with me, but I truly don't want to change my plate. Am I  liable for a ticket if I only have a plate in the rear of my car?  </P> <P> Dorothy Jung  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> Why are there so many cars driving around in Orange County without a front  California license plate? They have valid back plates, but the front plate is  missing. Is this legal?  </P> <P> This seems to be particularly true of the adolescent- or muscle-type vehicles  with the race-car look. Is the law simply not being enforced, or can we really  leave our front plates off here in Orange County?  </P> <P> William Luedeking  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P> <P> Yes, there are lots of cars zipping around Orange County and other spots in the  state without front plates. And, yes, it is against the law to operate a car  that doesn't have license plates affixed to both the front and rear.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, a missing front plate rarely prompts a law officer to pull a  U-turn and hit the flashing reds.  </P> <P> Officer Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's South Orange County  division said CHP officers don't spend much time looking for people with  missing license plates.  </P> <P> "It's just not something we focus a lot of attention on," Daily said, noting  that officers spend most of their time snaring motorists for far more grievous  violations like speeding and drunk driving.  </P> <P> "Generally, we like a stop to be for a little more than no front plate."  </P> <P> Patrolmen typically issue tickets for a missing plate only when they've  corralled a motorist for some other violation, Daily said. Even then, the  citation is merely a fix-it ticket requiring the driver to head into the local  Department of Motor Vehicles office to replace the missing plate.  </P> <P> Daily agrees that the most frequent scofflaws of the license plate law are  youthful drivers of high-performance sports cars who seem to feel that the  plates ruin the cosmetic appeal of their streamlined machines.  </P> <P> But some motorists simply don't realize they've got two plates when a new set  arrives in the mail, he said. These days, the plates are so thin and sandwiched  so tightly together that people occasionally think they've been issued only a  single plate for the rear bumper, Daily said.  </P> <P> As for the travails of Dorothy Jung and her beloved but battered license plate,  the prospect of saving good ol' "two eggs over easy" looks bleak.  </P> <P> Bill Gengler, a DMV spokesman in Sacramento, said people can reorder copies of  personalized "vanity" license plates, but general-issue "sequential" plates, by  policy, cannot be duplicated once they are lost or destroyed.  </P> <P> About 7 million sequential plates are stamped out in huge batches by the state  each year. With that sort of demand, it proves far less costly and time  consuming for the DMV to issue a whole new license number and plate to a  motorist rather than go through the chore of reproducing a lost or destroyed  plate.  </P> <P> Some motorists have inquired about getting sequential plates reissued by paying  extra cash and ordering the same license number as a vanity plate, Gengler  said. But that tactic is also forbidden, primarily because it could put the DMV  computers into a tail spin.  </P> <P> "She's out of luck," Gengler said. "But maybe she might get an even better  license number with her new plates."  </P> <P> Ordering a new set is simple. Any local DMV office can issue plates on the spot  for an $8 charge. People with vanity plates are given a temporary set while the  others are being stamped out and mailed.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> I'm happy about the diamond lanes, but find one thing about driving in them  that is very upsetting.  </P> <P> Although my husband and I were traveling at a respectable speed in the lane  that runs to Costa Mesa from Seal Beach, cars kept coming up behind us and  honking, telling us that we were not going fast enough. Since we were going  faster than the posted limit already, we resented this rudeness to a great  degree.  </P> <P> Was it the intention of the Highway Patrol to reserve that lane for cars  traveling 75 to 90 m.p.h. or drivers with one or more passengers in their cars?  We deeply resent that some drivers treat this lane as if it were a raceway.  Can't something be done about that?  </P> <P> Anona Gray  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P> <P> Tailgating is a common problem in car-pool lanes. There is something about a  special reserved lane sealed off by a yellow line that trips a switch in lots  of motorists. Many drivers figure they have carte blanche to push the pedal to  the metal: "Look, out world! Here I come! And how dare you go the speed limit!"  </P> <P> Lt. Dwight McKenna of the Highway Patrol's Santa Ana office said patrolmen are  always on the lookout for tailgaters in the car-pool lane. Tailgating is  considered one of the "big four" offenses, along with speeding, drunk driving  and unsafe lane changes, he said.  </P> <P> McKenna said officers invariably go with gusto after a tailgater zooming along  only a car length behind another vehicle. Some officers will snag an offender  if he's within two or three car lengths at speeds of more than 55 m.p.h., he  said.  </P> <P> Although the practice is extremely unsafe, people in the fast-lane life style  of Southern California seem to relish putting their reaction time to the test.  Fender bender accidents or worse are often the result.  </P> <P> The long-held rule of thumb is to maintain a car length for every 10 m.p.h.  Another good tip is to allow two seconds between you and the car ahead. To  check, pick a reference point, like a sign. Watch the car ahead as it passes  and count one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two. If you pass the same spot before  you finish counting, you're too close.  </P> <P> Of course, as Johnny Carson has joked, you can move six car lengths back and  five cars will pull in front of you.  </P> <P> Moreover, it doesn't do much good when some hotshot in a one-ton pickup comes  roaring up about 18 inches off your rear bumper.  </P> <P> In those cases, the best thing to do is get out of the guy's way and hope the  long arm of the law will eventually snag him, said Sam Haynes, a Highway Patrol  spokesman in Sacramento.  </P> <P> There is, however, a problem with employing that tactic in the car-pool lane --  the yellow line prevents a motorist from immediately sliding into the adjacent  lane. Haynes recommends staying calm and waiting for the broken white lines so  you can merge right. During rush hour, this may mean slowing way down and  popping into the gridlock of cars, but better that than letting some one-ton  turkey put your trunk in the back seat.  </P></p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Property: Black Wednesday still casts a long shadow - John Authers finds the industry unconvinced that a recent burst of activity represents an upturn NOT FOR the first time in the past three years, there is a feeling abroad that the UK's doom-laden residential property market may at last have turned. But as with so much else in 1992, Black Wednesday and its effect on confidence continue to cast a long shadow. Belief in imminent recovery is by no means irrational - it is founded on secure logical tenets of economics. But unfortunately some fundamental economic tenets have been turned on their head in the past few years. A consortium of life insurance companies that joined forces with the Henley Forecasting Centre last year to model the housing market proved this all too conclusively. It took all factors, such as unemployment, house prices, interest rates and demographics into account and was back-tested to show that it could successfully predict house prices for all periods from 1960. But the model has consistently predicted a rise in house prices for the past 24 months, and instead they have fallen steadily. According to David Badcock, of GA Life, a new factor must have emerged. He believes this is that infuriatingly insubstantial concept, 'confidence'. People who once would have been sufficiently happy with their finances to buy, are now too scared to do so. Away from the broader macroeconomic models, the housing market is so diverse that it is possible for anyone to find evidence for any theory. So why the optimism? Some of the buoyant emotions of the past few weeks come from a sudden resurgence in activity and transactions. Abbey National reported that it had done more gross lending in December, traditionally a bad month for house-buying, than in the usual peak month of August. December was heaviest in special fixed-rate deals, which are more popular than ever. Estate agents also reported a sudden pick-up in deals in the last two weeks of November and the first two weeks of December. Woolwich Property Services, an estate agency based predominantly in London and the South-East, enjoyed its highest volume of business for three years during this period while GA Property Services saw a 35 per cent increase in transactions on its usual figure for the period. Norman Lamont's autumn statement also injected life into the market by providing housing associations with extra cash to buy repossessed properties. This has stimulated private developers into action and Barnard Marcus, the auctioneers, reports that prices on auctioned London properties are beginning to increase. Repossession prices may, therefore, have bottomed out. The first swallows of spring? Senior figures within the housing industry remain unconvinced. Adrian Coles, of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, says: 'I'm not putting any weight on it yet. Mortgage lending will show a very slight increase, but it's still not back to where it was.' Michael Goodsell, of Royal Estates, reports that optimism is appearing at the grass roots of his estate agents' offices. 'I suppose they have to be optimistic because that's in the nature of their job. Let's hope it's justified.' The recent pick-up in activity does not yet outweigh the sharp downturn in activity following Black Wednesday, when the UK left the exchange rate mechanism and base rates briefly reached 15 per cent. This had a devastating effect on confidence and Goodsell reports that sales levels dropped 35 per cent in the following weeks - at a time when they might normally have been expected to stay buoyant. Many would-be buyers simply pulled the plug on well-advanced deals and the current upswing may be caused by these deals going through at last. But so many second-time buyers have been withholding their property from the market as prices fall and so many potential first-time buyers have been sheltering in rented accommodation that everyone seems confident the market will speed up next year. Precise estimates vary. Martin Ellis of the Woolwich building society is predicting a rise of 12 per cent in transactions for next year, while John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst for UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects a rise of 15 per cent. Derek Taylor, of Halifax Property Services, is expecting a rise of 10 per cent, but points out that this is no reason for celebration, given this year's fall of 15 per cent. A pick-up in demand for houses such as this would normally stimulate prices. But the UK's over-supply of property lies at the heart of disagreement over the course prices will take. Wriglesworth is predicting 'more pain before gain', and expects the overhang of supply to mean another 5 per cent fall in house prices before a modest recovery at the end of next year. A more common view, however, is that cheap mortgages and the changed cost of renting versus buying should be enough to keep the market stable for the next 12 months, with a possible slight recovery in nominal house prices at the end of the year. Few expect house prices to outstrip inflation, so in real terms most analysts believe houses will become slightly cheaper over the next year. Coles is more optimistic than most and points out that statistics are not available to show how much of the supply overhang is on the market already and how much is being rented. For example, he suspects that much of the overhang from inherited houses is being rented. Coles believes Wriglesworth may therefore have overestimated the effect that the supply overhang will have on the market. Affordability is the point sustaining the optimists. As house prices and mortgage rates fall while average earnings rise, so the argument goes, a house becomes easier to afford. This has traditionally been regarded as the crucial factor driving the property market - and houses had become extremely expensive by 1990. But affordability had already returned to a level in line with the historic trend by September. Black Wednesday, followed by a fall of 3 percentage points in base rates should have seen the market take off. Instead, house prices fell by around 3 per cent, according to the indices published by the Halifax and Nationwide building societies. The damage Black Wednesday inflicted on confidence was even greater than the good it did for housing affordability. A serious recovery in prices must await a recovery in the confidence in the management of the UK economy.</p>

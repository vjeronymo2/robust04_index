			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / E German investment inflow to rise 20% IN SPITE of the deepening recession in west Germany, investment in the eastern part of the country is expected to increase by almost 20 per cent this year, to more than DM135bn (Dollars 80bn), according to a new survey. The rate of increase in investment has declined, after a jump of 33 per cent, from DM84.5bn in 1991 to DM112.8bn in 1992, according to the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. West German enterprises contributed DM41.8bn to the total investment in 1992, and are expected to invest DM48.9bn this year, with the recession undoubtedly causing a number of plans to be cut back, but with commitments still pushing up the total. The main areas of new investment in the massive inflow of cash to the former Communist East Germany are transport and communications (DM22bn in 1992 and DM24bn in 1993), manufacturing industry (DM22bn and DM26.5bn respectively), and service enterprises, including housing for rent, (DM28.2bn and DM34.3bn). Ifo's calculations are based on a compilation of sources, including published investment plans of west German enterprises, information from foreign investors, the Treuhand privatisation agency, the federal statistics office, and Ifo's own investment surveys. The institute's initial calculations of private enterprise investment in mid-1992 proved slightly over-optimistic, and had to be revised downwards by some DM5bn in the latest survey - primarily reflecting lower investment in manufacturing industry. Housing investment, in contrast, expanded faster than first forecast. The figures reflect heavy investment by public sector enterprises, including the Treuhand agency itself, seeking to restructure eastern companies for privatisation, by the German railways, and by Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications monopoly. In 1993, the west German eletricity utilities are expected to invest some DM13bn in overhauling the eastern grid and power stations, an increase of one third on the current year. Germany's inflation rate stayed stubbornly high in April for the fourth month running, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Preliminary figures showed annual west German inflation in April rose slightly to 4.3 per cent - at the top end of most expectations - from 4.2 per cent in March. The federal statistics office said prices rose 0.3 per cent in April, the same rate as the previous month.</p>

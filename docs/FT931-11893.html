			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Commerce deputy secretary nominated PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has nominated Mr John Rollwagen, chairman and chief executive of Cray Research, to be deputy secretary of commerce. The nomination fulfils widespread expectations among US high-technology industry executives, who backed Mr Clinton in the election campaign, that one of their number would join the administration. Mr Rollwagen, 52, has headed Cray, the world's largest maker of supercomputers, since 1977. He is a founding member of the Computer Systems Policy Project (CSPP), a group of computer industry chief executives who worked closely with the Clinton election campaign on formulating high-technology policies aimed at improving the competitiveness of US industries. In particular CSPP advocates the construction of a 'national information infrastructure,' a high-speed data communications network linking schools, businesses, research laboratories and, ultimately, homes throughout the US. Mr Clinton said Mr Rollwagen would work to help restore 'the competitiveness of American business'. Mr Brown said Mr Rollwagen would play a central role in the Commerce Department's efforts to promote high-tech industries and create job opportunities in the areas of high technology and telecommunications. Cray's board of directors has elected Mr John Carlson, the company's president and chief operating officer, to replace Mr Rollwagen.</p>

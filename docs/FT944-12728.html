			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Markets: Risks of the Southern Comfort zone - Global Investor The average central banker has been programmed to warn about the threat of inflation regardless of economic circumstance. Something is clearly up, then, when a well-known anti-inflationary hawk like Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, argues that the markets are too pessimistic about the inflationary prospect. Cynics may conclude that the need to talk his bond book is temporarily taking precedence over Mr George's disinflationary zeal. Current high real rates of interest are prohibitive for government borrowers everywhere. So who is right: the governor or the markets? And why are bond markets suddenly making central bankers look like monetary doves? In the end the question turns on the nature of default risk. The markets are saying that current levels of government debt are unlikely to be serviced in full, especially in what economist David Roche of Independent Strategy likes to call the Southern Comfort countries - a category in which he includes Sweden and Finland, and on occasion the UK, along with Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (see accompanying rake's progress-type chart). Others whose debt-to-GDP ratios would qualify them for club membership include Canada and Belgium. The dismal calculus of debt is that real rates of interest are not only much higher than potential GDP growth rates in these countries; the gap is now so wide that it is difficult even for countries with strong governments to run a primary budget surplus (excluding interest) big enough to stop the debt increasing. Yet the markets clearly do not expect a formal default. Most of the Southern Comfort countries with substantial foreign currency denominated debts enjoy much lower rates of interest on the foreign component of the debt stock than on their domestic IOUs. It follows that investors are demanding an increased risk premium against the possibility of an internal default, whereby governments monetise debt by borrowing from the domestic banking system - the modern equivalent of printing money. Whether the markets are right to assume that the foreign debt will still be serviced is another matter. The consequence of internal default through inflation is likely to be an overvalued real exchange rate, followed by a devaluation that will increase the real cost in domestic currency of servicing the foreign investors' bonds. True, export earnings will also rise in response to the exchange rate change. But the relevant external debt is owed by the government, not the corporate sector. The more important question is whether, in an inflation-induced political and economic crisis, the reduced cost of servicing domestic debt will leave room to look after the external debtors. The experience of the Latin American debt crisis offers no encouragement on this score. And where countries are running a primary budget deficit, such as in Sweden and Spain (see table), holders of foreign currency debt are much more heavily at risk than the market recognises. What would happen if it came to the crunch? An obvious model would be the period under the last Labour government when fiscal rigour was imposed on the UK with a little arm-twisting from the International Monetary Fund. But there was also help, at that time, from global inflation and negative real rates of interest on Britain's external debt. No such help will be forthcoming in a world choc-a-bloc with bond market vigilantes. Nor will a government that is running a primary budget surplus necessarily feel the need to call on the services of the IMF. Default need not happen, of course. Both Ireland and Denmark have shown that debt stabilisation through fiscal adjustment is possible. With high real rates, the benefits from fiscal discipline are striking and immediate. Once markets detect signs of political will, the virtuous circle of falling rates, lower debt service, reduced budget deficits and shrinking risk premia can be quickly established. The snag is the scale of the problem. Consider Sweden, where David Roche estimates that it would take a monumental fiscal adjustment of 12 per cent of GDP just to start stabilising the public debt. Yet Sweden has the highest level of public spending in the developed world - over 70 per cent of GDP last year - for good reason: the people like their welfare state. Yet they also feel over-taxed. The message is that judgements about bond yields in inidividual countries are more than ever to do with politics. And it seems unlikely that the more general problem of high real rates will go away quickly, since the pressure on capital markets remains formidable. While the level of savings in the OECD is significantly lower than in the period before 1974, debt has been rising inexorably. The OECD projects that between 1978 and the end of this year net public sector debt will have risen from 21 per cent to 42 per cent of GDP. That suggests, pace the central bankers, that there could indeed be a serious inflationary problem. The markets cannot convince themselves that electorates are prepared to meet the ever-soaring bill for the welfare state. If the vigilantes are nodding, it is in being over-optimistic about the servicing of foreign currency indebtedness. But sooner or later the Southern Comfort zone will deliver a default. The more interesting question is whether the UK will be a victim or beneficiary of the resulting flight to quality.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 27/10/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   % change over period                        US    Japan    Germany   France   Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.09    0.04      0.09      0.10    0.16    0.11 Month                0.42    0.20      0.41      0.45    0.69    0.46 Year                 3.56    2.31      5.63      5.81    8.25    5.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                -0.10   -0.02     -0.37     -0.35    0.74   -0.45 Month               -0.47   -0.64      0.49      0.27    1.06    0.92 Year                -2.87   -0.60      1.02     -0.68    1.25   -0.43  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                -0.29   -0.03     -1.11     -1.15    1.09   -0.56 Month               -0.86   -1.14      0.47     -0.48    0.60    1.58 Year                -7.88   -1.90     -4.08     -7.66   -5.44   -4.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 -0.2    -1.2      -2.5      -0.7    -1.6    -1.1 Month                 1.1     0.7      -2.2      -2.3   -10.8     0.9 Year                  3.3    -3.2      -2.3     -10.5     8.2     0.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

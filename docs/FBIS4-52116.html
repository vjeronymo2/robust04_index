			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, May 4 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  has called on the United Nations Security Council to take urgent  measures to restore peace and order in Rwanda.    Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed who made the call  Wednesday said Malaysia was deeply concerned over the tragic  situation in the central African state.    In a statement received here from Paris, Dr. Mahathir said  that the continuing internal political strife taking place in  Rwanda had led to great loss of lives and created an exodus of  refugees to neighbouring countries.    Dr. Mahathir is in France on a private visit. [Passage  omitted]</p>

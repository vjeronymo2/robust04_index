			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 23 January that the Defense  Ministry will export about 10 F5AB fighter planes of the ROK Air  Force to Thailand at the cost of from $1 to $1.5 million each.  F5AB is an outmoded fighter plane model that was introduced  from the United States late in the sixties. This is the first  time the ROK has exported planes. The United States originally  opposed the ROK's plan to export planes of this model, but has  recently consented to it.</p>

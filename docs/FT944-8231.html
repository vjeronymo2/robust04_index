			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom sell-off decision expected today One of the most keenly awaited decisions in the investment banking world is expected to be taken in Bonn today when Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets with Deutsche Telekom to decide which banks will handle the DM15bn (Dollars 9.7bn) partial privatisation of the German telecommunications concern. The main interest centres on which foreign investment bank will be chosen as global co-ordinator for the sale of Telekom shares to international investors. Goldman Sachs of the US is the most favoured candidate for this role, which will involve working with the two big German banks - Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank - expected jointly to head the overall issue. However, other US and European banks are strongly in the running. European banks have made clear their feeling that the post of global co-ordinator should go to one of them and not a US institution. Altogether, 22 foreign banks from the US, Europe and Japan put their cases (in a so-called beauty contest) in Bonn to the government and Telekom. Among those whose chances are also rated highly are Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley of the US and SG Warburg of the UK. Also to be decided is the role of adviser to the government on the Telekom issue. CS First Boston has put itself up for this position only, though other banks are interested. The chancellor is scheduled to meet this afternoon with Telekom and the finance and postal ministries. The decision is expected to be announced quickly. Apart from the global co-ordinating role, other banks will be chosen to manage the regional consortiums for north America, Europe and Asia. Telekom has said a British bank could well have a senior consortium role because of the importance of the UK stock market. Although the sale of 25 per cent of Telekom's shares will not take place until early in 1996, with another tranche in 1998, the issue will have important consequences for the development of German financial markets and domestic investment in equities. About half the shares are likely to be sold to German institutional and private buyers.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Rationalisation fails to prevent Hartons' setback THE ECONOMIC downturn in the UK dealt a harsh blow to Hartons Group, the distributor of plastic sheet and film, which saw profits of Pounds 608,000 in 1989 turn into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.14m last year. Steps to rationalise operations failed to counter a sharp fall in demand for the group's products. Turnover, which during the year fell 16 per cent to Pounds 128.84m (Pounds 153m), was down 14 per cent in the fourth quarter. Last year's decline 'truly reflected the state of the economy,' said Mr Colin Astin, chairman. The group's wide customer spread covers a cross-section of the general economy and for that reason 'when the economy goes down our business goes down.' In an effort to stem its sagging profits, Hartons embarked on a reorganisation programme, closing 11, or a third, of its distribution branches in the UK and rationalising operations in the remaining 20. These measures were behind an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.23m. Additionally, the disposal of the Wakeling Medical manufacturing company and the closure of its only distribution outlet in Ireland, resulted in an extraordinary loss of Pounds 578,000. Wakeling was sold at net asset value of Pounds 215,000. The effect of the recession on customers, which comprise mainly smaller to medium-sized companies, was reflected in the increase in bad and doubtful debt provisions to Pounds 1m. Among overseas operations, which contribute half of turnover, North America was hit by deteriorating economic conditions whereas European markets generally put in a firm performance. France produced record profits on turnover up 10 per cent while Spain saw turnover increase by 8 per cent. The group will continue rationalising operations that are not essential to its longer-term objectives, Mr Astin said. Any disposals would not be in the UK and would be aimed at concentrating the group's activities on plastics distribution. Benefits of the rationalisation should emerge this year. Borrowings have come down and working capital has been released as a result of lower interest charges and closures. 'Nothing's changed and it all looks very grim,' Mr Astin said, 'but people for the first time in many months are begining to talk positively.' The group saw a slight improvement in March, he said. Losses per share came to 3.6p (0.06p) and no final dividend is proposed. The total for the year is 0.1p (0.2p).</p>

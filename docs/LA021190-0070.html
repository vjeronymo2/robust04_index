			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE THE SKIES ARE NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY;  </P> <P> GROWING UP WESTERN RECOLLECTIONS EDITED AND WITH INTRODUCTIONS BY CLARUS  BACKES; FOREWORD BY LARRY MCMURTRY (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22.95; 240 PP.)  </P> <P> Up behind the house in the hilly suburbs of Colorado Springs, my wife's cousin  has a little place marked out among the pines which he refers to as his "shrine  of the West." There he has some of the things that we all commonly associate  with the American West: a couple of bleached cow skulls, an old wagon wheel,  various odds and ends of mining iron, etc.  </P> <P> You can't see the spot from anywhere around, not even the house. It's just  there, and he knows it's there, and now and then he adds something to it.  Another of my wife's cousins retired with his wife to an isolated piece of land  in western Nevada, with no running water until last year, electricity supplied  by a gas generator, a privy out in the sagebrush, and no phone.  </P> <P> These little vignettes are not unlike those provided by the seven distinguished  men writers (why no women?) who grew up somewhere in that almost independent  nation we call The West: Dee Brown ("Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"), A. B.  Guthrie Jr. ("The Big Sky"), David Lavender ("One Man's West"), Wright Morris  ("The Field of Vision"), Clyde Rice ("A Heaven in the Eye"), Wallace Stegner  ("The Big Rock Candy Mountain") and Frank Waters ("Book of the Hopi").  </P> <P> Mentioning single titles like this does not do justice to the writers, of  course. Some are known best by these works, but all have written others -- some  more memorable than others -- and of course Wallace Stegner and Wright Morris  were the 1980 and 1981 winners of the Los Angeles Times Robert Kirsch Award for  the whole body of their work, and there are other national awards scattered  among these seven.  </P> <P> The editor of this book, Clarus Backes, was book editor of the Denver Post.  Before his death in 1988, Backes gathered these anecdotal pieces and wrote  brief introductions to each. His children completed the editing and saw their  father's book into press, and another distinguished western writer, Larry  McMurtry, agreed to write a foreword.  </P> <P> The writers chosen all are now in their 80s, so they grew up in a West --  between Oregon and Texas -- that has changed considerably since their several  boyhoods. The vignettes of Western life have a common texture, therefore, which  corresponds to a great extent with the mental icon, carried by many Americans,  which represents this curious region.  </P> <P> And it is a curious region, with an even more curious iconographic consistency:  One might say that the image we have of the West is of the highest definition,  to a degree even more pronounced than that of the South. Western dress and  Western music, for example, are unique in the American cultural heritage.  </P> <P> If we think about it, we might be able to concoct "Southern dress," perhaps  even "Pacific Coast dress," or that of the Northeast, but Western clothes do  not need any concoction: We know the elements of the cowboy outfit instantly;  so do people around the world. We call the music "Country and Western," but its  origins are clearly in the cowboy ballad. Indeed, the West, as icon, was  perhaps the first internationally recognized image of American character.  </P> <P> The texture presented in these vignettes should not, therefore, come as any  surprise. The features of the land, and the raw quality of the civilization  that crept into it, element by element, are not unfamiliar: ranch life, the  railroad, whorehouses, telegraph offices, saloons, gold mines, all the panoply  of the West that corresponds to our image of it, all spread out against the  mountains, rivers, plains and deserts that are still there, some of them even  untouched by strip- mining and real-estate development.  </P> <P> Here is Wright Morris, describing a scene from his boyhood: "At a time every  western man smoked and gambled, spitting indoors was something of an option. My  father neither smoked, drank, gambled nor swore, but he liked to sit and talk  in a good lobby. A good one had palm trees in tubs at the front, with a tile  floor all the way back to the desk.  </P> <P> "Without a lobby from where to watch what was going on, without a lobby where  something of interest might happen, a town could have half a dozen or more good  railroads but in no time at all none of the trains would stop. Even before I  knew anything else, I knew that."  </P> <P> It is an odd book, strangely comforting in its assurance that what we think of  when we summon up an image of the West is not just the invention of Hollywood.  As kids, most of us seemed to know that the movies were filmed in Simi Valley  (after all, why truck all that film gear so far from the studios?), but we  fervently hoped that the West of Randolph Scott had been in fact something like  what we were shown.  </P> <P> But what, after all, is the appeal of the West? What is the hunger in us that  its violent landscapes and the ruggedly individualistic character traits of its  people promise to satisfy? There are lots of cheap answers, none adequate. Why  did I buy myself a pair of cowboy boots in Colorado Springs, to the  uncomprehending and sardonic amusement of my wife? Her cousin could not explain  it to her, any more than could I.  </P> <P> Why did we both find the gently dying mining town of Victor, on the slopes of  Pike's Peak, infinitely preferable to the touristy hucksterism of Cripple  Creek? I looked to Frank Waters, who grew up there, and to Dee Brown and the  others for an answer, but they seem just as unable to explain it.  </P> <P> One of my best friends, the Western painter Ron Himler, moved to Tucson to get  closer to the country of his subject, the Indians of the Plains and the  Southwest. I asked him what made him choose the subject that ultimately drew  him to where he feels he has found his roots. We polished off a lot of brandy  one night talking about it.  </P> <P> He couldn't explain it either.  </P></p>

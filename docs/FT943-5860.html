			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (8): No business like funny business - Conserving a culture Few Japanese people would consider a sense of humour to be a national characteristic. But in Kansai, cracking jokes is a way of life. 'When they are late for an appointment, Osaka folk will often greet their companion with a joke instead of apologising for their tardiness,' observes Mr Kenji Miyashita, editor of the Kansai edition of PIA, a popular weekly magazine on city trends and events. This instinctive humour has given rise to a strain of comedy that is distinctly Kansai, and which is exemplified in Yoshimoto Kogyo, one of the most successful entertainment companies in Japan. Amid one of the country's gloomiest post-war periods, Yoshimoto has been doing a roaring trade selling Kansai laughter. The company owns three theatres in Osaka, and earlier this year opened another in the classy Ginza district of Tokyo. Yoshimoto's influence and the appeal of Kansai humour have been such that, to many Japanese people, comedy fails unless it is performed in the Kansai dialect. 'It is not surprising that Yoshimoto has been such a success,' says Mr Tatsuya Terasawa, a civil servant living in Tokyo, who comes from Osaka. 'Everyone in Osaka is like a Yoshimoto comedian. It is no wonder that the better among them should be considered especially good anywhere else.' The cult, according to those who have lived there, begins early in life for Kansai folk. Unlike Tokyo, where schoolboys aspire to achieve high marks or win sports medals, popularity in the Osaka classroom depends less on intelligence or athleticism than on how funny you are. The propensity of Kansai people to look for the funny side of things stems from a merchant culture which fostered the knack of spotting the unadorned truth beneath the respectable show that most people, especially Tokyoites, tend to put on. 'Kansai humour stems from the gap between tatemae, or human behaviour that follows the social rules, and honne, or their true thoughts and feelings,' explains Mr Masashi Noyama, manager of corporate information at Yoshimoto Kogyo. There is also a happy-go-lucky attitude among Osaka people that contrasts sharply with the seriousness with which Japanese society takes most things in life, and adds to Kansai humour. For example, if a cheque bounces, the Osaka businessman might call his lawyer and say, 'something terrible has happened,' as if it had happened to someone else, points out Mr Noyama. The contrast between the seriousness of the event and the easy-going attitude is what makes the situation funny, he explains. Yet, while Kansai humour is today widely appreciated throughout Japan, Mr Noyama and others worry that the distinctiveness of the region's culture is being lost behind the uniformity of an increasingly influential mass media. Like many other things which originated in the Kansai region, local musicians, designers and performers tend to move to Tokyo once they become successful, observes Mr Miyashita, at PIA. There used to be an Osaka blues and soul culture in the 1970s, but that has more or less disappeared; while Kansai theatre performers, including comedians, move to Tokyo in order to go into television. Concern that Kansai is being drained of talent has prompted the Osaka city government to encourage theatre companies to use public facilities for performances. The Osaka chamber of commerce aims to encourage the study of Osaka as a city by promoting plays that use it as a setting, gift ideas that improve the city's image, and music compact discs by, for example, the Osaka Philharmonic Orchestra. Others, such as Mr Noyama, hope that, with the spread of the information superhighway, talented performers will no longer have to move to Tokyo.</p>

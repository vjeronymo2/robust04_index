			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Management: The continuing search for excellence - Book review When Tom Peters and Robert Waterman were consultant colleagues in McKinsey &amp; Co's organisation practice in the 1970s, Waterman played godfather to Peters, the brilliant but reckless junior. But since they went their separate ways after the staggering success a decade ago of their best-seller, In Search of Excellence, it is Peters who has had the higher profile. His string of charismatic shockers, notably Thriving on Chaos and Liberation Management, eclipsed the quieter Waterman's equally perceptive works, The Renewal Factor and Adhocracy: The Power to Change. With this latest volume*, The Frontiers of Excellence, Waterman deserves to hit the same heights as Peters. In the US, where the book's local title is What America Does Right, its timing is especially good: after several years of self-doubt, American business is ripe for the same sort of confidence-booster that In Search of Excellence proved in 1982-83. The core of Waterman's message is captured in his subtitle: Learning From Companies That Put People First. His argument is simple if controversial: that today's top companies, like those which have remained successful over the long term, do not put the shareholders first. Instead, they pay primary attention to employees and customers. As a result they perform far more effectively than their rivals, and thereby deliver superior results to their shareholders. They do this, says Waterman, by being better organised to meet the needs of their employees, thereby motivating them unusually well; and to meet the needs of customers by being either more innovative, more reliable or cheaper  -or all three. This is simple to state but difficult to achieve. Waterman devotes almost the entire book to examining how 10 US organisations 'put people first'; how the courier company Federal Express strikes an ideal balance between what he calls 'potentially oppressive systems and the cheerful attitudes of a deeply enthusiastic workforce'; how Levi Strauss, the clothing manufacturer, creates employee commitment and a set of empowering 'shared values' in a sweatshop industry; how household goods company Rubbermaid and consumer products group Procter &amp; Gamble have remained so innovative for so long; how Motorola's 50-year-old maxim of 'anticipate and commit' has inspired the telecoms company to change its business several times and improve product quality; and so on. Along the way, Waterman provides several valuable insights: into the nature of leadership in a decentralised, shallow organisation ('today's leaders understand that you have to give up control to get results - they act as coaches not as 'the boss''); into the importance to strategic success of building relationships with customers and suppliers that are hard for rivals to duplicate; and in the consequent need to organise outwards and downwards to please customers and employees, rather than upwards to please the boss. These principles emerge from the wealth of practical detail, so that the reader has a sense of learning alongside Waterman rather than being lectured. That said, the book has minor flaws. Prime among them is Waterman's very enthusiasm, boyishly infectious though it is for the most part. His celebration of P&amp;G's innovation, and its history of encouraging self-managed teams in several factories, hardly pauses to consider claims that its head office has a Stalinist, oppressive culture. Waterman also concentrates too much on the well-known potential for companies to liberate the initiative of their frontline employees. Far too little of the book deals with the trickier and more complex question of whether middle and senior managers - those who keep their jobs - can be liberated in similar fashion. Waterman also ducks the thorny question of why some great companies stumble badly, while others remain vibrant. To conclude that we should 'learn from the best while they're good and move on when they lose their edge' is a cop-out unworthy of the manifest intelligence which Waterman shows in the rest of this very readable book. * The Frontiers of Excellence, published in April by Nicholas Brealey Publishing, price Pounds 16.99 (in the US: What America Does Right, published by Norton, Dollars 25).</p>

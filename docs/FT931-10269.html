			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: David Brown - Correction David Brown Group, the gear and pump maker which is shortly to be floated, had one strike in 1991, a year after the group's new management team arrived. The phrase 'a strike each year since they arrived' in yesterday's FT was the result of an editing error.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, FDA is also proposing to require in &sect;123.8(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the processor retain any records relating to the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequacy of the equipment or processes being used by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor, including the results of scientific studies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations to determine adequacy, for 1 year beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability of these records to refrigerated products being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced by the processor, and for 2 years beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability of the records to frozen or preserved products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being produced by the processor. The processor may need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain a written scientific evaluation of a process, such as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooking, pasteurization, or cooling process, to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process it is using is adequate to destroy pathogens or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent their growth. Such an evaluation may also be necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure the adequacy of the cooking, pasteurizing, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerating equipment that the processor is using. (See the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with processing records, these records should be retained for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a period of time that reflects the period that the products to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they relate can be expected to be in commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recognizes that some processing plants may be closed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a seasonal basis. Given the nature of the HACCP system, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA may choose to inspect at least the records of a plant even if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plant is not in operation. Therefore, FDA is providing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.8(c) that if a processing facility is closed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between seasonal packs, the records may be transferred to some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably accessible location during the period of closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.8(d) that HACCP plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and records be available for review and copying by authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency employees at reasonable times. As already discussed, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's access to HACCP records is essential to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP system is working, and that the safety of seafood is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensured by design. FDA's authority to require maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these records, and to provide for agency access to them, is fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported by the holding in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Confectioners Association <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Califano, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  569 F.2d 694&hyph;95 (D.C. Cir. 1978). In this case, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> court recognized FDA's authority to impose recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on firms that process foods when such requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectuate the goals of the act. See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Toilet Goods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gardner, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  387 U.S. 158, 163&hyph;164 (1967). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of the records in ensuring that fish and fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products will not be rendered injurious to health has been fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed. FDA access to these records will expedite the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's efforts to ensure that the fish and fishery products in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interstate commerce are not adulterated and to identify any such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that are.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is aware that there is substantial public interest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent to which industry-generated HACCP records could or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be publicly available. As FDA understands it, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argument in favor of availability is that where an inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system to protect the public health relies heavily on records,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those records should be public to the maximum extent possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The arguments in favor of protection of records, on the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand, are based on concerns about advantages to competitors from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure and on the risk that the records will be otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misused if they become public. FDA invites comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general question of public disclosure of HACCP records and on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's preliminary analysis of their availability, as follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has longstanding explicit statutory access to certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry records during inspections involving infant formula,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drugs, and devices and has access by regulation to certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing records during inspections of low acid canned food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors. The agency has the right to copy and take possession  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these records but does not routinely do so. FDA typically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copies and takes possession of records only when they may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed for regulatory purposes. As a preliminary matter, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects to continue that practice with regard to seafood HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public availability of those HACCP records that FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would possess as a result of copying during an inspection would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be governed by section 301(j) of the act and by the Freedom of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Act (FOIA) and regulations issued pursuant to it by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 301(j) of the act expressly prohibits FDA from disclosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade secret information obtained during the course of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection. The FOIA regulations also say that FDA will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divulge either trade secret or commercial confidential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. As a preliminary matter, HACCP plans and monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records appear to fall within these two categories of protected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records. As a consequence, FDA may well have little discretion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this area. Moreover, under DHHS' FOIA regulations, processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be entitled to challenge in court a pending disclosure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records on the grounds that the records to be disclosed are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial confidential or trade secret.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an additional matter, there are significant legal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical questions as to whether FDA has the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require disclosure of industry records that are not in FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession. As discussed elsewhere in this document, FDA does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not contemplate the submission of HACCP plans or other records to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA under these proposed regulations. The preapproval of HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans by FDA (and thus the submission of HACCP plans to FDA) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simply not practical. The agency has tentatively concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plans and monitoring records will be reviewed on site by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency investigators as part of FDA's normal inspection regime.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

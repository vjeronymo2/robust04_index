			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report THE RECENT sharp fall in London Metal Exchange ZINC prices was extended yesterday morning before consumer interest appeared at last to steady the market. The three months price, which had fallen Dollars 190 during October, reached Dollars 1,092 a tonne during the morning before steadying to close at Dollars 1,096.50 a tonne, down Dollars 16 from Friday. The recovery continued in kerb (after-hours) trading, which ended with three months zinc at Dollars 1,101.50 a tonne. COPPER traded narrowly in dollar terms, reflecting a fairly lifeless performance on the New York market, and three months metal ended at Dollars 2,272 a tonne, down Dollars 13. The weak pound boosted sterling copper prices with the three months position ending the kerb session at Pounds 1,496.50 a tonne, its highest level for more than two years and a gain of Pounds 20.25 from Friday's kerb close. COCOA futures at the London Futures and Options Exchange were also boosted by sterling's fall, the March position ending the day Pounds 19 up at Pounds 724 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

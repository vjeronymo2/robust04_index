			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Big advertiser set to make series for ITV Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer-products group and inventor of the soap opera, is set to make programmes for ITV in the first deal of its kind in the UK. The company, which is the world's biggest advertiser, is negotiating the sale to the ITV network of a game show called Go Bingo. The Independent Television Commission, which sets out strict rules about the influence advertisers are allowed to have on programmes, said the show would not be permitted to push Procter's products. The deal would go much further than the present sponsorship arrangements between commercial companies and TV programmes. Procter owns the rights to Go Bingo. This contrasts with sponsored programmes, which are made independently, and sponsors are then invited to associate themselves with the finished programme. TV sponsorship is becoming increasingly popular: Midland Bank is the latest company to announce a link with a TV programme. It said on Monday that it would sponsor Moving Story, a Carlton Television comedy series. Ryvita, the crispbread manufacturer, is another company which has recently moved into sponsorship - it will be associated with Swank, a weekly afternoon fashion programme. ITV, which confirmed that negotiations with Procter were in progress, said there would be a straight sale of the bingo programme and there would be no question of Procter bartering the programme in return for advertising airtime. Bartering is a common practice elsewhere in Europe. In some countries advertisers supply programmes complete with advertisements at the beginning and end of the show. The ITC said there had been a small number of advertiser-supplied programmes shown in the UK since new rules made the practice possible in 1991. These have included a Tina Turner concert made by Pepsi, the soft-drink producer, and Indy car racing supplied by Texaco, the US oil group. However, it will be the first time a multinational will have sold a series to the ITV network. To comply with ITC rules, Procter will have to state at the beginning and end of the show that it has made the programme. Mr Ed Artzt, Procter's chairman and chief executive, recently told a conference of US advertising chiefs that the company was exploring alternatives worldwide to conventional TV advertising because of the increasing fragmentation of audiences and new media developments which mean that viewers can choose not to receive advertisements.</p>

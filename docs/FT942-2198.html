			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / 25 die in Iranian prayer hall blast Iran said that 25 people were killed and 70 wounded yesterday when a bomb exploded in a crowded prayer hall in the north eastern Iranian town of Mashhad. The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said the worshippers had congregated at the mausoleum of Imam Reza to observe the Islamic mourning day of Ashura. The authorities in Tehran immediately blamed the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, the main Iranian opposition group, which in the past few years has been more visible outside the country than within. However, a statement issued from the Mujahadeen office in Paris 'strongly condemned' the bombing. It added: 'Such criminal actions, which inflict casualties on innocent people, only serve the interests of the mullahs' regime.' IRNA reported that several people had been arrested. An interior ministry official quoted by the agency said several of the injured were critically ill. Earlier the death toll had been put at 70. Mashhad was the centre of rioting two years ago when official buildings, banks and shops were attacked and several people killed in protests believed to have been sparked by demolition of slum housing. There have been reports of minor incidents in Tehran this year, but none causing serious loss of life or damage to buildings. But with last year's fall in oil prices, the government has fallen further behind in meeting international debt obligations and, with inflation rising sharply, senior Iranian officials have been aware of the risks of public discontent. Parliament has refused to sanction price increases sought by the government and President Rafsanjani's efforts to maintain other economic reforms, such as a single exchange rate, have been abandoned. An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale struck southern Iran yesterday killing two people, injuring over 100 and destroying or damaging 51 villages, official media said, Reuter reports from Tehran.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> French doctors reported what may be the first documented case in medical  literature of infection with the AIDS virus through an acupuncture needle.  Doctors at the Necker Hospital in Paris described the case of a 17-year-old boy  who apparently became infected with HIV -- the virus that causes the deadly  disease -- when he underwent acupuncture for tendinitis. "We believe that the  incidence of HIV transmission by acupuncture is very low," the doctors wrote in  reporting the case in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. A  spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said that there have  been no documented cases of infection with the AIDS virus in the United States  from an acupuncture needle.  </P></p>

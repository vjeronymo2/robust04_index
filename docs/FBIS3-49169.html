A joint statement has been released. The statement  reiterates the imperative that a cease-fire should immediately  take effect; there should be a lasting cessation of hostilities  as well as a lasting basis for regulating relations between the  Croat and Bosnian peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It has been agreed that Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic  will meet on 8 January. An agreement was also confirmed in  Vienna on a free-trade zone in the port of Ploce. The  cease-fire plan will be discussed in Bonn. Peace mediators Owen  and Stoltenberg said that a cease-fire agreement alone would not  solve the problem because in Bosnia-Herzegovina 69 cease-fires  had been agreed so far while the end of the war was still not  yet in sight.    Due to the protracted grave situation on the ground,  proposals were tabled for the first time for mutual demarcation  between the Croats and Muslims. The two sides agree that an  immediate cease-fire and a lasting cessation of hostilities is  in the interest of both peoples and both states. In Bonn on  Saturday Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic will also discuss  the organization of future political, military, territorial, and  humanitarian relations between the two peoples.    [Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic] "This is by all  accounts the most precious result of today's and yesterday's  meetings. This means that at the meeting of the two presidents  they will also talk about a cease-fire."    [Unidentified announcer] Being aware of the risks in the  event of these conflicts on the ground deepening and spreading,  both sides accepted peaceful solutions to the problems. They  particularly discussed the need for full compliance with the  existing cease-fires, especially so in central Bosnia. A  comprehensive plan is being drawn up for the implementation of  the cease-fire along front lines, including a suspension of all  military activity, thus creating preconditions for a lasting  cessation of hostilities. This plan, which must be finalized by  Saturday, will include protection for the population and  trust-building measures.    [Unidentified correspondent] "Do you believe there is some  chance of an agreement on a cessation of hostilities in Bonn on  Saturday?"    [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic] "Talking  about whether there is any chance, the answer is, in fact, yes.  The answer to this question is yes. This will not be simple.  I can see that there is goodwill and this is why my answer is  yes, there is a chance."    [Unidentified announcer] An agreement was also reached on a  free-trade zone in the port of Ploce. The cochairmen's  suggestion about access to the sea near Prevlaka was explicitly  rejected. For the first time, envoys Granic and Silajdzic told  each other their territorial demands. For the first time, the  Muslims discussed Croatia's stands on territories. On the  ground in Bosnia, in the shadow of death, a diplomatic  foundation for a new peace was found.    [Granic] "Both sides have taken on an obligation to do their  best to implement the existing agreements and signed agreements.  This means putting an end to all conflicts. In any case, to us  this therefore means that the Bosnian Muslim offensive on the  Croat enclaves in central Bosnia should stop, and so should  conflicts along all frontlines between the Croats and Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will also be one of the main topics of  the Tudjman-Izetbegovic meeting."    [Unidentified announcer] Some of the most important results  are the humanitarian solutions -- a special commission will  ensure the crossing of a field hospital to the left bank in  Mostar tomorrow [6 January], the reconstruction of the  devastated city, and the return of expelled persons according to  the Brussels agreement. This will be discussed by the working  group for Mostar.    [Granic] "We have achieved several concrete results. This  might not seem enough, the situation being what it is, but we  believe this to be a step forward -- especially regarding the  humanitarian situation, the Mostar issue.    "The talks were held in a constructive atmosphere. We hope  it stays the same in future, but most of all we hope that these  measures and agreements at certain levels will result in a  cessation of hostilities -- this is the most important thing,  without this all these agreements will acquire a completely  different dimension. I hope we will succeed."    [Unidentified announcer] A special commission will meet on 7  January to discuss the passage of humanitarian convoys, the  evacuation of the wounded, and the long-term supplying of  hospitals. A commission for the exchange of prisoners will meet  on 11 January.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (6): Caution the watchword after wake-up call - 'Some levels of asset prices during 1993 were based on a hope and a prayer' / Investors in the secondary debt market need to be more discerning During last year's raging bull run, you could buy almost any emerging market debt instrument and make a substantial profit. However, amid the uncertain US interest rate outlook and with general elections in several developing nations looming, that performance will be hard to match this year, and investors will need to be a great deal more discerning if they are to ride the secondary debt market successfully. Prices for emerging market debt were driven to dizzy heights in 1993 on a wave of foreign capital attracted by double-digit returns and improving domestic conditions in many developing countries, where political and economic reforms were beginning to pay off. The rally soon attracted increasingly indiscriminate buyers - including highly leveraged speculators  -who helped push price levels that proved unsustainable. 'Some of the gains were purely liquidity-driven,' says Marc Wenhammar, head of fixed income at Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets. Especially in some of the non-performing debt markets, 'the price appreciation didn't really correspond with fundamentals - it was pure speculation,' he says. 'To be honest, some levels of asset prices last year were based on a hope and a prayer,' echoes Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank in London. J P Morgan's Brady bond index surged 44.17 per cent last year. West Merchant Bank's secondary debt index, which, besides Brady bonds, includes the commercial debt of countries which have not yet completed the Brady restructuring process, rose by 63.6 per cent. When the inevitable wake-up call came - in the form of US interest rate tightening in February - it sent emerging bond markets plunging in a sell-off exacerbated by panic-selling from hedge funds and other leveraged players. Domestic woes, including the assassination in late March of Mexican presidential candidate Donaldo Colosio, put further downward pressure on prices. In the first four months of 1994, WMB's index shed about 23.5 per cent. While the slump was across-the-board in nature, it varied in magnitude, with the non-performing assets particularly badly hit. This is a mirror image of last year's developments, when the prices of such instruments were driven up sharply in anticipation of debt restructuring deals, says Mr West. With little or no current yield, these assets had no support during the market sell-off, as exemplified by Peru, Russia and Panama. In the first four months of the year, the price of Peru's Citibank loans plunged by 41.7 per cent, Russian Vneshekonombank debt sagged by 45.5 per cent and Panama's US dollar loans fell by 32.7 per cent. 'Both the surge in inflows in 1992 and 1993 and the sudden contraction in early 1994 reflected a herd mentality,' Charles Dallara, managing director of the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, said in a recent speech. Most specialists feel the sell-off has been overdone and say many markets have begun to offer good value. 'The correction has now put markets into cheap territory versus their fundamental credit quality,' says Aidan Freyne, head of emerging market sales for Salomon Brothers Europe. Many also feel the shake-out may prove beneficial for the markets longer-term. 'The correction will ultimately be good for the secondary market - it got rid of the speculative money, and is making people look at fundamentals, analysing which markets really provide value,' says Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants in Washington. According to Salomon Brothers, outstanding emerging market debt at the end of the first quarter consisted of some Dollars 127bn in Brady bonds; Dollars 221bn in medium- and short-term bank debt (including pre-Brady bank debt); and some Dollars 112bn in eurobonds, globals and Yankees. In addition, there is about Dollars 255bn in local-currency, domestic market instruments, only some of which foreigners can buy. Although the market includes eastern European, African and Asian debt, the lion's share of turnover is in Latin American paper. New external investment and lending to principal developing countries, which fell from Dollars 102.7bn in 1981 to Dollars 27.5bn in 1987, surged to Dollars 180.8bn last year, according to numbers published by the IIF. Equity and bond purchases dominated last year's flows, each accounting for more than Dollars 60bn, with commercial banks providing another Dollars 24bn. This contrasts with the heavy reliance on commercial banks in 1981, when they provided about 60 per cent of the total flows. Heavy private external financing to developing nations bears the risk of 'inducing a mood of complacency' among policy makers, Mr Dallara warns, urging that developing nations' governments keep up their reform policies if they want to maintain a stable flow of funds to their economies. He also said investors need more information on emerging markets: both on their economic performance and prospects, as well as the risks involved - sovereign, liquidity, counterparty and market risks. This could contribute to greater discrimination by investors, and thus reduce volatility 'by acting as a counterweight to both bullish and bearish swings in sentiment,' he says. Discerning investors will have to watch out for several potentially market-moving developments this year. On the political front, several Latin American countries will hold general elections in the coming months, with Mexico's polls in August and Brazil's October elections particularly closely watched. Moreover, investors should keep an eye on the ongoing debt restructuring process. Bulgaria, Ecuador and Poland are next in line for Brady deals, having reached agreements in principle with their creditors. Panama, where restructuring proposals have already been exchanged, and Peru are expected to reach agreements late this year or early 1995. Russia is expected to restructure its commercial bank debt this year but there will be no write-off of either principal or interest. Lastly, Cote d'Ivoire has a growing chance of negotiating a deal in 1995 and is the most attractive exotic asset, notes Alexander Mitcheson-Smith, emerging markets analyst at UBS. As long as US interest rate uncertainty continues to cloud the horizon, emerging bond markets could be prone to unpredictable mood swings. Many observers do not expect to see a sustained market recovery until late this year, when the peak in US rates has passed, the elections are out of the way and growth in the region picks up. However, some traders are reporting a cautious return by investors seeking exposure to some of the more heavily sold sectors. 'We are starting to see investors looking for cheap paper,' says one trader. 'The market has deteriorated along with Treasuries but its fundamentals haven't - for a lot of people, these levels offer great value for the longer term.'</p>

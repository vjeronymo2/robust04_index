			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POTTER TESTS SKILL ON DELICATE JAPANESE PIECES  </P> <P> Ever so carefully, Meriwether McClorey puts pieces of raku pottery into her  kiln. The Somerset potter plans to fire about 30 pieces on this chilly  afternoon.  </P> <P> The kiln, a converted water heater, will hold only three pieces. So McClorey  and her husband will spend more than eight hours repeating the firing process.  It's a painstaking but fascinating method of making art, and friends come by to  watch during the evening.  </P> <P> Raku (pronounced rah-KOO) can be traced back to traditional Japanese tea  ceremonies. More than 1,000 years ago, decorating and firing pottery was a  social event marked by drinking tea.  </P> <P> McClorey, who has specialized in raku for about four years, says the process  has been changed in the United States, where potters are apt to do firing much  more quickly.  </P> <P> To look at the delicate pottery, it is obvious that much skill goes into every  piece. Yet, to an extent, the outcome of each one is unpredictable. During  firing, new patterns emerge. They work in concert with the original, intended  ones.  </P> <P> "Go ahead and light it," McClorey says to her husband, John.  </P> <P> Fueled by a combination of propane gas and air, the kiln will eventually heat  up to 1,900 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, glazing occurs, giving  each piece of raku a unique look.  </P> <P> Much work has already gone into this pottery. At her studio in Somerset,  McClorey shaped the various bowls, plates and vases of clay and did preparatory  painting and designing.  </P> <P> The firing takes place in a sheltered kiln area outside McClorey's home in  rural Pulaski County. Before going into the kiln, pieces are preheated on a  wood stove in the house.  </P> <P> "Everything's very gradual," McClorey says, explaining the different steps  involved. At this stage, the pottery has a pasty appearance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glassy, Colorful Surface  </P> <P> But after the items have spent 20 minutes in the kiln, McClorey peeks through a  hole in the kiln door. The glaze has started to bubble. Once melted, the glaze  -- a mixture of clay and silica -- gives the finished product a glassy,  colorful surface.  </P> <P> After firing, John McClorey uses large tongs to remove the pottery. Each piece  is then sprayed with a copper sulfate solution and placed inside a garbage  barrel for smoking for about 35 minutes. This affects both the color and  texture of the finished product.  </P> <P> The artist seems proudest of things that are the simplest in the firing  process, such as the old vacuum cleaner that distributes air into the kiln. She  points to crinkled cardboard on top of the vacuum cleaner. Hard to believe that  a little piece of paper regulates the air flow.  </P> <P> "It works, though," she says, grinning.  </P></p>

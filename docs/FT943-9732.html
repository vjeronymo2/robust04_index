			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data help shares to a firm close - Market Report Share prices held firm in London yesterday with the help of favourable news on domestic price inflation and consumer credit. Trading volume was unexciting, however, and the market had to struggle against the effects of ex-dividend quotations in a number of leading stocks. London was overshadowed in the first half of the session by concern that the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in the wake of the strong US jobless figures announced on Friday afternoon. UK stocks edged forward towards the close as the US markets regained confidence. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a gain of 4.4 at 3,171.9. The broader-based FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued its advance, closing a further 13.8 to the good at 3,728.7. Traders responded positively to the disclosure that producer prices in the UK had risen by only 1.9 per cent in July, indicating that domestic inflation was still subdued and thus reducing pressures on the Bank of England to lift base rates. However, nervousness towards rate prospects continued, with market traders anxiously scanning comments in the European press by the Bank of England Governor. Share prices made slow progress until the New York market opened, however. The rise in consumer credit in June was substantially greater than predicted in the stock market and retail and consumer issues responded well to this latest indication that retail spending might provide the back-ing for economic recovery. The Dow Industrial Average was 10 points up at the London close, although UK markets remained wary of a move by the Federal Reserve during a trading week studded with important US economic data. Seaq trading volume, at 547.3m shares was about 6 per cent down on the previous session and left traders with a good deal of time on their hands. Friday's retail, or genuine customer investment business in equities was worth Pounds 1.28bn. This figure is just about satisfactory, from the point of view of the London-based investment houses. Strategists pointed to a generally unexciting performance across European bourses, which they said reflected the prospect of a difficult, lightly-traded, summer holiday week. In addition to the latest data on US retail sales and producer prices, this week brings another appearance before Congress of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve and a sizeable US funding programme. This morning, the London market faces the domestic trade figures for May. The UK markets are expected to remain quiet this month, barring any sudden move on US interest rates. In the wake of the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin published last week, equity market analysts hopes that the widely-anticipated rise in UK base rates can be postponed, at least until next month. The blue chip dollar stocks made little headway, in spite of the rally in New York. Hopes for news of a sizeable takeover move in the pharmaceuticals industry continued to circulate but trading volume died away. The big oil stocks could make little fresh response to activity in crude oil markets. There was a good deal of switching among banking stocks as institutions sought out the best growth opportunities. The best gains came in the stores sector, where the domestic consumer credit figures brought in a few hopeful buyers. Most of the high street names managed to put on a few pence, but traders admitted that individual share volumes had not been particularly impressive. There was some demand, once again, for UK construction stocks with German links following further evidence of recovery in the economy and the building industry in that country.</p>

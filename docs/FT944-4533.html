			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: White House urged to reduce use of antidumping measures The White House is being urged to rein in the use of dumping measures because of their detrimental effect on liberalised trade regimes. Two economists with the American Enterprise Institute - Mr Claude Barfield and Mr Mark Falcoff - argue in a new paper that much of the 'abuse' of the US dumping laws could be curbed without passage of new legislation. 'An essential first step would be a clear statement from the political operatives in the White House that in the future the US would aim for a more even-handed administration of existing law,' the authors say. As the world has moved towards freer trade, 40 countries have established anti-dumping laws, alleged to protect domestic industries from predatory price cutting. Since 1980, governments have allowed more than 2,000 anti-dumping actions to proceed. The US has initiated 99 cases in Latin America alone. 'Antidumping laws have moved far from their original goal,' say the economists. 'Uniformly throughout the trading world, national regulators, using spurious unfair trade claims as a pretext, have manipulated the dumping laws to favour domestic producers and decrease pressure from foreign competition.' The report from the Washington-based think tank singles out two antidumping cases which, it says, were used 'to cripple' Latin American exports to the US: actions against Siderca, an Argentine steel company, and Colombia'scut flower industry. Siderca ran into trouble in 1984 when it refused to enter a 'voluntary' restraint agreement with the US. At great expense Siderca successfully fought the antidumping cases. This year it has had to contend with a further two. One US company brought an action against Siderca although, according to the authors, the plaintiff does not even produce the same steel pipe as the imports. In the second example, the US cut flower industry first tried to keep out the Colombian imports without having to prove an unfair trade practice. When the US government refused, the industry launched more than 50 suits under sections of US trade laws. After that approach failed, the US Commerce Department began to allow multiple complaints against single types of flower. In 1987 it levied dumping duties on carnations and recently found against imported roses from Colombia and Ecuador. The authors call for US and foreign companies to be treated under the same competition rules. 'Ultimately this will mean the repeal of antidumping laws - which establish separate rules and criteria for 'fairness' - and their replacement with rigorously enforced antitrust laws that discipline predatory price behaviour,' the authors say. Latin American leaders should also agree to bring their own 'unfair' trade laws into line with strict antitrust enforcement. See Feature</p>

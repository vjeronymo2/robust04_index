			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Singapore to place Dollars 5bn air order Singapore Airlines (SIA) is expected to announce today an order for up to 50 wide-body airliners worth more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn), which would double the size of the airline's fleet by the year 2003. The order is expected to involve both Boeing 747-400 jumbo airliners, as well as European Airbus A340 long-range aircraft for delivery, starting in 1997 and running to 2003. SIA, one of the most profitable airlines, has also been looking at the new Boeing 777 twin-engine 400-seater airliner. The airline told the bidding manufacturers of aircraft and aero-engines four months ago it needed 22 Boeing 747-400s and 30 Airbus A340s, in addition to the 12 Boeing 747-400s and 13 A340s it already has on option. However, the precise number of new aircraft it will order is only to be disclosed today. The deal is particularly important for the airframe and aero-engine manufacturers because orders of this magnitude are now rare in the troubled airline industry. All three leading aero-engine manufacturers - including Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US, and the UK Rolls-Royce group - have submitted bids to supply power plants for the new Boeing and Airbus aircraft. SIA said this year it needed the new aircraft to meet expected annual growth of 8 to 9 per cent over the next 10 years. The airline has also had a longstanding policy of renewing its fleet on a regular basis so as to maintain an average aircraft age of five years. SIA has now earmarked China, India and Vietnam as its main new growth areas during the next 10 years. It is also seeking to operate services from London to the US, if it can secure the necessary traffic rights and airport slots.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Wen 7895 7186] and XINHUA </F> reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)]    [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking at an  international symposium on China's strategy for developing  foreign economic relations and trade during the 1990's, Wu Yi,  minister of foreign economic relations and trade, said today  that, while China restructures its financial, tax, and foreign  trade systems, the nation's preferential policies for foreign  investors remain unchanged.    Wu Yi told the Chinese and foreign participants at the  symposium that China, while restructuring its economic and trade  systems, will continue to attend to respecting and protecting  foreign businesses' legitimate rights and interests. She said:  During the new round of foreign trade reforms, state-owned  foreign trade businesses are allowed to convert renminbi for  foreign exchange or to buy foreign exchange with renminbi, but  will adopt interim measures on all foreign-funded businesses in  China, namely permitting them to maintain their current spot  exchange accounts to facilitate their production and operations,  including their import and export businesses.    Wu Yi also noted: On the whole, foreign-funded businesses in  China do not have to pay higher taxes during the new round of  financial and tax reforms. For the few businesses which do have  to pay higher taxes, China has drawn up some compensatory  measures to make sure that they will continue to enjoy  preferential treatment prescribed in Chinese laws and  cooperation accords.    Wu Yi indicated that China's preferential policies for  foreign investors remain unchanged. She added that China will  continue to improve the investment environment and create the  necessary conditions so that foreign businessmen can enjoy the  "same treatment as Chinese nationals."</p>

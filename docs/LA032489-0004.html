			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iran's interior minister said that the execution order against British author  Salman Rushdie will be carried out despite the efforts of what he described as  "world colonial powers," Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said. Ali  Akbar Mohtashemi met with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who issued the order  last month. "World colonial and arrogant powers should know the children of  Islam will execute the divine ruling against deviated people, apostates and  others trying to fight Islam," Mohtashemi said. The death order was issued  against Rushdie for his novel "The Satanic Verses," which many Muslims see as  blasphemous.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- About half of Diet  legislators surveyed want a two-party system in Japan's future  politics, replacing the current multiparty setup, an influential  private group promoting political reform said Tuesday [3 May].    Of the lawmakers surveyed, 50.3 percent prefer a two-party  system, 39.3 percent favor a moderate multiparty system with  three or more parties, and 3.5 percent like a long and stable  rule by a single party, according to a poll conducted by the  Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform.    The group of dozens of voluntary members from business,  labor, academic and journalistic circles sent questionnaires to  761 lawmakers of both houses, 239 business executives and 78  labor unionists from April 1 to 22, committee members said. Of  the legislators, 59.5 percent responded, they said.    According to the survey, 20.3 percent of the lawmakers said  most existing parties will disappear in political realignment.    As to the timing of such realignment, 58.6 percent of the  Diet members said it will take place in a year and 12.4 percent  said in several years, they said.    A two-party system was sought by 88.5 percent of respondents  from Komeito [Clean Government Party], a Buddhist-backed party  in the coalition, 87.3 percent from Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], a key party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, and 60.9  percent from the Democratic Socialist Party, another ruling  party, they said.    A moderate multiparty system was backed by 70.8 percent of  members of the Japan New Party led by former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa.    The figure was identical for the Social Democratic Party,  which defected the coalition last week, and 50 percent for new  party Sakigake [Harbinger] led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura. Sakigake refused to take new cabinet  positions, they said.    The biggest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was  split, with 45.6 percent favoring a two-party system and 41.8  percent support a moderate multiparty system, they said. The  LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power last August.    Members of the opposition Japanese Communist Party did not  answer the survey, they said.</p>

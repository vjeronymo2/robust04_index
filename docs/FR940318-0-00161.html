			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has determined that because of the potential for formation and emission of decomposition products in rigid closed cell foams, notification and review under SNAP is required for blends of chemical alternatives in foam end-uses that encompass residential products where chronic consumer exposure could occur. These end-uses are: Polyurethane rigid laminated boardstock, polystyrene extruded boardstock and billet foams, phenolic foams, and polyolefin foams. This analysis is detailed in the SNAP technical background document, ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Foam Blowing Agents.'' In contrast, for open-celled foams where the blowing agent is fully emitted from the foams within hours or days of manufacture, the formation of decomposition products is not a factor in decisionmaking. For this final rule, use of blends or mixtures of substitutes listed as acceptable under the SNAP program in open-celled or closed-cell or semi-rigid end-uses not designated above does not require notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Listing Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptable substitutes. (1) Rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a) HCFC&hyph;123. HCFC&hyph;123 is acceptable as an alternative blowing agent to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. From the standpoint of technical feasibility, HCFC&hyph;123 represents a viable alternative to CFC&hyph;11 as a potential blowing agent. More specifically, the physical properties, thermal conductivity, and aging of foams blown with HCFC&hyph;123 are similar to those blown with CFC&hyph;11. As a result, HCFC&hyph;123, which has an ozone depleting potential significantly lower than that of CFC&hyph;11, has the potential to replace CFC&hyph;11 in many applications. Nonetheless, availability of HCFC&hyph;123 is limited at present. The acceptable exposure limit (AEL) for HCFC&hyph;123 is 30 ppm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HCFC&hyph;141b. HCFC&hyph;141b is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. Although its ODP of 0.11 is relatively high, HCFC&hyph;141b offers almost immediate transition out of CFC uses in this sector. Not only does HCFC&hyph;141b offer a technically feasible alternative to CFC&hyph;11, but it is currently available in quantities sufficient to meet industrial demand. HCFC&hyph;141b is scheduled for phase-out from production on January 1, 2003 under the accelerated phase out rule (58 FR 65018) under section 606 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. HCFC&hyph;22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than CFC&hyph;11. Plant or process modifications may be required to allow use of blowing agents like HCFC&hyph;142b that have significantly lower boiling points than CFC&hyph;11. HCFC&hyph;22 is subject to the accelerated phase out rule (58 FR 65018) under section 606 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;142b is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. HCFC&hyph;142b offers an alternative with significantly lower potential to deplete ozone than CFC&hyph;11. Plant or process modifications may be required to allow use of blowing agents like HCFC&hyph;142b that have significantly lower boiling points than CFC&hyph;11. HCFC&hyph;142b is subject to the accelerated phase out rule (58 FR 65018). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;141b. The HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. HCFC&hyph;22 has an occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 250 ppm, whereas HCFC&hyph;141b has an OEL of 1000 ppm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b blends are acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. This blend offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than CFC&hyph;11. Plant or process modifications may be required to allow use of blowing agents like HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b that have low boiling points than CFC&hyph;11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) HCFC&hyph;141b/HCFC&hyph;123. The HCFC&hyph;141b/HCFC&hyph;123 blend is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. As noted above, HCFC&hyph;141b, because of its commercial availability offers an immediate opportunity to replace CFC&hyph;11. HCFC&hyph;123 has limited availability. However, because the ODP of HCFC&hyph;123 is lower than that of HCFC&hyph;141b, the blend has a lower ODP than HCFC&hyph;141b alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;141b. The HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. Because both components of the blend are commercially available in large enough quantities to meet industry demand, it offers a near-term vehicle for replacing CFC&hyph;11 in laminated boardstock foams. HCFC&hyph;22 has an occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 250 ppm, whereas HCFC&hyph;141b has an OEL of 1000 ppm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. HFC&hyph;134a offers the potential for a non-ozonedepleting alternative to CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams. Plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate the use of HFC&hyph;134a because its boiling point is lower than that of CFC&hyph;11. In addition, the cost of HFC&hyph;134a is relatively high, and the use of HFC&hyph;134a may cause significant increases in thermal conductivity, with a concomitant loss in the insulating capacity of foams blown with HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a also has a relatively high global warming potential compared with other available alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. HFC&hyph;152a offers the potential for a non-ozonedepleting alternative to CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock. Use of HFC&hyph;152a as a blowing agent in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam has raised concern over the potential for significant increases in thermal conductivity. Process changes may be necessary to accommodate the use of HFC&hyph;152a, and plant modifications may be necessary to manage its flammability. Also, foams blown with HFC&hyph;152a will need to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. These hydrocarbons have zero-ODP and zero-GWP. Plant or process modifications may be necessary to accommodate the use of saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. These materials also pose flammability concerns which may require capital investment to manage. Foams blown with hydrocarbons will need to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials. Finally, the thermal conductivity is greater than CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents which may effect the thermal capacity of final products. Saturated light hydrocarbons are VOCs and must be controlled as such under Title I of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) 2-Chloropropane. 2-Chloropropane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam. At present, because 2-chloropropane is a proprietary process, its commercial availability may be limited. Moreover, 2-chloropropane is flammable and its use may require extensive modification of existing equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foam.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

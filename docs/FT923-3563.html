			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Speculation rises over disposal of Habitat FRESH SPECULATION that the Storehouse retailing group was considering selling its Habitat business circulated yesterday after a French newspaper reported that Au Printemps was interested in buying Habitat's French arm. Storehouse has suggested in the past that it might dispose of Habitat if a suitable buyer could be found but declined to comment on the report. Au Printemps, the French retailer owned by the Pinault group, also refused to comment. Analysts expressed surprise that Storehouse should consider selling Habitat France individually - given that it was the most profitable part of the furniture business - but suggested that any sale could realise up to Pounds 100m. Ms Julie Ramshaw, retail analyst at stockbrokers Morgan Stanley, said: 'I do not believe that Habitat has a long term future with the group but I do not think there is any urgency about selling it.'

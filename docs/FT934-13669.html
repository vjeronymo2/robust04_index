			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (15): Propelled into a new financial age - Mexico MEXICO'S growing financial integration with the US is propelling it into the age of derivatives. On the Chicago Board of Trade, trading volume on listed options on Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest stock, runs to more than Dollars 30bn a year, making it one of the most popular options on the exchange. Some 200 to 300 trades in Mexican warrants are executed every day in the over-the-counter market in Luxembourg. The market in tailor-made derivatives on blue-chip Mexican equities, debt instruments or the peso is thriving, and is even larger than the listed warrant market in Luxembourg. Such instruments have become highly popular with investors wishing to hedge against falls in the stock market, rise in interest rates, or simply leverage their exposure to Mexican assets. They have also proven profitable for the investment banks that offer them, led by Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Banker's Trust, and Goldman Sachs. The derivative business conducted in Mexico, though, has been limited, mainly because of government regulation. Until recently the only types of derivatives that could be offered in Mexico were coberturas, tesebonos, and ajustabonos. The cobertura is an over-the-counter exchange rate contract, in which the investor pays a premium determined in the market for the right to receive at some specified time in the future the observed peso/dollar devaluation over the period of the cobertura. Tesebono is a treasury-bill that offers dollar rate of return, protecting the investor against the devaluation. The ajustabono offers a nominal rate of return plus the inflation rate over life of the bill. The cobertura has been popular with Mexicans keen to hedge or speculate against exchange rate fluctuations, with daily volume over Dollars 1bn. (Foreigners have had to pay withholding tax of 15 per cent, so they have shied away from the market. However the withholding tax has just been reduced to 4.9 per cent, and foreigners might now move into the market.) But the cobertura, like the tesebono, is not a full currency hedge, since investors are only paid in pesos. Were the peso to be made inconvertible, investors would not be able to buy dollars at the official exchange rate. However, with the offshore derivative business growing by leaps and bounds, last year the Mexican government decided to stem the tide, and expand the home-based derivative market. The Mexican Securities and Exchange Commission allowed the stock market to offer listed warrants on blue-chip Mexican stocks. The warrants started trading in October, and average volume has been modest, at about Dollars 1m a day. So far the warrant market has suffered from over-regulation, lack of liquidity, and foreigners have preferred to keep on buying OTC offshore. It can take several months to obtain permission to issue a warrant, a privilege only granted to Mexican brokerages, which limits the overall liquidity of the market. Mutual funds are still awaiting permission to buy the warrants. Mexican brokerages are also unwilling to trade or comment on warrants issued by their rivals. This has further prevented the market from reaching a critical mass. While the government's conservative attitude has been criticised by banks keen to compete with the US in derivatives, it has won support outside broker circles. 'There is a virtue in being cautious. It is much worse to go when you are not ready, than to wait too long,' says Catherine Mansell, an academic and author of the best-selling The new finance in Mexico. Next year the Mexican authorities plan to open listed options market in Mexico for equities. Some time after that, the stock market may offer listed options on the peso, and interest rates, and future contracts on baskets of stocks. No decision has yet been made about when to offer such products. The success of such markets depends on liquidity, how the clearing system is arranged, and restrictions on market makers, says Juan Jose Suarez, co-head of derivative products at Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. But if regulation is flexible enough, Mr Suarez expects considerable interest. 'It's difficult to imagine the sort of volume traded on the Telmex option, but there should be significant interest' he says. Participants stress the synergy between different derivative markets, suggesting that derivative instruments will take off when all are available, and trading is liquid. 'It would be very helpful (for Mexican derivatives) to develop a liquid and efficient futures market' says Trey Rhine, a vice-president at Merrill Lynch, the market leader in Mexican derivatives. A futures market would stimulate liquidity in the underlying market and other derivatives, and help investors arbitrage price differences between assets that offer the same return, ensuring a more efficient market. Many foreigners will still prefer to trade outside Mexico, if only because there are more comfortable dealing in dollar-denominated options, and in their own time zone, says Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, managing director of the London branch of Inverlat. Since the price of an option includes the implicit interest rates during the option's life span, investors will find it cheaper to buy a dollar option than a peso option, if, as is now the case, expected peso devaluation does not offset the peso/dollar interest rate differential. So far the signs from the authorities regarding regulation have been conflicting. On the one hand, Mexico's finance ministry is itself one of the world's largest users of options and futures, hedging against rises in US interest rates and falls in oil prices. It presumably would want to encourage the development of a domestic derivatives market to allow Mexican companies and investors to follow a similarly prudent financial strategy. In a possible sign of greater flexibility, the Securities and Exchange Commission finally gave Banamex permission to sell in Mexico an equity-lined note, which gives investors 70 per cent of the upside of the stock market, and protects the principal. Previously such equity-derivative offerings, done by Banamex or US houses such as Merrill Lynch, have had to be offered offshore in Luxembourg. However, the Central Bank remains worried about financial institutions' ability to manage the risks involved with derivatives. This was highlighted by last year's fiasco over ajustabonos (bonds that offer a real interest rate, that are, in effect, a play on future inflation rates) in which Mexican brokerages and banks lost at the very minimum hundreds of millions of dollars. But just as Mexico found in the early 1980s that it was impossible to prevent capital outflows even with capital controls, Mexico is finding that one way or another the derivative business has arrived. The question is whether it will continue to flourish outside Mexico, or whether it will be brought onshore.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Joint Statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry and </F> Defense Ministry": "Actions, Not Declarations Are What Is  Needed"]    [Text] Of late, statements by certain politicians in  foreign countries, items in the foreign mass media, and debates  at international forums have sometimes voiced the idea of the  "ambiguity" of Russia's peacekeeping mission on the territory of  a number of CIS countries. Talk of Russia's "neoimperial  ambitions" is becoming increasingly current. No matter what  form these recriminations take, they invariably boil down to one  thing: Russia is allegedly stepping up strong-arm pressure on  its neighbors and demanding the right to "interfere" in their  internal affairs on the pretext of peacekeeping activity --  virtually bypassing universally recognized norms of  international law, moreover. At the same time what is being  perpetrated is not just an arbitrary interpretation of the facts  but also the impudent or unwitting distortion of these facts.    The idea that Russia is allegedly "unilaterally" sending  troops to unstable regions is the main argument used by people  who take that kind of view of Russian peacekeeping in  neighboring states. It is thence concluded that involving the  world community in peacekeeping efforts to settle conflicts on  the territory of the former USSR should consist in supervising  Russia's actions.    We do not want to exaggerate the importance of this line  being taken in certain political and social circles in West and  East. Most countries' leaders demonstrate a responsible and  sober approach, acknowledging Russia's positive role in curbing  and settling crisis situations. Russia would like to see a more  lasting, true partnership founded on equality, mutual trust, and  respect established in the field of peacekeeping in the CIS  countries in actual fact and not just in declarations of intent.    To this end we consider it timely to draw attention to a  number of fundamental political and international-legal elements  of Russia's involvement in peacekeeping activity in the CIS.    Russia's actions are designed only to stop armed clashes in  a  number of the new independent states, stabilize the situation  there, and create conditions for a long-term lasting settlement.  We take pride in the fact that, thanks to the presence of  Russian peacekeeping forces in "hot zones," far more numerous  civilian casualties have been avoided.    Our efforts are being mounted against the backdrop of the  dramatically complex economic and financial situation in Russia  itself, diverting considerable funds into peacekeeping: In the  last 10 months alone this expenditure has totaled around 26  billion rubles (notwithstanding the difficulty of precise  calculations and our peacekeepers' inadequate supplies compared  with the UN "blue helmets"). There are over 15,000 Russian  servicemen in hot spots on the territory of the CIS states.    Peacekeeping in the Commonwealth countries is not a "Russian  initiative." In all cases without exception our actions are  being conducted at the request and with the consent of the  appropriate states and warring parties. Peacekeeping  contingents are sent on the basis of bilateral and multilateral  agreements that accord with the norms of international law.  This fully squares with the provisions of the UN Charter,  whereby the possibility of resolving questions of peacekeeping  on the basis of agreements between the interested states is not  only entertained but even welcomed (Article 52 of the UN  Charter). The only exception being coercive operations, which  must be carried out under the leadership of the Security Council  in accordance with Article 53 of the UN Charter. However, all  the current peacekeeping operations on the territory of what was  the USSR do not fall under that provision since they are not  coercive but are being conducted with the consent of all the  warring parties. The United Nations and the CSCE are regularly  briefed on the progress of all these operations.    Russia consistently advocates very extensive UN and CSCE  involvement in settling conflicts in the CIS countries. But  there is no need for any UN and CSCE "permission" for the  operations involving Russia and its neighbors that are being  carried out on the basis of the above criteria. These  operations are being conducted on the basis of the sovereign  rights of the corresponding states as enshrined in the UN  Charter and need no further legitimization. The fact that  cooperation with the United Nations and the CSCE and their  active, thorough support for the peacekeeping efforts made by  Russia and its neighbors could really help to settle the  conflicts more effectively and rapidly is another matter. We  also advocate this by asking the United Nations and the CSCE to  cooperate with the peacekeeping operations in the CIS countries  in various forms, including by sending missions, observers,  advisers, etc. Russia will also be willing to take part in UN  and CSCE peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former  USSR if the parties to a particular conflict ask these  organizations to set up such operations there and if it is  decided to carry them out.    However it must be stated that reaction to the CIS  countries'  repeated appeals to the United Nations and CSCE for support (in  particular with regard to the conflicts in Abkhazia and  Tajikistan) is being dragged out. Therefore agreements between  Russia and its neighbors, along with mechanisms set up within  the CIS framework, remain the main peacekeeping instruments in  the region. It is thanks to them that the tasks of maintaining  international peace and security, an inalienable part of  ensuring global stability, are now being resolved. The world  community should recognize that objective reality and move on to  to closer cooperation with Russia and its neighbors. That would  incidentally help all "doubters" to see the "transparency" of  these peacekeeping operations and the unfounded nature of the  suspicions on this score.    In firmly pursuing a policy of ensuring peace and stability  around its borders and meeting its pledges under agreements with  the corresponding countries and within the CIS framework, Russia  is not pitting its efforts against anyone whatsoever. We do not  demand a special status for ourselves or an exclusive role, but  nor are we evading our responsibility for the situation in what  is a key region for Russia. We are prepared for constructive  cooperation on these matters with the United Nations, the CSCE,  and the world community as a whole.</p>

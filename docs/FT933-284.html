			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (23): High export potential - There is almost no known crop which cannot be grown in Peru NOTHING could look less like prime agricultural land than Peru's coastal strip, a 2,800km ribbon of greyish moonscape desert where rain never falls. Yet there are 760,000 hectares of irrigated land already available, ideal for a wide variety of export fruit and vegetable crops - about five times the area on which Chile's agro-industrial boom is based. There is almost no known crop which cannot be grown somewhere in Peru. The coast is particularly well suited to high-price export crops such as asparagus, melon, tomatoes, grapes, broccoli and snow peas. The temperate climate and absence of rain means that there are effectively no seasons, so produce can be harvested year round and 'windows' in international markets exploited. For years, Peruvian and foreign agriculturalists have been aware of this potential. Until recently, however, legislation on land tenure has prevented development. Under the land reform enacted by General Velasco's military government 25 years ago, huge, privately-owned coastal haciendas were turned into co-operatives. Elsewhere, minifundios - tiny plots worked by a single family  -proliferated. A downward spiral of inefficiency and decapitalisation converted Peru from a once flourishing exporter of sugar, rice and cotton to a net importer of all those products. Peruvian agriculture has now been on the decline for 40 years. In the decade 1950-1960, the sector accounted for more than 20 per cent of gdp. By 1970 it had fallen below 15 per cent and, for the past 13 years it has hovered at between 11 and 13 per cent. 'Traditional' exports from the former haciendas - primarily rice, sugar and cotton - have slumped. Last year, for the first time, 'non-traditional' produce (asparagus, cocoa, exotic fruits, colourants and so on) overtook the historically more important crops, earning Dollars 151m in foreign exchange, Dollars 36m more than their 'traditional' rivals. 'But Peru's potential is only relative unless there are adequate conditions,' says Mr Salomon Diaz, a cochineal exporter and president of Adex, the agro-industrial committee of the exporters' association. 'The state still needs to devise positive export-oriented strategies to convert Peru into an important agro-industrial exporter.' Agricultural policy has always focused on big spending projects - irrigation works more often than not. Research has been starved of funds. It has never been directed towards identifying opportunities in national and international markets. The Fujimori government has laid down some essential foundations for the modernisation of agriculture. Land has been declared a freely tradeable commodity, strict land-holding limits have been relaxed and foreigners put on an equal footing with Peruvian nationals for investment purposes. Advances against terrorism have brought relative tranquillity back to the countryside. Taming inflation has been especially important for medium to long term activities such as farming. But serious problems remain. 'Less than ten per cent of Peruvian farmers hold legal title to their land, which prevents them using it as collateral for credit,' says Mr Diaz. 'Then, financing costs - at about 18 per cent a year - are absurdly high. So are costs of energy and transport.' In the Andean highlands there is no agricultural land left. The jungle has some 4,000 hectares suitable for cultivation, but lack of roads and transport infrastructure renders this land almost useless. At least in the short term, development must therefore centre on the coastal strip. Here the old haciendas, now co-operatives, remain in possession of some of the best irrigated coastal land. But according to Mr Diaz, they are wasting the scarce resource of water by growing thirsty crops like rice and sugar-cane. 'Peru's coast has the great advantage that, because there's no rain, irrigation is man-managed. With high technology methods - drip or sprinkler systems - we could irrigate four times the area with the same amount of water we're now expending on crops we'd do better to import.' Modern irrigation methods mean that even a five-hectare plot (and two-thirds of all Peruvian farmers have less than that) becomes economically viable if intensively cultivated with high-value export products. 'But the farmer needs support from the state to switch. A Chilean farmer can bring in irrigation equipment and claw back the import tariffs once he starts exporting. We can't,' says Mr Diaz. Mr Carlos Bolona, a former economy minister, would promote change and efficiency in the sector by different means. 'Until the state charges farmers a realistic price for the water they consume,' he says, 'they'll never switch from the 'easy' crops to valuable export products.' So far, the star of those crops is asparagus; exports last year topped Dollars 26m. Export values of mangoes, mandarine oranges, grapes, apples and bananas all stand at about Dollars 5m a year, the point at which, according to Mr Diaz, they create their own export momentum and you can 'stop worrying about them'. 1992 export earnings from cocoa products totalled over Dollars 13m. Colourants (marigold, annatto, cochineal and carmine) brought in Dollars 24m. Principal buyers were the US and, in Europe, the Low Countries, followed by Germany and Spain. Agro-industry, in a small way, already exists in each of Peru's widely distinct geographical zones and each specialises in a different range of crops. The northern coast produces high-quality mangoes, bananas, passion fruit and lemon-limes; the centre: asparagus, broccoli, green beans, snow-peas and grapes; the south: beans (which have considerable export potential), garlic, onions and oregano. 'All these are products in international demand, which Peruvian farmers have long experience in growing,' says Mr Diaz. 'It wouldn't be difficult to double or triple export quality output in the short term.' The Andes and the jungle, too, have their own specialities. Peru's high mountains (home of the potato) produce high-protein grains such as quinua and kiwicha, which are starting to acquire an international reputation. Other products include tarwi, a host of medicinal plants and herbs and the colourant cochineal, of which Peru is the world's leading producer. Descending the eastern slopes of the Andes towards the Amazon basin, crops give way to world-class coffee and cocoa, annatto and every conceivable tropical fruit. 'We're sleeping on our comparative advantages,' warns Mr Diaz. 'One of Peru's best fruits, which we hardly export, is the chirimoya (custard apple). But Chile has planted perhaps 400 hectares and is already strongly entering the international market.' Paradoxically, it may finally be the Chileans who get things moving in Peru. Chilean entrepreneurs are in Peru now, sizing up opportunities for land purchase. 'They've been through this themselves. They're aware that Peru's climatic conditions are even better than their own - they know it's going to be excellent business,' says Mr Bolona.</p>

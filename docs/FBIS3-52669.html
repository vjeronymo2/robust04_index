In a periodic assessment submitted to the prime minister,  the  sources said that if the deadlock in the talks lingers on, the  PLO will become paralyzed and Israel will have to contend with  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The sources added that the  ongoing stalemate is adversely affecting Palestinian public  opinion, which is now doubtful of the Oslo agreement and is thus  putting Fatah on the defensive and strengthening Hamas.    There are all sorts of pressures on 'Arafat, emphasized an  intelligence source: "From below, by the younger  intifada-experienced local leaders; from central figures in the  PLO inner-circles, such as Abu-Mazin [Muhammad 'Abbas] and Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh; and from the former Palestinian delegation to the  peace talks, which is demanding a more democratic  decision-making process."    A similar assessment was presented to the cabinet yesterday  by the government's coordinator of activities in the  territories, Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild.    Military sources added that signs of a rift in the making  are  evident in Jordanian-PLO relations. The sources confirmed that  King Husayn is "dismayed" with 'Arafat's reluctance to proceed  with an agreement with Jordan. [The Jerusalem political  correspondent of Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew adds on page 2 of  its 3 January edition that Rothschild further told the cabinet  that Jordan has been punishing the PLO for its failure to honor  its agreements by banning citrus fruit exports from Gaza through  the Jordan River bridges and by delaying the opening of  Jordanian bank branches in the territories.]    Based on this information, Rabin told the cabinet that  "Israel is in no hurry" to conclude a deal, adding that from now  on, all understandings will be "in writing."</p>

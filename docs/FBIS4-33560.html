			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 7 June.    The Mexican economy grew slightly in the first quarter with  the GDP increasing 0.5 percent over the same period in 1993.  Nevertheless, for thousands of Mexican companies and their  employees, the recession that began in 1993 continued. This was  particularly true in the service subsectors of trade,  restaurants, and hotels. The recession in the service sector  has lasted longer than in the other areas of the economy. The  last time this sector showed growth was in the first quarter of  1993, when it registered an annual growth rate of 2.2 percent.  (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300  GMT 2 Jun 94)    CORPAMEX [Mexican Employers Confederation] President Antonio  Sanchez Diaz de Rivera told UNOMASUNO yesterday that economic  growth has been "delayed" and that its reactivation will not be  seen until 1995. In a news conference, Diaz proposed that new  family businesses be exempt from all types of taxes and a 3  percent cap be placed on sales taxes. According to Diaz, these  measures will allow "groups in the underground economy to pass  into the formal economy, and this will prevent the unemployment  problem from worsening." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 1 Jun  94 pp 1, 19)    The under secretary of trade has said NAFTA is "progressing  very well," adding that proof of this is that manufacturing  exports in the first quarter rose 25.4 percent over the same  period last year. The under secretary also announced that a free  trade agreement will be signed among the G-3 nations --  Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela -- during the upcoming  Ibero-American presidential summit in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia. The official also said the free trade agreement  signed with Costa Rica has paved the way for negotiations with  Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. (Mexico City  NOTIMEX in Spanish 2024 GMT 2 Jun 94)    The Bancomer Financial Group has announced that the lifting  of trade barriers and lagging technology have had an adverse  effect on the Mexican textile industry, even though in the  long-run this could be the one of the sectors to benefit most  from NAFTA. The Bancomer Group forecasts a 3.9 percent increase  in the GDP this year, but only a 2.1 percent increase in the  garment industry's gross product. Problems faced by the industry  include a lack of integration in terms of production, a shortage  of raw materials, low quality, limited designs, and high  financing costs. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 17)    A poll conducted by the Secretariat of Commerce and  Industrial Development (SECOFI) among industrialists, asking  whether it should move to expedite the liberalization of trade  barriers on some products listed under NAFTA, has met with a  very poor response, while most respondents announced their  opposition to the expediting of liberalization. The industrial  sectors voicing the greatest opposition were those that produce  glass, wine, household appliances, pharmaceuticals, heavy  machinery, and chemicals. Meanwhile, industries in favor of  speeding up the lifting of trade barriers were those that  produce shoes, textiles, citrus fruits, flowers, and tropical  fruits. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 49)    The president of the National Agrarian Council has said  problems still remain six months after NAFTA's implementation,  particularly in terms of customs and the overall understanding  of the trilateral agreement's terminology. The president noted  that the majority of producers in this sector have expressed  their opposition to speeding up the lifting of tariffs.  Nevertheless, it was reported that the sector grew 7 percent in  the first quarter, mainly because of strong exports of coffee  and cattle. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 52)    The governments of Mexico and the UK yesterday signed an  agreement on tax issues. The agreement is aimed at averting  double taxation and tax evasion on income and capital gains.  The agreement seeks to eliminate excessive taxes resulting in  double taxation on investments and capital flow between the two  nations. The agreement also makes it easier for tax authorities  from both nations to exchange information to combat fraud and  tax evasion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 14)    Japanese businessmen said during a meeting with President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari that Japanese companies in the  electric, banking, automobile, heavy machinery, construction,  and food industries are interested in investing in Mexico in  light of the nation's secure economic future. Among the  companies interested in investing are: Bank of Tokyo, Honda  Motors, Canon Ltd., Sanyo, Nissan, Clarion, Aoki Corp., Marubeni  Corp., and Terumo. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0333 GMT 1  Jun 94)    Yesterday, Mexican Petroleum [PEMEX] announced a 25-50 cent  increase in the per-barrel price of petroleum as of 1 June for  oil sales to the Americas, Europe, and the Far East. The  measure is designed to keep Mexican crude aligned with prices on  the international market. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 1  Jun 94 p 18)    PEMEX Gas Company and Basic Petrochemical Company -- PEMEX  subsidiaries -- showed a 444 million new peso gross profit for  the first quarter of 1994. In a press release, state-owned  PEMEX reported that with larger revenues mainly from sales and a  reduction in expenditures, the operation and investment budget  showed a 570 million new peso surplus as opposed to the budgeted  deficit of about 110 million new pesos. (Mexico City LA JORNADA  in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 48)    SECOFI will apply, as of Saturday, a retaliatory quota of  45.74 percent on beef imports from the EU. SECOFI also reported  that an "antidumping" investigation has been initiated into beef  imports from the United States. The retaliatory quota was  imposed on meat from the EU after it was confirmed that European  nations still subsidize this sector. If the investigations into  the U.S. imports demonstrate questionable trade practices, a  retaliatory quota will also be imposed on these imports. (Mexico  City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1651 GMT 3 Jun 94)    The public sector, banking sector, and private industry's  increase in contracting net international debts has prompted  considerable growth in Mexico's overall foreign debt in the  first quarter. According to SECOFI and the Bank of Mexico,  foreign debt reached an all-time high in March at $119.179  billion. That is 6.7 percent higher than accumulated debt  recorded in December 1993. Most foreign funds were used to  finance export projects, as well as small and medium-sized  businesses. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 3A)    During 1993, private foreign debt increased by $10.791  billion, of which 67.8 percent was incurred by the nonfinancial  sector and 32.2 percent by the banking sector. After the  renegotiation of government liabilities in 1990, the placing of  bonds and securities became the main foreign financing tool for  a total of $5.285 billion in 1993. Of this total, 73.6 percent  corresponds to 44 emissions by nonbanking firms and 26.4 percent  to six emissions by the banking sector. (Mexico City EL  FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 pp 1, 10)    SECOFI confirmed that in the first 1994 quarter, 19 percent  of the 41.4 billion new pesos earmarked for public investments  in 1994 had already been invested in public agencies and  corporations. The total investment budget was increased by  7.324 billion new pesos to include investments in the National  Solidarity program. The Group of Economists and Associates  indicated that for the first time in several years public  savings was not enough to finance public investments.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (1): A nettle to be grasped - One of Latin America's most consistent democracies has just witnessed the collapse of its second army rebellion in 10 months. Stephen Fidler contrasts its political and social turmoil with its high-speed economic expansion For the second time in a year, members of the Venezuelan armed forces failed on Friday in a violent attempt to unseat the elected government of Carlos Andres Perez. The attempted coup reinforced the impression of a country simmering with political, social and military discontent, of an unstable society about to boil over. Since the first coup attempt in February, the government of President Carlos Andres Perez has been embattled, at loggerheads with Congress and deeply unpopular in the country at large. Yet Venezuela is an enigma. One of the continent's longest-standing democracies, it has been ruled by elected governments since 1958. With its vast reserves of oil, its problems are, on the face of it, the most tractable in Latin America. At the same time its economy has been the fastest-growing in the world last year, expanding 10.4 per cent, after 1990 growth which approached 7 per cent. This year growth will probably exceed 8 per cent. While some of this growth may be down in part to an influx of illegal drugs money over the country's newly open borders, it cannot be denied that the poor are benefiting. Consumption of basic foodstuffs has risen spectacularly. The Venezuela-American Chamber of Commerce, whose membership has a good grasp of the subject, reports sales of processed foods in October up 24 per cent on a year earlier. The government says recent growth has only been possible because the private sector has been freed by the Perez administration's economic deregulation programme. The lifting of controls has had other effects which, in the view of some government supporters, provides a clue to the political opposition which the government has encountered and which have blocked further attempts at reform. 'One of the reasons for the political turmoil is that the economic programme has made political favouritism a dying industry . . . Price controls, import controls, exchange controls, credit controls have all gone. That affects a whole segment of the economy and has a big impact on the patronage that was oiling a big political sector,' said one minister. These measures, the government's chronic shortage of money and the relentless vigilance of an aggressive press have probably reduced opportunities for corruption, even as the country has become progressively more obsessed by it. The government has also alleviated some of the worst effects of its policies on the poor, through food support programmes which have replaced, for the most part, generalised food subsidies. The government spends 10 per cent of its budget on these programmes and plans to increase their coverage next year. This is not to say that Venezuelans - whose per capita annual income of Dollars 2,450 is hardly changed from 15-20 years ago - do not have legitimate grievances. The president has aggravated these concerns by appearing aloof and isolated. A man with the political skills to persuade Venezuelans of the importance of economic reform, he has failed to do so. The government's most significant failure is its inability to improve much on the abysmal levels of public services. 'I've doubts about the meaning of growth,' said Mr Ramon Pinango, academic director at IESA, the leading business school. 'Public services are getting worse: education is deteriorating, so is health care, and public safety is getting worse.' Government utilities - or rather their customers - are suffering from a lack of maintenance of plant installed in the oil boom years of the 1970s. Large areas of Caracas, for example, are suffering cuts in their water supply for days on end. Some efficiencies can be obtained by improving management of the current system. There are also signs of a possible way ahead through the de-centralisation of the political system. In a country where teachers are regularly found to be functionally illiterate, education standards in some states have been raised by requiring teachers to pass tests before they are employed. Privatisation offers a solution to other problems: private ownership or management of utilities enables cash-short governments to encourage investment. The disaffection within the military is in part another manifestation of the government's inability to distribute the kind of largesse to which its citizens and employees became accustomed in the 1970s. In part, too, it reflects the loss of a sense of purpose and of prestige in the military, which now faces neither political extremism nor threat from neighbouring countries. Unless and until the government tackles the issue of shrinking the armed forces - allowing it to raise salaries and improve conditions of service - military unrest looks likely to remain an unpredictable possibility which future governments (and prospective foreign investors) will be unable to ignore. The crisis in Venezuela's public services has arisen largely because the 1970s oil price boom allowed the postponement, by successive Venezuelan governments, of tough fiscal decisions forced on most other Latin economies in the 1980s. It was left to the Perez government to attempt to wean Venezuelans away from their overdependence - financial and psychological - on oil. In a Dollars 50bn economy in which, even during the bad times, oil generates Dollars 10bn in export revenues, this has proved no mean task. Sooner or later a Venezuelan government will have to grasp the fiscal nettle: it will need to induce Venezuelans to pay the proper price for the goods and services they receive and to pay taxes. This should not be as difficult as it is proving. The government's non-oil revenues are equivalent to a meagre 5 per cent of GDP. Clamping down on tax evasion - as has occurred in Argentina - could yield big benefits, because some estimates suggest that only 35 per cent of taxes due are paid. Raising petrol prices - now the lowest in the world - to international levels would alone yield 2.5 per cent of GDP, according to calculations by Petroleos de Venezuela. Only when the government is in control of its finances can it start - in conjunction with sectoral reforms - to raise the appalling standards of public services. This will involve a recognition - among politicians, trade unionists and the wealthy and middle-class Venezuelans whose opposition to reform has been most articulate - that their stake in the country will require them, just like the citizens of other countries, to pay taxes. This in turn will require a sense that the political system itself is worthy of support: a belief that may be fostered by the increasing number of local and national politicians who will be directly elected in forthcoming elections. The government is optimistic that after Sunday's local elections some of the reforms it has been pushing, including a modest tax change, will be passed. More fundamental change will probably have to wait until after congressional and presidential elections at the end of next year. What will happen after that is a matter for conjecture. Currently, the country's two most popular figures both reflect a wish for a return to the past: Lt Col Hugo Chavez, the leader of the February revolt, and Mr Rafael Caldera, a distinguished 77-year-old former president who represents the political old guard. Mr Caldera, not yet an official presidential candidate, is unwilling to be too specific about his platform, but he makes no secret of his wish to reverse some reforms of the current administration. He would also seek, he says, further alleviation of Venezuela's foreign debt. The prospect of a Caldera government worries many businessmen and bankers. With little prospect of another oil boom, whoever takes office in February 1994 will face tough choices. Perhaps the failure of Venezuelans to heed the military's call for a popular rebellion last Friday reflects a sense that even for a society with huge oil reserves, there are no magic solutions. On the other hand, the rebellion will cast a pall of uncertainty over 1993 and may fatally damage the long-term confidence of investors.</p>

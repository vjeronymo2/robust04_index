			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: De Dietrich plans to pay preferential dividend DE DIETRICH, the French engineering group, yesterday confirmed that net profits had fallen sharply from FFr130.6m in 1991 to FFr85m (Dollars 16m) in 1992 and announced plans to pay a preferential dividend to long-term investors. The payment of preferential dividends, which is intended to encourage investors to take long-term holdings in companies, is a topical issue in the French corporate sector following the announcement earlier this week that the finance ministry was forming a working party to assess the subject. De Dietrich is one of the first companies to declare its interest in adopting a preferential dividend scheme since the ministry's announcement. SEB, the industrial group, on Wednesday said it planned to adopt a preferential dividend policy. The De Dietrich board has decided to hold its 1992 dividend at FFr45, following a difficult year. Turnover rose from FFr3.35bn in 1991 to FFr3.78bn in 1992, due to the addition of Cogifer, and operating profits increased from FFr181m to FFr193m but net profits still fell. So far 1993 has been another chastening period with turnover falling by 6.5 per cent in the first quarter to FFr849.3m. Club Mediterranee, the French leisure group, is on course for a gruelling year, according to Mr Gibert Trigano, chairman, who yesterday told a shareholders' meeting that 1993 would be 'very strained'. Club Med returned to the black with a net profit of FFr161m in 1992 after a FFr17.3m loss in 1991.</p>

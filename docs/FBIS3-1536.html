Yesterday, the sides met on their own. Today's meeting is being  mediated by the United Nations.    UNITA has already submitted a document to Alioune Blondin  Beye calling for the replacement of the National Electoral  Council [CNE] which conducted the September 1992 elections. A  UNITA diplomatic source said this issue is not negotiable.  UNITA has also asked for a more substantial and [words  indistinct] role for the United Nations and a larger UNITA  participation in the new CNE. Once this issue is dealt with, the  negotiations will tackle national reconciliation, the future  status of the president of UNITA -- the largest opposition party  -- and the reciprocal return of property owned by the warring  sides.</p>

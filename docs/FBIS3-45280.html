In Guangzhou today, more and more enterprises under various  economic ownerships are taking shape, including over 6,000  foreign-funded enterprises. They make labor-capital relations  more complex, according to Du Meixian, vice president of the  Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions.    To effectively protect the interests of both sides, the city  government is hammering out relevant regulations and setting up  supervision and arbitration organizations. Trade unions inside  enterprises are playing their part in mediating disputes.    In 1993, the city government worked out a decree which set  the minimum worker's salary at 250 yuan a month.    On the other hand, the city advocates workers associating  themselves more closely with the rise and fall of their  enterprises.    Every year, the city will commend a large number of  outstanding workers, factory directors, company managers and  trade union leaders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Baja California State Congress has created a  special commission to help investigate the assassination of Luis  Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, former PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. The commission  will continue to gather any new evidence Baja California  residents may present and send it to the attorney general of the  republic. Francisco Javier Reynoso Nino, Baja California  Congress secretary, has made this announcement in Mexicali.    [Begin Reynoso recording] We have started direct relations  with the two chambers of Congress, the chambers of deputies and  senators. Those contacts will, of course, be in both directions  and directed to further the investigations. We know, of course,  Congress is not an office to investigate crimes, but we will be  attentive to any information that becomes available and we will  immediately report it to the corresponding authorities. [end  recording]    Reynoso also said that although the Baja California State  Congress is not an investigative office, it can volunteer  available information to further the Special Prosecutor's  Office's investigation of the criminal case. He added the Baja  California Congress is demanding Colosio's murder be clarified  to the satisfaction of all the people.</p>

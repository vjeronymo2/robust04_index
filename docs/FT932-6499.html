			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Puerto Rico suspends its regional lending programme THE Puerto Rican government has suspended a programme of low-interest loans for its neighbours, threatening the viability of investment projects in the Caribbean Basin totalling about Dollars 700m (Pounds 454.5m). Projects likely to be affected include Dollars 165m for new banana farms in Costa Rica, Dollars 100m to expand electricity services in Guyana, and Dollars 250m to develop and exploit natural gas fields in Trinidad and Tobago. Announcement of the suspension by Mr Baltazar Corrada del Rio, secretary of state, followed a decision by the US House of Representatives' ways and means committee to approve changes suggested by President Bill Clinton to Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 936 allows federal tax exemption to Puerto Rican subsidiaries of US companies. Profits from these subsidiaries are deposited in Puerto Rican banks. Totalling about Dollars 15bn, these funds have become central to the island's financial stability. The administration of the US possession had committed Dollars 100m a year of the deposits for low-interest loans to business projects in Caribbean Basin countries. Since 1985 Puerto Rico's neighbours have received loans from Section 936 funds totalling Dollars 650m. Mr Clinton has proposed changing the tax break to a wage credit, in an effort to raise Dollars 7bn for the Treasury over five years.</p>

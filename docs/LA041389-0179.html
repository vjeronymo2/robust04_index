			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE VET: MANY DOGS MOURN WHEN CANINE BUDDIES VANISH  </P> <P> Q. Recently, we had our old Labrador put to sleep because of a long illness.  Now the other dog, also a Lab, seems to mope about the house and is much less  active. She seems to miss her companion but otherwise appears to be normal.  Should we get another dog for her? My wife doesn't think that she will accept  another dog. What do you suggest?  </P> <P> Mr. R. Volkman, Orange  </P> <P> A. When two dogs are together for long periods of time and one is suddenly  missing, there does seem to be a period of mourning in many dogs. It may be due  to a lack of companionship or an actual loss of affection. When this occurs,  the pet should receive extra attention and affection to help him or her adjust  to the change. In many instances, introducing a new puppy or very young dog  will help your other dog recover from the loss and may even spark new life into  her. A young dog or pup is easier and should pose no threat to the older  established dog as they start to get to know each other. There is always a  chance that the older dog will not accept any other dog or pup, so a trial  period, if possible, would be best.  </P> <P> Q. In the past several days, our miniature poodle has started dragging her  bottom on the carpet and is starting to chew at her rectal area. When I checked  her, there was some redness, so I put some ointment on there, hoping it would  make her feel better. I have checked for tapeworms but have not seen any. What  else should I do to help her?  </P> <P> Marianne DeLaMar, Brea  </P> <P> A. When a dog (or cat) starts to scoot or drag its bottom on the floor, it  generally means that there is a problem with the anal sacs. There are two sacs,  one on each side of the rectum, that contain a material that is used for  scent-marking. Now and then the duct to the outside can become clogged, causing  the sacs to fill and become uncomfortable. If left unchecked, the sacs could  become infected and eventually require surgery.  </P> <P> Have your pet checked by your veterinarian, who will also check for tapeworms  and the chance that there might be tumors starting, since both of these  conditions will also cause some irritation for your pet. When you have your dog  bathed or groomed, ask that the anal sacs be expressed. This will help minimize  any problems.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VALENCIA BEATS SAVANNA, IMPROVES TO 6-0  </P> <P> Valencia High School made the right plays when they were needed in its Orange  League opener against Savanna, coming away with a 27-17 victory at Glover  Stadium Friday night.  </P> <P> Valencia (6-0, 1-0) showed why the Tigers have won or tied for the Orange  League championship the past seven years.  </P> <P> Savanna -- which forfeited all of its games last season for using an ineligible  player and lost a share of the league championship -- tried to play catch-up  with Valencia, but couldn't.  </P> <P> Valencia jumped to a 14-0 lead in the second quarter on touchdowns by  quarterback Marc O'Brien and running back Korey Alexander, with Dave Greer  kicking the extra points.  </P> <P> Savanna (3-2-1, 0-1) scored with 10 seconds left in the second quarter on a  pass from quarterback Brad Belanger to Vince Flores. Savanna attempted a  two-point conversion, but failed. Scott Thompson added a 35-yard field goal in  the third, making the score 14-9.  </P> <P> Three minutes later, the Tigers' Willie Barnes romped in from 10 yards out,  giving the Valencia a 21-9 lead.  </P> <P> Belanger, who completed 20 of 35 passes for 259 yards, hit Flores with a  touchdown pass in the fourth quarter and Jeff Ragos scored on a two-point  conversion.  </P></p>

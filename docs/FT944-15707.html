			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Further rise likely to meet resistance - New York Last week's barrage of economic data was not quite a clean sweep for the bulls, but four out of five winners were more than enough to soothe Wall Street's interest rate woes, at least for the time being. Nevertheless, analysts say stocks may have difficulty making much headway this week, even though the third-quarter reporting season is in full swing. Part of the reason is the market surged during most of last week. Since the release of surprisingly timid employment data during the first week of the month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has appreciated nearly 3 per cent. The impression of moderating economic growth imparted from the jobs report was reinforced last week by news of a downturn in producer prices, a tame reading on the consumer level and stagnant output by US factories and mines. Best of all, the rate at which the industrial sector was utilising its total capacity slipped, suggesting inflation would stay benign in the coming months. Only September retail sales came in a bit stronger than expected. The prospect of an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term rates now seems remote. Thus, monetary policy has joined Haiti, Kuwait and US-Japanese trade relations on the list of threats which have receded as immediate concerns. Most economists believe the Fed will wait until after the November elections before tightening its policy. But the market may have already expended its potential to trade higher on the relief. The Dow has been brushing against technical resistance at the 3,910 level while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 will have difficulty breaking through the 470 mark. On Friday, it closed at 469.10. 'It's hard to see what will push the market higher in the short run, outside of good earnings news,' says Mr James Solloway, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. 'The trouble is, it's hard to judge how much of the improved earnings is already built into share prices.' Last week, investors' expectations were mostly vindicated but strong performances did not always translate into big gains in share values. Chrysler was the first of the Big Three car makers to release third-quarter results, announcing a 55 per cent profits rise. But its shares improved only slightly. This week General Motors is expected to publish its results. Some analysts fear its key North American operations will post a loss, though a robust bottom line is widely forecast. IBM's third-quarter results, still the computer groups' bellwether, are also due. Wall Street expects to see continued progress from the company, which was running at a loss a year ago.</p>

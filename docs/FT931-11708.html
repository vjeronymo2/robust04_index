			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Base rate hopes spark strong recovery in UK gilts UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied strongly yesterday morning following reports in the weekend press that the Bank of England may reduce interest rates by as much as 2 percentage points. Short-dated gilts outperformed longer-dated issues initially, leading to a steepening of the yield curve. Dealers said short-dated gilts surged at the start of trading, on press reports suggesting the prime minister has a base rate target of 4 per cent in mind. Base rate was cut from 7 per cent to 6 per cent a week ago. The rally enabled the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its outstanding tap stocks - a Pounds 150m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2009 announced after last Wednesday's gilt auction. The Bank said later in the day a further Pounds 750m of stock would be available for sale, consisting of the following amounts: Pounds 300m of 9 3/4 per cent stock due 1998; Pounds 200m of 10 per cent stock due 2001; Pounds 100m of 2 per cent index-linked stock due 1996; and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2024. The Liffe gilt futures contract moved from 102.00 at the opening to a high of 102.05, before ending the day at around 102.03. Cash bonds gained around half a point, with the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 1998 rising from 111 9/32 to 111 25/32 . EUROPE'S main government bond markets opened on a note of caution, fearful of further tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism despite the weekend devaluation of the Irish punt. French government bonds were initially marked down on fears that the French franc could be the next currency to come under pressure in the foreign exchange markets. But as the franc firmed slightly against the D-Mark, French bonds rallied. The Matif futures contract, which opened at 112.36, rose to end at 113.14. Elsewhere in Europe, prices of German government bonds were marked up initially, on expectations that investors would flock towards the safe haven of the D-Mark bloc. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 93.10, moved to a high of 93.21 but closed little changed. HOPES that the Bank of Japan would cut the official discount rate helped to lift Japanese government bond prices, with the rally continuing in London trading. The weak state of the Japanese economy has fuelled hopes of a further 50 to 75 basis point easing in the official discount rate, currently at 3.25 per cent. The easing speculation pushed rates on three-month certificates of deposit down to 3.43 per cent yesterday, compared with 3.52 per cent on Friday and 3.70 per cent 10 days ago. The March futures contract rose from its opening level of 109.53 to close at 109.58 in Tokyo, but continued to make gains in the London trading session to reach 109.71. In the cash market, the benchmark No 145 opened with a yield of 4.315 per cent, and closed at 4.295 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the day. US Treasuries eased slightly at the long end of the maturity range yesterday in the wake of a stronger-than-expected purchasing managers' report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was off its lows for the day, down  3/16 at 105 1/16 , yielding 7.203 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/8 , to yield 4.168 per cent. Prices opened slightly lower ahead of the day's main economic number - the National Association of Purchasing Management's January report. When the NAPM announced that its index of manufacturing activity had risen to 58.0 last month, up from 55.4 in December, prices fell even further - economists had been expecting an NAPM figure of only 56.7. Although the market's reaction to the news pushed prices lower across the board, traders said the selling was not particularly strong, and mostly represented profit-taking. Prices recovered some of their losses in the afternoon, but the Treasury's announcement of a Dollars 67bn first-quarter borrowing requirement, and word from the White House of a Dollars 30bn fiscal stimulus package, had little impact on the market. THE benchmark government bond table has been changed to include a different Danish bond issue. The 8 per cent bond due May 2003 now replaces the 9 per cent November 2000 issue. The 8 per cent bond due 2003 is recognised as the new 10-year benchmark bond.</p>

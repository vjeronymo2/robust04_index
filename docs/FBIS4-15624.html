			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk for TASS] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol April 11 TASS - The command of the  Ukrainian Navy has issued an appeal to the Crimean leadership,  urging to "protect the military from political games." The  document said that "Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov is counting  on the Black Sea Fleet in putting into effect the results of the  survey, held in the Crimean Peninsula on March 27." The command  of the Ukrainian Navy is concerned over a possible drawing of  the armed forces into the implementation of the reform in the  Crimea. The appeal stressed that the Black Sea Fleet is  subordinated to the Ukrainian and Russian presidents and that  citizens of the two fraternal countries are serving there.</p>

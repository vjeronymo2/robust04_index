			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIN PASSES THROUGH BUT AREA STILL DRY  </P> <P> A storm system passed through Southern California on Thursday, ushering in  enough showers to dampen roads and hastily unfurled umbrellas, but not nearly  enough to affect the drought that has gripped the state for nearly four years.  </P> <P> The first rain of December -- and possibly the last of the year -- hit the Los  Angeles area and Orange County early Thursday as the weak frontal system worked  its way south toward San Diego and then east into Arizona, said Rick Dittmann,  a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> "We're not looking at anything significant," said Dittmann. "It's not going to  be a drought-breaker by any means."  </P> <P> Since July, only 1.07 inches of rain have been recorded at the Los Angeles  Civic Center. That is more than three inches below normal.  </P> <P> "It's looking pretty bad," Dittmann said.  </P> <P> "We can still have a wet January, February and March and end up above normal,"  the forecaster said. "But again, it needs to kick in soon."  </P> <P> The low-pressure system, moving along the coastline from Northern California,  was expected to bring little relief, dropping less than .10 of an inch of rain  in the Los Angeles area, and perhaps a quarter of an inch in the mountains  before beginning to clear the Southland by this morning, Dittmann said.  </P> <P> "It doesn't have the moisture to be a heavy rain producer for Southern  California," Dittmann said. "It's moving so quickly (that) any showers will be  moving quickly also and it won't be able to rain on any area for long."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, moderate to heavy rains were reported in the San Diego area  during the evening.  </P> <P> The National Weather service said the storm dumped 1.01 inches at Lindbergh  Field between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. The downpour tied the all-time record for the  date set in 1931.  </P> <P> By late Thursday, only traces had been reported from Newport Beach north to  Westwood, the weather service said.  </P> <P> An upper-level low-pressure system will remain in the storm's wake, settling on  the southwest coast and possibly bringing showers to some local areas over the  next two days.  </P> <P> But "as it looks now," said Dittmann, "we'll have fair weather over the weekend  and into the new year."  </P> <P> Thursday's Civic Center high was 65 degrees. A similar reading was expected  today, with a high near 70 on Saturday, forecasters say.  </P></p>

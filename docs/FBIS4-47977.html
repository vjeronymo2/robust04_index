			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] and the men of the  Black Cockerel are involved in fierce fighting in the country's  central region. A FAA General Staff source says that the  fighting is taking place in Chongoroi and Tchindjendje.    In the north, the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA] forces have been carrying out operations  against the government forces in the area of (Dala Ucua), Bengo  Province. That source also disclosed that, in the wake of the  FAA forces' reoccupation of N'dalatando, Cuanza Norte Province,  the situation is now improving in favor of the government forces.    Two Zairian Army officers were killed on the Eastern Front a  few days ago. They were fighting alongside the UNITA forces.  In addition to [words indistinct] military operations, one can  now witness an intense [words indistinct] and concentration of  UNITA forces north of Dundo, near the border with Zaire.    In Cuito, the UNITA forces continue to murder, beat up, and  abduct local civilians, as well as to (?throw) explosives  against positions occupied by government forces.</p>

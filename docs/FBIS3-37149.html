Gasanov sees the programme as an  important element of European security.    The letter also expresses hope that Azerbaijan will join  this  partnership since the programme includes regulations on  respecting borders.    Today's scheduled visit of Georgian Foreign Minister,  Alexander Chikvaidze, to Azerbaijan was postponed due to bad  weather. However, towards the end of the day, the leader of the  Georgian diplomatic representation is due to arrive in Baku.  Important aspects to Azerbaijani-Georgian relations will be  considered at this meeting.    Today the delegation of the Polish Ministry of Foreign  Affairs is due to arrive in Baku as well. During meetings with  Azeri Foreign Ministry officials, development of bilateral  relations in policy, economy, culture will be discussed. The  ratification of the treaty on friendship and cooperation, as  well as bilateral treaties on cooperation in spheres of science,  technology and culture are expected to take place.    Agshin Mehktiyev, a Foreign Ministry official said that due  to diplomatic efforts by Baku, there has been positive movement  towards U.S. policy vis-a-vis Congressional restrictions on  government aid to Azerbaijan, which might lead to their  abolition. Azeri Foreign Ministry officials say the White House  and State Department have called for the annulment of Senator  Kerry's amendment that was attached to the "Freedom Suport Act"  (Title IX, Section 907). However, it is Congress that must vote  the final decision. This Congressional amendment bans U.S.  Government assistance, of most types, to the Government of  Azerbaijan.    The representative of the Azeri Foreign Ministry expressed  hope that the U.S. Congress will take a constructive position on  this problem.    A visit by the Azeri president to the United Kingdom is  expected in late December. The programme of this visit is being  worked out now. Aliyev will meet and negotiate with British  Prime-Minister John Major. The signing of the contract on  friendship, cultural, scientific and technical cooperation is  expected. The signing of bilateral treaty on cooperation in oil  production is also expected.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal by NCI to place the residual value on a ``fluid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrier'' component has some merit in that it does not try to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply the residual value to a component such as other solids, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the market may not place a value. The major drawback to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NCI proposal is that it ignores one of the components of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk, other nonfat solids, which is composed of lactose and ash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the other nonfat solids do not have as much market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value as either butterfat or protein, they are an important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of milk. If a multiple component pricing system is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be effective it should price as many of the components in milk as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible, preferably based on the value of those components in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the marketplace. There is, however, no readily available measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the market value of the other nonfat solids. Since there was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no testimony or any justification in the record for departing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Minnesota-Wisconsin price as a basic price for milk, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least one of the components in the payment plan must represent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the difference between a competitively-set pay price (the M-W)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the product-derived component prices. This residual value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore represents not only the value of the lactose and ash,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but also equates the component values, some of which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by their market value, with a competitively set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer pay price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prospect of lactose being added to milk by producers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purpose of benefitting from the other solids price was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed by several hearing participants. The incentive to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adulterate milk with added lactose should be no more of a problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the current incentive to adulterate milk with water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing to determine whether lactose has been added should, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact, be easier than testing for water since it would be part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing necessary to determine producers' payments. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, added lactose can be detected during normal testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures currently conducted on milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCI's concern that testing for total solids would increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers' costs and difficulty of testing was not established in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hearing record. In fact, testimony indicated that many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers are already testing for total solids. Hearing testimony  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also showed that the testing for total solids is as accurate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more accurate than testing for butterfat or protein. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the infrared machines that are used by most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories will test for total solids at the same time the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat and protein tests are done. Therefore, there should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no significant increase in testing cost or testing difficulty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the implementation of the component pricing plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in this decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Butterfat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The value of butterfat in the amended orders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be the same as under the current orders. There was no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal or testimony to change the way butterfat currently is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valued. One expert witness testified that the current system of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basing the value of butterfat on the value of butter is proper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This decision continues the historical relationship of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values of butterfat and butter. The difference between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing of butterfat in the amended order and the current order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is due to the way that value is expressed. Currently the value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of butterfat is expressed as a differential; that is, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference in value between 0.1 pound of butterfat and 0.1 pound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of skim milk. The amended order will express the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat on the basis of a price per pound. Whichever method is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used, the total value of butterfat in milk is the same. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by expressing the value on a per pound basis instead of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential, the objective of demonstrating clearly to producers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the value is in milk is easily achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, the butterfat price per pound in the amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order will be determined by multiplying the butterfat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential by 965 and adding the Class III price. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting price per hundredweight would then be divided by 100 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give a price per pound of butterfat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

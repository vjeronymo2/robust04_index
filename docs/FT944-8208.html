			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: London Traditional pre-Budget speculation is likely to shape sentiment on the gilts market, which was strengthened last week by positive UK economic data. Nevertheless, gilts continue to be buffeted by international trends, particularly following last week's US interest rate rise. With next week's Budget likely to reduce substantially the public sector borrowing requirement, gilts are expected to perform well over the coming weeks. A survey last week indicated that City economists now expect the PSBR to fall to Pounds 32bn this financial year, and Pounds 23bn next year. Speculation is mounting that the Budget might introduce an open repo market which would make the market more liquid and take the kink out of the yield curve that has made longer dates yields lower than those at the medium term. In the meantime, last week's economic data, which suggested that UK inflationary pressures remained subdued, is expected to strengthen the market. Mr Nigel Richardson, of Yamaichi International said: 'We go into the budget with a relatively favourable tone to the market - the background to gilts is good on an international basis.' As Merrill Lynch points out, the spread between UK-US yields has narrowed recently, and its economists predict that it could narrow further.</p>

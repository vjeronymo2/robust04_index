They  studied ways and means of restoring security especially in  Bujumbura in order to stop massacres, balkanization of suburbs,  looting, and arson. They decided on a number of measures.    First, the entire population is asked to keep peace  throughout the country and not to allow themselves to be  influenced by the situation in the various zones of the  Bujumbura mayorship in order to prevent trouble erupting  upcountry.    Second, from now on the Gendarmerie in cooperation with the  (?administration) must ensure the security in the suburbs,  markets, on the roads, and in other important public places.    Third, the officials of the gendarmerie and the army must  provide the men and necessary means to apprehend whoever  perturbs the security and who is in illegal possession of arms.    Fourth, the security forces must avail themselves rapidly  anywhere they hear gunfire and must proceed immediately with the  arrest of the culprits and the search of houses in the area of  the disturbance.    Finally, any person arrested, no matter what his function  may  be, will have to be brought before the judicial organs.</p>

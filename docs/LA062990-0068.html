			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTIMS RUSH TO SEE IF LOSSES ARE FULLY COVERED;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: ADJUSTERS GET READY AS RESIDENTS CHECK WHETHER THEIR POLICIES ARE  ADEQUATE TO REPLACE HOMES THAT HAVE SOARED IN VALUE IN RECENT YEARS.  </P> <P> Victims of Wednesday's devastating fires were scrambling Thursday to determine  whether their insurance coverage is adequate to replace homes that have soared  in value over the past several years.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, insurers said they were readying teams of adjusters to fly into the  hardest-hit areas of Southern California to handle claims in what has already  become one of the costliest fire seasons in years.  </P> <P> "From what we understand from the fire department, this is probably the worst  brush fire season in recent memory," said Dick Donegan, regional underwriting  manager for Allstate Insurance Co. in Glendale. "After four years of drought,  it looks like this is going to be a very rough year."  </P> <P> It could turn out to be rougher still for consumers who have failed to update  their insurance policies, particularly in fire-prone areas of Southern  California. The last fire of this magnitude destroyed 216 homes in Santa  Barbara 13 years ago.  </P> <P> Government officials later estimated that insurance covered only about 60% of  the losses that fire victims suffered in the so-called Sycamore Canyon Fire of  1977.  </P> <P> A lot has changed in the past decade, though. Agents said Thursday that the  bulk of the fire victims they have contacted have full coverage, largely  through "replacement value" clauses that have become popular in recent years.  </P> <P> However, these clauses vary dramatically from insurer to insurer. Some will pay  the costs of all damages, regardless of how much they exceed the policy limits.  Others only guarantee that personal items will not be depreciated to current  market value and instead will be replaced at original cost. Some damage waivers  can be rendered completely ineffective by policy limits.  </P> <P> Fireman's Fund, for example, says replacement value coverage applies only when  policy limits equal at least 80% of the value of the home. In other words, a  $100,000 house insured for $40,000 would get no benefit from the policy. But if  it were insured to $80,000, the replacement coverage would kick in, said John  Kozero, a Fireman's Fund spokesman.  </P> <P> Allstate's Donegan, on the other hand, says anyone who has purchased  replacement coverage with Allstate is fully covered "no matter what."  </P> <P> "If you have replacement cost coverage, and your house is insured to $100,000  but it costs $300,000 to rebuild it, you are still fully covered," Donegan  said. "There is no cap."  </P> <P> Transamerica Insurance Co. estimates that 72% of its customers have replacement  value coverage on the structures of their homes and more than 90% took out the  coverage for contents, said Richard Olsen, a company vice president.  </P> <P> The percentages vary at other companies, but many of the largest insurers in  the state said that at least half of their policies included some inflation  protection.  </P> <P> Those most at risk for inadequate coverage are the people covered by the  California FAIR Plan, a cooperative insurance pool that provides fire insurance  to high-risk houses in brush areas. FAIR, whose name stands for Fair Access to  Insurance Requirements, provides coverage only up to the policy limits and will  pay for lost items only at their depreciated values, regardless of their  current replacement costs, said Mike Harris, a plan spokesman.  </P> <P> Already the plan has received 23 claims, mostly from the Glendale blaze, Harris  said. But many of those policyholders have additional "wrap-around" coverages  with other insurers, he noted, adding that the average local FAIR Plan customer  has $275,000 in coverage.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, insurers were flying adjusters into fire-plagued parts of California  to help assess damages. And agents said they were already writing checks to  fire victims to help them cover living expenses and new clothes.  </P> <P> "We are sending out checks for $5,000 even without seeing the property," said  Ed Hurd, marketing manager at Manchester Insurance Agency in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Despite predictions that 1990 will be one of the worst years in recent history  for fire damage, insurers said consumers are not likely to see near-term rate  hikes. Fire insurance rates are determined over 10- and 20-year periods, a  practice that eliminates annual gyrations for especially disastrous years,  Donegan said.  </P> <P> Currently, homeowner policies that include fire insurance coverage cost between  $75 and $200 a year for each $100,000 in coverage, depending on location and  specifics of the policy, insurance agents said. And although wood-shake roofs  have been cited as one of the biggest factors in determining how much fire  damage a home will sustain, none of the insurers contacted Thursday said they  charged more for policies on houses with wood-shake roofs. However, several  insurers said they might decline a policy application if the home were in a  brush area.  </P></p>

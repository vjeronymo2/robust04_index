			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Neo-Nazis Offer Pact to </F> Schoenhuber"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Bonn -- Interior Minister Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) will present the report by the  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution for 1993  in Bonn today. He will again reject a ban of the Republikaner.  The information that has been gathered is allegedly not  sufficient to substantiate the suspicion of right-wing extremism  against Schoenhuber's party.    Meanwhile, neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists have offered  the Republikaner "sensible action alliances" and "active  election support" for the Bundestag elections. In a strategy  document of the right-wing extremist National List (NL), the  brown ideologists propose "organized comrade circles" for a  "basic unity among the `national opposition,' which should also  include the most radical fringes." The document reads: "We  believe that this might and should one day develop into a  `right-wing popular front....'" First of all, however, the  slogan is "Republikaner into the Bundestag."    According to the analysis by the Federal Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, the National List has for a long  time been trying to "mobilize supporters of different neo-Nazi  and other right-wing extremist groups to form an action  committee out of all organizations."    In its strategic considerations, the National List is not  impressed by the fact that Schoenhuber has distanced himself  from the NL and called for its ban. The neo-Nazis believe that  the entry of the Republikaner into the Bundestag would be "quite  useful for us." They give the following reason: Media  campaigns and the military actions of antifascist groups would  concentrate to a greater extent on this bourgeois-rightist  group. Moreover, "if Schoenhuber receives 30 seats in the  Bundestag with 5 percent of the vote, there will be the one or  the other extremist deviationist. Even a single (autonomous)  ultraradical nationalist deputy in the Bundestag would be a  similar advantage for the `National Opposition' like the deputy  of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], Krause, who joined the  Republikaner."    The NL strategists are convinced that a success of the  Republikaner would cost Kohl his chancellorship. Over the  medium term, the CDU could no longer try to win votes "on the  right fringe" and maintain the "bourgeois center" at the same  time. This would lead to a leeway on the right fringe of the  spectrum, as has existed for a long time on the left fringe  because of the Greens and recently also because of the Party of  Democratic Socialism that exists in "central Germany."</p>

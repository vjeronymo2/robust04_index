			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> 7-UP Parodies Coke, Pepsi: While Diet Coke and Pepsi continue to take  commercial pokes at each other, Diet 7-UP has decided to parody both of them in  a new TV campaign that will break Monday. But unlike the Pepsi and Diet Coke  ads -- which flaunt major rocks stars and 3-D technology -- one 15-second 7-UP  ad even features an announcer who mocks the competition when he confesses, "No  big rocks stars here." According to recent research data, Diet Coke is the  biggest selling diet soft drink in the U.S., with 7% of the market, with Diet  Pepsi second at 5.3% and 7-UP third, with 1.6%.  </P></p>

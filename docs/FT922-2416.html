			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Union Bank of Finland slides to FM317m deficit UNION Bank of Finland, the country's largest commercial bank, has reported a loss of FM317m (Dollars 74.2m) for the first four months of 1992, writes Robert Taylor. The figure compares with a profit of FM144m for the same period of last year. 'Taken as a whole, 1992 will be considerably weaker for the UNitas Group than last year,' said Mr Ahti Hirvonen, the chairman. 'The anticipated upturn in the economy next year is likely to reverse the trend, but it is still too early to estimate the speed of the change.' The bank blamed the deficit on deep recession in Finland. There was an 181 per cent growth in write-offs on credits and guarantees, to FM419m from FM149m last time. Net income from financing operations dropped 16.4 per cent, to FM645m from FM771m. There was a 14.9 per cent drop in the bank's total income, to FM1.14bn from FM1.34bn. However, the bank retains a healthy capital adequacy ratio of 10.7 per cent. Mr Hirvonen said the group was continuing to adjust to the situation, with a one-third cut in the number of branches and 20 per cent reduction in personnel. However, he warned that Finland's high interest rates would have disastrous consequences. 'It is a question of a threat to business and economic life generally, which is also reflected in the banks,' he said.</p>

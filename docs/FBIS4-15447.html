			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 07, BNS -- The Lithuanian state radio  and TV board decided on Tuesday [5 April] that channel 38 will  be shared by the Polish TV Polonia and the Vilnius-based  Baltijos TV.    The state-run TV Polonia, which recently replaced Polish  national TV on the channel, will show its programs every second  day three times a week. The private Baltijos TV, which is a  Lithuania-USA joint venture, will have four days on the channel.    Gintaras Songaila, Baltijos TV director general, said he  will  bring action against the board. In his words, politics is mixed  up in the board's decision and in its activities in general.    Gediminas Ilgunas, chairman of the radio and TV board,  agrees  that the decision is not very good. He added, however, that a  suggestion to divide time on the channel by hours was not  perfect either.    Ilgunas said the dispute over channel 38 started last  December when the board decided that Polish state TV would  broadcast for 45 hours a week and the remaining time would be  rented by way of contest. But Polish TV and Baltijos TV, which  won the remaining time on the channel in a contest, failed to  agree on air time, he said.    In Ilgunas' words, Polish TV complained that Baltijos TV  ignores its interests and interrupts its programs whenever it  wants.    "The Poles got what they wanted," Songaila said. He noted  that his station is able to fully cover time on channel 38.    Songaila said the board's decision violates laws regulating  media activities in Lithuania. According to the existing  legislation, a media company must be registered in Lithuania and  the share of foreign capital in it must not exceed a half of its  stock capital. Why doesn't this apply to TV Polonia, Songaila  said.    But the board has not yet discussed the situation on a  channel rented by TELE-3, a private TV station that broadcasts  throughout Lithuania. Liucija Baskauskaite, the station's  owner, presented document to the board confirming that the  station paid all bills to communication services. Ilgunas said  the station's debt reached 165,000 lits in mid-March.    The Lithuanian radio and TV transmission center earlier  submitted a claim for arbitration demanding to cancel its  contract with TELE-3 because of its debts for transmitter rent.  The center accused the station of violating other terms of the  contract.    But the state arbitration failed to pass any decision  Wednesday.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Industry calls for more of the same LAST night's welcome by industry for the cut in interest rates was tempered with renewed calls for additional measures to end the recession. While the Engineering Employers Federation warned that cheaper money might feed directly through into increased consumer spending, rather than into higher investment and increased exports, retailers said improved consumer confidence was essential. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, welcomed the cut in interest rates, but warned that it would not on its own lead to economic recovery. 'It's no longer a problem of people lacking confidence,' he said. 'Businesses are paralysed by uncertainty.' Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, joined industrialists in welcoming the reduction, but said 'still bolder' measures were needed. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and chief executive of Ford of Britain, said he understood the government's need to stage rates cuts in order not to 'throw away' gains made in its anti-inflationary policy. 'We'd like to see more cuts. But they've got to be balanced against the effect on sterling and inflation,' he added. Mr McAllister also called for an increase in capital investment programmes. Mr Colin Hope, chairman of T &amp; N, the motor components group, and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the cut was 'probably as much as the government can sensibly do at this time'. More cuts were needed to improve confidence. The Confederation of British Industry said the cut was the move 'business has been looking for', claiming it was justified by the weakness of the economy and by progress in trimming inflation. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said the chancellor had now 'completed the interest rate action required' when the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism. But the Federation of Small Businesses said it wanted rates cut to 5 per cent.</p>

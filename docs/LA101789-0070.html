			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A TALE OF TWO CHARGERS;  </P> <P> MCMAHON IS DOUBTFUL FOR GAME WITH GIANTS;  </P> <P> IS HE OUT?: A DISLOCATED SHOULDER, BRUISED KNEE AND SPRAINED ANKLE MAKE THE  CHARGERS QUARTERBACK AN UNLIKELY PARTICIPANT FOR SUNDAY'S GAME.  </P> <P> It went from bad to worse Monday for the Chargers.  </P> <P> Bad was the 17-16 defeat Seattle handed them Sunday when the Seahawks blocked  an extra point and a field goal in the final period.  </P> <P> Worse, was the preliminary injury report handed to Coach Dan Henning less than  24 hours later.  </P> <P> Charger quarterback Jim McMahon suffered a dislocated shoulder, a bruised knee  and sprained ankle against the Seahawks, won't practice Wednesday and may not  play against the Giants Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Trainers were  able to pop the shoulder back into position during the Seattle loss in which  McMahon threw for 286 yards. But it was extremely sore Monday.  </P> <P> McMahon topped a long list of Charger injuries. And his delicate condition  could prompt Henning to activate rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver,  eligible to come off injured reserve this week.  </P> <P> For his part, Tolliver insists he will be ready if needed even though he hasn't  played one regular season down in the NFL. Tolliver's injury, a broken  collarbone, occurred during the Chargers' final exhibition game.  </P> <P> "If Dan Henning tells me to go jump off that Coronado Bridge or whatever it is,  then I'm gonna jump off that bridge," Tolliver said. "That's the only way to  play the game. If he tells me to come off IR (injured reserve), then I come off  IR."  </P> <P> Henning said he won't make a decision on Tolliver until Wednesday's practice.  He also has the option of starting backup David Archer at quarterback against  the Giants if McMahon can't play.  </P> <P> McMahon has been the Chargers' starter through six games. But because of a  history of injuries he has never started more than nine consecutive games in  one season.  </P> <P> Asked if he thought he could be ready by Sunday for the Giants and their  fearsome pass-rushing linebacker Lawrence Taylor, Tolliver said, "if they got  me in there practicing with the regular group, then it's not a question of, 'Do  I think I would?' it's, 'I've got to.' There's no ifs, ands or buts about it.  If Taylor comes on a blitz, it's my job to throw it."  </P> <P> The most serious injuries to other key players include H-back Rod Bernstine  (knee), wide receiver Quinn Early (knee) and left tackle Joel Patten (knee).  Henning said running back Dana Brinson has a "neurological problem" between his  neck and shoulder described as a "burner."  </P> <P> Henning also said it is entirely possible that McMahon, Early, Brinson, Patten  and Bernstine will all miss the Giants' game.  </P> <P> The loss of Brinson and Bernstine cripples the Chargers at the H-back position  which, next to quarterback, is the most important spot in their offense. "I'm  going to put up a notice on the board out there," Henning said. "It will say,  'All those interested in being a back, apply.' "  </P> <P> Added Henning: "It's going to be difficult to prepare for this game no matter  what offensively because of the amount of injuries that we have."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Charger cornerback Gill Byrd leads the AFC with five interceptions. . . .  Giants place-kicker Raul Allegre leads the NFL in scoring with 63 points. The  Chargers (2-4) play the Giants (5-1) at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Sunday. .  . . Asked if the "burner" injury suffered by Dana Brinson was anything like  what other teams commonly refer to as a "stinger" Charger Coach Dan Henning  said, "I thought a stinger was a drink."  </P></p>

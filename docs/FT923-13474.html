			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (6): The bright lights beckon - Tourism BAHRAIN's biggest tourist attraction dare not speak its name. However hard the island markets its virtues as a tourist destination - and the government is marketing these more vigorously than ever - it will not advertise its liberal drinking laws as being among them. Islamic propriety prevents the government from selling Bahrain on the basis of its bars. But since Bahrain's neighbours prevent the selling of alcohol altogether, little selling is required. More than 1.4m people arrived in Bahrain last year for tourism or recreation  -75 per cent of them fellow Gulf Arabs. An average of around 160,000 of these visitors a month arrived over the 25km causeway which links Bahrain to the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, which is very strictly teetotal - 'the Saudis, very bluntly, come here for R and R,' says one official. It would not be entirely accurate to claim that these visitors all crossed into Bahrain just for a weekend drink (by far the majority cross only for the day and a half of the Moslem weekend) - although numerous expatriate workers with Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's giant oil company based over the causeway in Dhahran, make no bones about the fact that they do. Whatever Bahrain's additional attractions, and these include a good number of Arab and western-style nightclubs, several top-of-the-range hotels and restaurants and a generally accommodating atmosphere, Bahrain's weekend popularity adds up to an industry worth, by government estimates, more than Dollars 1bn a year - more, if the figure is correct, than its aluminium smelter, for instance. It also adds up to a growing and labour-intensive industry which the emirate is, given its acute need to create jobs for young Bahrainis, exploiting to the hilt. According to government figures, the hotel industry in 1990 employed just 656 Bahrainis out of a total workforce of 3,249. However, Mr Tariq Almoayed, the minister of information who is responsible for tourism, believes that as many as 10,000 Bahrainis could eventually be employed in the sector. On the path to that, as yet far distant, dream, Bahrain has set up a hotel and catering training centre, which injects 200 Bahrainis a year into the industry and which this year will add a year-long course in travel and tourism to its curriculum. The island is also adding fast to its hotels, particularly those of two- and three-stars which cater for the bulk of visiting Saudi and other Gulf families, on the basis that each new room equates roughly to one new job. Bahrain already has 23 two- and three-star hotels and an additional 10 are being built. 'With relatively small investment, you can create very large opportunities for employing Bahrainis,' says Mr Almoayed. The government's Tourism Development Company is also expanding - to the extent that it can afford - the range of attractions offered on what is, to be honest, a fairly small and featureless island. The company has set up bus tours, dhow trips to nearby Dar island and has just completed an impressively housed Arabic restaurant, in full wind-towered Gulf style, beside the equally impressive new museum on the emirate's north coast. The company also helped establish the island's first beach club at Al Bander, which gathers an excellent fish restaurant, bars, holiday apartments, a swimming pool and tennis courts round a small, man-made cove. But the Al Bander development, to be followed shortly by the opening of a new Meridien resort hotel - the island's first such - on a spit of land off Bahrain's northern shore, points up some of the limitations the island faces in promoting itself, as it is also seeking to do, as a rounded, upmarket tourist spot. To begin with, the island is acutely short of beaches. In fact, Bahrain at present has only one public beach to speak of - the Emir's beach to the island's south. The Al Bander beach has been hewn and sanded out of otherwise rocky coast, and the Meridien will also have to create its own sandy shores. Moreover, much of the country's coast will be impossible to develop for tourism - the east coast houses most of the island's heavy industry, much of the west coast is taken up by private villas and the dagger-tip south coast embraces the island's main airbase and is thus firmly out of bounds. The government hopes, nevertheless, that the Meridien and Al Bandar will create what one official calls a 'small critical mass' to pump-prime further private sector investment into developing upmarket tourist features. One hope is that the island's five five-star hotels will loosen out of being purely business hotels into providing a bit more tourist fun. But in aiming further upmarket and away from purely causeway-fed tourism, Bahrain suffers badly from comparison with Dubai, its go-getting United Arab Emirates rival further down the Gulf. Dubai's aggressive bid for the same tourist market is already supported by three large resort hotels, one grassy golf course, with another on the way, long stretches of sandy beach and, most important, by something in the region of 10 times Bahrain's oil revenues with which to invest further in tourist attractions. A large theme park, for instance, is already well into planning. Bahrain's hope is that visitors will include the island as one stop on a regional Gulf tour - though at present, inter-Gulf co-operation on tourism is as fraught with rivalry as other areas of regional economic endeavour. Nevertheless, the island's promoters have persuaded the South African airline Flitestar to open weekly flights to Bahrain later this year carrying what, for the most part, will be tourist passengers. In the end, though, it will be the bright lights visible from Saudi Arabia, promising Egyptian and Filipino nightclub entertainers, a small feast of Italian, Greek, Arabian, Chinese and Indian restaurants and, of course, the odd glass of Johnnie Walker, which will keep Bahrain's future hotel and catering school graduates busy on a Thursday and Friday evening.</p>

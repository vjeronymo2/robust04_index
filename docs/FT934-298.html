			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cavalier who infuriated the establishment Mr Mario Conde is only 45, yet he has infuriated Spain's financial establishment more often than any septuagenarian, writes Our Financial Staff. He bounded on to the financial stage in 1987 when he and a friend sold their bulk chemicals producer to Montedison for Pta65bn (Dollars 481m). With the proceeds they bought their way on to the Banesto board, and he became president within days. He has enlarged the bank at a breakneck pace; become embroiled in a wrangle with los Albertos, two other youthful entrepreneurs, which ended in their public humiliation; helped Mr Rupert Murdoch stage a boardroom coup at a television station; provoked the hostility of BP; and been cited as a future conservative prime minister. The son of a Galician customs official, he studied law at the Jesuit University of Duesto near Bilbao, achieving one of the three highest marks in national law exams. He admits that when he took control at Banesto he did not tell shareholders how bad it was. If he had come clean, he said recently, 'what would have been their reaction? They would have left the bank'. This cavalier approach to shareholders partly explains Mr Conde's many enemies. Just as important is his enthusiasm for busting Spanish banking's interest rate cartel. With his departure, the Spanish financial establishment will sleep more easily.</p>

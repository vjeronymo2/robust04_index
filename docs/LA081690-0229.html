			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR;  </P> <P> VOTE DELAYED ON TRASH PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday postponed for 90 days a decision on whether to  franchise the city's residential garbage collection.  </P> <P> After hearing testimony from nearly two dozen residents, the council chose to  wait until November to make a decision.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Terry Belanger said the council will "step back and take  a little bit of a break, a breather" before deciding whether the city should go  from its current open market status, in which residents can choose their own  garbage haulers, to a franchise, in which one or more companies would have  exclusive hauling rights within the city.  </P></p>

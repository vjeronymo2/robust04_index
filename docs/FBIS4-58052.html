			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source at the Defense Ministry,  commenting on the so-called statement of the military official  at the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff command which  was transmitted by Channel One in Sanaa on 28 April said:    The Defense Ministry affirms that this statement was not  issued by it and did not represent its opinion and that the  statement was totally incorrect and had tried to change the  facts upside down. It had tried in vain to place responsibility  for the explosion of the situation in 'Imran on whom it referred  to as saboteurs and secessionist elements in the Yemeni  Socialist Party. The official source declined to answer this  statement but the reality has already been made clear by the  official source of the Defense Ministry last Wednesday [27  April]. This fact is well-known by those who were burned by the  fire of this sedition which was sparked off by the adventurous  military command in Sanaa, the people of 'Imran and the members  of the military commission who were present then at 'Imran Camp.    The statement added that the endeavors by the president and  other officials in Sanaa to contain the position was totally not  based on reality and that the appeals made by the defense  minister to stop the military offensive against the 3d Armored  Brigade had not been seriously dealt with.    The official source said that the ruling military circle in  Sanaa had launched considerable forces equipped with various  arms to attack the 3d Brigade without giving regard to the  members of this brigade and the peaceful people of 'Imran. It  also did not allow the evacuation of the wounded and did not  treat them as prisoners of war but tortured them and  interrogated them by the security bodies.    The source appealed to the public opinion, the military  commission, and the fact-finding commission which was formed by  the House of Deputies and human rights organizations to  interfere in this inhuman conduct which contradicts with the  morals of our Yemeni people.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting If the Accounting Standards Board gets its way, that large portion of UK companies currently floating off-balance sheet will soon come back into view. Its latest proposals are admirably clear: companies should show assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet if they enjoy economic benefits or face risks. In theory, the market should then be able to assess the real rate of return on assets and the true extent of gearing. Whether the ASB has done enough to frustrate the financial engineers remains an open question. The tighter definition of a subsidiary introduced by the 1989 Companies Act has already put a stop to the more obvious abuses of off-balance sheet finance. Yet complex sale and repurchase agreements using options are all too common, notably in the leisure and property sectors. The ASB insists such assets should be shown in the main accounts if the option to repurchase is likely to be exercised. That will be open to interpretation. One can only hope the combination of plain language and explicit examples will be enough to hold the line. The ASB deserves credit, though, for backing away from rules which would have stopped banks taking assets off-balance sheet by securitising through the capital markets. That would have placed the UK financial sector at a competitive disadvantage. Yesterday's draft marks a common-sense compromise: banks will have to show all assets on the face of the balance sheet, but can include a figure net of securitisation alongside. Purists might complain at this proliferation of categories. But a treatment which accurately reflects the transfer of risk and the retention of reward is the kind of innovation the market should welcome.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, 17 Jun (AFP) -- About 30 Hutu militiamen on  Friday [17 June] attacked a hotel housing hundreds of Tutsi  refugees and sprayed gunfire into the rooms after chasing UN  troops away, a UN military spokesman said. The attack on the  Milles Collines hotel by extremist gunmen from the Hutu majority  came hours after the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front  launched a commando raid and brought some 400 people out of a  church where hundreds of people have been killed by Hutus. The  UN spokesman, Major Jean-Guy Plante, said he could not give any  casualties from the raid on the hotel, but said it was "probably  murderous".    Both the hotel and the church are on territory in the  embattled capital held by Hutu pro-government troops and militia  forces. In the Tutsi raid on the church, other rebel forces  started firing to create a diversion, and 180 wounded civilians  and soldiers, believed to have been hurt in the ensuing  fighting, were admitted to a Red Cross hospital.    Two UN officers, one from Bangladesh and the other from  Uruguay, were hurt in what was believed to have been a grenade  or mine explosion Friday about 20 kilometres (12 miles)  north-west of Kigali during a reconnaissance mission on the road  to the town of Ruhengeri, UN military sources said. No further  details were immediately available and it was unclear who was  responsible for the explosion. Fighting erupted despite a shaky  two-day-old ceasefire between rebel and government forces.</p>

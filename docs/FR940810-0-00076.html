			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) agreed in its post-hearing comment that the use of spray can with certain solvents is potentially dangerous, and suggested that nonhazardous sprays or aerosols be allowed (Ex. 150). Another participant described an occasion in which the spray can was accidentally dropped, punctured, and released solvent into the work area (Ex. 7&hyph;24). The safety director at Fruehauf Trailer Operations, asked ``why is it necessary to use a solvent as opposed to water? *&blank;*&blank;* why couldn't it be used in place of a solvent in the performance of brake and clutch work?'' (Ex. 7&hyph;4). Mr. Swartz agreed that ``simple water and detergent can be as effective'' (Ex. 1&hyph;176) However, he insisted that it be a gentle mist of water and that resulting drips be caught and proper disposal carried out (Tr. 1852).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA agrees with these comments and witnesses. The Agency notes that some of the solvents contained in the spray cans used to spray brake assemblies present significant health risks. As a matter of public health policy, it is better not to list as preferred, a compliance method which introduces another hazardous substance into the breathing zone of the worker.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the effectiveness of the solvent/spray method is compromised by the reported need to use additional force to remove asbestos deposited in the brake assembly, which the spray cannot reach. Additionally, comment and testimony indicate that the force of the aerosol spray by itself can make airborne the asbestos-containing dust. OSHA noted in the proposal, that the spray/solvent can method produced the highest airborne concentrations of the methods tested by NIOSH (55 FR at 29724). OSHA notes that although it based its endorsement of the solvent/spray method on the NIOSH study, as Mr. Swartz pointed out, ``the issue of the residual dust left in a drum, I don't think, was properly addressed in that study *&blank;*&blank;* (In) the real world, *&blank;*&blank;* the mechanic will either dump it on the ground or he'll dump it in a garbage can. At the end of the day he's going to sweep the floor, and he's sweeping the dust up'' (Id at 1845).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, in this final standard the spray/solvent can method is no longer a ``preferred method,'' the use of which will exempt employers from other provisions of the standard. Although the standard does not prohibit the use of solvent sprays in brake and clutch repair to control asbestos exposure, employers will have to comply with other provisions in the asbestos and other standards when using the method. Initial monitoring must be undertaken to assure that exposures are likely to remain under the PEL, provisions of the hazard communication standard relating to communicating the hazard potential of the solvent used, and training employees in avoiding exposure to such solvent must be complied with. Employees must be specifically informed that the solvent/spray method is not preferred, and OSHA's reasons for that decision must be explained to them, as part of that training. Employers must provide for the prompt cleanup of all asbestos containing liquid or debris which is produced by any brake cleaning method, including a solvent/spray. Thus, solvent-wetted asbestos containing material must be HEPA vacuumed when it reaches the ground, because waiting will result in dried and airborne dust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the methods tested by NIOSH was the use of a HEPA vacuum alone, without enclosure. The National Automobile Dealers Association representative, D. Greenhaus, encouraged OSHA to include this in its list of preferred methods of asbestos control in brake work stating that this was the method already in use in many places (Ex. 7&hyph;104). The Sheehy (NIOSH) study noted that'' *&blank;*&blank;* the drums must be removed before the vacuum cleaner can be used, thus there is a potential for asbestos release during drum removal'' (Ex. 1&hyph;112), and P. Carpenter of Nilfisk stated ``[t]he greatest potential for exposure occurs when the brake drum is first removed'' (Ex. 7&hyph;140). OSHA agrees that the potential for exposure during drum removal before the HEPA vacuum can be used precludes listing including this as a preferred method. Moreover, NIOSH found that HEPA systems alone do not clean the brake components as effectively as the other methods (Ex. 1&hyph;112). Mr. Greenhaus also recommended that OSHA prohibit three activities during brake operations: dry brushing, air hose cleaning and use of non-HEPA vacuums. NIOSH agreed that such prohibitions are necessary and OSHA concurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

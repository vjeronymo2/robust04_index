The meeting was to  concentrate on possible ways of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict.    Armenia accounted for its refusal by the fact that  Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian community was barred from  negotiations, while Armenia thinks it necessary to grant this  community the status of a party in the conflict, Azerbaijan's  Foreign Ministry reported tonight.</p>

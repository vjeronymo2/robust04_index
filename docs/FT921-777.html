			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: CCF lifts payout as profits rise CREDIT Commercial de France, one of the largest private-sector French banks, yesterday announced a 17 per cent increase in net profits on a comparable basis to FFr917m in 1991 from FFr813m the previous year. Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman, cited a 'prudent policy on credit' as one of the chief reasons for the profits increase. The board proposed raising the dividend from FFr3.5 a share in 1990 to FFr3.8 the previous year. CCF - together with other French banking groups - has been hit by an increase in corporate bad debts, particularly in the computer sector and among small businesses, although it suffered less than its competitors from defaults on consumer loans. The group has been taking steps to improve efficiency by scrutinising costs  -the increase in general costs was held to 2 per cent last year  - and by more stringent control of credit provision. The bank, whose activities are divided equally between commercial and investment banking, managed to hold its risk provisions at FFr1.15bn, which is roughly the same level as in the previous year, 'despite the deteriorating economic situation', said Mr Pebereau. In 1990, CCF was forced to implement a steep increase in provisions for customers' defaults, although it did manage to shrink its country risk provisions.</p>

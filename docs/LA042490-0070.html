			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GRACIELA ITURBIDE PHOTOGRAPHS KEEP A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE  </P> <P> The most striking of Graciela Iturbide's photographs are the oddball ones, in  which peculiar details of dress or stylized gestures take center stage,  enveloped by the rich blacks of the silver gelatin print.  </P> <P> Like the shot of child from Juchitan, Oaxaca, with a comb casually stuck on the  back of her long wet hair like a festive ornament. Or the image of a stately  man in a long flowered dress who holds a small mirror reflecting the other side  of his sexually ambivalent face. Or the tight closeup of impassive young women  from East Los Angeles in their skimpy white tops who demonstrate the sign  language of their gang.  </P> <P> Yet a survey at the Cal State Long Beach Art Museum of Iturbide's work from the  past 17 years (to June 1) ultimately displays the photographer's old-fashioned  decorum and aesthetic sensibility. Born into an upper-middle-class home in  Mexico City in 1942, Iturbide ventures into the worlds of her subjects with a  pilgrim's devout fascination and an aesthete's concern for niceties of  composition and lighting.  </P> <P> Her lens doesn't pry; it ennobles and sympathizes. Even the curious or  outlandish sitter is viewed from a respectful distance and set within a  carefully stage-managed composition alive with subtle gradations of blacks and  grays. A former student and assistant of Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Iturbide comes  honestly by her interest in the ritual aspects of everyday life in rural Mexico  and her penchant for isolating single figures against swaths of empty sky or  cracked and splattered old walls.  </P> <P> Death and festivity appear to be the two constants of Iturbide's sitters,  mostly small town folk from various regions. The proud, fleshy middle-aged  women who sell food, swig beer or clasp each other in friendship wither into  crones and anguished mourners. Even the children have a memento mori aura about  them. Unsmiling, often seen in fiesta costume as virgins or angels, these  little girls are reminiscent of the grave fancy-dress subjects of  literary-minded Victorian photographers.  </P> <P> Typically, Iturbide stands at a respectful remove to photograph a Juchitec  teen-aged bride-to-be lying under a sheet with scattered flowers and splattered  chicken blood after a ritual sexual assault by her fiance. Darkness seeps in on  all sides, isolating the girl in a victim's cage of fear and loneliness. In  select images like this one, tact, sympathy and finely calibrated lighting give  a "documentary" scene a symbolic charge and quietly feminist perspective.  </P> <P> Gormley's Vision: British artist Antony Gormley is best known for life-sized,  lead-covered plaster figures that stand, sit or recline alone or in coolly  conjoined pairs. Seams demarcate these smoothly generalized bodies into  strictly symmetrical portions, calling attention to the "piece of work" that is  man -- the rational, twinned nature of body parts as well as the human duality  of spirit and matter. Although the "skins" of these figures are mapped  territories, their interior lives remain aloof and unknowable.  </P> <P> The 12 ink drawings in Gormley's "Bearing Light" series represent an extreme  reduction and condensation of his sculptural concerns, including his recent  treatment of man-as-architecture in a concrete "room" with tiny orifices sited  on the Australian desert and the hooded heads of pairs of figures commissioned  for the political battleground of Londonderry in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> In the drawings, simple black silhouettes evoke various sights: the bulk of a  head, shoulders and upper torso; a slim, tall archway; narrowed eyes; a head on  its side with oddly truncated ears. An infant on its stomach, like a specimen  frog, is a study in doubles: curled fists, ears, knees, halved rump. A  post-and-lintel arrangement can be read as a the lower half of a human figure.  Intersecting black discs suggest the monocular vision of someone peering down a  gun sight.  </P> <P> Seen as a group, the images -- which also include an irregular, slightly  chewed-looking cross -- might be an elliptical shorthand for the watchers and  the watched, the victims and the perpetrators in Britain's long-standing civil  war. Yet Gormley's overriding vision extends beyond any specific state of  events to the underlying dichotomies and betrayals of mind and body.  </P> <P> Burnett Miller Gallery, 969 N. La Brea Ave., to May 12.  </P> <P> Jiri Goes to Sea: During the past decade, Czech-born Jiri Georg Dokoupil has  moved from one international capital to another while picking up and discarding  various approaches to art. He made flashily dislocated Neo-Expressionist  paintings, assembled a goofy series of sculptures out of the names of corporate  entities, turned out faux-naive, antic drawings of children.  </P> <P> His latest enterprise, "Marina," offers a deadpan twist on traditional  seascapes and Impressionist harbor images. His models are banal images cut out  of boating magazines and projected on a screen. Suspending a gessoed canvas  horizontally from the ceiling, he copies the image with soot from a burning  candle. The soft black rings create a kind of exaggerated pointillist effect.  Ocean liners, yachts, tiny human figures, churning water, humps of land -- all  are reduced to the same insubstantial, loopy black script.  </P> <P> Reducing images of the world to black smudges on a white ground has its  parallels in photography (and its precursors in blurry, photo-like paintings by  Gerhard Richter). But Dokoupil takes the idea a step further. His process  translates the notion of the painter's personal "touch" into a mere  will-o'-the-wisp -- or a soiled byproduct of the light of reason -- that is  ready to be blown off the canvas by the next strong wind of a new art movement.  </P> <P> In fact, a fixative is applied to these canvas in deference to potential  buyers' worries about permanence. So much for the purity of an idea. Dokoupil  has used the soot technique before, in a series of media-derived images of  gilt-edged art auctions. His dust-to-dust look at art production ultimately  seems better suited to events that equate art with monstrous sums of money.  </P> <P> Stuart Regen Gallery, 619 N. Almont, to May 26.  </P> <P> Art as Product: "Frontier Tales" at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (to  May 20) is steeped in the wishful belief that somewhere, somehow, there are  artists creating interesting stuff in ultra-commercial, unschooled or  ultra-private formats. It isn't too surprising to discover that the "finds" on  view are pretty lame. The commercial product (Clive Barker's "Pinhead" doll,  film poster, etc.) seems undistinguishable from than zillions of other such  cult-consumer items. The rag-tag homemade work is longwinded and tedious at  worst, cute at best (Russell Crotty's wall of tiny surfer images that read as a  huge abstract design from afar.)  </P> <P> And yet a deliciously batty portion of an installation by Joan Mahony does make  a case for art that's part window-dressing, part scavenger hunt.  </P></p>

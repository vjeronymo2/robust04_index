			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUNDAY SILENCE DRAWS NO. 4 POST POSITION FOR HOLLYWOOD CUP  </P> <P> Horse of the Year Sunday Silence and Criminal Type, racing's current  giant-killer, head a field of seven entered to for Sunday's $1-million  Hollywood Gold Cup.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence, who will carry high weight of 126 pounds and be ridden by  Patrick Valenzuela, drew the No. 4 post position. Ruhlmann, who will tote 124  pounds and jockey Gary Stevens, will be alongside in No. 5.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic last  year before undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery in November, returned to the  races at Inglewood June 3 when winning the $300,000 Californian by  three-quarters length over Stylish Winner.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence concluded his preparations for the 1 1/4- mile Gold Cup's 51st  renewal with a handy five-furlong work in :58.1 on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Perfect," said trainer Charlie Whittingham. "He's in good shape for Sunday's  race."  </P> <P> The winner of over $4.5 million last year, Sunday Silence will race coupled  with stablemate Ruhlmann, who won the Santa Anita Handicap in March while  leading the entire 1 1/4 miles. Hollywood Park linemaker Russell Hudak has  installed the Whittingham-trained entry as the 4-5 favorite to capture first  prize money of $550,000.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence and Criminal Type will be confronted by the hottest horse in the  country, Criminal Type. The Calumet Farm five-year-old upset Easy Goer and  Housebuster in Belmont Park's Metropolitan Mile on May 28. One race previous,  the D. Wayne Lukas-trainee upset Ruhlmann by a neck in the $1-million Pimlico  Special.  </P> <P> Criminal Type, a winner of $66,800 last year, already has earned close to $1.8  million in 1990.  </P> <P> He will be ridden by Jose Santos, who became Criminal Type's jockey prior to  the Pimlico Special, and has been assigned 121 pounds. The son of Alydar will  be 2-1 on the morning line.  </P> <P> Linesmaker Hudak made Opening Verse, 119 pounds and jockey Angel Cordero Jr.,  the field's third choice at 4-1. Opening Verse has been freshened since running  fifth in the Pimlico Special as the 3-2 betting favorite.  </P> <P> " got beat 3 1/2 lengths and never really ran his race," commented trainer  Richard Lundy. "He needed a little break, and I think he comes into the race a  fresh horse. He's been training real well, and there's no reason to believe he  can't win."  </P> <P> The complete field, in post position order, for the 51st Hollywood Gold Cup,  which will be run at approximately 5:20 PDT:  </P> <P> Stylish Winner (Corey Black) 113, 15-1; Criminal Type (Jose Santos) 121, 2-1;  Santangelo (Julio Garcia) 110, 30-1; a-Sunday Silence (Patrick Valenzuela) 126,  4-5; a-Ruhlmann (Gary Stevens) 124, 4-5; Mi Selecto (Jerry Bailey) 114, 15-1;  Opening Verse (Angel Cordero Jr.) 119.  </P></p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Society resumes pension transfers Yorkshire Building Society, the 12th-largest society in the UK, is re-entering the pension transfers market with a service offering customers independent actuarial advice, Alison Smith writes. The service, which will be available from the end of this month, comes against a background of widespread failure across the financial services industry to comply with regulatory requirements in cases where people transferred savings out of occupational pensions schemes into private plans. A study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, found that regulatory guidelines were breached in nine out of 10 pension transfer cases. Yorkshire's service will link the society with Buck Consultants, an independent firm of actuaries. Under the arrangement, Yorkshire will make the initial contact with a customer and will then take him or her through a questionnaire. For a flat fee of Pounds 75, Buck will then assess the benefits from the occupational scheme and the investment returns required for higher benefits. It will then prepare an actuarial report to go to both customer and building society. This will include a statement recommending whether the customer should take the transfer value or not. If the advice is to transfer out of the scheme into a personal plan, Yorkshire, which is one of the few larger societies to act as an independent financial adviser, would hope to advise the customer. Buck said its usual fee for a similar service would be about Pounds 150.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: The dangers of the personal pension  -Debbie Harrison looks at what the salesmen have not been telling you Up to 400,000 people may have been affected by mis-selling of personal pensions, according to a study commissioned by the Securities and Investment Board, the financial regulator. Personal pensions were designed for employees who had no pension provision, not as an alternative to good occupational schemes. Unfortunately the large lump sums associated with transfers from company schemes have proved a prime target for commission-hungry salesmen. New rules preventing further mis-selling of personal pensions are not yet in force so it is essential to understand why you are normally better off in your employer's scheme. The majority of company schemes in the UK link the value of the pension to the employee's salary at retirement. This gives scheme members a guarantee against inflation since wages outstrip prices over the long term. The employer, who sponsors the scheme, is under a legal obligation to provide the promised pension even if it means topping up the pension fund. Most schemes provide a limited inflation link for the pension itself and 'deferred' pensions - the benefits left behind by scheme members when they change jobs. Public sector schemes offer full index linking of pensions and also participate in the 'transfer club' which allows employees to change jobs within the public sector and receive like-for-like benefits. Most company schemes also provide death and disability benefits. In spite of these attractions, many thousands of employees, including public sector workers, have been persuaded to transfer their occupational pension benefits to personal pensions. They have paid dearly for their ignorance. Personal pensions do not offer the guarantees and protections available under a good final salary scheme. The product simply builds a fund which is used to buy an annuity which pays the retirement income. There is no guaranteed annuity value and no recompense if poor investment returns result in an inadequate pension. The risk is entirely with the individual. Moreover, under a personal pension the employee foots the bill for the expensive death and disability insurances and is likely to lose the valuable company contributions since most employers will not pay into a personal pension if they operate a group scheme. The most likely time to a transfer is on change of job. If you have been a member of the company pension scheme for more than two years you will not be allowed to take a cash refund of contributions but will have three options: to leave your money where it is, to take it with you to the new employer's scheme, or to transfer it to a personal pension. The first, and often most sensible choice, is to leave your money in the former company's scheme as a deferred pension where it will remain until you retire. Deferred pensions can be attractive, particularly where good annual increases are paid. Since January 1991, schemes have been required by law to increase the whole of the deferred pension by price inflation, up to a maximum of 5 per cent, and some schemes are more generous. Second, it may be appropriate to transfer your pension into the new employer's scheme. Such transfers are complex and you will need professional help to determine whether this provides better value. The newly redundant should leave their pension with the previous employer until they have a new job, so they can examine this option before looking at personal pensions. Only when the company schemes have been examined should you consider a transfer to a personal pensions or a buy-out bond. Buy-out bonds are similar to personal pensions but offer limited guarantees and, in some cases, a higher proportion of the fund can be taken as tax-free cash. If you would like to find out whether a personal pension or buy-out is appropriate, it is vital to obtain independent advice from a pensions specialist. This should be arranged on a fee basis so that the adviser's remuneration is not dependent on a sale. The adviser's examination should cover the following points: Full details of the individual's benefits under the previous employer's scheme, including whether any additional voluntary contributions payments (AVCs) were paid and any penalty on transfer. Benefits benefits offered under the new employer's scheme. What the transfer value would be worth in the new scheme. This often appears to be less than in the old scheme for a variety of reasons. A full 'fact find' on the individual, including career prospects, attitude to risk and family insurance. Brian Hurl, of Lexis Pension consultants, says: 'Only when all this information is collated, can the adviser calculate the rate of investment growth required by the personal pension transfer to match the benefits of the previous or new employer's schemes.' The adviser must ensure that any quotation from a life office mirrors the benefit structure of the previous scheme. For example, if the scheme offers 5 per cent inflation proofing and widow's and childrens' pensions, the personal pension quotation must do so. If these are excluded, the life office will project a much higher pension. Finally, if the decision is made to transfer to a personal pension or buy-out bond, the adviser should conduct an analysis of the provider's investment performance and charges. It is important that the plan is free of early withdrawal penalties so you can move your fund if the provider's performance is poor.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RKX: "Kok Does Not Expect Second Attempt To </F> Form `Purple' Government To Be Successful"]    [Text] The Hague, 27 Jun (ANP/BELGA) -- Wim Kok, the leader  of the Netherlands Social Democratic Party PvdA [Labor Party],  does not see how another fresh attempt to achieve a "purple"  coalition composed of the PvdA, the VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] could yet prove  successful this time around. "The `purple' adventure has been a  failure," Kok said at a news conference.    Kok said "he had made a great effort to see whether or not  any solutions were still conceivable" following the extra  package of demands tabled by VVD leader Bolkestein last weekend,  who complained at further cuts on government expenditure and  proposed further cuts in social security instead. According to  Kok, however, it had not yet proven possible to reach agreement.  Kok concluded that the investment in a "purple" coalition after  seven weeks of negotiations had gone awry. The PvdA leader  described as "strange" the VVD's complaints about cuts on the  state budget, in view of the fact that in recent years, the VVD  had always been the party to say that further cuts could surely  be made.    On Tuesday [28 June], the PvdA will fix its standpoint. The  main conclusion will be that new negotiations will have to focus  on a government combining the PvdA, the CDA [Christian  Democratic Appeal], and D66.</p>

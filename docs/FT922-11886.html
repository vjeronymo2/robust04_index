			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Struggling Zenith slips deeper into red ZENITH Electronics, the struggling US television manufacturer, suffered a loss of Dollars 28.6m, or 98 cents per share for the first quarter. This compares with a loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 85 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The company said the poor results reflected lower colour television sales and prices, compared with those of last year and continuing recessionary conditions for its other electronic products. Television sales were affected by price cuts by competitors, causing Zenith to slash its prices, and inventory decreases by several national retailers. First-quarter results were also affected by launch costs for the company's new larger screen and higher resolution video monitors. Mr Jerry Pearlman, Zenith chairman, said the second quarter was expected to continue to be difficult because of the slow US economic recovery. He added that benefits from the company's cost reduction programmes were not expected to be felt until the second half of the year. The company's fortunes appear in the longer run to hang on the success of its Digital Spectrum Compatible HDTV system, developed with AT&amp;T. Testing of the system began in March and is expected to be completed in May. The US Federal Communications Commission plans to adopt a new digital broadcast system for HDTV in 1993.</p>

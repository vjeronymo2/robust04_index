			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> REGIONAL PARK PLAN NEEDS PUBLIC'S INPUT  </P> <P> A special meeting to select an advisory committee and begin planning for a new  114-acre regional park in Upper Newport Bay will be held tonight at the Newport  Dunes Clubhouse.  </P> <P> Most of the land for the proposed Upper Newport Bay Regional Park was acquired  last summer by the county from the Irvine Co. in exchange for approval of  nearby residential and commercial developments in the 1980s.  </P> <P> The county park will not include any wetlands, which are managed by the state  Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> County officials plan to build a nature interpretive center at the park as well  as expand the existing system of hiking trails.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to maintain and enhance existing areas and add passive  recreational uses," said Denton Turner, design manager for the county's  regional parks. "What the committee will help us determine is what recreational  uses are appropriate, where they are appropriate and at what level or intensity  of use."  </P> <P> County planners are seeking applicants to serve on a special advisory panel  that will help shape development of the proposed park. Those interested can  apply at tonight's 7 p.m. meeting at the Newport Dunes Clubhouse, 1131 Back Bay  Drive in Newport Beach. STEVE CHURM  </P></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: The message of Mellor - Radio IT WAS hard luck on Brian Hayes, presenter of Radio 2's monthly scrutiny of current affairs, Hayes over Britain, that the month's topic was Newspapers, for the previous week Radio 4 had embarked on a four-part series, The Message and the Media, on the same subject. Still, there was the David Mellor case to hang arguments on. Half an hour or so was given to a broad survey of the Press, comparing newspaper errors and newspaper ethics. Then the experts were called in, Clive Soley, MP, who is to present a Private Bill on the Press, and Stewart Steven, the new editor of the Evening Standard, to instruct us - for the programme is basically a phone-in. Phone-ins in broadcasting theory give each individual listener the feeling that he or she might join in the broadcast if they wanted to. The weakness lies in the questions, which are put by people interested but not informed in their subjects, so there were sundry personal complaints, and affirmations of private beliefs. Soley and Steven provided appropriate comfort, or on general questions agreed that there were wicked as well as good reporters, who should be sacked. A friendly programme, but I doubt if listeners came away with many new ideas about the Press. Exactly where jazz belongs is hard to say. Not on the dance-floor, alas. Radio 3 has always given it some time, so has Radio 2, more acceptably to me, as Humphrey Lyttelton has much the same preferences as I have. Radio 3 regards jazz as intellectual, and its new eight-week series Bright as Fire (Tuesdays, repeated Thursdays) deals with Mike Westbrook as if he were a classical composer. In the first programme, much of the music we heard represented Westbrook's musical influences - Ellington, Mulligan, Lyttelton - but what we heard of his own, two extracts from Celebration, hardly showed their effects; indeed were hardly jazz at all as I see it. Perhaps later on we shall hear more of what he wrote when he was younger, for college gigs and Ronnie Scott's, which should be less self-conscious. What if . . ? (Radio 4, Tuesdays) envisages the results of possible events that might but did not happen. This week, the legalisation of cannabis was discussed by Griffith Edwards of the National Addiction Centre and Anthony Henman of the International Anti-Prohibition League. Professor Edwards made the strongest point at once, that marketing and sponsorship would take over, pot would be advertised as cigarettes are. Henman suggested that in time pot would be used less, and in ways other than smoking. We then veered into talk of hard drugs, something presenter Christopher Andrew ought to have checked. For half an hour on Saturday evenings (repeated on Mondays), Radio 1 gives Songlines - not about Australian aborigines but a modern equivalent of old-time music-hall. A bunch of entertainers over a studio audience give unrestrained comic song and comic chat in the intimate style of Collins's or the Metropolitan in the Edgware Road. Half an hour at a time is about right, and I enjoyed what I heard. Stanza (Tuesdays, 11 pm) is like a Radio 4 Songlines, a group of poets under presenter Andrew McAllister reading poetry and talking informally about stuff such as sprung rhythm. I am afraid people who say that Sir John Gielgud reads Shakespeare in 'a clapped-out elocutionary voice' are not for me. For duty's sake, I have heard some of the Olympics on Radio 5, where commentators and athletes all know one another by their Christian names. I have to say that, much as I hope we (not they) will win gold medals, I find the personal ambition of the competitors distasteful, and the principles of what we used to call 'sportsmanship' only modestly observed.</p>

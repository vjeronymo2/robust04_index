He added that the 16-nation alliance was ready to  meet any UN request to help break the siege of the Bosnian towns  of Tuzla and Srebrenica.    Serb forces around Tuzla have prevented the re-opening of an  airport there which is needed for UN aid operations. They have  also hindered the relief of Canadian troops trapped at  Srebrenica.    The spokesman said: "We have provided our plans for close  air  support (of UN troops under attack) and air strikes to the UN  and we have offered to send a team to UNPROFOR (UN Protection  Force) headquarters in Zagreb."    Speaking after a regular meeting of NATO ambassadors, he  added: "We are ready to help the United Nations with its  planning for the re-opening of Tuzla airport and the relief of  the UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica." [passage omitted]    NATO sources said the UN's special representative in  ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, would submit proposed plans for  military intervention, including bombing, to the world body in  New York on Friday.

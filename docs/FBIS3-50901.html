For that reason, I have an  open telephone line with the delegation, because I am directly  responsible for the peace process," President Ramiro De Leon  Carpio said in San Gaspar Chajul at the end of the inauguration  of various projects and the presentation of a contribution to  the Chajul Val Bak Cuyol Association.    "For the past seven months this responsibility was delegated  to Hector Rosada, and I maintained direct participation. Now I  will be responsible for the agreements that -- God willing --  will lead to the signing of a comprehensive social and economic  peace," he added.    De Leon Carpio said that this was his first statement on the  topic of talks with the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity]. He also said the governmental delegation in Mexico has  a specific mission: to establish contacts for a future dialogue.    "We hope the established objective will be achieved; in  other  words, the establishment of the procedures and mechanisms for a  future dialogue. They will not undertake an in-depth analysis  of a specific topic or of the peace plan that the government has  begun with the national reconciliation," he said.</p>

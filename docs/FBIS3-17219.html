Armenia would like to finish the recovery by the end of  1994,  but it is premature to talk about deadlines at present, because  the experts have yet to estimate the work to be done and  determine what additional equipment should be brought to the  plant. According to the deputy minister, it is impossible at the  moment to estimate how much it will cost to resume operations at  the plant in accordance with the relevant Russo-Armenian  agreement, which Oleg Soskovets, Russian first vice-premier, and  Grant Bagratyan, Armenian prime minister, signed on March 17.</p>

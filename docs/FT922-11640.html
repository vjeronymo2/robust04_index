			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Banque Worms problems depress UAP profit UNION des Assurances de Paris, the largest player in French insurance, saw its net profits fall by 10.7 per cent from FFr4.22bn in 1990 to FFr3.77bn (Dollars 671m) in 1991 mainly because of the problems of Banque Worms, one of its banking interests. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, described 1991 as a 'difficult year' in which UAP, which is in negotiations with the Suez industrial group over its minority holding in the Victoire insurance company, was beset by the slowdown in the European insurance market, particularly in France and Italy, although it fared well in the UK and Belgium. UAP, a state-controlled company, is the latest of the large French insurers to have announced a reduction in profits for 1991. On Thursday Axa disclosed a more dramatic 28 per cent fall in net profits to FFr2.4bn. Victoire last week announced a more modest decline of 1.7 per cent to FFr1.8bn. Mr Peyrelevade refused to comment on the progress of UAP's discussions with Suez over the Victoire stake, despite speculation in the French press that an agreement is imminent. UAP wants to exchange a large part of its 34 per cent stake in Victoire for 50 per cent of Colonia, the German insurance company controlled by Victoire. The deal would enable UAP to fulfil a long standing ambition of expanding in the vast German insurance market. Mr Peyrelevade said that, Germany apart, UAP did not intend to further expand its international interests in the foreseeable future. Despite a decline in earnings per share from FFr50.2 to FFr44.8, the board proposed to hold the dividend at FFr11.</p>

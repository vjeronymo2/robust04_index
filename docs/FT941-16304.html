			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Horrendous' cost of proposed local government structure Sir, To most of us in business it is self-evident that having larger unitary local authorities will make our lives easier, be less expensive, and, with good management, provide better local services. It is not surprising, therefore, that in Cleveland the Confederation of British Industry, the Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Teesside Small Business Club all concluded that they would prefer two unitary authorities to replace the existing five rather than the four favoured by the Local Government Commission and Mr Phillip Yuill (Letters, January 4). From the business point of view local government reorganisation shows every sign of turning out to be a disaster. Between them the commission and the government are going to lumber us with a new local government system that is more expensive, less efficient and more divisive, and the bill is going to be horrendous. The commission estimates the transitional cost will be between Pounds 590m and Pounds 780m. On the experience of the 1973 local government reorganisation I shall be amazed if it is a penny less than Pounds 1bn and I believe Sir John Banham, the commission chairman, has mentioned a similar figure. Against the background of current public sector debt it is staggering that the government is prepared to incur this quite unnecessary financial burden and has specifically instructed the commission that it is not required to put forward the lowest cost solutions. On the question of Durham and Cleveland reorganisation I entirely refute Mr Yuill's suggestion that we, Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Teesside Small Business Club, do not speak for local business. He also misinterprets the views of the training and enterprise council and Teesside Development Corporation. Our membership, which has been consulted at meetings and through surveys over many months, includes virtually every significant employer in the area and a vast range of professional practices and smaller businesses. Not surprisingly, they view the prospect of substantially increased costs and four local authorities rather than two with considerable foreboding. Ian Wrigglesworth, chairman, Confederation of British Industry Northern Region, 15 Grey Street, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 6EE</p>

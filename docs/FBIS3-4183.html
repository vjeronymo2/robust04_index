			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hwang Pyong-tae, Republic of Korea ambassador to the </F> PRC: "Sino-ROK Relations Head Towards a Bright and Glorious  Future"]    [Text] The establishment of diplomatic relations between  the Republic of Korea and the Peoples Republic of China on  August 25 1992, was a historical breakthrough in the Northeast  Asian region. The two countries have eliminated the legacies of  the past mischievous history during the last 40 years of the  Cold War confrontation, and are moving ahead hand in hand,  building a solid basis upon which bilateral friendship and  cooperation are further strengthened and multilateral peace and  prosperity are promoted. It was under these sets of  relationships where active, co-operative exchanges in various  areas between the two countries has grown by leaps and bounds.  In 1993, the trade volume between the two countries reached  $8.2 billion, marking a 52 percent increase from the previous  year, and the accumulated approved amount of ROK investment to  the PRC has been doubled each year since 1990, reaching $1  billion. The same phenomenal exchange took place in cultural as  well as academic fields .    However, our times demand us to do more than what we have  achieved so far. Both countries have to look forward to the  coming age of the 21st century and Asia-Pacific cooperation.  Both countries find themselves at a historical juncture calling  for not merely promoting horizontal cooperation, but also  developing a vertical structure of co-operation upon which the  two countries build a basis for Northeast Asian regional  cooperation conducive to the Asia-Pacific age of cooperation in  the 21st century.    The visit of President Kim Yong-sam to the People's Republic  of China is well-timed to witness and review the ongoing flows  of cooperation the two countries are now pursuing, and consider  and design the future scheme of joint undertakings the two  countries will pursue in furtherance of the common interest and  engagement for a better two-way Sino-ROK relationship and  expanded East and Asian Pacific multiway co-operation.    The visit will provide an excellent occasion for the people  and business communities of both sides to recognize the  sentiment of peace and stability prevailing between the two  countries and among this region. The two countries are destined  to share fate of partnership in promoting prosperity of people  and the peace of nations between ROK and China and among the  East and Asia Pacific countries.    I sincerely wish the visit and stay here of President Kim is  most successful and enjoyable and his meeting and dialogue with  the leader and the people of the People's Republic of China most  fruitful and rewarding.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Tories prepare for internal warfare - Europe likely to dominate party conference in Brighton THE British Conservative party could be engaged in open warfare over its approach to Europe almost as soon as its annual party conference opens in Brighton next Tuesday. A series of meetings on the fringe of the conference offer the prospect of public divisions between senior ministers and party rebels. Almost every shade of attitude towards Europe will be voiced in occasions ranging from a discussion of 'the sufferings of a dependent economy in the exchange rate mechanism' to a meeting of the European People's party. The greatest sensitivity is likely to attach to Wednesday's meetings. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will address a lunchtime fringe meeting on 'current challenges' in British foreign policy, and later the same day Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, delivers the Conservative Political Centre lecture, entitled 'Europe - a community not a superstate'. Ministers are anxious to avoid the jarring that occurred last weekend, when Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was interviewed about the government's approach to Europe at almost the same time as Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, was describing the policy in a somewhat different tone. Party managers are also nervous about the prospect of Lady Thatcher's presence, knowing that she could give a unique boost to the Eurosceptics. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, met the former prime minister yesterday to agree the arrangements. On the other side of the argument, Sir Leon Brittan, an EC commissioner and former cabinet minister, will speak at two meetings on Thursday about the Community after the Maastricht treaty. The leading Eurosceptic MPs and peers have already organised a relentless series of meetings. Lord Tebbit, a former cabinet minister, is to address the Selsdon group on Tuesday, Lord Ridley, another former cabinet minister, is to speak to a group called Conservative Youth against European Federalism on Thursday, and Mr Michael Spicer, a leading Eurosceptic MP is at fringe meetings almost every day. Eurosceptics may also have high hopes of the address on 'Toryism post-Thatcher' to be given to the Young Conservatives by Mr Kenneth Baker, former home secretary who has become a heavyweight critic of policy on Europe.</p>

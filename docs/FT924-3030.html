			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Regulator poised to approve power industry's dash for gas PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will today give the all-clear to the power generation industry's 'dash for gas' which is blamed for reducing demand for coal. After a two-month investigation, Prof Littlechild has concluded that power from gas-fired stations is not uneconomic, and that it conforms to present price controls. 'My review does not so far suggest that regional electricity companies have breached their economic purchasing licence conditions,' he says in a report to be published today. His findings, which are still preliminary, will have a powerful influence on the review of energy policy being conducted by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the wake of the crisis over pit closures. His overall conclusion will make it hard for Mr Heseltine to blame gas for the coal industry's problems. It also weakens the case for calling a halt to the construction of further gas-fired power stations, many of which he has already approved. But Prof Littlechild's report will also provoke a strong challenge from the coal lobby which claims to have evidence that gas is costlier than coal. Prof Littlechild's main findings are: The contracts which the regional electricity companies have signed with gas stations 'appear to compare well with other contracts available'. The contracts have added diversity to the regional electricity companies' sources of supply. They are also less vulnerable to environmental regulation because of the low emissions from gas stations. Regional companies 'looked to the future, actively seeking the most economic and competitive sources of supply from new generators as well as existing licensees'. Prof Littlechild also casts doubt on claims by the coal lobby that coal-fired plant can produce electricity for as little as 2p per unit, compared with more than 3p for gas-fired power. 'I do not think it is realistic to expect such prices,' he says. He stresses that his report is incomplete. He will announce further conclusions on January 31. The dash for gas resulted from the lifting of an EC ban on the use of gas for power generation. Over the past two years, more than two dozen gas projects have been announced, the first of which are now starting up. If they are all completed, they could displace as much as 30m tons of coal a year. Gas power stations fire up coal conundrum, Page 10</p>

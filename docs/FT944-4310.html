			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / EU nearer accord on data protection rules The European Union yesterday took a big step towards adoption of EU-wide data protection rules. Ministers believe they are vital for the development of revolutionary services on the information superhighway. Ministers meeting in Brussels agreed that plans to harmonise rules protecting personal information would be adopted by the year's end, provided a final text was agreed. The decision overrode strong objections from Britain, which believes that legislation is unnecessary and that the Brussels plans will impose heavy costs on the private sector. However, with all other member states backing the initiative, the UK (which has minimal data protection laws) will almost certainly have to take the measures on board. The Commission said the proposals were essential to speed cross-border provision of financial and other services which are hindered by differing data protection regimes. Further, the development of new electronic highways will make it much easier for EU consumers to choose mortgages, life insurance and other services from outside their home country. Brussels says this will not be possible without a single regime. The plan gives countries 12 years to introduce rules covering information stored on paper rather than on computers. Also, data protection will only be applied retrospectively to manually held data where people actually require access to the information. At yesterday's meeting ministers also discussed progress in the single market. Tables produced by Brussels showed Greece and Germany with the worst records for adopting outstanding measures deemed crucial for the free flow of goods, services and capital. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, reacted sensitively to suggestions that Bonn was dragging its feet, saying much legislation had not been adopted for technical reasons. Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single market, said 1994 had been a disappointing year for the single market, with a lack of political commitment from member states. Greece, which has only implemented 77.9 per cent of the single market legislation is the worst offender. Of 217 measures, it has made no progress on 43. This compares with Denmark - the champion - which has only eight outstanding. The second slowest country is Germany, which has made no progress on 26 directives, followed by Ireland with 24. France is the second most efficient, followed by Britain, which has still not adopted 14 bits of legislation.</p>

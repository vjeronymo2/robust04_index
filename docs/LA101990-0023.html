			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SMOKING SCIENTIST DROPPED FROM EPA PANEL;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE UC SAN DIEGO PROFESSOR HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON CIGARETTE PERILS. THE  TOBACCO INSTITUTE AND A VIRGINIA CONGRESSMAN URGED THAT HE BE REMOVED.  </P> <P> At the urging of the Tobacco Institute and a Virginia congressman, a nationally  acclaimed scientist from UC San Diego has been removed from an Environmental  Protection Agency panel reviewing the effects of secondhand cigarette smoke.  </P> <P> The scientist, Dr. David M. Burns, an associate clinical professor of medicine  and a pulmonary specialist at UC San Diego Medical Center, has a been outspoken  about the perils of smoking.  </P> <P> "I've never seen anything like this," said Steven Bayard, manager of the EPA  project to assess the health risks of passive smoking.  </P> <P> "I'm disturbed about this," Bayard said Thursday. "I think it shows undue  pressure, personally, from the tobacco companies and the Congress."  </P> <P> Dr. Donald Barnes, head of the EPA's Scientific Advisory Board, maintained that  there was no undue pressure to remove Burns, who was praised by EPA staffers  and others.  </P> <P> Burns said he believes the tobacco industry is frightened about the quality of  the two scientific reports on secondhand smoke that the panel was asked to  review. The EPA reports, which analyze the effects of passive cigarette smoke  on adults, children and people in the workplace, are scientifically solid,  Burns said.  </P> <P> Since the late 1970s, Burns, 43, has served as a senior editor and reviewer of  the surgeon general's smoking reports. Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett  Koop presented Burns the prestigious Surgeon General's Medallion.  </P> <P> Burns' fervent anti-smoking views and citing of scientific evidence have made  him enemies in the tobacco industry.  </P> <P> Burns said he was asked by the EPA to serve on the panel in July, a fact  confirmed in an Aug. 10 letter from the agency asking him to analyze the  reports.  </P> <P> Barnes, a former EPA staff scientist, told both Burns and The Times that while  Burns has not technically been removed from the panel -- because the group does  not yet officially exist -- the scientist will not serve on the committee.  </P> <P> Barnes acknowledged that tobacco industry representatives came to see him two  or three times to object to Burns.  </P> <P> Brennan Dawson, a Tobacco Institute spokeswoman, told the Associated Press: "We  want a fair panel that will look at it objectively. Our concern is that Mr.  Burns is unable to do that."  </P> <P> On Sept. 18, Rep. Thomas Bliley (D-Va.) wrote the EPA without mentioning Burns  by name but urging that the panel "consist of qualified individuals who have  not already prejudged this issue in any manner."  </P> <P> Bliley is a strong tobacco industry ally. Philip Morris, a major cigarette  manufacturer, is the largest private employer in his congressional district.  </P> <P> Barnes said that while Burns is highly competent, there are two or three other  scientistswho had also worked on the surgeon general's reports who are equally  qualified but have not taken strong public positions against smoking.  </P> <P> Barnes said the EPA was looking for people who not only would be fair but would  also be perceived as being fair.  </P> <P> "I don't know of anyone else you could point to that would have the degree of  expertise (Burns) would possess on smoking in general and the whole issue of  passive smoking in particular," Donald Shopland, coordinator of the National  Cancer Institute's smoking control program and a long-time Burns colleague,  told the Associated Press.  </P> <P> The Associated Press and Times staff writer Rudy Abramson in Washington  contributed to this report.  </P></p>

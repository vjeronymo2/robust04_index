			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / People: Jeffrey joins Charterhouse Hoping that his experience proves the marketplace for economists in the City is still alive is Richard Jeffrey who, three months after being made redundant from one stock-broker, has just landed a top job with another. Jeffrey, 34, takes over next week as head of research at Charterhouse Tilney, a leading agency stockbroker; he previously held a similar position at Hoare Govett. Jeffrey, who lost his last job after the firm sacked large sections of its research team, says he spent his three months away from the City recharging his batteries and seeing more of his three children. He will take over a research team of 25. About a third of these are in London, where Jeffrey will be based, and the rest in Liverpool where Charterhouse Tilney has a strong regional presence. Jeffrey spent 10 years at Hoare Govett where he built up a reputation for independent thought on economic matters. He thinks Britain made a big mistake joining the European exchange rate mechanism and thinks the high interest rates and slump in house prices of the past year make the economic outlook for Britain extremely gloomy.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JUDGE DENIES BONE MARROW TESTS  </P> <P> A Cook County judge today denied for the second time a father's request to have  his 3 1/2-year-old twins tested as possible bone marrow donors for his dying  12-year-old son.  </P> <P> Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds said she cannot order the tests because the  twins, James and Allison Curran, would derive no physical benefit.  </P> <P> The twins' mother, Nancy Curran, opposes the tests, so their father, Tamas  Bosze, sued to force the twins to undergo testing in a bid to help his son,  Jean-Pierre, who is dying of leukemia.  </P> <P> Jean-Pierre has called the twins his last hope for survival, although now his  condition is too poor for a transplant to be performed.  </P> <P> Curran, whose relationship with Bosze ended when she was eight months pregnant,  objected to the procedure, saying she feared for the health and safety of her  children. Jean-Pierre is Bosze's son by another woman.  </P> <P> Reynolds' first ruled against the tests July 18 and Bosze won an emergency  appeal before the Supreme Court. The high court found the interests of the  three children had not been adequately represented independent of their  parents' interests and ordered guardians appointed and the case reheard.  </P></p>

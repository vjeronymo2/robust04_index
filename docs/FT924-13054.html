			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Tories urge Jubilee Line cash pledge LORD Wakeham, leader of the House of Lords, has urged the chairmen of Lloyds and Barclays to persuade Canary Wharf's 11 banks to make a no-strings cash contribution towards the cost of building the Jubilee Line extension on the Underground. The request is understood to be an important shift in the government's intentions towards the extension. Until now, bankers have feared that the government was happy for them to make an inadequate offer because it provided the Treasury with an excuse to cancel the project and save public expenditure. Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, and Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, were acting as representatives of Canary Wharf's 11 commercial banks in a meeting this week with Lord Wakeham, who is chairing a government committee on London's Docklands. Lord Wakeham indicated that if the banks made the no-strings offer, the line would probably be built. A government source said that money had been allocated for the Jubilee Line, conditional on the banks providing their share. The Bank of England is acting as a mediator between the government and the Canary Wharf banks. Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, has warned the government that, having invited the banks to make a new Jubilee offer, it must not subsequently dismiss any offer in a fashion which could appear cavalier. The Bank of England is concerned that any such rejection would damage the government's reputation in financial centres abroad. Bankers warned yesterday that the Jubilee extension to London's Docklands may yet be scrapped, since it will be difficult to persuade all 11 banks, nine of which are foreign, to make a no-strings offer. The banks have already offered Pounds 390m towards the Jubilee's Pounds 1.6bn costs. However, the first two pay-ments totalling Pounds 98m are conditional on the government moving civil servants to Canary Wharf. The Treasury is adamant that the funds should not be conditional on relocations or any form of government support. Canary Wharf's banks, which have lent Pounds 576m to the project, have to decide in the coming week whether they can make an unconditional offer.</p>

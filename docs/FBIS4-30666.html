			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand is considering arranging the "orderly  return" of Laotians who do not volunteer to return home.    "Laotians should go home on a voluntary basis," said  National  Security Council deputy secretary-general Khachatphai Burutphat,  "but some may not volunteer to go home and we may have to send  them back in an orderly return program as Hong Kong has done  with Vietnamese boat people."    Mr. Khachatphai's remarks, made at the end of a two-day  meeting which sought to speed up the repatriation of Laotians  still encamped in Thailand, referred to the bilateral agreement  between Hong Kong and Vietnam for the "orderly return" of boat  people with no prospects of resettlement in the West.    The meeting also drew senior officials from Laos and the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.    The UNHCR's Thailand representative, Ruprecht von Arnim,  said  both Thailand and Laos agreed the repatriation process could  continue for another year.    The agreement conforms with the Comprehensive Plan of Action  (CPA) which calls for solutions by the end of 1995 to the  problem of Vietnamese and Laotians still encamped in this region.    But Thailand still insists on closing its last camp for  Laotians at Ban Na Pa in Nakhon Phanom by the end of this year.    "We must emphasise the closure of the camp rather than the  extension of the repatriation period," said Mr. Khachatphai.    "There are many ways to persuade the remaining refugees to  return on a voluntary basis."    Thailand reportedly put the accent on the provision of  training as part of its proposal to accelerate the repatriation  process. The Thai proposal calls for returnees be put in a kind  of half-way house in Laos pending full reintegration into the  country.    The Laotian side led by Don Somvolachit of the Foreign  Ministry's Department of Europe and America Affairs, proposed  two new settlement sites for the returnees in the central  provinces of Khammouane and Bolikhamsai.    The UNHCR will inspect the sites and draw up a financial  plan  for the projects, said Mr. von Arnim.    As part of the effort to speed up repatriation, he said the  meeting discussed deterrents and incentives.    The UNHCR raised the possibility of halving the allowances  granted to returnees -- now set at 2,000 baht per person -- if  they return after 30 September. Laos said it would give those  arriving before that date carpentry tools and housing items.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPERATION RESCUE  </P> <P> "700 Abortion Foes Arrested at L.A. Clinic" scream the headline. All that  misguided energy and passion -- and for what? -- to deny women the right of  choice.  </P> <P> How many of these protesters have adopted an "unadoptable" child who was  unwanted or abused after birth; helped teach learning-disabled children in an  inner-city school who were born drug-dependent or have other problems that none  of us can begin to know; or even more to the heart of the problem, written or  lobbied Sacramento to protest the imminent closing of family planning and  health care clinics here in California due to budget cuts, cuts which, among  other consequences, will serve to increase the number of unwanted pregnancies?  </P> <P> Here in the United States we have the highest infant mortality rate of any  industrialized country. Are these protesters also working for better prenatal  health care and are they willing to pay for this care through higher taxes?  </P> <P> After the demonstrations are over, the protesters will leave Los Angeles and  return home, self-righteous and energized by their actions. Meanwhile, the  aftermath of their symbolic efforts, the unwanted children, children who should  be our nation's brightest hope, are left behind.  </P> <P> NATALIE ROESCH  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

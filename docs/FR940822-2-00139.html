			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Renewal Funding Procedures and Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Institute recognizes two types of renewal funding as described below_``continuation grants'' and ``on-going support grants.'' The award of an initial grant to support a project does not constitute a commitment by the Institute to renew funding. The Board of Directors anticipates allocating no more than $3 million of available FY 1995 grant funds for renewal grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Continuation Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose and Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Continuation grants are intended to support projects with a limited duration that involve the same type of activities as the previous project. They are intended to enhance the specific program or service produced or established during the prior grant period. They may be used, for example, when a project is divided into two or more sequential phases, for secondary analysis of data obtained in an Institute-supported research project, or for more extensive testing of an innovative technology, procedure, or program developed with SJI grant support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order for a project to be considered for continuation funding, the grantee must have completed the project tasks and met all grant requirements and conditions in a timely manner, absent extenuating circumstances or prior Institute approval of changes to the project design. Continuation grants are not intended to provide support for a project for which the grantee has underestimated the amount of time or funds needed to accomplish the project tasks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A continuation grant may be awarded for either a single project or for more than one project as a package grant (see sections III.J., V.C.1 and 3, and V.D.1 and 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking a continuation grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its intent to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less than 120 days before the end of the current grant period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. A letter of intent must be no more than 3 single-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper and must contain a concise but thorough explanation of the need for continuation; an estimate of the funds to be requested; and a brief description of anticipated changes in scope, focus or audience of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Letters of intent will not be reviewed competitively. Institute staff will review the proposed activities for the next project period and, within 30 days of receiving a letter of intent, inform the grantee of specific issues to be addressed in the continuation application and the date by which the application for a continuation grant must be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Application Format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application for a continuation grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation), a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative, a disclosure of lobbying form from (applicants other than units of State or local government), and certain certifications and assurances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of an application for a continuation grant should include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project Objectives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A clear, concise statement of what the continuation project is intended to accomplish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Need for Continuation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An explanation of why continuation of the project is necessary to achieve the goals of the project, and how the continuation will benefit the participating courts or the courts community generally. That is, to what extent will the original goals and objectives of the project be unful-filled if the project is not continued, and conversely, how will the findings or results of the project be enhanced by continuing the project?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A continuation application requesting a package grant to support more than one project should explain, in addition, how the proposed projects are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the advantages of funding the projects as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would accrue by considering or funding them separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

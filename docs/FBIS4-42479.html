			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EC Commission President Jacques Delors by </F> announcer Anne Sinclair; from the "Seven Out of Seven" program  -- live]    [Excerpts] [Sinclair] Good evening, Mr. Delors. [passage  omitted] Gianfranco Fini, head of the Italian neofascists, told  LA STAMPA yesterday: D-Day brought freedom back to Italy, and I  welcome it as a positive event, but was it not also the day when  Europe lost its cultural identity? How does Jacques Delors  react to such words?    [Delors] I was very angry when I read that. So far, I have  followed the usual rule and -- as president of the European  Commission -- I avoided commenting on what happens in Italy.  All the more so, because I think that if we comment beforehand,  we are likely to spoil the chances of those who want to limit  the possible resurgence of neofascism. But now we must not only  be very vigilant, we must be both vigilant and worried. He also  added that until 1938 -- when Mussolini passed the racist laws  -- fascism could not be considered as something negative. He  also added that there are moments when freedom is not the main  value. At this point, I got very worried. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Something else on Italy: You agree with the  criticisms and reservations expressed by Francois Mitterrand  rather than the good conduct report issued to Berlusconi by Bill  Clinton two days ago?    [Delors] Why did Bill Clinton do that? Because, according to  his analysis, he thinks that within the government coalition  there are people who can stop the rise of neofascism. This is  why he is giving his support to the coalition forces just a few  weeks after the elections. Maybe in many months' time he will  act differently. It will all depend on what those people will do  and say.    [Sinclair] [passage omitted] Jacques Delors, I would like  you  to watch with us the interview which Bill Clinton gave to TF1 --  I can see you getting your notes out -- to TF1 and "Seven Out of  Seven." This is the only French television station to which he  decided to speak before his trip to Europe. The interview,  which he gave me, took place in Washington, at the White House,  on Friday 27 May. [passage omitted; recording of interview with  President Clinton, who answers questions on U.S. policy on  Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti, and on relations with Russia, and  stresses desire for a strong Europe]    [Sinclair] Jacques Delors, I saw you listening very  carefully  and taking notes on the interview. We will look at several  points shortly. Regarding the last question: I am in agreement  with Francois Mitterrand, says Bill Clinton -- do you really  think America wishes to have a strong Europe, or is this  diplomatic language?    [Delors] I had doubts for years, but after my talks with  President Clinton I am certain that he wants a strong Europe.  Of course, the United States remains a top power. It is  difficult to carry out certain actions without it, but we have  come back to the thinking of those who wanted a strong Europe,  although one has to deserve it. Let me give you an example.    [Sinclair] You are saying that we have to deserve it?    [Delors] Yes, we have to deserve it. Let me give you an  example. There are 300,000 American soldiers in Europe. There  will be no more than 100,000 in 1995, or little more than that.  Are we in a position to form a European army, a pillar of the  Atlantic Alliance, at the service of the UN resolutions to  ensure that peace, the freedom and independence of peoples is  respected? This is the question which is put to us.    [Sinclair] And what is your reply, in your opinion are we  ready or not?    [Delors] We are not yet quite ready, but it is not by  rejecting what has already been accomplished in the construction  of Europe that we will make progress toward this objective.    [Sinclair] Russia might be present at the July G-7 meeting.  [passage omitted]    [Delors] I would personally include other countries in the  G-7.    [Sinclair] Which countries, for example?    [Delors] I think there should be an African country like  Nigeria; China, when it respects democratic rules, India and  Mexico. [passage omitted]. As for Russia, I think there is  quite a contrast between Russia the big political power and  Russia plagued by all its economic problems. But I think Russia  the great political power is now working for peace. [passage  omitted] On the other hand, I am very worried about the  economic situation.    [Sinclair] You are very worried about today's Russia. But  this renders its associate membership in the G-7 a rather  complicated matter, since the G-7 focuses on the economy.    [Delors] This is why in Naples we will discuss the economy  among ourselves and we will publish a document with the  forecasts concerning us. The day after, Yeltsin will come for  the political meeting. There is a difference between the  economic and political parts of the meeting.    [Sinclair] [passage omitted] A word about the countries of  East Europe, which are asking with increasing frequency to be  linked to Europe tomorrow and NATO perhaps sooner. We have seen  in Hungary that the voters voted for the communists. The  communists are back, they voted democratically for the  communists, and that is true. Will those linked in the long term  either to Europe or NATO not be adding political instability to  economic instability?    [Delors] Well, first of all, one has to know those  communists, and let us leave their past aside, and furthermore  some of them are very young, like the prime minister of Poland  -- and I have made a mistake, as he is from the Peasant Party,  but he governs with the communists.    [Sinclair] In Hungary we have seen some of these figures  returning.    [Delors] Yes, in Hungary, but they are extremely competent  men, but in order to join the European Union one has to fulfill  three conditions: First, to be a multiparty democracy; second,  to honor human rights as a whole; and third, to have an economy  which is not dwarfed, which will not be crushed by the more  efficient economies of the West. These conditions remain.  However, at the moment the biggest problem of the countries of  East Europe, apart from the economy -- although we are helping  them as well as we can -- the biggest problem is that of  security. These countries have the feeling of living in a lack  of security because the problems of minorities arise, border  questions have apparently not always been solved, and then there  is the contamination of the Bosnian affair, and, you see, I am  convinced that if the European Union did not exist then war  would already have spread throughout the Balkans, and this  should not be forgotten either. [passage omitted]    [Sinclair] Do you agree with Bill Clinton who is now saying  that the Bosnia arms embargo should not be lifted?    [Delors] Bill Clinton brilliantly explained to me in May  1993  why we should lift the embargo. I understand that he is now  embarrassed. But when today I hear what our negotiators are  saying -- David Owen in particular; he is there and has been  following the events for three years -- I fear that, given the  Serbs' potential strength, if we lifted the embargo this would  help the Bosnians and we would really have massacres. Maybe it  was our fault, although the French minister of foreign affairs  rightly recalled that we French have many troops deployed there  and that the European Union has given 60 percent of the  humanitarian aid, more than anybody else [sentence as heard].  We cannot forget that. In spite of all that, we must today  consider what the situation is.    [Sinclair] And what would happen if the Bosnia negotiations  failed?    [Delors] If the negotiations failed we should maybe consider  lifting the embargo. But I think that lifting the embargo means  that Western countries would inevitably have to intervene. We  must understand this. It is not possible to wage war by proxy.  If we gave weapons to the Bosnians and they were crushed....    [Sinclair, interrupting] They want weapons, not men.    [Delors] Yes, indeed. But if they were crushed, it would be  an even greater victory for ideology. I think that on the basis  of the peace plan put forward by the European Union -- it is not  perfect -- and things being what they are, we could have a peace  solution. Not a very stable one, it would be somewhat  precarious. But there is a condition: The ideology of ethnic  cleansing must never be approved and in Serbia they have  understood what this means. A peaceful Bosnia could cooperate  with and be helped by the Europeans. [passage omitted]</p>

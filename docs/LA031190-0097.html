			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDO Q &amp; A : LAW PERMITS BOARD TO LEVY ADDITIONAL FEES  </P> <P> QUESTION: I would like more information regarding your answer, "Associations  Entitled Legally to Raise Fees" (Feb. 11), about a community association  board's authority to raise assessments up to 20% per year.  </P> <P> I live in a condominium that passed an amendment to the declaration allowing  increases only with the approval of 60% of the members except for emergency  situations. Does the new law that you cited displace all previous provisions in  the association's documents? How can a board of directors stay informed about  changes in the law?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Yes, Section 1366 of the California Civil Code specifically states that  regardless of more restrictive limitations in an association's documents, the  board may increase regular assessments up to 20% of the previous year's  assessment.  </P> <P> The board may also impose a special assessment that does not exceed 5% of the  budgeted expenses. Higher increases are legal if more than 50% of the owners  attend a meeting at which a majority of those present approve the increase.  </P> <P> Proper notice must be given and the meeting must be conducted according to  Section 7510 and Section 7613 of the Corporations Code. Your board can research  the law by going to the county law library. Some local public libraries also  have excellent legal reference books available.  </P> <P> Since the law is changing frequently, make sure that you have current  information.  </P> <P> The board has the authority to approve an assessment increase greater than 20%  if the increase is directly related to an emergency situation, such as an  extraordinary expense required by a court order, an extraordinary repair or  maintenance expense where a threat to personal safety is discovered, an  extraordinary expense necessary to repair or maintain association property that  was unforeseen at the time of preparation of the annual budget.  </P> <P> The board must pass a resolution containing written evidence of the need for  the repair and reasons why the expense was unforeseen. The resolution must be  distributed to all the members with the notice of the assessment increase.  </P> <P> California Civil Code, Section 1366.1 prohibits the association from collecting  an assessment, penalty or fee that exceeds the amount necessary for the purpose  for which it is collected.  </P> <P> Community Associations Institute provides seminars and newsletters to keep  boards of directors, managers and other professionals informed about changes in  the laws governing community associations. There are chapters across the  nation. You will find chapters in the following California cities: Los Angeles,  San Diego, San Francisco, El Toro, Sacramento, Camarillo, Stockton and Palm  Desert.  </P> <P> New Owner Charged Steep Transfer Fee  </P> <P> Q: Our association would like advice regarding the extra fees that we can  charge to new owners. Can our homeowners association assess a new buyer a  transfer fee of twice the monthly assessment fee for the unit being sold?  </P> <P> A: That sounds like an unreasonable fee based on the laws governing ownership  transfer fees. The seller is obligated to provide to the prospective buyer  certain documents listed in California Civil Code, Section 1368.  </P> <P> The association may be asked to provide these documents through the escrow  company. The law allows the association to charge only the amount of the  association's reasonable cost to prepare and reproduce the requested documents.  </P> <P> Many management companies, operating as the agent for the association, charge  $150 or more for this service. In my opinion, such fees are unreasonable and  possibly illegal, based on the specific wording of the law. The cost is  customarily passed on to the buyer at the closing of escrow.  </P> <P> When challenged, managers say they are charging the fee because of the time  spent on the phone with escrow and loan officers, real estate agents and others  involved with the resale. One manager recently told me that he felt that the  limit imposed by the law did not apply to management companies.  </P> <P> Some managers and association boards are not aware that the association must  provide the requested documents within 10 days of the written request. Any  person or entity that willfully violates this section of the law is liable to  the purchaser for actual damages as well as a civil penalty not to exceed $500.  </P> <P> When selling my condominium, I provided the documents to the buyer myself and  told the management company that I expected a reduction in the transfer fee  since the only thing they were providing was a letter showing that there were  no past-due assessments owed on the unit.  </P> <P> The manager said that I shouldn't be concerned about the amount of the transfer  fee since the buyer is the one who ends up paying. Sure enough, at the closing  of escrow the buyer was charged a $150 transfer fee.  </P></p>

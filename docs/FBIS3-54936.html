In the statement dated December 31 but conveyed to TASS only  today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's ultranationalist party describes  its motion as "a new year gift" and expresses hope that this  decree will be "a step towards consolidation of society".    The draft decree also suggests that the trial over the  August  1991 pro-communist coup plotters be terminated "for lack of  corpus delicti", as well as that all people mixed up in the  October 1993 events on both sides "be relieved from any  responsibility".    The authors of the draft decree propose placing the jailed  masterminders of the October uprising under home arrest and then  banning them, as well as some of the August coup leaders, from  going in for politics for three years.</p>

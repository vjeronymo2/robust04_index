			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allders may return to market in autumn ALLDERS, the department store and duty free company which was taken private after a Pounds 224m buy-out from Hanson in 1989, is considering returning to the stock market, possibly in the autumn. No timetable for the possible flotation has been fixed, and the company is now recruiting a stockbroker and other advisers. Schroders, which arranged a 1991 financial restructuring for the company, is likely to be retained as financial adviser. The restructuring, prompted by poor trading conditions and a looming debt repayment peak, included a Pounds 10m injection of fresh equity, underwritten by Prudential Venture Managers, 3i and CIN Venture Managers. Following the 1989 buy-out, Allders said it wanted to return to the stock market within four years to use the proceeds of the flotation to pay off borrowings. Allders operates 11 UK department stores and claims to be the world's second largest duty free retailer, after Duty Free Shoppers of the US.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A FEELING of inertia descended on dealings in stock index futures with little in the way of economic data on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened slightly lower than anticipated at 2,569, March initially slipped back in light selling before buying from independent traders led to a recovery, the contract going forward to 2,573 by lunchtime. Improved buying was noted with Wall Street's firm opening, but talk of an opinion poll to be published this weekend showing a strong lead for the Labour Party was said to have halted any further advance. Dealers noted an improved premium of about 3 points in the June contract. March closed at 2,576, around 7 points above estimated fair value premium of about 6. Turnover was 3,983 lots. In traded options, turnover at 25,521 was surprisingly low for an expiry day. The FT-SE 100 index option was busy at 8,385 contracts. British Steel was the busiest stock option. It traded 1,727 contracts with the April 60 calls, together with the April 80 calls, equally active. This was followed by British Gas which traded 1,415 lots. Amstrad, Midland Bank and British Aerospace were also active.</p>

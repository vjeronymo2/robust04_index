Police spokesman Savas Andoniadhis said the judges, who were  assisted by the Cyprus force, were conducting a general inquiry  into smuggling.    Narcotics and fabrics are understood to have been included  in  the investigations. The judges were on the island for ten days.    The value of the smuggled goods is believed to be thousands  of dollars.    A seven-member team comprising the judges, lawyers, and tax  inspectors investigated two unnamed Dutch offshore companies.    The companies are believed to have moved huge quantities of  fabric to Lebanon and Pakistan using documents relating to  another country.    According to reports, members of one offshore company were  described as owners of boat which was bought with drugs money.    A Dutch judge issued a confiscation order on the unnamed  boat  and any property gained through smuggling.</p>

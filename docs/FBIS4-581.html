			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The atmosphere at the Angolan peace talks is hardly  likely to have been improved by reports of fighting today in a  strategic region of the northeast. The talks have dragged on  for nearly five months now, but they have got bogged down in  disputes over power-sharing between the MPLA [Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola] government and the UNITA [National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels. Now the two  armies are battling for control of Cafunfo, a diamond rich town,  300 hundred miles east of the capital. Nicholas Jackson of  REUTER news agency telexed this report from Luanda:    State media and independent observers said today that  fighting was intensifying around the rebel-held town of Cafunfo,  which is at the heart of the Cuango valley diamond region. A  diplomat in Luanda said that both sides were engaged in military  actions and that government artillery was within range of  Cafunfo, which was captured by UNITA early last year. The state  daily newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, also reported that UNITA was  stepping up its activity. The town would be a major prize for  the government in the war against UNITA. Since the rebels  captured the town, industry sources say as much as $200 million  worth of diamonds have leaked out, providing the rebels with  their main sources of funds.    Diplomats said action on the ground seems to be taking  precedence over UN-brokered peace talks in the Zambian capital  Lusaka. One diplomat said that the talks were reaching a  turning point. If there was no progress, the United Nations  would have to suspend the process, letting the fighting take its  course. The Lusaka talks have yielded agreements on military,  legal and political issues, but the sides became bogged down on  national reconciliation, in particular on power sharing between  the government and UNITA and a role for UNITA leader, Jonas  Savimbi.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON BLVD. TO BE RENAMED  </P> <P> Compton Boulevard in Gardena will be renamed Marine Avenue by Nov. 1, in accord  with a City Council vote on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The change will mean that the name Compton Boulevard will disappear from the  area west of the Harbor Freeway, except for two sections that run through  Hawthorne.  </P> <P> Gardena officials approved the change following a mail survey of Compton  Boulevard merchants, property owners and residents. The results of the survey  showed 68.4% approved the change and 31.6% were against it.  </P> <P> The city's Public Works Department estimated that the cost of changing streets  signs along the city's two-mile stretch of Compton would be $1,855.  </P> <P> Officials in Lawndale, who had already approved renaming the street, have begun  putting up Marine Avenue signs, but will mark major intersections with both  names for several months.  </P> <P> In Manhattan Beach, the street has been known as Marine Avenue since the early  1900s.  </P> <P> Hawthorne officials have discussed changing the name of the boulevard but have  not done so.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's Gardena council meeting, 19 of 22 residents and business owners  who addressed the council were in favor of the change, saying that Compton  Boulevard "is neither a boulevard nor does it go to Compton." Residents also  said the change would improve the street's image and make the name consistent  with other South Bay cities.  </P> <P> The Post Office will continue to deliver mail to Compton Boulevard in Gardena  for at least a year after the name change becomes official in November, city  officials said.  </P></p>

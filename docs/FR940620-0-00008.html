This amendment is prompted by reports of a slight separation between the end hinge shims and the cargo door; this separation can cause bending loads on the fasteners. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the hinge fasteners, loss of structural integrity of the cargo door hinge, possible loss of the cargo door, and subsequent rapid decompression of the airplane. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective July 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 20, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Pemco Aeroplex Inc., P.O.

That action proposed to require replacement of the forward and aft hinge shims and the lower hinge fairings of the main cargo door with new shims and fairings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters support the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter considers there is no justification for issuing the proposed rule, since most of the affected airplanes have already been modified in accordance with the proposed requirements. The FAA does not concur. Although the commenter has provided the FAA with data indicating that the proposed modification has been accomplished on all airplanes currently on the U.S. Register, this data did not provide positive indication, verified by FAA personnel, that the modification had been accomplished on airplanes not currently on the U.S. Register. Should one of these affected airplanes be imported to the U.S. in the future, this AD is necessary in order to ensure that the required actions are accomplished on the airplane prior to it being placed on the U.S. Register. Further, as is indicated in the final rule, operators are given ``credit'' for previously accomplishing the requirements of the rule; therefore, no further action is required on the part of the operators in these cases.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter contends that there is no justification for the proposed AD, since the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) holder (Pemco) has not indicated that the referenced Pemco service bulletin concerns an airworthiness problem. The commenter states that Pemco has portrayed the service bulletin as addressing only a reliability problem. The FAA does not concur. In developing this AD action, the FAA reviewed the relevant data which indicated that this STC door design allows slight separation between the end hinge shims and the cargo door during pressurization cycles; such separation can cause increased bending loads on the door hinge fasteners. The FAA determined that this situation constitutes an unsafe condition since, if not corrected, it could lead to fatigue failure of the hinge fasteners, loss of structural integrity of the cargo door hinge, possible loss of the cargo door, and subsequent rapid decompression of the airplane. Regardless of whether or not the wording in the service bulletin describes the procedures specified within it as addressing an airworthiness problem, the FAA finds that accomplishment of those procedures will serve to eliminate the identified unsafe condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggests that the wording that identifies the location of the affected cargo door be clarified. The commenter points out that the notice identified this door as the ``main cargo door;'' however, a more correct identification would be ``main deck cargo door.'' The FAA concurs and has changed the pertinent wording in the final rule accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Logsdon was not injured, Miller said, but the blaze caused $100,000 in  structural damage and destroyed $30,000 in contents.  </P> <P> The house is owned by the Casitas Municipal Water District, which leases the  dam from Ventura County and runs it, said Richard Hajas, assistant general  manager of the district.

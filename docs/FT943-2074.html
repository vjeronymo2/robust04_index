			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good result in Canada Sir, The headline, 'Canada crumbles' (September 14), seemed to be contradictory and presumptuous in the face of good news from the election results in Quebec. The narrow margin of the popular vote in the election demonstrated that Quebeckers do not want independence. The result would also have been a non for independence even if the vote had been held soon after the contentious Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. I am a Canadian from the west and have discussed with several Quebeckers the possibility of separation during my visits to Quebec. I always get the feeling that it is the politicians and the media who have been wanting and propagating independence. The people of Quebec have never wanted and will never want independence from Canada. Your editorial headline therefore should have been more thoughtful and have read 'Canada wins'.

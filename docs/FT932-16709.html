			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / London bears brunt of transport strike: Regions complain about capital's day-off as roads 'bedlam' fails to materialise A LONDON holiday, with business as usual for much of the rest of the UK, was the verdict on the effects of yesterday's rail strike. British Rail ran almost no services - the Thames and Chiltern line from Banbury and Aylesbury into London was one of the few exceptions. London travel problems were compounded because half of the red buses were off the road in a separate dispute. However, London Underground's services were operating nearly normally, except where tracks are shared with BR. The 'bedlam' on the roads being predicted by motoring organisations largely failed to materialise, apart from snarl-ups in the morning on the M6 north of Birmingham and heavy congestion on the M1 through Northamptonshire. For regular motorway users life was generally more pleasant than usual. Mr Brian Harries, a salesman from Nottingham said: 'If the roads were as quiet as this every time they strike - keep striking, lads.' Many of those who began their journeys by road before dawn were sitting at their desks at an unearthly hour with nothing to do and nobody to talk to. Mr John Stevens, director of policy at the Institute of Personnel Management, had breakfast at 7am in a roadside cafe after arriving in record time at the institute's Wimbledon headquarters. The Confederation of British Industry said thousands of workers had taken a day's leave or had taken work home. In some organisations it had been possible for employees to go to local offices instead. For example at Grant Thornton, accountants, partners were working in out-of-London offices where possible. At Touche Ross they were arranging to see clients based out of central London. The CBI's conference in London on trading with Zambia, had a 90 per cent turnout. Regional chambers of commerce reported irritation from businesses unable to communicate with people in London. The Thames Valley regional chamber, for example, said it had had difficulty getting in touch with anyone in the capital. Glasgow chamber of commerce said it had 'heard about London getting the day off'. In Birmingham, businesses reported only 10-15 minutes added to journey times and chambers in Teesside and Manchester said companies had been unaffected. The British Retail Consortium said plenty of tourists took advantage of the fact that it was a bit quieter in London's west end. Shops reported few difficulties getting store staff to work, although among head office workers, for example at Marks and Spencers' head office in Baker Street, many had spent the day working at home. In central London there was a distinct holiday atmosphere: Mr Jean-Luc Martigny, a French banker living in Kensington, said: 'It reminds me of France. Whenever we have a religious or bank holiday we take a pont, or bridge, to the weekend. The habit seems to be catching on here.' Restaurant and wine bar owners were not convinced though. Mr Paul Blannerhassett, assistant manager of Balls Brothers wine bar at Hays Galleria near London Bridge, said he had never seen fewer customers on a Friday. It was not like previous rail strikes when everyone had been determined to get to work. The manager of the Cafe D'Arte, an up-market sandwich and salad bar at Blackfriars, said customers had told him only half their staffs had turned up, although he had about 75 per cent of his normal business. The Paperchase shop on a deserted Waterloo station was a particularly forlorn sight. By late afternoon when the staff decided to close, 60 customers had been in compared with the usual 700. 'It's been a disaster of a day, but we felt we had to open,' said Ms Emma Carr, assistant manager. There were beneficiaries, however. A welcome boost was given to the financially troubled Thames riverbus service as a number of Londoners chose to go to work by river. Services were increased and the normally half-empty launches were fully booked on the morning run up the river from Greenwich. The launches were also much more crowded than usual on the eastward route from Chelsea. Miss Jill Boezalt, office manager with a landscape architect, found the Pounds 3 river trip from Chelsea more expensive than her usual Pounds 1.20 bus journey from Battersea, but she could not remember a less troublesome trip to work. 'This is a real treat . . . a delightful way to get to work. I'd do it every day if only it were cheaper.' Coach companies and National Car Park sites reported roaring business, with substantial bookings. 'They started coming in from 5.30 this morning, well ahead of normal, and we've been full until mid-afternoon,' said an attendant at an NCP South Bank site.</p>

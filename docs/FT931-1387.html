			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Inflation falls to 4% in Spain ANNUAL inflation in Spain fell to 4 per cent in February, the best performance in five years. But it did little to raise hopes for significant interest rate cuts and triggered only a modest recovery on the Madrid stock market. The February consumer price index was static, meaning that Spain's annual rate of inflation has fallen sharply from 5.4 per cent at the end of 1992. Some analysts in Madrid yesterday forecast end-of-year inflation at below 4 per cent. However the Bank of Spain, which the previous day had decided to hold its benchmark intervention rate at 13 per cent, was holding short-term money market rates at around 15.5 per cent, with analysts expecting little movement soon. Most believe the Spanish will wait to see whether a new French government relaxes monetary policy after the final round of parliamentary elections this weekend. The February figure was, nevertheless, lower than expected and the more remarkable because changes this year to the way the CPI has been calculated probably overstate comparative inflation. The new calculation gives high-inflation service industries greater weight than previously.</p>

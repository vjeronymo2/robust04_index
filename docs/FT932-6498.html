			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Clinton defends record in office: A few 'glitches' conceded  -Trade status for China - VAT 'feasible' PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday mounted a robust defence of his record in office and the performance of his much-criticised White House staff. His appearance on a two-hour breakfast television 'town meeting' came just hours before a budget bill pact with conservative Democrats was voted on by the House of Representatives. Mr Clinton confirmed that he would extend China's most favoured nation trading status for a year 'because I want to support modernisation in China and it is a great opportunity for America there'. But he said he expected 'some progress' from China on human rights abuses and the use of prison labour. Other disputes with China, over arms sales and trade, would be negotiated separately and directly with the Chinese, he said. 'I think they will appreciate the gesture I'm making.' On the issue of introducing a value added tax, the president said he thought it was 'feasible if it is not regressive'. It was something 'we may look at later on', but was 'such a big issue' that it had to come after economic and health care reform. Most of the questions put to the president by his audience of 200 members of the public in the Rose Garden were about national economic and social issues, while the programme's hosts concentrated on the controversies over the White House travel office and Mr Clinton's recent haircut on board Air Force One which delayed traffic at Los Angeles airport. On the latter issues, Mr Clinton conceded only 'a few glitches' in their public presentation. He said reforming the travel office would save money and was 'good for the country and good for the taxpayer'. He flatly denied charges of nepotism and cronyism over proposed alternative travel arrangements. He insisted his staff had only followed past practice in calling in the FBI to investigate the travel office without directly consulting the attorney general's office. But he praised Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, who has objected to being circumvented, for her 'great judgment', adding: 'She can question whatever she wants to'. He also defended his White House staff who, he said, were not as young as popularly supposed. He would neither confirm nor deny that he was considering bringing in political heavyweights well versed in government to bolster the operation. 'If you try and change a lot of things you might break some eggs and it is not an exact process,' Mr Clinton said. He suggested the Washington establishment was also partly responsible for difficulties in getting the administration's message across. 'I think we've done a lousy job of cutting through the fog that always surrounds this town.' He listed a variety of achievements and said his own analysis of his first 100 days showed he had spent a quarter of his time on foreign policy, 55 per cent on the economy and health care and 20 per cent on other domestic policies. The president said he spent just 2 1/2 hours on the issue of gays in the military. But he added he favoured the latest compromise proposal, known as 'don't ask, don't tell,' which would permit homosexuals to serve in the military but require them to keep their sexual practices private.</p>

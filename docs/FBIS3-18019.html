			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE (JLV): "Acceleration in European </F> Union-Sweden Negotiations"; as released by BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 22 Feb (Belga) -- Sweden on Tuesday [22  February] expressed its satisfaction with the development of the  negotiations that should lead to its membership in the European  Union [EU]. It thus welcomed the decision of the Twelve to  create a new criterion for obtaining Community regional aid that  would directly benefit the three Scandinavian countries on the  threshold of the EU (Sweden, Finland, and Norway).    The Twelve are opposed to these three countries receiving  regional aid as less-favored regions, insofar as the regions in  question have a per capita income of around 80 percent of  Community GDP, which is more than the 75 percent set as  "objective 1."    For this reason, the European proposal created an "objective  6" for eligibility to the structural funds concerning regions  with a population density of less than eight people per square  kilometer.    Most of the Nordic regions of Sweden, Norway, and Finland  meet this criterion, and could therefore benefit from this  Community godsend, evaluated by Luxembourg Foreign Minister  Jacques Poos to be worth some ECU175 million per year.    This proposal is a "great step forward and constitutes a  very  good base for the rest of the negotiations," stressed Swedish  Foreign Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel during a news conference.    "The fact that the specific situation of northern Sweden is  recognized as such is very important," he added.    In addition, Sweden asked the Twelve to grant it a  transition  period during which its contribution to the Community "kitty"  would not be greater than the benefits it would reap from  entering the Community "club."    "From the start, we are ready to pay as much as we receive,  but we would like a transition period up to 1999, after which we  would contribute in full and would ensure the dynamic effects of  our membership were felt," explained Mr. Dinkelspiel.    The Twelve did not, however, hide their reluctance on this  point. Mr. Dinkelspiel admitted: "I must say that our proposal  was not greeted with waves of enthusiasm." Such a hypothesis  would put a serious strain on the benefits expected from the  membership of the four countries, currently members of EFTA  (European Free Trade Area), estimated to be worth ECU1.6 billion.    Foreign Ministry sources pointed out that Sweden would  contribute almost half this sum (some ECU765 million), thus  becoming the third largest contributor in the EU, and the  largest contributor per inhabitant.</p>

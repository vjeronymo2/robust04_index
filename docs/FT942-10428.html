			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / EU curbs urged on cash card issuers Central bank governors yesterday advised EU governments to prevent companies other than banks from issuing electronic cards which can be used as a substitute for cash. They said that this would help to protect consumers. The European Monetary Institute council approved a study which called for only authorised credit institutions to be allowed to issue pre-paid cards. Banks hope that such cards may eventually take the place of notes and coins. Several European banks and credit card issuers are working on schemes for multi-purpose cash cards which consumers could load with money electronically. They would then use the cards for small transactions in shops and retail outlets. The report by the EMI's working group on EU payments systems is the first central bank response to the growth in schemes such as the Mondex initiative launched by National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank and British Telecom. It said that central banks would have to monitor the fraud prevention measures, and might have to act if these were not satisfactory. Some EU states already have laws preventing companies which are not licensed credit institutions from issuing cash cards. However, an amendment to EU legislation might be required to ensure that this policy applied in all countries. Although telecom companies and others now issue cards with cash values for limited uses, the central banks' proposals would only apply to 'multi-use' cards which are intended as a near-perfect substitute for cash. Banks in EU countries including Portugal, Denmark, Belgium and France are working on multi-use cash cards. Banks believe they could save substantial amounts if they were adopted by consumers because they would have to handle less cash.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, a plenary of the Committees for the  Defense of the Revolution [CDR] was held at El Caney  Municipality where people in this area of Santiago de Cuba  Province asked Division General Sixto Batista Santana to express  to Fidel and Raul the assurance that they can count on them  during this battle.    During the plenary, Esteban Lazo Hernandez, first secretary  of the Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba, made a  special intervention in which he pointed out the moment requires  all the firmness of the revolutionaries; in that sense, he  stated:    [Lazo] "That is the reason I say that we are in times of  very  profound thoughts that reflect the state of mind of  revolutionaries, patriots, and Cubans. We must get everyone to  join the battle. But let us not forget that during these  difficult times we must win the battle with real revolutionaries  and with patriots. We will not win this battle with the  mediocre, with those who change sides, or with pessimists. This  battle must be won by patriots. We must win this battle for the  future of our fatherland."    In another part of his intervention, before members of the  CDR in El Caney, Esteban Lazo said that despite the efforts made  by the Revolution there is still ingratitude; he gave an example  from the life of Jose Marti:    [Lazo] "Marti said to Gomez, when he made him head of the  Liberating Army: I make you head of the Liberating Army knowing  that you will accept; I can only offer you the sacrifice of your  life and the possible ingratitude of men. Today, there is  ingratitude, but above it is the honor of Cubans."    After talking about these realities, Lazo, who is also a  member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed  out that despite all the difficulties, our economy is beginning  to recover. He gave specific examples.    [Lazo] "We have our refinery. How long was our refinery out  of service? Today it is operating. That is an expression of  recovery. Rente, which was producing between 37 and 38  megawatts, is now producing 230 megawatts, and, by the end of  the year, should have all its units ready to work. This gas  plant that is near here [words indistinct]. How about the  textile factory? We have established a plan with the Mexicans  for producing approximately 18 million square meters. In other  words, we are seeing a recovery in our economy."    These were comments made by Politburo member Esteban Lazo  Hernandez, vice president of the Council of State, in a special  intervention made at the plenary held with CDR members in El  Caney, where, in the presence of Sixto Batista Santana, the  application of decree-law No. 149 was affirmed.</p>

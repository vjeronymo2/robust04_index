			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> CHIPPENDALE CHAIR  </P> <P> THE GOLDEN AGE of English cabinetmaking and furniture design was the period  from 1714 to 1830 -- generally called the Georgian period, after the four  English kings who reigned during those years. However, it is really more  important to know whether a piece was designed by Hepplewhite or Sheraton or  Chippendale than whether it was made during the reign of, say, George III.  Matters were far different in France, where furniture styles were named after  reigning monarchs: Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI. If nothing else, this shows  that wealth and taste were more the province of the British upper classes than  of British royalty. Britain had its own rising class of minor nobility and  wealthy merchants who determined trends in the decorative arts, and the English  kings had little interest in such things. The richness of the period, both in  England and in France, is extraordinary.  </P> <P> Of all the 18th-Century English designers and cabinetmakers, the one whose name  is most familiar today is Thomas Chippendale. Born in Yorkshire in 1718, he was  the son of a joiner. As a young man, he was apprenticed to a cabinetmakers'  firm in London. Within a decade, he had his own shop, and it soon turned into  one of the largest furniture-making businesses in that country. His work was  renowned for its exquisitely carved decoration, cabriole legs and elaborate  chair backs. He was famous for the exotic Oriental designs and lacquerwork that  came to be called Chinese Chippendale.  </P> <P> In 1754, he published a book, "The Gentleman and Cabinet-maker's Director." The  first edition had 16 plates, along with many drawings of Chippendale's own  designs for chairs and settees and for such imposing furniture as commodes,  dressing tables, bookcases, library tables and breakfronts. His designs were by  no means original, but the book served to bring his name before a wide public,  and he became a celebrity.  </P> <P> It is, however, misleading to think of Chippendale as the greatest of all  18th-Century English cabinetmakers and furniture designers. His reputation was  chiefly founded on one popular book, but the designs in it were for the most  part derivative, and he personally was no more than an average craftsman. But  he was a fine publicist and a man of great business acumen, the head of a large  and successful firm known throughout the British Isles.  </P> <P> Many of the Chippendale chairs sold at auction these days are 19th-Century  copies, and others are handsome (and expensive) examples made in the American  Colonies, before and after 1776. Typical 18th-Century English Chippendale  pieces are often found for good prices. In 1988, for example, you might have  acquired eight Chippendale mahogany dining chairs with pierced ladder backs for  $10,000; or 12 carved mahogany armchairs for $15,400. Per chair, prices are not  excessive.  </P> <P>  Look for Chippendale chairs at Morey Palmer Associates, Museum Antiques in Los  Angeles; Richard Gould Antiques in Santa Monica; Richard Yeakel in Laguna  Beach; G.R. Durenberger in San Juan Capistrano, and Jay's Antiques in Pasadena.

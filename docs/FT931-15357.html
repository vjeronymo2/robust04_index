			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television The Mafia can usually be relied on to make a good story. Most promising programme of the evening is Allied to the Mafia (BBC 2, 8.10), in which the historical documentary series 'Timewatch' examines the nuts and bolts of the mutually rewarding relationship which the Americans struck up with the Mafia ahead of the Allied landings in Sicily, 50 years ago. Clive James - Fame in the Twentieth Century (BBC 1, 9.30) is a series which thus far threatens to make no demands on anyone's grey cells. Tonight James's survey of people in the limelight looks at the late 'twenties and early 'thirties, the period which saw the arrival of the 'talkies', the reluctantly famous Charles Lindbergh, and the infamous Al Capone. But if you are looking for something more taxing the nature of scientific research is explored in the concluding part of Culture Clash (BBC 2, 11.15). Unless your New Year's resolution was to wade through Richardson's enormous novel, there is much to be said for watching Clarissa (BBC 2, 9. 25), the well-made TV adaptation in three parts which tonight returns for its second run.</p>

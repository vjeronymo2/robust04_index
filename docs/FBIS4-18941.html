			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F> lower house floor leader, by Enza Cusmai in Pontida on 10 April:  "Maroni: `Someone Wants Me Dead'" -- first paragraph is IL  GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] Pontida -- Threats. The Northern Leaguer who is  most favored for the seat of interior minister is the target of  threats. The last threat dates back to a few days ago; it was  signed by Walter Alasia, the name of the notorious branch of the  Red Brigades and said: "We already consider you a dead man."  Roberto Maroni, the great mediator, lets the news slip through  in a soft voice while [Northern League Secretary] Bossi is  speaking on the stage at Pontida. However he does not lose his  composure even though his expression is not as calm as usual.  "The police authorities offered an escort, but I do not want it  because if they want to kill me they will succeed anyway.  Moreover, I do not want to create any alarm, there are already  too many problems."    [Cusmai] But are you not afraid?    [Maroni] Yes, but escorts do not do a great deal. I would  abolish almost all of them; they cost heaps of money and are  often given to people that do not need them.    [Cusmai] To politicians that are no longer part of the game  and who feel threatened?    [Maroni] Precisely. Those people have to look after  themselves. Those who were formerly powerful are at a high risk  just because they are no longer capable of satisfying the  interests of their old clients. This is their business and does  not concern the state and the people.    [Cusmai] You want to do away with escorts then?    [Maroni] I would allow them in dribs and drabs. Today there  are only about 10 people in Italy whose lives are very much at  risk. Only they deserve a special treatment because they are all  the people who are working on the front line and fighting  against organized crime, both Mafia and ordinary crime.    [Cusmai] Today here at Pontida, Marco Formentini [League  Mayor of Milan officially designated you minister of internal  affairs. What would be your first measure?    [Maroni] I would transfer the Viminale [seat of the Interior  Ministry] to Palermo or Naples. I realize that this is not any  easy thing to do. It takes time. Therefore, I would begin by  immediately decentralizing certain functions and sections. For  example, I would transfer the anti-Mafia commission to Palermo.  And I would see Mario Borghezio from Turin, who is highly  competent and already a member of the anti-Mafia commission, as  its president.    [Cusmai] Why do you want to transfer pieces of the Viminale  palace?    [Maroni] Because the operational and strategic structures of  the Viminale must be present in the hot areas of the country.  The people must feel the presence of the state and its  protection.    [Cusmai] Do you not see Milan as being a dangerous city?    [Maroni] Of course, it is full of thousands of companies  that  are not controlled. Unfortunately, there is no limit to  financial crime, but it can also be fought with federalism.  Only this can weaken the Mafia because a large part of its  revenues does not come from prostitution or drugs but from  public tenders. In any case, I would transfer the Industry  Ministry and the CONSOB [National Commission for the Supervision  of Companies and the Stock Exchange] to Milan.    [Cusmai] Let us get back to public order. What do you think  about the police forces?    [Maroni] There is currently no coordination between the  police, military police, and fiscal police. We have three  operational centers where antagonism rather than collaboration  reigns. Well, the battle against crime must begin with the  total streamlining of these structures.    [Cusmai] What do you say about the prefects?    [Maroni] They are all public officials who are at the end of  their careers and their structures are almost useless. The most  important thing is that they manage civil defense and this  should be coordinated by the municipalities.    [Cusmai] What major damage did the DC [Christian Democratic  Party] cause during the 40 years in which it managed the  Interior Ministry?    [Maroni] I am trying to think of the good that it did but  nothing comes to mind. It permitted relations between politics  and the Mafia, it destroyed local autonomy, it used the secret  service for political battles.    [Cusmai] And what would you do to the secret service?    [Maroni] A great uplifting is needed immediately. First, by  replacing all the executives and top men at once. In addition,  the new people must be hired through public exams.    [Cusmai] Secrecy is not needed then?    [Maroni] The structure of the secret service must not be  secret. I would change its name. I would call it a confidential  service or a service for democracy.    [Cusmai] The Interior Ministry also has jurisdiction over  local bodies. How should one intervene in this sector?    [Maroni] The municipalities should be reorganized, city  managers introduced, the careers of municipal secretaries  revised. In practice, the latter should no longer be responsible  for municipal management, but should become the controllers of  the legitimacy of acts. The management instead should be  entrusted to a managerial staff selected by the mayor. This is  the primary emergency. Only in this way will the municipalities  be able to govern.</p>

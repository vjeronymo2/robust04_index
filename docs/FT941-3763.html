			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Computers to keep the books - Affordable accounting packages are now available for even the smallest companies Little more than a decade after IBM introduced personal computers to the office desktop, there has been an explosion in powerful software available to help companies manage their accounts. Collapsing hardware prices and increasingly user-friendly software have given managers in the smallest companies a speed of access to information unimagined by their predecessors. Where a few years ago companies might only have known the state of their cash books at the end of a month, real-time accounting packages, costing little more than the petty cash allowance, now update ledgers the moment a transaction is completed. Yet, according to Paul Walker, managing director of Sage, a UK supplier of integrated accounts packages, as many as 40 per cent of companies with up to 50 employees are still not computerised. What are these companies missing? At the simplest level, the choice includes Sage's Moneywise, Microsoft's Money and Intuit's Quicken. These systems are basic cash management packages. They replicate manual books, but are really only suitable for sole traders or individuals with the simplest of needs, according to Dennis Keeling, independent analyst of accounting, business and manufacturing systems. Bigger and more complex companies need full-blown, double-entry bookkeeping accounting systems that have sales, purchase and nominal ledgers. These so-called integrated packages include Sage's Sterling products, which cost from Pounds 100 to Pounds 900 through dealers. Since the company's launch in the mid-1980s, it has attracted 170,000 users of this software in the UK; Sage services more than 53,000 support contracts. Sage is working with Microsoft, the US software house, on a joint promotion to allow the two companies' products to link and form what Sage calls 'an integrated office environment' that incorporates spreadsheets, word processing and accounting packages. But as ever in the fast-moving computer world, there are pretenders to the market leaders' throne. 'In Sterling you have a world-class package with incredible volumes,' says Keeling. 'But the product that has come from nowhere in 18 months to become a significant number two is Megatech's Tas Books.' Sold via mail order and costing Pounds 99, Tas Books has 'taken on Sage and really eaten into its market in the UK', Keeling says. Sage's Sterling still dwarfs Megatech. But Megatech nevertheless claims 20 per cent of the integrated accounting packages, helped by a rare recommendation from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Sage has about 60 per cent of this market. The feature of Tas Books that will excite some business people - and appall some accountants - is that it allows users to correct their mistakes. And it comes with a detailed tutorial on double entry bookkeeping. Just as word processors correct typing errors, so Megatech says its Tas Books acts as an account processor. Many accountants would say that mistakes should be reversed by contra entries even if this leads to clutter and a more expensive audit. 'With the account processor you can make changes so the Books represents your source document 100 per cent accurately,' says Theo van Dort, founder and chief software designer at Megatech. 'We say forget what accountants will like, this is what businessmen will like. We want to record the original documents and not mistakes.' To protect against unauthorised entries, the system keeps an audit trail. While Megatech claims some very big customers, Keeling says the system is probably limited to companies with sales of Pounds 5m. Van Dort disagrees, giving an example of one content Tas Books user, Massarella Catering Group, a retail caterer in department stores which has sales of Pounds 28m through 98 outlets. Some critics also say Tas Books has a limited appeal because it is available only within a Dos operating system, and not within Windows. Sage, for example, which has 500,000 users in the US, says half its UK sales of accounting packages are in the Windows format. 'Some people do not want it (accounting packages) in Windows at the moment,' says Walker. 'But in America if you don't have a Windows product you might as well go to sleep.' Encouraged by its success in the market, Megatech says it is now launching a Tas Books 2 version. In addition to the existing features, this software will allow users to automate stock control, sales order processing and purchase order processing. This product will move Megatech towards a market serving bigger companies with so-called modular systems. Products in this market include Pegasus Senior, Sage's Sovereign, Tetra's 2000 and Cameleon, Sun Systems' Sun Accounts and Multisoft's Prestige. Each module - the cash book, the sales ledger, the purchase ledger - can cost up to Pounds 1,000. It is a more competitive, higher end of the market where there is less growth, partly because most companies buying such packages will already have some form of computerised bookkeeping. The real growth is below this level, according to Walker. 'The new small- to medium-sized company market is still expanding. There is the company that has still not computerised and those people that computerised four to eight years ago and who have decided to catch up with technology and are buying new software.'</p>

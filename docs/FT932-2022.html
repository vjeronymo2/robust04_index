			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Observer: From pulpit to practice It says a lot about the changing face of Italian capitalism that Guido Rossi should be imported to preside over the rescue of debt-ridden Ferruzzi. The Harvard-trained lawyer, ex-head of stock exchange watch-dog Consob, has acted as both insider and outsider in Italy's corporate world. He has advised groups like Fiat, Olivetti and Generali, and made much money. But  - as his 'Rossi the red' nickname testifies  - he has never hidden the leftist sympathies which in 1987 gave him Communist Party backing as an independent senatorial candidate for Milan. He has long fiercely criticised the way Italian family businesses ignore minority shareholders. Moreover, after quitting Consob in 1982, he described the stock exchange as little more than a souk, and muttered darkly about reform attempts always running up against a wall of vested interests. Hence the new political climate should enable him to practise what he has been preaching. Whether it will can only remain to be seen.</p>

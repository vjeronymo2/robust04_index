			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Waste Management up 26% WASTE MANAGEMENT International, the UK-listed overseas arm of Waste Management of the US, yesterday reported first quarter profits in line with expectations and said it was continuing to benefit from acquisitions and internal growth. Pre-tax profits increased 26 per cent to Pounds 34.4m in the three months to March 31 on turnover 18 per cent higher at Pounds 220.9m. Most of the increase in sales was due to acquisitions, although there were also gains due to price increases and foreign exchange swings. Europe remained the company's most important market, accounting for 82 per cent of sales compared to 77 per cent last year. Asia continued to grow in importance, accounting for 10 per cent of sales. The company is involved in or studying projects in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia. Its hazardous waste treatment plant in Hong Kong is due to begin commercial operations in the next few days. The company has also submitted four proposals for waste energy plants in Taiwan. Earnings increased 19.6 per cent to 6.1p. That fell in the middle of forecasts issued last week by the company following concerns, mainly in the US, that profits were below expectations. The company does not pay dividends. The shares, which were listed last year at 585p, gained 1p to 544p.</p>

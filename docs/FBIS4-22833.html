Saydakhmedov, M.G. Karpman, and G.P. </F> Fetisov, Moscow Institute of Aviation; UDC  621.793.184:669.14.018.252.3]    [Abstract] Specimens of R-6Mo5Co5 high-speed cutting tool  steel were coated by the ion-plasma process with Ti, V, Cr  nitrides and various combinations of them, the process involving  condensation from the plasma phase with attendant ion  bombardment. Deposition of titanium nitride coatings was  preceded by preliminary deposition of titanium on the steel  surface. Subsequent processing was done with the steel substrate  at a temperature within 550+/-25C and the nitrogen pressure  within 0.25-0.28 Pa, with the bias potential held constant at  100 V and the current varied over the 75-125 A range. The phase  composition of the coatings was analyzed in a DRON-3M x-ray  diffractometer with Cu-K[.sub]_a_[/] and Co-K[.sub]_a_[/]  radiation sources, the results revealing the presence of  0.02-1.0% Fe,Mo,Co,W,Si from the steel. An x-ray  structural  examination revealed, moreover, not only TiN with a b.c.c.  crystal lattice (parameter a= 0.4241 nm) but also up to 8%  _a_-Ti phase which had formed during the preliminary deposition  of titanium. An x-ray spectrum microanalysis was performed with  an electronic probe in a ``Cam-Scan'' analyzer. The relative  nitrogen content in the coatings was measured using a  TiN[.sub]0.06[/] reference specimen. The coatings were tested  for abrasion resistance in dry sliding friction, a 2500 m long  path being covered at a velocity of 1.1 m/s and the amount of  wear being measured by the loss-of-mass method. The heat  resistance of coated steel was estimated from the change of mass  as specimens were soaking in air at 600C. Microbrittleness  of the coatings was measured with a PMT-3 microhardness tester,  the ratio of indentations with cracks to the total number of  indentations being thus estimated and the behavior of cracked  indentations being tracked as the load was increased from 0.196  N to 1.96 N. Examination of chromium nitride coatings revealed  74% Cr[.sub]2[/]N and 26 % CrN, also traces of chromium   which had formed a 0.4 m thick underlayer after its  preliminary deposition. Examination of vanadium nitride coatings  revealed traces of vanadium accompanying the principal phase VN  with a b.c.c. crystal lattice (parameter a= 0.4123). Coatings of  (Ti+Cr) nitrides were found to have a b.c.c. crystal lattice and  a nonstoichiometric composition corresponding to  (Ti,Cr)N[.sub]0.47[/]: isomorph of TiN and CrN mononitrides  rather Ti and Cr dinitrides, despite the low (32 atom%)  nitrogen content. Coatings of (V+Cr) nitrides consisted of  79-80% (V,Cr)[.sub]2[/]N and 11-21% (V,Cr)N, both phases   having a b.c.c. crystal lattice. The results of mechanical tests  indicate that these coatings have a higher heat resistance and a  higher wear resistance than TiN and (Ti,Cr) coatings, also when  deposited on Ti-W 22 titanium alloy and on 12Cr18Ni10Ti steel.

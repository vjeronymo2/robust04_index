			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: European futures links encounter local opposition - Exchanges are slow to give up autonomy The ambitions of Europe's thriving derivatives exchanges have spawned plans to forge links aimed at a broader investment base. However, in practice, exchanges are finding it more difficult than imagined to sacrifice total autonomy. In the past decade, 18 derivatives exchanges have sprung up in Europe. They support 98 different futures and options contracts, excluding options on individual shares. Many of the smaller exchanges have successful stock derivatives - index futures and equity options - even though their underlying stock markets are quite illiquid, and barely contemplating international expansion. The best example of cross-border links is Fex, an alliance of European derivatives exchanges that plans electronic connections across borders between London, Stockholm, Zurich, Amsterdam and Vienna. Budding exchanges in Spain and Italy hope to join the group. Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) and France's Matif are also discussing a link. Amsterdam's electronic derivatives exchange, the European Options Exchange (EOE), and the London arm of its Swedish counterpart, OMLX, have already linked systems in the first stage of the Fex agreement, allowing joint access to their respective stock index products. To date, it is the only such alliance successfully consummated. The pace of this co-operation may be checked by the realities of joint ventures, including protectionist concerns from the exchanges' less robust cash markets. The board of Soffex, Switzerland's futures and options exchange, dealt a blow to the Fex agreement last week when it ordered work on cross-border links and foreign memberships to stop. Switzerland is struggling to construct a national electronic stock market (the EBS) to replace its three regional exchanges. The three big Swiss banks which dominate Soffex's board are expected to govern the EBS when it emerges. Analysts say the banks may have stifled Soffex out of fear that international links would bleed away Switzerland's stock market to London. 'The banks may see the need to build up a good Swiss stock market (before opening it up to foreigners). By putting off the Soffex links, they may be buying time,' says Mr Ruben Lee, managing director of the UK consulting firm, Oxford Finance Group. The price of delaying co-operation, Mr Lee says, is, increased competition. London already accounts for about one-fifth of Swiss stock trading, and Liffe, London's futures and options exchange, has been singularly successful at capturing foreign currency-denominated financial contracts. The decision to constrain the derivatives market long enough for the cash market to catch up has serious implications for Soffex and its Fex partners. Soffex's volume is posting records, but with the electronic link, the exchange 'would have had a lot more market-makers, and a lot more liquidity, and we would have created business for our partner exchanges as well,' said Mr Daniel Grossreider, Soffex vice-president. Other planned links are proving difficult to consummate. By co-operating, exchanges lose some control over their own business. Liffe and the Chicago Board of Trade last month abandoned discussions to share government debt contracts. The larger exchanges are turning toward joint marketing efforts in preference to links, viewing them as easier and more practical. The smaller derivatives exchanges, however, have more to gain from links, since they have fewer overlapping members.</p>

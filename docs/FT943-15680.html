			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Credit Lyonnais report leaks France's parliamentary inquiry into Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank which lost FFr6.9bn (Pounds 820m) last year, criticises its former head, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, for mismanagement but exonerates him from any personal misappropriation, according to leaks of the 200-page report due to be published on Tuesday. The parliamentary inquiry, unusual in France, has been headed by Mr Philippe Seguin, the national assembly president, who apparently writes in his introduction that 'political interference has not had a decisive impact' on the bank's situation. The French treasury is reprimanded in the report for failing to keep a closer eye on the bank's growing liabilities, including some FFr40bn in doubtful property loans that have been hived off into a separate state-backed company. Reaping the consequence of its earlier inattention, the treasury is now said to be nervous about the plan by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new head, to declare a FFr2bn-FFr4bn loss for the first half of this year, in an attempt to wipe the bank's slate clean as quickly as possible.

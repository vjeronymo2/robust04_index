			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> IMPASSIONED POSTERS CHANGED THE FACE OF GERMANY  </P> <P> Nov. 9, 1918. Kaiser Wilhelm abdicates power of a bruised and battered Germany.  Within hours, a new republic is declared. A coalition of socialists forms a  provisional government and announces a January date for the country's first  democratic elections. Suddenly, the war-weary nation awakes.  </P> <P> Censorship rules lapse, a paper shortage eases, and posters swathe the urban  landscape in fiery political rhetoric. The bold color used by German artists  "transformed the cities into pyrotechnic tapestries," according to historian  Ida Katherine Rigby. Between the November Revolution and the January elections,  wrote a contemporary observer, "Berlin's streets rioted in color orgies, the  houses exchanged their gray faces for an agitated mask."  </P> <P> A selection of these impassioned posters now hangs on the spare white walls of  the Photowest/W. Bradley Lemery gallery downtown. Tamed somewhat by the new  surroundings, many of the works nevertheless refuse to be declawed, their  fierce color and searing imagery stretching resolutely over the vast  chronological and geographical divide.  </P> <P> An image of a bony, ashen hand poised over a quiet village portends impending  danger. The poster's caption links the threat to Bolshevism and urges Germans  to protect their homeland from the forces that assumed power over Soviet Russia  the year before. Determined to prevent Germany's November Revolution from  veering toward the anarchism and extremism associated with Soviet Russia's  October Revolution, the provisional government launched a fervent campaign to  instill order, to cease agitation in the streets and appeal to workers to  return to their jobs.  </P> <P> Posters became instrumental in this campaign, and those commissioned by the  government's publicity committee took their places on the streets beside those  issued by political parties and private anti-Bolshevik leagues. The  Novembergruppe, a band of artists and writers committed to upholding the values  of the socialist-led revolution, carried out many of the commissions with the  same Expressionist fury they brought to their paintings and prints.  </P> <P> Demonstrators plunge through the center of a Heinz Fuchs' poster, their signs  as harshly pointed as the artist's brusque black lines. "Do You Want Enough to  Eat?" reads one handwritten placard. "Work Brings Bread," answers another. An  unbounded Expressionist energy collaborates here with the government's adamant  call for order. To eyes steeped in generations of Expressionism, from German to  Abstract to Neo-, the effect is dynamic, charged, immediate. To the German  worker of 1918-19, however, the simple, slashing lines of such images were like  strange babblings in a foreign tongue, suspicious and offensive.  </P> <P> More intelligible, perhaps, were posters in the style of O.H.W. Hadank's "Work  is Deliverance." The bold red block letters confirm the image below, of a  monumental sower, spreading seeds across the new Germany. While the old nation  stands in flames and ruins beneath a stormy sky, the new gleams in the light of  the rising sun, a common symbol of the nascent republic. Radiant and orderly,  the new world thrives through the labor of its citizens, the workers in  distant, churning factories, and the strong, stern-faced sower.  </P> <P> Cesar Klein's "He Who Doesn't Work Digs the Graves of His Children" offers the  same moral in more desperate terms. In the center of the image a group of men  huddles together, idle, hands in pockets, while behind them a factory stands  unproductive and, in front, a mother and her children starve. The mother, gaunt  and humble, clutches a bundled baby, while an older child reaches out toward  the men from her seat on an austere black coffin. Klein's sooty palette,  accented in blood red and touches of yellow, empowers the image with a severity  and urgency certain to prod the soul.  </P> <P> Whether drawn in the violent black shards of Expressionism, in an older, more  staid style of illustrational realism, or a melodramatic mode in between, the  posters here state their case with bold insistence. The contemporary viewer,  however, is faced with a challenge similar to that imposed on the German worker  of 1918-19. While the worker could read the words but not the imagery of the  more innovative posters, the present audience can grasp the power of the images  but not the words. The gallery has provided only sporadic translations, and  without these, the posters shout in a muffled voice, commanding in tone but  elusive in meaning.  </P> <P> The richness of this material, historically as well as visually, deserves a  more thoughtful approach than it has earned here. Thematic groupings and more  precise information about the social and political contexts from which the work  emerged would help it do what it meant to do -- communicate and not just  decorate.  </P> <P> Though the show is named "Novembergruppe," it is doubtful that all of the work  here was made by members of that group. Many of the posters bear the torch  insignia of the Werbedienst, the government's publicity office, but many do  not. A campaign poster for the German National People's Party, for instance, a  faction that remained loyal to the conservative values of the Kaiser's Germany,  seems an unlikely Novembergruppe commission.  </P> <P> This eclectic selection of posters, culled from three private collections,  nevertheless reflects the extraordinarily fickle nature of German politics  between the wars. Even in retrospect, the period refuses a fixed definition.  Its 17 different governments in 15 years suffered contradictions, clashes and  dangerous ambiguities -- problems that this show, too, cannot overcome.  </P> <P> "Novembergruppe" continues at Photowest Gallery (744 G St., Suite 205) through  April 30.  </P></p>

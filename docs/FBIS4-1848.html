			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Entrepreneurs in  Western European countries have become more and more interested  in China's vast market since Deng Xiaoping delivered his  landmark speeches during a south China trip in early 1992.    Western European entrepreneurs, given added knowledge of  China's reality, have seen that the country's reform and opening  policy, which has brought about economic prosperity and social  stability, is not an expediency.    A fever of investing in China has emerged in Western Europe  since 1993. Statistics show that the total volume of  contractual investment in China by EEC countries reached 670  million U.S. dollars during the January-September period of last  year. The development of economic and trade cooperation  between China and Western Europe has been bustling. The trade  volume between the two sides was 15.1 billion U.S. dollars in  1991, 17.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, and up to 26.1 billion  U.S. dollars in 1993.    Taking the lead is Germany. In November last year the two  countries signed over 20 cooperative agreements and letters of  intent involving a total capital of 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.    China's economy has entered a new phase of high-speed growth  since the beginning of 1992, with an annual growth rate reaching  13 percent for two years running, presenting a big contrast to  the economy in Western Europe.    Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti of Switzerland said at a  meeting in Zurich in February of this year that the rise of  China's economy has offered enormous opportunities to Swiss  enterprises. He called on Swiss entrepreneurs to swing into  action by seizing the opportune moment.    Ambassador Pierre Duchateau, head of the China-based  delegation of the European Communities (EC) Commission, told  XINHUA that the EC will enhance cooperation with China in such  fields as transportation, energy, telecommunications and  agriculture.    France is rapidly catching up. An official from the French  Embassy in China told XINHUA that the upcoming China visit by  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur signify the importance  France has attached to its ties with China. He revealed that  the French prime minister will bring with him important  information on the possibilities of cooperation in such areas as  trade, aviation, communications and energy.    An official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that it is the vast potential  market rather than cheap labor that is attractive to foreign  investors. This potential is becoming a reality, said the  official, adding that China's total import volume will exceed  1000 billion U.S. dollars from now to the end of the century.    Another major factor that makes China so attractive is the  country's good investment conditions. China has adopted more  than 500 economic laws and regulations concerning foreigners and  is trying to further perfect economic legislation in this regard.    China's economic and trade system, after 15 years of reform,  has become more conformable to the rules of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the country has laid  a favorable foundation in its infrastructure for further  attracting foreign investment.    While Western Europe aims at China's big market, China is  trying to open up the market of Western Europe. In the  international economic exchanges there exist both cooperation  and competition between the partners.    Duchateau admitted that some Western European countries  sometimes showed a tendency toward trade protectionism because  of economic recession in those countries.    He held that the best ways should be found to settle the  trade conflicts in the international community through  consultation and cooperation between the parties concerned.    The official from China's MOFTEC also held that problems  should be resolved through consultation. China opposes adopting  unilateral restrictive actions without consultation.    He said that China is taking an active part in the  negotiations in an effort to resume its signatory party status  in GATT. China is willing to abide by the stipulations of GATT  and dedicate itself to promoting the development of the world  economy and trade.</p>

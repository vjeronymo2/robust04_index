			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Ju Mengjun </F> (0215 1322 6511)]    [Text] Almaty, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Visiting Premier Li Peng  met with Kazakhstan's businessmen and entrepreneurs in the  commercial center here this afternoon. He stated a six-point  proposition for developing China's economic cooperation with  Central Asian nations.    When Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Kazakh Prime Minister  Tereshchenko, arrived at the conference hall, he was accorded a  warm welcome by several hundred entrepreneurs and economic and  trade officials.    Abishev, Kazakh deputy prime minister and minister of  foreign  economic relations, spoke first. He said: Kazakh enterprises  are greatly interested in developing economic cooperation and  trade with China. China already has some 170 joint ventures  here. They involve a wide range of businesses and play an  important role during the course of Kazakhstan's economic  development.    He said: "Kazakhstan and China are mutually complementary in  economics and there is a great potential for cooperation between  them. Premier Li Peng's current visit will further promote  bilateral economic cooperation and trade."    Premier Li Peng said in his speech: The Chinese Government  attaches great importance to developing economic cooperation and  trade with Kazakhstan. Accompanying me on the trip here are the  persons in charge of five major Chinese corporations dealing in  construction engineering, petroleum and natural gas, iron and  steel, textiles, and import-export of electronic products  respectively. They are here to have direct contacts with  Kazakhstan's enterprises and to explore ways of expanding  cooperation. Extending his welcome to Kazakh entrepreneurs to  visit China, Li Peng said: "Enhancing understanding is the basis  for developing cooperation."    Premier Li Peng stated a six-point proposition for further  developing China's economic cooperation and trade with  Kazakhstan and other Central Asian nations:    1. Cooperation should be based on equality and mutual  benefit, and conducted according to the economic law. In  specific terms, the two sides should help supply each other's  needs, benefit each other, stick to the principle of exchange at  equal values, and basically maintain a balance of trade, which  should be regularized. The setting up of joint ventures should  benefit both or all parties, with the fundamental purpose to  help develop the national economies of relevant countries.    2. Cooperation should be developed in diversified forms.  While barter trade takes up a big portion in bilateral trade at  present, cash payment trade represents the trend of development.  Of course, there must be an adequate means of banking  settlement to conduct cash payment trade. The Chinese  Government fully agrees with the Central Asian nations' hope to  develop economic cooperation with different parts of China, in  addition to the nearby Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    3. Economic cooperation should proceed from the actual  conditions, with full use of local resources. Economic  cooperation follows a course of gradual development from small  to large quantity and from lower to higher level. Market  prospect should be taken into full consideration from the very  beginning of joint ventures. Market demand is an important  factor deciding the survival of enterprises. We should take  full advantage of local resources such as raw and processed  materials, and enable enterprises to bring in good economic  returns with competitive products. To do so, we should give  full play to the role of those enterprises which have both  strength and good reputation.    4. Communications and transportation need to be improved  with  a view to building a new "Silk Road." To further expand  economic cooperation and trade, it is essential to gradually  improve communications and transportation. The Chinese railways  minister and Kazakh transportation minister have held fruitful  talks and reached an important agreement. The two sides should  strive to ensure smooth traffic through the Euro-Asia  continental bridge, to bring benefits to the peoples of all  countries concerned.    5. The small amount of economic assistance China has  provided  the Central Asian nations within its means is only a symbol of  friendship. China itself remains a developing country with a  very low per-capita GNP and faces an arduous task of economic  development. China is providing assistance within its power to  some developing countries, including Central Asian nations, but  the assistance is very small in amount. It is only a symbol of  friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of those  countries.    6. China is willing to develop multi-lateral cooperation to  promote common development. China's open policy is meant for  the developing countries as well as the developed nations,  particularly the neighboring countries. While China will  maintain and further develop friendship and cooperation with  Kazakstan and other Central Asian nations, it is also willing to  see the growth of trade, economic cooperation and friendly  contact between them and other countries. It is a matter of  course that other countries will come to invest and run  factories in Central Asian countries. China is ready to  participate in equal and fair competition. China seeks no  spheres of economic or political influence in Central Asia.    Premier Li Peng's speech won warm applause among Kazakh  economic and trade officials and entrepreneurs.</p>

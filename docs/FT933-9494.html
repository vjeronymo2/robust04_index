			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US and Mexico may thrash out separate deal on Nafta issues CANADA'S trade minister, Mr Thomas Hockin, yesterday prepared to leave Washington, where talks between US and Mexico were still under way on the North American Free Trade Agreement. His departure, to attend a cabinet meeting in Ottawa, fueled speculation that the US and Mexico were negotiating separate deals in the current talks over environment, labour, import surges and financing of a US-Mexico border clean-up. Officials of the US, Mexico and Canada issued a statement that press reports of separate deals over the weekend were 'inaccurate, misleading and false'. Canada has been a firm opponent of a US proposal to create a strong enforcement mechanism if any of the three governments fail to enforce their labour or environmental laws. Mexico has backed a proposal to use the levying of fines for enforcement, but this has been vetoed by key Democrats in the US Congress. At the very least, the US and Mexico are expected to agree to some combination of fines and tariff 'snapbacks' in the event of 'persistent, systematic and unjustifiable' non-enforcement of environmental laws. In Congress, there is concern that fighting over Nafta has 'turned intensely ugly.' US corporations, hostile to labour and environmental enforcement, are believed to be supplying Mexico with proposals to bring to the bargaining table. Ms Lori Wallach, a lawyer of Public Citizen, a citizens' group opposed to Nafta, predicted there would be 'teeth' in the final agreement over sanctions to enforce labour and environment agreements, as the Clinton Administration has often promised, but 'the teeth will be in the large intestine' at the end of 'a long, twisted, tortuous' dispute settlement process. Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, has made little progress in satisfying Ms Wallach and other opponents of the pact. Disputes between the US and Mexico over the environment can drag on for years, critics say, because there are no precise deadlines for investigations and settlement as there are for settlement of commercial disputes. Environmentalists also complain that although the side agreement deals with environmental protection, conservation issues - such as the controversy over drift net fishing - are not included. Labour leaders say they get even less from the side agreements.</p>

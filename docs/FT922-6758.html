			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Russia says Crimea was illegal gift THE Russian parliament yesterday adopted a potentially explosive resolution declaring illegal the transfer of the Crimea peninsula to Ukraine in 1954. Deputies approved by a slim majority a resolution saying the 'gift' proposed by the then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and rubberstamped by an obedient Communist parliament was unconstitutional and had no legal force. The vote, coming hours after the Crimean parliament rescinded an independence declaration under pressure from Kiev, is likely to aggravate the already difficult relations between Ukraine and Russia. It could also expose Russia to a host of territorial claims from other republics and national minorities. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Georgia are already unstable because of disputes over borders drawn under the Soviet era.</p>

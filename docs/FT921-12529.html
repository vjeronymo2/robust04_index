			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Air crash prompts German safety fears THE German Federal Office for Air Safety yesterday joined the ranks of those questioning the sheer quantity of high technology confronting the modern pilot, in the wake of the Airbus A-320 crash in the Vosges mountains. Mr Hans-Ulrich Ohl, spokesman for the air safety body, said pilots were 'under-stretched' by having too much technological assistance. He added this led to 'boredom, which then means that mistakes are not spotted in time'. He argued that pilots now had to relearn everything before flying new aircraft. 'If someone has been flying a machine for 40 years, where the steering is still done by hand, and not electronically, then obviously he has to adapt to the new situation,' he said. His remarks echo suggestions by a number of French pilots this week that the A320's fly-by-wire computer control system can lull pilots into a false sense of security. The crash on Monday, in which 87 people died, has rekindled the controversy over the aircraft's advanced computerised systems. However, the cause of the tragedy remains a mystery. An initial examination of the aircraft's flight recorders recovered in the wreckage had yielded no reason to ground other A320 aircraft for technical checks, Mr Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, France's director of civil aviation, said this week. A study of the cockpit voice recorder also appeared to rule out the icy weather as the cause of the aircraft's sudden loss of altitude on its approach to Strasbourg airport. The French government agreed yesterday to appoint an independent pilot to a commission investigating the crash.</p>

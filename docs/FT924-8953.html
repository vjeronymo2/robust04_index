			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Lisbon Metro extension As part of a design and construct tender, ACER CONSULTANTS and KAISER ENGINEERS will provide design services for a Pounds 50m extension of the Lisbon Metro in Portugal. The tender awarded for this section of the project is designated as Restauradores - Baixa/Chiado and Rossio - Baixa/Chiado - Cais do Sodre. The design and construct consortium consists of contractors Bento Pedroso Construcoes (BCP), Somague and Agroman plus the design firms of Profabril, Acer and Kaiser Engineers. The project involves the construction of 2.6km of tunnel; two new underground stations (Cais do Sodre and Baixa Chiado); and the expansion of two stations (Restauradores and Rossio) to increase platform lengths to receive six car trains. The new works will split the present single metro line into two lines with potential for future extensions. It has been esimated that the expansion of this section will increase the passenger capacity by 40 per cent, helping to alleviate road traffic and parking in central Lisbon. Completion of the project is scheduled for May 1995. Construction methods will include a combination of NATM, shield, cut and cover (top down) and underpinning techniques.</p>

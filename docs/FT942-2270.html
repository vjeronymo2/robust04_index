			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Index stands firm against summer storms - London The stock market has run into a series of summer storms and can take comfort from the fact that the FT-SE 100 3,000 mark has been re-tested and held. This week should have opened against a more reliable domestic background than for some time; at least, the European and UK by-elections are out of the way. But the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England have managed, between them, to scare the market by ruling out tax cuts now and threatening higher interest rates later. The stock market perhaps should have been hurt by the combined Mansion House effect, but in fact was not. Mr Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse Tilney characterises Mr Eddie George's speech as 'innocuous . . . a precautionary statement of the obvious'. The market knows that interest rates may rise this year and is more interested in assurances that the move can be postponed as long as possible. It is not possible to be equally sanguine about the blow delivered to global bonds by the negative turn in the Korean situation. Unfortunately, nor is it possible to say whether the same situation could blow markets about this week. Several City analysts identify one significant feature of the Korean shake-out. 'Despite political concerns, the US dollar has not gained ground,' says NatWest Securities, adding that US bonds would be unable to continue outperforming core European bonds if the dollar continued to disappoint. Given that healthy bond markets are the key to healthy equities, the Korean factor could benefit UK share prices. Nomura Research refuses to see the North Korean developments as any sound reason for a withdrawal from Far Eastern markets but warns that Japanese funds still see US bonds and equities as the best buys. In spite of the problematical outlook on the international front, underlying faith in the current levels of the London equity market remains sound, even if some of the reasons may surprise. Mr Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson does not accept the view that base rates will rise. 'The UK economy is set to weaken sharply. Higher base rates are not justified,' he says bluntly. Kleinwort has reined in its forecast for earnings growth in the non-financial corporate sector to only 10 per cent, compared with a market consensus forecast which started the year at 12.6 per cent and has now been raised to around 13.4 per cent. Most analysts see the UK stock market continuing to move within its existing range for the Footsie of 3,000 to 3,050 - an extremely narrow range by recent comparisons. Stock Exchange volume statistics confirm that institutions are willing traders at these levels.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Trust has entered into an investment management agreement with the Adviser, a registered investment adviser, whereby the Adviser manages the investment of the assets of the Funds and reviews, supervises, and administers all investments of the Funds. Shares of each Fund are distributed through the Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Adviser. No compensation is payable by any Fund to the Distributor for its services. The Winston Company Limited Partnership (the ``Administrator'') serves as administrator to the Funds pursuant to an administrative agreement with the Trust. Under the administration agreement, the Administrator receives a monthly fee from the Funds based on a specified schedule of rates that is based on the Funds' average daily net assets. The Winsbury Service Corporation, an affiliate of the Administrator, provides accounting, dividend disbursing, and transfer agency services pursuant to a separate agreement with the Trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants request a conditional order to permit each portfolio of the Fund to offer an additional class of shares (``Class B shares'') that would be identical to existing shares except that Class B shares would be subject to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder service plan (the ``Plan''). Under the requested order, the existing shares would be ``Class A'' shares that would no be subject to a Plan and related fees. The Plan would authorize each Fund to compensate the Distributor and other securities broker-dealers and service organizations for shareholder services provided to Class B shareholders. Services to be provided under the Plan may include: (a) Establishing and maintaining client/shareholder accounts and records; (b) aggregating and processing purchase, exchange, and redemption requests; (c) investing the assets of clients' accounts in Class B shares pursuant to specified pre-authorized instructions; (d) arranging for bank wires; (e) providing sub-accounting services and preparing tax reports and forms on behalf of shareholders; and (f) forwarding shareholder communications from the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. It currently is contemplated that the service organizations would be compensated at an annual rate of up to 0.20% of the daily net asset value of the Class B shares of each Fund. The fees would be payable even if the amounts paid exceed the service organizations' actual expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The services provided under the Plan are not primarily intended to result in the sale or distribution of Fund shares. Applicants in all cases will comply with article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers as it relates to the maximum amount of asset-based sales charges that may be exposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. All transfer agency expenses and other expenses incurred with respect to a specific class will be borne by that class. All other expenses incurred by a Fund will be allocated between the two classes of shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class. Because of the service fees paid by Class B shareholders, the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on the Class B shares generally will be lower than those of the Class A shares. As a result, the net asset value per share of each class generally will differ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Shares of the Funds generally may be exchanged at net asset value for shares of other Funds. The exchange privilege will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed creation of the Class B shares may result in one class having priority over another as to payment of dividends, and thus be a ``senior security'' as defined in section 18(g) of the Act, and prohibited under section 18(f). The creation of Class B shares, where Class B shareholders would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters concerning the Plan, also may violate the equal voting provision of section 18(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive demands of today's financial services industry. Under the dual distribution system, an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial to an investor given his or her relevant circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants assert that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights in the manner described is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, these arrangements should not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of such class of shares are substantially identical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of the Act was designed to ameliorate. The dual distribution system will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Fund. The arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the dual distribution system suggests that it will facilitate control by holders of any class of shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of a Fund, (b) the exclusive right of Class B shares to vote on matters related to the Plan, (c) the impact of the disproportionate payments made under the Plan, (d) the incremental transfer agency costs attributable to the Class B shares of the Fund; (e) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (f) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (g) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (h) trustees' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (i) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of shares; (j) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by one class of shares; (k) litigation of other legal expenses related solely to one class of shares; and (l) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one or more classes of shares that shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

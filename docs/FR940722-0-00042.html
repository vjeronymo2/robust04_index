			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Where information available to the commission indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the permit applicant is currently in violation of [NDCC Chapter 38&hyph;14.1], [SMCRA], or any law or rule of the United States or the state of North Dakota, or of any department or agency in the United States or the state of North Dakota pertaining to air or water environmental protection, incurred by the applicant in connection with any surface coal mining operation during the three-year period prior to the date of application the permit may not be issued until the permit applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted by OSM in a final rule  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice dated January 9, 1992 (57 FR 807, 816&hyph;17), current NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) is similar to the Federal counterpart provision at section 510(c) of SMCRA, but the Federal provision, unlike the State counterpart, does not contain a temporal limitation upon the violations considered by the regulatory authority in making its decision to approve or deny a permit. The three-year temporal limitation in current NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) renders North Dakota's statutory provision less stringent than section 510(c) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> North Dakota has now proposed to delete the three-year temporal limitation from NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5), thus rendering it no less stringent than section 510(c) of SMCRA. The Director notes that North Dakota's reference to SMCRA in revised NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) is interpreted to include SMCRA, its implementing rules, and all state and federal programs enacted pursuant to SMCRA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  57 FR 807, 811&hyph;812, 816&hyph;818 (January 9, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds North Dakota's proposed statutory revision at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) to be no less stringent than section 510(c) of SMCRA and is approving the proposed change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e), Environmental Protection Performance Standards, Preblasting Survey Criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to revise NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) by requiring that a preblasting survey be conducted by the permittee when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one mile [1.61 kilometers] of any portion of the permitted area. Currently, the North Dakota statutory provision requires such a preblasting survey when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile [804.67 meters] of any portion of the permitted area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA requires that a preblasting survey be conducted when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile of any portion of the permitted area. North Dakota's proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) thus allows a potentially larger group of residents or owners within the vicinity of a mine to request a preblasting survey than is provided for by SMCRA. In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for hich no Federal counterpart exists Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed statutory change at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS;  </P> <P> CAFETERIA STOPS PLASTIC FOAM USE  </P> <P> Students concerned about the environment on the College of the Canyons campus  in the Santa Clarita Valley have persuaded the privately run school cafeteria  to halt the use of plastic foam.  </P> <P> Cafeteria manager Pedro Dalmau said that the change to biodegradable paper  products took place earlier this month.  </P> <P> Members of the campus chemistry club recently researched environmental problems  that can be caused by lightweight, cellular polystyrene that does not readily  decompose in landfills. Club members then wrote to the Santa Clarita Valley  Community College District Board of Trustees expressing their concerns.  However, the board had not as yet addressed the issue.  </P> <P> "Rather than waiting to be asked, the cafeteria was gracious enough to  volunteer to make the change," club president Christopher A. Drap said.  </P> <P> In their letter to the board, club members wrote, "We feel very strongly about  the environment and want to do what we can to protect it . . . ."  </P> <P> The letter cited the effects plastic foam has on the atmosphere and used Cal  State Northridge's recent switch to paper and plastic plates, bowls and cups as  an example worth following.  </P> <P> Efforts last year to convince officials to make the change apparently fell  through because of lack of support, Drap said. This year's success may have  been because of a group effort rather than an effort by individuals last year,  he said.  </P> <P> "It is very exciting to know that we can do something like this," Drap said.  "It is very satisfying."  </P> <P> Dalmau said that the cafeteria, operated by Nature's Harvest, was ready to make  the switch after ideas were thrown around last year. "Maybe other colleges will  change to follow the example," he said. JACI D. ANTRAM  </P></p>

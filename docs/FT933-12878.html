			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Business parks' vacancies at 20% THE AFTERMATH of recession and a surge in development activity in the late 1980s has left a fifth of office space in business parks empty, DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers, have found. Demand fell last year because of recessionary pressures, including the fall in town-centre rents, which removed business parks' cost advantages. The take-up of space last year fell to 3m sq ft, a 75 per cent drop on the peak levels in 1989.</p>

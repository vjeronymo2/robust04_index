			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> 'THE MARKET' IS BLAMELESS THIS TIME;  </P> <P> THE S&amp;L MESS WAS ENGINEERED, AND LARGELY BY DEMOCRATS.  </P> <P> At the Arbatov Institute in Moscow last week, the Soviet expert twitted his  guests about American savings-and-loans: "We have had difficulties in our  public sector, you have had difficulties in your private sector." What? Private  sector?  </P> <P> The people at Arbatov, otherwise known as the U.S.-Canada Institute, are as  bright as people can be who have served a Marxist government for so many years,  from which one concludes that the myth is widespread that the collapse of the  thrifts is a free-market disaster.  </P> <P> Of course, it is not. The $300 billion we hear about every day or two would not  exist as a liability but for government. There is nothing more clearly a part  of the public sector than a government guarantee, and it is government  guarantees that cause the S&amp;Ls to be a noticeable economic phenomenon.  </P> <P> The way the Communists and the Democrats would like to put it, the story goes  roughly as follows: Deregulation was a goal of the private sector, motivated by  greed. Under the Reagan Administration, the thrifts were deregulated, pursuant  to Republican cupidity. Result: The taxpayers are out $300 billion.  </P> <P> That's roughly how Democratic polemicists want to parlay the thrift story,  perhaps nudging Neil Bush up as president ex officio of S&amp;L Inc. Anybody  who believes that ought to work for the Arbatov Institute.  </P> <P> Deregulation is a good idea, and much of it was done under the Carter  Administration. It was then, for instance, that airplane deregulation was done.  </P> <P> What became visible during the 1970s was that there was a credit crunch  stifling the thrifts. This was the result of the deregulation of commercial  banks, which began then to make loans at commercial rates of interest. The  S&amp;Ls pointed out that unless they could compete with the banks, they too  would become extinct. You cannot entice depositors by offering them 4.5% in  interest when the bank next door is offering 7.5.  </P> <P> The most dramatic moment in the history of the S&amp;Ls came when, in the last  year of the Carter Administration, the ceiling on deposit insurance was  unobtrusively raised from $40,000 to $100,000. Four legislators, according to  an eyewitness, met calmly in a back room during a temporary adjournment and  decided to up the insurance. Three Democrats (Sens. William Proxmire and Alan  Cranston and Rep. Fernand St. Germain) and one Republican (Sen. Jake Garn)  simply decided that 100 grand was more like it, and the next thing we knew,  that became the law.  </P> <P> That was a significant raise, which immediately caught the attention of Wall  Street money brokers who were happy to place $100,000 chunks of loose change  with whatever thrift in town was offering the highest interest. What was there  to lose, with Uncle Sam agreeing to guarantee the safety of the deposit? Of  course, the S&amp;L offering the highest interest was the S&amp;L in the  greatest trouble, the thrift that desperately needed cash.  </P> <P> In due course the thrifts turned to Congress with a complaint: We are free to  pay whatever interest we choose to pay to our depositors under deregulation,  but we are not free, under existing legislation, to deregulate our "assets." In  non-banking lingo, they were saying: Certain things we can't lend money on, and  therefore can't make a profit on, so please give us the liberty to move away  from staid old home mortgages, and let us swing like the bankers across the  street. Whereupon the thrifts went chasing after office buildings, fast-food  restaurants and amusement parks. St. Germain, the ever-accommodating House  Banking Committee chairman, went further, with a bill authorizing the S&amp;Ls  to lend up to 100% of an asset's appraised value, never mind that the actual  purchase price was lower. In the words of economist Edwin Rubenstein: "S&amp;Ls  could now lend $2 million on a $1-million project, so long as an accommodating  appraiser could be found. Speculators and swindlers moved in. Their motto:  'Heads I win, tails FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation)  loses.' "  </P> <P> By the time Ronald Reagan took office, 3,300 of the 3,800 thrifts were losing  money. In 1986, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III tried to get through the  Democratic Congress a $15-billion bailout plan -- 5% of estimated current  federal liabilities. It was torpedoed by House boss Jim Wright and our old  friend Fernand St. Germain.  </P> <P> A classic case of the feds making possible an economic catastrophe.  </P></p>

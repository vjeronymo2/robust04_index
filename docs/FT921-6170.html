			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Keating rattles the nationalist sabre THE ROW over Australia's constitutional relationship with the UK appeared to be developing into an election issue yesterday for Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, after he launched a spirited defence of Australian nationalism and criticised Britain's war record. Mr Keating, who recently defeated Mr Bob Hawke as Labor party leader, has come under heavy fire from Australian monarchists and the British tabloid press who claim he insulted the Queen during her state visit to Australia. Their wrath was aroused by a speech in which Mr Keating stressed Australia's independence from Britain, and by his wife's failure to curtsy to the Queen, who remains Australia's head of state. Mr Keating rounded on his attackers yesterday by portraying Labor as the patriotic party, and accusing the opposition Liberal/National party coalition of outmoded nostalgia for British rule. To the fury of his critics, and a number of Tory MPs in the UK, Mr Keating went on to accuse Britain of abandoning Australia to the Imperial Japanese army in 1942 by failing to defend the Malaysian Peninsula, of abandoning Singapore and of attempting to prevent the return of Australian troops to Australia. The allegations are, in fact, relatively uncontroversial in Australia. Historians have long believed that Winston Churchill gave the defence of Burma priority over Australia. However, such a frontal assault by the leader of a Commonwealth country is likely to have caused the British government to wince. A small band of Tory MPs sprang to the defence of the realm. Sir John Stokes said: 'It is quite untrue to say we deserted Australia in the war. We fought in Malaya and Singapore and many British servicemen were killed.' Mr Anthony Beaumont-Dark described Mr Keating's behaviour as 'thoroughly despicable.' 'He is trying to use the Queen for what he thinks is his political advantage,' he said. The Foreign Office was suitably diplomatic. Mr Keating's remarks, it said, 'seem to have been made in a domestic political context and to have been addressed to the Australian opposition'. They may be right. Mr Keating's nationalist sabre-rattling could be a potent vote-winner for Labor if it can depict the conservative coalition as backward looking and ashamed of Australia's developing multiracial culture. Fewer than than 60 per cent of Australians now have a family link with the UK, compared with about 90 per cent just after the Second World War and nearly 100 per cent in 1901, when the continent's six British colonies achieved independence as a single federal state. Mr Keating was careful to say he did not expect Australia to become a republic during his period in office, although he expected the monarchy to be abolished 'eventually'. The small Australian Republican Movement, which has sprung to prominence since the tabloid attacks began, said it hoped public resentment at British interference would grow into support for constitutional change. Senator Chris Schacht, a veteran republican campaigner, said the British media had given the republican cause its biggest boost 'for years'. The republicans plan a national convention later this year to draw up detailed proposals for constitutional change.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  held discussions on what he called "matters of common interest"  with Namibian President Sam Nujoma at his Westbrooke residence  in Cape Town on Thursday morning. The meeting is the first of a  series of four meetings with Frontline leaders scheduled for  Thursday morning.    Mr Mandela said after the meeting that he had exchanged  views  with Mr Nujoma on several issues including proposed Frontline  action on the crisis in Lesotho.    Mr Nujoma said he and Mr Mandela had discussed "bilateral  issues". "We have much in common particularly in terms of  trade. Over 70 percent of Namibia's trade is with South Africa  so we are good neighbours... We wanted to promote that."    He said he and Mr Mandela also discussed the situations in  Angola, Mozambique and Rwanda. "These are issues of great  concern to all of us. We want peace and stability because one  cannot have development where there is no peace."    Mr Mandela also posed briefly for photographs with  Zimbabwean  President Robert Mugabe with whom he has just begun a meeting.    He is also due to meet President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of  Tanzania and Joachim Chissano of Mozambique. All five heads of  state will be attending a southern African economic summit in  Cape Town on Thursday afternoon.</p>

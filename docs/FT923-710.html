			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: ERM rumours plague market THE FRENCH FRANC continued to make gains against the D-Mark in Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism yesterday, although there were persistent rumours in the market about the possibility of another realignment of the ERM, writes James Blitz. The franc appreciated to a high of FFr3.3820 to the D-Mark in European trading and closed at FFr3.3860. Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of France made light interventions in the market to support the French currency, as it showed the first signs of rising above FFr3.40. The intervention was thought to have been tactically well-timed, and, by the close of European trading, dealers were confident that the danger of a franc devaluation had receded. The large differential in French and German overnight rates, which was yesterday about 10 percentage points in the franc's favour, encouraged the purchase of francs. It was therefore far more lucrative for dealers to be long of the French currency over the weekend. However, there were few sign of major investment institutions, like pension funds, reversing their decisions earlier this week to sell francs. The French currency also gained from suggestions that the core currencies of the ERM - the D-Mark, French franc, Dutch guilder and Belgian franc - could move quickly to currency union, transforming Europe into a two-tier currency system. The Belgian central bank governor, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, said that monetary union among the 5 EC countries could start 'immediately.' Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's economy minister, also called for an urgent re-ordering of exchange rates in the ERM, adding to the idea that a realignment of the system could take place this weekend. The head of foreign exchange at a major London-based investment bank said that there was more than a 50 per cent chance of this happening this weekend. Sterling was undermined yesterday morning as investors turned their attentions away from the French currency. The pound dipped to a historic low against the D-Mark of DM2.5090 in intra-day trading, but recovered later in the day to close 0.5 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.5450. The dollar drifted lower in European trading as the French franc's stronger position in Europe undermined perceptions of the dollar as a safe haven. The US currency dropped more than a pfennig to a session low of DM1.4690. It was further undermined by poor US economic indicators, including a 0.1 per cent fall in durable goods orders in August, when a 1.8 per cent rise had been expected. The dollar recovered to close at DM1.4840 against the D-Mark from a previous DM1.4850.</p>

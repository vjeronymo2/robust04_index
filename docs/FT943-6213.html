			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / US may ease immigration for Cubans The US administration is considering relaxing immigration rules to allow more legal Cuban immigrants, in return for a commitment from the Castro government to halt the refugee exodus. The US proposal could be put to Cuban government representatives at migration talks to be held in New York tomorrow. Cuba yesterday said its team would be led by Mr Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and a former foreign minister, in an indication of how seriously President Fidel Castro's goverment is taking the opportunity to talk to the US. However, the US is ruling out discussion of general issues despite President Castro's calls for broader talks, including consideration of lifting the trade embargo against Cuba. The Clinton administration has made it clear that a future meeting on the broader issues of US-Cuba relations will depend on a demonstration of goodwill by Cuba at the migration talks. Mr Michael McCurry, US State Department spokesman, said the US intended 'to solely focus. . . on the question of legal, safe and orderly migration from Cuba', but acknowledged that the Cubans 'believe that there are other issues that may be pertinent to this discussion, so we expect that they may bring those up'. The US offers visas for legal entry to more than 20,000 Cubans each year, but residence visas were granted to fewer than 3,000 Cubans last year. Ms Janet Reno, US attorney general, has repeatedly called on Cubans to pursue legal avenues of immigration and desist from attempting to flee Cuba by boat. Last week Mr Castro claimed the failure to grant more visas had helped encourage the flood of people leaving by sea. The plans to bend immigration rules could include a proposal to grant entry to relatives (including cousins who normally do not qualify) of Cuban-Americans and to offer refugee status to some Cubans even if they do not meet the strict criteria. Ms Reno's office was reported to be thinking of using emergency powers under immigration laws to raise the number of Cubans admitted to the legal ceiling. This could involve allowing some of the 19,700 Cubans waiting for visas, some of them for as long as 10 years, to jump the queue and be granted admission this year. The number of Cubans attempting to cross the Straits of Florida in makeshift rafts and boats dropped over the last few days because of bad weather, but rose sharply again early yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faysal al-Husayni, chairman of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, in Jerusalem, by  Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, on the "Dialogue From Afar"  program; date not given--recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Two days after the dreadful massacre  committed against Palestinian citizens in the Ibrahimi Mosque,  what is the situation in the occupied Arab territories?    [Al-Husayni] The Palestinians in Hebron, who were the  victims  of that massacre, are now living under a strict curfew; anyone  who walks on the street is fired upon. The curfew is imposed on  all other Palestinian towns: Bayt Sahur, Bayt Jala, Bethlehem,  Ramallah, Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqiliyah, and all the Palestinian  towns and villages. People are moving freely in Qiryat Arba',  the center where the crime was planned. Even the closure  decision that the Israelis claim to have made is not in force;  the area is not closed and the settlers are free to leave the  settlement and return to it from Hebron and elsewhere. This  shows the nature of the Israeli approach, which can only produce  other such practices by the settlers--practices that the Israeli  army completes, either by encouraging them or by participating  in them.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is more than one question about the  implications of that criminal act. Was there really collusion  between the Israeli Government or the Israeli army and the  settlers?    [Al-Husayni] Israel's past approach created a particular  Israeli mentality. This mentality is not necessarily exclusive  to settlers; it can also extend to many of the Israeli soldiers,  whose conduct is usually in line with what these settlers want.  For instance, this settler killed 38 Palestinians inside the  mosque. When the worshipers came running out of the mosque to  escape the settler's fire, the army fired on them and killed 15.  This mentality--incriminating the Palestinian just because he  is Palestinian and always finding excuses for the Jew just  because he is a Jew--is the core of the problem. This is what  makes the existence of settlements the adversary of any attempt  to achieve peace. We believe that the settlements' continuing  presence is tantamount to a time bomb that will blow up among us  at any minute. That is why our basic demand is to withdraw the  settlers and end the presence of settlements in the areas from  which Israel will withdraw. While this is being achieved, the  Israelis must disarm the settlers completely.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This horrendous crime makes us pause to  clarify things. How can the Palestinians be completely  protected in the coming stage?    [Al-Husayni] The best temporary measure would be  international protection. But the final formula must be total  Israeli withdrawal from our occupied Palestinian territories.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Then you demand international protection?    [Al-Husayni] We demand international protection. But until  this is guaranteed, several steps must be taken. They should  start by disarming settlers, changing the army's orders to open  fire, and, more importantly, take practical steps in  negotiations by beginning to withdraw immediately from Gaza and  Jericho.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What about continuing peace talks between  you  and the Israeli side?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that any talk of negotiations must be  preceded with an agenda in which the settlement issue takes  priority.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you mean that the issue of settlements  should take a new form?    [Al-Husayni] It is no longer possible to defer the issue of  settlements to the second phase; it must be discussed  immediately.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What will the next Palestinian step be  following this dreadful massacre against worshipers in the  Ibrahimi Mosque?    [Al-Husayni] If Israel wants to maintain the peace process,  it must take these measures. On the negotiating level, we must  start discussing the issue of settlers and settlement and  immediately start to discuss the final solution. Second, Israel  must take practical measures, including disarming settlers and  evacuating the settlers from the areas that might cause  provocation.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much, al-Husayni.    [Al-Husayni] My thanks to you.</p>

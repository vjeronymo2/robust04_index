			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Austrian agency adds to unsold DM mountain The Eurobond market let out a collective groan yesterday as a further DM800m piled on to the mountain of unsold, D-Mark Eurobonds with maturities of more than 10 years. Asfinag, an Austrian government-guaranteed agency, raised DM500m through an offering of 20-year Eurobonds while the German state of North Rhein-Westphalia launched a DM200m issue of 25-year Eurobonds which are puttable after 10 years. 'There is far too much supply of long-dated paper but no demand from investors,' said one syndicate manager who was involved in the Asfinag deal. Sales of Asfinag's bonds were reported to be slow, reflecting a view in the market that they were expensive compared with other long-dated issues. The bonds remained in syndicate overnight but were expected to be freed to trade today. Asfinag's bonds were priced to yield 51 basis points over the 6 per cent German government bond due 2003, which was virtually the same as the current yield spread on LKB Baden Wurttemberg's 15-year Eurobonds. Some syndicate managers said that the yield spread on Asfinag's bonds should have been at least eight basis points wider. Late in the day, the German state of Schleswig-Holstein came with a DM300m issue of 10-year Eurobonds which provide investors with an option to extend the maturity by a further 10 years and receive a higher coupon. 'This is a new structure which turns the puttable bond on its head,' said lead manager JP Morgan in Frankfurt. Merck, the largest pharmaceuticals group in the US, could provide some sparkle to a jaded Eurobond market today when it raises Dollars 250m through its first Eurobond offering. The five-year bonds, via Morgan Stanley, are likely to be priced to yield around 15 basis points over US Treasuries. The tight yield spread reflects the borrower's triple-A rating and the scarcity of corporate issuance in the Eurobond market.</p>

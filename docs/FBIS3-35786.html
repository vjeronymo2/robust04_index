			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Moscow Offers Friendship, </F> Beijing Replies With Polite Smile"]    [Text] Blagoveshchensk-Beijing-Shenzhen-Xi'an-Moscow --  "How do you interpret the concept of `constructive partnership  with the PRC'?" Journalists did not tire of asking Andrey  Kozyrev that question throughout the foreign minister's China  trip. After all, as far as the masses are aware, the formerly  hostile communist giants remain divided along ideological lines  -- democrats are in power in Moscow, while Communists rule in  Beijing.    This is not important in practical politics -- unadorned  pragmatism and a painstaking desire to avoid any potential  conflicts currently define relations between the two capitals.  Nonetheless, it is not yet entirely clear whether the call from  the Russian diplomatic chief to "move from a full normalization  of relations to constructive partnership" will meet with the  response from Chinese leaders that the Kremlin is hoping for.    Addressing members of the PRC People's Diplomacy Association  in Beijing, Kozyrev explained that constructive partnership  includes the strengthening of mutual trust, cooperation on the  UN Security Council, and a qualitative improvement in trade and  economic cooperation, not least in border areas.    But you get the impression that the PRC leadership is in  practice in no hurry to pick up on the ideas brought here by  Kozyrev. It is not simply a question of the traditionally  unhurried style of Chinese diplomacy, but also of the PRC  political elite's lack of confidence about how events in Russia  will develop. For China stability is the key concept of state  life. It was in the hope of stability that Beijing rushed to  show its favor for the State Committee for the State of  Emergency, and was shocked by the collapse of the USSR which  followed August 1991. Since then Chinese leaders have forsworn  support for any specific political forces in Russia, cutting  themselves off from what is happening in our country with a  reliable shield of "noninterference in other countries' internal  affairs."    Interest in events in our country has now increased. Chinese  diplomats have been persistently asking the delegation members  and accompanying journalists about the changes in the Russian  Government and Chernomyrdin's plans. The Chinese are  particularly interested in the personality of the premier. For  the first time recently they can see atop the Russian pyramid of  power someone they can understand and who is close to them in  spirit.    The program for the Russian prime minister's visit to China,  planned for late spring-early summer, has not yet been agreed,  but it can be assumed with confidence that his talks with State  Council Premier Li Peng will mainly address economic issues --  construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations and  Russia's participation in modernizing more than 150 enterprises  built in the fifties with the USSR's help. The Russian side  plans to involve the stricken defense enterprises of Siberia and  the Far East in the latter project. The Chinese are not  rejecting this option, but nor are they rushing to commit  themselves with specific pledges, leaving the door open for the  time being for others who want to participate in the  modernization -- specifically, Hong Kong investors.    Military-technical cooperation remains another sphere of  major mutual interest for Russia and China. Russian arms  supplies to Beijing invariably arouse poorly concealed  irritation in the West, and this was evident from the questions  which foreign correspondents put to Andrey Kozyrev at the final  press conference. The minister was quite dry and hostile in  rejecting the suspicions of behind-the-scenes deals between our  country and the PRC, stating that all contracts concluded in  this sphere have been submitted to the UN register. Western  journalists were clearly unhappy with this answer. The  curiosity of the corps of journalists in Beijing was intensified  by the presence in the Russian delegation of Colonel General  Boris Gromov, deputy defense minister. He did not take part in  the most intensive section of the bilateral talks -- the foreign  ministers' meeting -- but appeared merely at protocol events.  Interest in Gromov was boosted by agency reports on the eve of  the visit about major differences between Moscow and Beijing  over the delivery of Su-27 fighter-bombers. The Chinese are  allegedly refusing to pay for a second batch of aircraft,  insisting that Russia sell them the technology to produce the  aircraft. It should be noted that neither the colonel general  himself nor people in Kozyrev's entourage clarified the problem.  The delegation members literally "clammed up" at the merest  mention of the arms trade.    The Foreign Ministry experts' explanation for the secrecy  over this issue is that they wish to preserve commercial  secrets. Despite this, various rumors and a lack of trust will  undoubtedly continue to accompany the development of  Russian-Chinese military ties.    Whereas the mutual benefits of "constructive partnership"  are  more or less obvious in the economic sphere, in the political  sphere the new concept at first glance holds out more advantages  for Moscow, which is counting on Beijing's support on the issue  of Russia's membership of Asia-Pacific Cooperation (APEC).  Moreover, the Kremlin is expecting help from the PRC in its  attempts to block the spread of Muslim extremism in the former  Soviet republics of Central Asia.    "Beijing has a better understanding than certain Western  capitals of the danger that Central Asia faces from religious  extremism," Andrey Kozyrev stated. He explained that for China,  like Russia, Central Asia is their nearest neighbor. Needless  to say, it is not simply a question of geopolitics -- the  Chinese are worried about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism  among the Uighurs, who make up the majority of the population in  the northwest of the country. Incidentally, the scale of the  Uighur separatism problem in China and the range of issues which  Russia is encountering in the new states of Central Asia are  hardly comparable.    As for our country's membership of APEC, despite the Chinese  leaders' official assurances of sympathy for this desire,  Russian diplomats say that no real support from Beijing should  be expected in the immediate future. Everyone is working on  their own behalf in this area, and the PRC leadership is in no  hurry to act as defender of the interests of a not entirely  understandable or stable Russia.    While expecting few benefits from cooperation with China,  the  Kremlin at the same time cannot ignore the problem of human  rights in the PRC -- a problem which has caused so much lively  interest in the West, and primarily in the United States. So  far the criticism of Beijing from Russian representatives,  including the foreign minister during the latest trip, has been  absolutely unspecific. Kozyrev formulated Russia's official  position as follows: "We are not making this subject a taboo,  but nor do we plan to kick up a fuss about it." Foreign  Ministry experts are privately voicing the following views:  First, we should remember the Chinese political tradition,  which has always placed the interests of state stability above  the interests of the individual; second, we should be as active  as possible in bringing China into contact with the outside  world -- not least through work in international organizations  -- gradually encouraging it to make concessions and to  liberalize the humanitarian sphere.    In the opinion of certain Russian foreign policy department  staffers, the U.S. view of the human rights problem in the PRC  is largely based on short-term considerations linked to the  battle over most favored nation status in trade and the pressure  from the strong Chinese lobby. At any event, Moscow's line  essentially still maintains its continuity with Gorbachev's  famous statement on the Tiananmen Square events of 1989: "This  is China's internal affair."    Russia is expecting a response from the PRC to the idea of  "constructive partnership" and is hoping to get a more or less  clear answer from PRC President Jiang Zemin, who is expected to  pay an official visit to the Russian capital in the late summer  or the fall.</p>

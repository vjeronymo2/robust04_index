			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TASK FORCE LISTS CHOICES FOR LANDFILLS  </P> <P> Taking its cue from the landfill shortage that has developed in North County, a  joint San Diego city and county task force has identified six potential dump  sites in the southern and western areas of the county to replace three that are  rapidly filling.  </P> <P> The task force study of the proposed sites will be presented to the public in  community meetings over the next several weeks, and two or three of the six  will eventually be chosen.  </P> <P> But proposing sites may be the easiest step in the process, officials warned  Tuesday. Overcoming opposition to the desperately needed landfills will be  tougher, as evidenced by the political struggles that have stymied selection of  a new North County trash dump site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> North Versus South  </P> <P> Officials said that gaining final approval for a landfill site or sites in the  southwest section of the county could take as long as seven years.  </P> <P> "You're going to have to have it somewhere," County Supervisor Brian Bilbray  said. "We know we're going to need it in the future."  </P> <P> The search for space in the south is not as pressing as in the north, said  Kathy Lehtola, program manager for the county Department of Public Works.  Whereas dumps in Otay Mesa, Miramar and Sycamore are expected to be full in the  late 1990s, the San Marcos landfill in North County is expected to be filled by  1991.  </P> <P> (The county will take a look at adding the so-called Lowry landfill site to  three already under consideration in North County at a supervisors' meeting  Tuesday.)  </P> <P> "We're really early in the process," said Robert Epler, deputy director of  waste management for the city of San Diego. "From a planning point of view, the  timing of the South County search is better than the North County search. This  represents a good starting point for discussion."  </P> <P> One of the possible sites is in the city of San Diego, while the others are in  unincorporatedareas of the county. Criteria used to identify potential sites  included capacity, accessibility, land use, protection of ground water and  natural resources and visibility.  </P> <P> Lehtola said it will take up to three new sites to accommodate the trash  disposal needs of the region stretching from Batiquitos Lagoon along the coast  to Julian in East County, Campo along the U.S.-Mexico border and back to the  coast.  </P> <P> Although existing waste-reduction and recycling programs might cut the amount  of trash entering the landfills, the sites eventually selected will be able to  handle a "worst-case scenario" of the region's trash needs for 30 years.  Combined, the sites would hold about 210 million cubic yards of solid waste,  officials said.  </P> <P> Approval will be required from a plethora of political bodies, including the  Board of Supervisors, the San Diego City Council, the state Regional Water  Quality Control Board, the county Air Pollution Control District and the  California Waste Management Board.  </P> <P> The sites are:  </P> <P> * Oak Canyon, 300 acres, in the city of San Diego, west of the Sycamore  landfill.  </P> <P> * Long Valley Peak, 700 acres, south of Interstate 8 across from Laguna  Junction.  </P> <P> * Campo Reservation, 350 acres, at the south end of the Indian reservation,  near Tierra del Sol.  </P> <P> * An unnamed site, 400 acres, south of California 94, west of Dulzura.  </P> <P> * Marron Valley, 525 acres, south of Engineer Springs, along the international  border.  </P> <P> * East Otay Mesa, 425 acres, at the far eastern edge of Otay Mesa, near the  border.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposed Landfill Sites  </P> <P> 1. Oak Canyon, in the city of San Diego, West of Sycamore Landfill.  </P> <P> 2. East Otay Mesa, far eastern edge of Otay Mesa, near the U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> 3. Unnamed, South of California 94, West of Dulzura.  </P> <P> 4. Marron Valley, South of Engineer Springs, along the U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> 5. Long Valley Peak, South of 1-8 across from Laguna Junction.  </P> <P> 6. Campo Reservation, at the south end of the reservation, near Tierra Del Sol.  </P></p>

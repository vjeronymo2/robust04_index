			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCIPLINED FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS, OFFICER, DISPATCHER SUE LONG BEACH POLICE  CHIEF  </P> <P> A police officer and a dispatcher, who were disciplined after their views about  the Police Department were published in a newspaper, have filed lawsuits  charging that Police Chief Lawrence Binkley violated their "constitutional  right of free speech."  </P> <P> Officer Greg Roberts and dispatcher Charles Cobbley were reprimanded for  writing letters to the Press-Telegram earlier this year. Both men are now  seeking to clear their records and change the department's practice. The suits  also seek an unspecified amount in damages.  </P> <P> Roberts' lawsuit was filed Tuesday and Cobbley's lawsuit was filed Nov. 3, both  in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Their attorney, James E. Trott, said he plans to file at least three more  lawsuits on behalf of other officers who were investigated or disciplined for  comments that placed the department or the chief in a negative light.  </P> <P> At least eight officers have been investigated, threatened with an  investigation or reprimanded this year for publicly commenting on the  department or on sensitive issues. The remarks were made in forums ranging from  the letters-to-the-editor page to a retirement party.  </P> <P> Binkley has said that officers should have gone through the chain of command to  air their concerns and complaints. Public criticism, he said, is inappropriate.  </P> <P> But the officers complain that their First Amendment rights have been violated.  </P> <P> "The last time I checked, the American flag was still flying in front of that  building," said Trott, the officers' attorney.  </P> <P> Roberts was reprimanded for insubordination and "bringing the department into  disrepute" after his letter was published Oct. 17. Roberts blamed "incompetent  police management" for inadequate patrol staffing. In his letter, he did not  identify himself as an officer.  </P> <P> As a result of the letter, Roberts also may have lost an opportunity to work an  overtime shift, which had been previously approved, according to the lawsuit.  When he questioned why he was taken off the roster for an overtime shift, "he  was advised the decision was made by the administration and no other details  were provided," according to the lawsuit, which also names the city and Police  Cmdr. John Bretza as defendants.  </P> <P> Cobbley was reprimanded for insubordination and violating the department's  policy dealing with professional journal publications after his letter, which  criticized police management, was published May 21.  </P> <P> In his letter, Cobbley specified that he was not speaking as an authorized  representative of the department but as a private citizen. His lawsuit also  names the city and Lt. Michael Kunst as defendants.  </P> <P> Officers say that the informal gag order is partly a result of the growing  tension between management and the rank-and-file, who are battling over a new  contract.  </P> <P> The City Council last week declared an impasse in negotiations, and imposed the  city's contract offer. But the Police Officers Assn. immediately took the issue  to court, and the city agreed to delay imposition of the new contract until a  court hearing Dec. 14.  </P> <P> Many officers have said they want to be free to express their opinions on  department issues -- regardless of where the contract negotiations stand. As a  result of the crackdown, Officer Ray Faraca recently circulated a petition  advocating "freedom of speech," for officers. The petition has been signed by  about 260 officers -- more than 40% of the force -- Faraca said.  </P> <P> The petition said police officers "possess the exact same rights and privileges  that all citizens enjoy and hold so sacred. . . . We can no longer condone the  department's obsession to become the 'one and only voice.'  </P> <P> "We all gave an oath to serve and protect the public but we did not pledge an  'Oath of Silence.' "  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Public Safety Advisory Commission, which oversees police safety  issues, plans to continue its discussion of the department's media policy at  its next meeting Dec. 13. Several commission members have expressed concern  that officers' First Amendment rights may have been violated.  </P> <P> Police administrators say officers can be disciplined for being disloyal or for  violating various policies that, among other things, forbid them from publicly  criticizing orders they receive.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles Police Department, "Officers are free to write letters to  the editor as long as the position they take is identified as their personal  position rather than the position of the department," regardless of whether it  is critical, according to Fred Nixon, a department spokesman.  </P> <P> "There would be no discipline taken . . . for a mere expression of an opinion  or being quoted in the paper or having written a letter to the editor," Nixon  said.  </P> <P> Long Beach Councilman Les Robbins, immediate past president of the 5,000-member  union that represents sheriff's deputies, said he knew of no deputy disciplined  for making statements to the press.  </P> <P> Robbins said he sides "more with those who advocate First Amendment rights."  But, Robbins continued, he also tells cadets at his law enforcement agency that  they can be disciplined for "anything you say or do that can be a disgrace or  dishonor to the department."  </P> <P> Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, an attorney who is considered one of the more  liberal City Council members, has defended Binkley's policies. "I'm not sure  that I would take the same tack as management," Braude said. "But police is a  paramilitary organization, and there has to be a special kind of discipline."  </P></p>

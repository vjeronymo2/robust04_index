			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: EXPOSING THE GRADUATION RACKET  </P> <P> One of the myths of higher education is that students care who their graduation  speaker is going to be. We have recently witnessed the Barbara Bush brouhaha at  Wellesley. Graduates and faculty members have ferociously debated the merits of  having Mrs. Bush deliver a message of significance that will remain with the  Class of 1990 for the rest of their lives.  </P> <P> It is a myth because, according to the recent census figures, 99% of all  students graduating this year will not recall what the speaker said. Twenty  minutes after the ceremony is over they won't even remember who he or she was.  </P> <P> I speak with some authority on this. Over the years I have addressed many  graduating classes, and I found the only measure of a successful speech was to  talk fast and leave out as much substance as I possibly could.  </P> <P> This has been my experience: I have noticed that as soon as I start to speak,  the students look at their watches. Although this is disconcerting, it is not  disruptive. The disruption comes from those without watches who keep asking  others what time it is.  </P> <P> In the midst of making some of my most significant points, foaming champagne  bottles always appear and are passed up and down the rows. Swigging champagne  from the bottle during a commencement speaker's talk has now become the most  sacred of all graduation rituals.  </P> <P> The way many students kill time during a speech is to pull the tassel on the  cap of the person seated in front of them. If the person whose tassel is being  pulled likes the person who is pulling, there is a great deal of giggling. But  if he or she doesn't like the tassel-tugger, then loud, harsh words are  exchanged.  </P> <P> One reason students don't pay too much attention to the speaker is they are  using the time to locate their parents and relatives sitting in the bleachers.  If it's a large ceremony, this requires a tremendous amount of scouting.  Sometimes the relatives are helpful because they start yelling at the graduate.  This, by the way, doesn't do one's speech any good at all.  </P> <P> Another factor making it difficult to get your message across is that students  are much more concerned about their appearance as they walk across the stage to  receive their diplomas than they are with what the speaker is saying. The  conferring of degrees takes place right after the commencement speech, so  everyone is adjusting his or her gown. Some students will decide to take their  bows with their gowns zipped up. Others will leave them open as their first  post-graduate act of defiance.  </P> <P> There are even students who will sleep during your talk, but I have discovered  that it's nothing personal.  </P> <P> The reason that they can't stay awake is because they haven't had any sleep the  night before. The mistake most speakers make is to keep staring at the student  who is sleeping, and this can throw off a speaker's timing something awful.  </P> <P> Of course, in every graduating class there will be a few who bring their  morning newspapers with them, and then turn the pages while you're speaking.  The only way I can deal with this is to say to myself, "Thank God they can  read."  </P> <P> As a speaker, the most important lesson I have learned is: No matter how  pertinent my message, it was not appreciated by the Class of 1990, because the  audience couldn't hear one word of it over the school's 1943 loudspeaker  system.  </P></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bond market decline upsets equities A DECLINE in international bond markets, influenced by worries that the Bundesbank will continue to resist pressure for further cuts in German interest rates, took the shine off a promising performance by London's equity market. In a generally muted trading session share prices made good early progress, led by the Footsie future, before slipping into negative territory as today's national rail strike loomed and the long three-week trading account comes to an end. But dealers said the market was ending the extended account in good shape and there had been a marked improvement in both sentiment and the level of genuine customer business in the market yesterday. Turnover totalled 583.4m shares. The new trading account is expected to bring out some strong support for the market as recent evidence that the recovery in the UK economy is well underway prompts the big institutions to allocate substantial funds to equities for the second quarter. And overseas investors, particularly in Germany, are said to be increasingly interested in the UK equity market, focusing on recovery trends and a strong pound. Mr Ian Harnett at SGST, the French-owned securities house, said he was much more confident that the FT-SE 100 will go to 2,950 and potentially to 3,000 over the current quarter. The 100 index ended the day a net 2.4 lower at 2,839.7 while the FT-SE Mid-250 index continued its recent bout of underperformance against the 100 index in closing 6.8 down at 3,085.9. There was widespread enthusiasm in the market at the outset with trading statements from a number of the UK's leading companies generally receiving a warm reception around the City's dealing desks. The announcement from Forte, one of the UK's leading hotel and leisure groups, of a cut in the final dividend had been well flagged and saw the shares move up strongly. A maintained dividend from Blue Circle plus profits from RMC ahead of the most forecasts led to some aggressive buying of both stocks. Redland, another of the leading building materials shares, attracted keen support after offering shareholders an enhanced scrip dividend. At its best, in mid morning, the Footsie 100 index was up 12 points at 2,854.1. However, a bout of profit-taking, the easier trend in bond markets, and a slightly disappointing opening by Wall Street, which was down more than 15 points on the Dow Jones Average shortly after London closed, saw share prices slip back to close marginally easier on balance. Water and electricity stocks came under the lash again, both sectors plunging as institutions continued to cash in some of the substantial profits in the sectors and switched the proceeds into some of the market's underperformers. The FT-SE Actuaries water index fell 2.9 per cent while the Electricity index dropped 1.7 per cent. The best performer in the Footsie 100 was British Steel, responding to price increases and a much more positive stance on the shares adopted by at least two of the market's leading broking houses. ICI maintained its recent good showing, the shares racing higher as US investors continued to react to the upgraded earnings estimates instigated by one of the top US brokerage houses.</p>

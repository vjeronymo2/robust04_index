			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low-cost CIS smelter clean-up likely THE ALUMINIUM industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States is likely to go ahead soon with a low-cost scheme drastically to cut pollution from most of its smelters. It would cost about USDollars 600m, compared with previous estimates of Dollars 6.6bn to upgrade the CIS plants, according to Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, chief executive of the Kumera Corporation of Finland, which would act as manager of the project. The scheme would go a long way towards answering complaints by the European Community's aluminium industry that it is being forced to shut down modern smelting capacity to make way for exports from heavily polluting CIS smelters. Mr Kumpulainen said that Kumera, a privately-owned group with an annual turnover equivalent to about Dollars 100m, had completed studies at some CIS smelters that showed it would be possible, as an intermediate step, to convert the existing Soederberg operations rather than to move completely to the modern, so-called pre-bake technology. This could be done with well-established technology developed by Reynolds Metals, the US group, which had used it to convert to Soederberg smelters in its own country. 'The CIS industry can afford this scheme but the cost of converting to pre-bake technology is not financially viable,' Mr Kumpulainen declared. As an example of how pollution could be reduced, he said that at one CIS smelter some 20 kg of emissions a year could be cut to only 2 kg. Upgrading the Soederberg lines would also produce huge energy savings because the present power efficiency of 80 per cent would increase to 90 per cent. Ten of the 14 CIS aluminium smelters use the Soederberg process - including the two largest, Bratsk (850,000 tonnes a year) and Krasnoyarsk (800,000 tonnes). Kumera has made proposals to them all. Mr Kumpulainen said work was expected to start at the 60,000 tonnes-a-year Kandalaksha smelter later this year, which would take two years to complete. It would be possible to convert all the CIS Soederberg smelters in two to three years. One side effect of the conversion would be an increase in the annual capacity of each by 8 or 9 per cent. Mr Kumpulainen was speaking during meetings here to arrange the formation of a new organisation to promote and defend the interests of the CIS aluminium industry internationally. Mr Igor Prokopov, president of Concern Aluminiy, the holding company for the CIS industry, said that CIS aluminium output this year was expected to be in line with the 3.2m tonnes produced in 1992. He also expected that official exports would be about the same at 850,000 tonnes. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, a few days ago signed a decree permitting the industry to export 520,000 tonnes of aluminium free of duty to pay for its raw materials, equipment, food and other necessities, he said. Last year's duty-free total was 650,000 tonnes. Russia was taking steps to cut unlicensed and unofficial exports of metal by imposing new customs regulations between itself and other members of the Federation. Mr Prokopov pointed out that the CIS industry was producing at well below its rated annual capacity of 3.5m to 3.8m tonnes mainly because reconstruction was taking place at smelters to improve their performance. However, 'political problems' in Tadzhikistan would this year reduce output at the smelter there to between 300,000 and 320,000 tonnes, compared with its capacity of 520,000 tonnes.</p>

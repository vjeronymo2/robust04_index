			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS, BY TIMES CRITICS: IT'S TOON TIME FOR DISNEY AND TMC;  OTHER CHOICES INCLUDE THREE ATMOSPHERIC FILMS AND A WESTERN SPOOF  </P> <P> WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT  </P> <P> Dense, satisfying, feverishly inventive and a technical marvel, this 1988  live-action/animation blockbuster hit is a sort of inked-in film noir with  outrageous sight gags. Bob Hoskins stars as a seedy gumshoe, and the film's  mystery plot involves a last, great roundup of cartoon stars. Directed by  Robert Zemeckis, with Oscar winner Richard Williams as director of animation.  </P> <P> Friday 7 p.m. Saturday 2:30 a.m. Disney Friday 11 p.m. Saturday 12:30 and 9  p.m. TMC Sheila Benson  </P></p>

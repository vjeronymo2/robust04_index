			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN TRIAL OF REFUGEE  </P> <P> Jury selection began Tuesday in the murder trial of an Estonian refugee accused  of beating and stabbing to death activist Viivi Piirisild in her North  Hollywood house in July, 1988.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said the selection process in the case against Tauno Waidla should  take about two weeks, after which attorneys will begin to present evidence.  </P> <P> Waidla, who faces the death penalty if convicted, admitted the killing to  police a month after it was committed, according to court documents. But his  attorney, Martin R. Gladstein, has said he will seek to have the statement  thrown out because detectives did not honor Waidla's request to have an  attorney present during questioning.  </P> <P> Waidla and Peter Sakarias, who also is accused in the killing, were hailed as  heroes after they deserted the Soviet army and escaped to West Germany.  Sakarias has been judged mentally incompetent to stand trial and has been sent  to Atascadero State Hospital.  </P></p>

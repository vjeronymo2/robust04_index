			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Business in the Community names new chief BUSINESS IN the Community has appointed Ms Julia Cleverdon chief executive. Ms Cleverdon joined the organisation  - whose president is the Prince of Wales  - four years ago from the Industrial Society. She takes over as chief executive of the body, which encourages companies to take social responsibilities more seriously, from Mr Stephen O'Brien. He will be executive vice-chairman. The organisation gains a woman director at a time when one of its leading priorities is Opportunity 2000, a drive to secure a more balanced workforce. Ms Cleverdon hopes that initiatives such as Opportunity 2000 will help ensure that the better male-female balance of BITC's own senior staff would become the norm elsewhere. During the 10 years since the foundation of Business in the Community - partly in response to rising youth unemployment and the redundancies of the last recession  - corporate involvement in the community has become a more mainstream issue in Britain's boardrooms. One of the organisation's successes has been to convince some companies that there is a business case for community activities, rather than just a philanthropic one. Ms Cleverdon sees her role as spreading this message, which is still largely confined to large companies. 'In the 1980s, the measurement of whether a company was making a contribution to the community was largely confined to how much money it gave,' she explained. 'I believe that in the 1990s companies are going to look far more strategically at a whole range of issues  - charitable support, employee community involvement, purchasing policies, recruitment  - and see how they can be fitted into a partnership with the community. Companies need to put their employees' efforts alongside financial assistance to make the maximum possible contribution.' While some industrialists still question whether involvement in the community should be a priority, Ms Cleverdon says that active companies are showing growing sophistication in their approach. She cites Tesco's campaign of offering vouchers in its stores to help schools obtain computers. Even enthusiastic business leaders are concerned that the private sector should not be seen as an alternative to state provision. 'The private sector cannot make a difference alone,' says Ms Cleverdon. 'We have to forge the closest possible links with the front-line parties like community organisations, schools and local authorities. But we must remember that people who work in companies and undertake community activities are not the private sector in an abstract sense. They are parents. They are school governors. They are the community.' Four business leaders have been appointed as deputy chairmen. They are Mr Peter Davis, chief executive of Reed International; Mr Eric Nicoli, group chief executive of United Biscuits Holdings; Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM (UK), and Mr Michael Heron, a regional director of Unilever.</p>

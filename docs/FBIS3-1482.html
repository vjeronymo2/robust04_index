Thomson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] should stop  and consider the catastrophic consequences of their violence,  Democratic Party [DP] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  leader Tony Leon said on Monday.    In a statement responding to killings during a Zulu march in  the city centre earlier in the day, Mr Leon said: "All parties  should now consider the national interest of this country before  pushing South Africa over the precipice into a Bosnian-type  civil war. It is intolerable that the commercial heartland of  South Africa should be paralysed by mass action of this sort.  It is equally clear that not enough is being done to foster a  breakthrough on the kwaZulu issue, and mob tactics of the type  witnessed today take us even further away from a solution."    Mr Leon said the DP understood ANC security guards had taken  it upon themselves to fire live ammunition into the crowds and  said this was "both illegal and grossly irresponsible".    "Both the IFP and ANC should pull back and consider the  catastrophic consequences of their campaign of mutual violence."</p>

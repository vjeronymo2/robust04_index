			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS GIVE BEUERLEIN THE OK TO SEEK A TRADE  </P> <P> Quarterback Steve Beuerlein, at a stalemate in contract negotiations, can do  something about it -- for a price.  </P> <P> "We have afforded him the opportunity to look for a trade," Raider owner Al  Davis said Tuesday. "That was done 10 days ago."  </P> <P> Beuerlein, who finished last season ahead of Jay Schroeder as the Raiders'  starter, earned $140,000 and has rejected an offer of $500,000 from the  Raiders.  </P> <P> Schroeder makes in excess of $1 million.  </P> <P> Beuerlein confirmed that he received a Mailgram from the Raiders that gave him  permission to seek a trade, but said that the Raiders are asking for too much  in return.  </P> <P> "We didn't request a trade," Beuerlein said. "It was their idea, but they set  the compensation very high, almost to a point were they know that there's no  team that would probably buy on it. They want a player of commensurate ability,  which is very vague, or a first-round draft choice or choices."  </P> <P> With Beuerlein out of camp, Schroeder has regained the starting quarterback job  but has been mostly unimpressive in three exhibition games.  </P> <P> Davis denied a report by sportscaster Fred Edelstein of ESPN that the Raiders  will play in Oakland this season. Although Davis said he expects the team to  remain in Los Angeles this season, he evaded questions on when he will decide  between offers from Oakland and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It's unfounded," Davis said of Edelstein's report. "It's erroneous. The only  truth of his statement, which everyone knows, is that we have talked to Oakland  and we are; and we have talked to Los Angeles, and we are. And we're  negotiating with both."  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Tailback Marcus Allen will be out a week to 10 days with a pulled right  hamstring. He was injured in practice Tuesday. . . . Running back Steve  Strachan, who asked to be released because the club is overstocked at the  position, had his request granted Tuesday. A five-year veteran, Strachan rushed  for 174 yards during his career with the Raiders.  </P></p>

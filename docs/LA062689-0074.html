			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEWS;  </P> <P> DUBE'S AFRICAN REGGAE FOLLOWS ALL THE RULES  </P> <P> Lucky Dube is a South African singer who four years ago jumped from the comfort  of Zulu pop to the more uncertain world of reggae. It was a brave cultural  statement for an African to adopt the African-destiny cause of the Jamaican  music, but the artistic results on display in Dube's L.A. debut Friday at the  Palace were mixed. Except for one a cappella choral piece, the wiry performer  made no attempt to blend the music of the homeland with that of the exiles  seeking the homeland. Reggae's politics my be radical, but the musicians tend  to follow the rules.  </P> <P> But if it was standard-issue reggae, at least it was good reggae. Dube's six  fatigues-clad instrumentalists and three colorfully-draped female singers  delivered with a power and precision that were buoyed by a casual, offhand  touch. His sharp-edged voice sometimes took on a Peter Gabriel-like huskiness,  and he could whip out a spine-tingling, Princely falsetto to take things to  higher ground. Dube (pronounced doo-BAY) addresses the usual big issues --  race, politics, theology, romance -- with a fair amount of eloquence, and he  was in constant motion, with all limbs swinging like pistons. Entertaining  enough at first, but after a while Dube came off like a wind-up reggae star.  RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

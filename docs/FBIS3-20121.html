Iran's ambassador was informed of the  decision on Friday 25 March. Press spokesman Invard Havnen, in  the Foreign Ministry, said that the deportation has nothing to  do with the assassination attempt on William Nygaard, Norwegian  publisher of Salman Rushdie's book, Satanic Verses. The Iranian  diplomat has 10 days in which to leave Norway.</p>

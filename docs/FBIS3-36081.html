[no closing quotation marks as received]    This statement came in reply to a cable addressed to the  Naval Headquarters Chief, Vice-Admiral Svyatashov, by his  Ukrainian counterpart, Rear-Admiral Ryzhenko, who has described  the Black Sea Marine Brigade as "a foreign unit on Ukraine's  territory."    The spokesman emphasized that in line with the Yalta  agreement, the brigade, like the entire fleet, is subordinate to  the Ukrainian president. Thus, Ryzhenko's declaration  contradicts the document signed by the president as the Supreme  Commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> A big hit: The smash pop group New Kids on the Block has inspired a  hearing-impaired toddler to begin speaking this fall, her mother said. Dolores  Watts, of Dundee, Md., said her daughter's hearing had been affected at 11  months by ear infections.  </P> <P> "She couldn't speak in sentences or even say mommy and daddy correctly," she  said. Then the 2-year-old saw a New Kids video at a birthday party. The next  morning, she awoke and said her first sentence: "Mommy, I want Joe." Joe  McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg, Danny Wood and Jordan and Jonathan Knight are the  band's members.  </P> <P> Lest We Forget: The now-dead decade gave us this immortal quote from Vice  President Dan Quayle: "Hawaii has always been a very pivotal role in the  Pacific. It is in the Pacific. It is a part of the United States that is an  island that is right here . . . "  </P> <P> The Royals: For the second year running, Princess Anne topped her mother, Queen  Elizabeth II, as the goingest member of Britain's royal family. Anne, 39, who  separated from husband Mark Phillips in August, filled 737 official engagements  in 1989 for public and private groups. The figures are tallied as a hobby by  London insurance broker Tim O'Donovan. The queen came in second place with 592  spots; she was followed by her husband, Prince Philip, who was at 569 events.

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Dublin to lift TV ban on Sinn Fein The Irish government is to lift its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein from January 19, when the present banning order expires, allowing leaders of the political wing of the IRA to be interviewed on Irish TV and radio for the first time in almost two decades. Downing Street responded coolly to yesterday's move, saying it 'noted' the decision, which was a matter entirely for the Irish government. It said a review of Britain's broadcasting ban would not be completed for 'some weeks'. Explaining Dublin's decision, Mr Michael D. Higgins, minister for broadcasting, called the ban 'an appallingly blunt instrument . . . which removed broadcasters' discretion and authority'. He said the onus would now be on the independent broadcasting authorities to prevent views being aired which would incite crime or violence, and which could be sanctioned under other provisions of the Republic's broadcasting legislation or criminal legislation. 'The Irish people abhor violence and those who support violence should be submitted to critical questioning like everyone else. Cloaking them is against the public interest,' Mr Higgins said. The minister said that a review of the ban had been under way for more than a year, before the present Anglo-Irish peace initiative. He said the lifting of the ban was made for 'broadcasting reasons and not as some kind of sop to Sinn Fein', although he said current efforts to persuade the IRA to abandon violence and bring Sinn Fein to the negotiating table provided 'a very important context' to the decision. 'The atmosphere is very different to when the ban was first introduced (in 1976),' he said. Mr Joe Mulholland, director of news for the state TV and radio station RTE, said the decision was 'a step forward'. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, also welcomed the decision, saying it 'was long overdue'. Labour welcomed the move and said the British ban should be lifted 'as soon as possible without prejudice to the recent Anglo-Irish declaration'. But Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, said she was 'reticent to call for it to be lifted today'. Mr Michael Mates, former Northern Ireland minister, said he hoped the British ban would not be lifted 'unless and until' the IRA ended its armed campaign. Three policemen were injured in a bomb attack on their Land Rover in east Belfast last night.</p>

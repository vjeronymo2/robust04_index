			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. A, 25, a Chinese man who borrowed videotapes of  public executions from PRC authorities which were used in a TV  Asahi (president, Kunio Ito) special news program "The Scoop"  and which allegedly proved to be "fabricated," answered SANKEI  SHIMBUN's questions in a telephone interview from his hiding  place in South America on 24 April.    During the interview, Mr. A admitted he had appeared as an  armed policeman in the program, had been investigated by the  authorities after the program was aired for disclosing state  secrets, and had subsequently fled to South America. He also  revealed that his mother, who is a public security cadre, was  the one who actually borrowed the video footage; she and a  number of others who helped in filming the Asahi program were  later arrested. He also admitted that this affair has had  serious consequences.    Mr. A acted as coordinator (interpreter and guide) who  sub-subcontracted for Asahi's subcontractor production which  conducted location shooting in Fuzhou in Fujian Province, China.  Mr. A's interview was conducted for approximately one hour with  Tadao Kasahara, president of "Damu" [name as published], the  production which produced the news program in question.    On 2 April, TV Asahi used up all its air time for "The  Scoop"  to look into the above program in question. It admitted the  special program had been fabricated. However, the interview  with Mr. A was the first time Asahi admitted fabrication after  trouble occurred in China over how the video footage was  obtained. TV Asahi will now have to deal with the consequences.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of "exclusive" interview with President Cesar </F> Gaviria by ``special correspondent'' Pablo Biffi in Gaviria's  office on 24 May; copyrighted by CLARIN]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Biffi] When Colombian drug  trafficker Pablo Escobar escaped from jail in 1992, it was said  the United States had been preparing his abduction ...    [Gaviria] No, I do not believe the United States wanted to  abduct Pablo Escobar in violation of a Colombian legal order.  As I have already said, Escobar escaped thanks to his huge  power to corrupt. He escaped because we prevented him from  pursuing his criminal activities from jail. Colombia did away  with Escobar and may yet defeat drug trafficking.    [Biffi] You have restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. As  OAS secretary general, will you promote Cuba's reintegration  into the OAS?    [Gaviria] On an issue like Cuba, the OAS secretary general  may not adopt an attitude different from that of other members.  Nevertheless, I believe there is a perception in America that we  can encourage Cuba to implement economic and political changes.  This involves their opening to other social segments and  holding elections the way we understand them in other countries  so that Cuba may rejoin the inter-American system.    [Biffi] Are these changes a nonnegotiable condition for  Cuba's reintegration into the OAS?    [Gaviria] It may be perceived in our continent that if Cuba  takes these steps, its reintegration may be possible. Likewise,  if Cuba does not take these steps, its reintegration would be  somewhat difficult.    [Biffi] The United States has threatened military  intervention in Haiti. Would you support this type of measure?    [Gaviria] I can only express my opinion as president of  Colombia as I must be cautious because I will encounter this  problem as OAS secretary general. Our country's policy has  always been to exercise full diplomatic and economic pressure on  Haiti's de facto government seeking the reinstatement of  democratically elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide in his  post. We have never made a decision on military intervention  because we have never had to make such a decision in the OAS or  in the United Nations. Therefore, we have not taken a position  on this issue because we are convinced that diplomatic and  economic pressures may yield results.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Matisse Thief Fined: A burglar who broke into the former apartment of artist  Henri Matisse in Nice, France, and stole a cache of paintings last December has  been fined $1.6 million for damaging the works.  </P> <P> The Correctional Tribunal of Nice also handed down a three-year suspended  sentence to Frank Cochet, who stole $12.9 million in paintings. Police said  Cochet damaged several works as he ripped them out of their frames. Art  restorers said the damage done to the works would require the amount of the  fine to repair. The damage to "Pink Nude" alone depreciated its value from $4.3  million to $1.2 million. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

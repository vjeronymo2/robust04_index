			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / German Elections: Unemployment fails to excite German voters In the depressed Lausitz region of east Germany, where some towns have a jobless rate of more than 20 per cent, a trade union official says that housing is a bigger election issue than unemployment. In Hamburg a Social Democrat candidate for the Bundestag admits that no party has 'the easy answers' to high unemployment. Not for the first time in a recent European election both the parties and voters claim that combating mass unemployment is their number one issue, yet they do not seem to believe it. 'There is a ritualistic quality to the debate, heightened by the fact that the political extremes have not prospered from high joblessness and that unemployment in both parts of Germany is now actually falling,' says Mr Robert Leicht, editor of the liberal weekly paper Die Zeit. It is true that the state of the labour market remains far from rosy. Average unemployment in west Germany is 7.9 per cent and in east Germany is 13.8 per cent. Most economists believe that unemployment will fall only slowly and could even rise again. They also point out that in many parts of eastern Germany real joblessness is often double the official rate once early retirement and state job creation are counted in. Nevertheless, the Social Democratic party, which has placed most emphasis on unemployment, does not seem to have benefitted thereby. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, last week told a trade union conference in Hamburg that there would be 700,000 fewer unemployed if the training measures of three years ago were restored. While the Christian Democrats place less stress on unemployment they are strongly promoting an increase in part-time work, which headed a recent poll on the best measures to reduce joblessness. The CDU benefits from its image as the party of business, especially in east Germany where the ability to attract new investment is regarded as crucial. In west Germany there is still usually a correlation between areas of high unemployment, such as Bremen, and voting for parties of the left. In east Germany, where the political landscape has not yet settled, that is not the case. Towns and regions are still shifting from right to left or vice versa, often depending on local personalities, and some of the areas of highest unemployment - in Saxony, for example - are strongly CDU. The party of Democratic Socialism - the former east German communists - is the only one calling for a positive right to employment. But judging from a meeting last week in Cottbus, addressed by the former communist leader Mr Hans Modrow, its support is drawn from the senior bureaucrats of the old regime - many of whom have switched to running 'businesses' funded by western grants - and not the eastern unemployed. Without any advertising, Mr Modrow attracted about 250 people to his meeting. Later the same evening in the main square in Cottbus, close to the Polish and Czech borders, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD and one of the best speakers in German politics, attracted only about 350. Mr Lafontaine is not popular in east Germany. 'I hate him, he's a champagne socialist who doesn't like easterners', said one worker in Sachsen Dorf, the depressed suburb of Cottbus. His speech dwelt mainly on how he had told the truth four years ago as SPD Chancellor candidate and how Chancellor Helmut Kohl had lied about the economics of unification. When he did eventually turn to the issue of unemployment - which has been as high as 18 per cent in the Cottbus region - his audience seemed less not more interested. 'Getting rid of the Russian troops was a bigger issue here,' said one SPD official.</p>

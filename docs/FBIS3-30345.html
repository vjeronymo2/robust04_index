			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- French General Philippe  Mercier, member of the chief of staff [as received], said on  Tuesday that Bosnian Muslims have completely turned to the war  option after they captured arms factories in the latest fighting  (against Croats) in the central part of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Gen. Mercier told the press that, thanks to financial  support  of Islamic countries, Bosnian Muslims continue to arm themselves  because arms and ammuntion, even a certain number of rockets,  can reach them across borders of the former Yugoslavia despite  the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the former Yugoslavia.    This is the first time in France that a high military  official openly spoke about the amply arming of the Bosnian  Muslims and the aid they were receiving from Islamic countries.    French military sources assessed that Muslim forces loyal to  Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic numbered around 85,000  troops, possessed between 20 to 30 tanks, around 350 cannons and  a score of helicopters and airplanes.    Gen. Mercier confirmed reports that "several units" of the  Croatian Army were in Bosnia-Herzegovina helping Bosnian Croats  in the fighting against Muslims in central Bosnia-Herzegovina.    French sources claim that the forthcoming meeting of the  European Union foreign ministers, to be held in Brussels on  February 7, will discuss the possible imposing of economic  sanctions against Croatia due to its direct military involvement  in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

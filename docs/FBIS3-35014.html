			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Doron Me'iri] </F>   [Text] The number of terrorist attacks in Jerusalem fell  sharply in 1993 compared with 1992. This emerges from data  released by Yehuda Wilk, commander of the Israel Police  Jerusalem District, summing up the 1993 work year.    The severity of the attacks, however, did not change: three  people were killed and 17 wounded in 1993 compared with three  killed and 12 wounded in 1992.    The number of car torchings dropped significantly: 267 cars  were set ablaze in 1993 compared with 448 in 1992. Stone  throwing also decreased sharply: 2,731 incidents in 1993 as  opposed to 3,640 in 1992. The same applies to firebomb attacks:  64 in 1993 as opposed to 91 in 1992.    There were 24 stabbings and attempted stabbings in 1993  compared with 27 in 1992. Three bombs were planted in 1993  compared with 14 in 1992. The number of shooting incidents  remained unchanged: five instances in both 1992 and 1993.    Commander Wilk attributed the drop in terrorist attacks to  "aggressive intelligence methods adopted by the Jerusalem  police." According to him, "terror-related problems cannot be  solved by deploying huge numbers of policemen and are best  handled by small intelligence teams."    In 1993, the Jerusalem police arrested 350 Arabs suspected  of  having participated in disturbances, including stone-throwing  incidents; 15 suspected of hurling firebombs; and 60 suspected  of torching cars.</p>

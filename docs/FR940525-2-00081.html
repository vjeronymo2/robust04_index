			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Plan acquired the Whole Loans in four blocks for an aggregate purchase price of $2,089,978. The Plan earned $1,488,791 in income with respect to this investment and it paid total servicing fees of $122,290. The loans underlying the Whole Loan Blocks represented first lien interests on residential property and had coupon rates ranging from 6.375 percent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9 percent. None of the individual borrowers was a party in interest with respect to the Plan. No delinquencies, other than occasional late payments, were ever documented with respect to the Whole Loans. Further, no restrictions were ever placed on the sale of transfer of this investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Whole Loan Block  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  consisted of nine loans which the Plan purchased from the Mellon National Mortgage Corporation of Colorado Profit Sharing Plan Trust, an unrelated entity, on November 16, 1979 for $152,578.

The applicant states that the agreement between the Plan and Midland Federal at the time these Whole Loans were purchased stipulated that the Plan would earn 8.75 percent and that the servicer would retain the full coupon rate.

On July 23, 1990, the Board of Directors of WCIC adopted a Restated Employees' Retirement Fund Agreement which covered employees of WCIC and its related companies. The Plan then became a section 401(k) cash or deferred compensation plan effective January 1, 1991. In the process of converting the Plan, the Trustees determined that they should seek outside investment expertise and provide participants with a choice of investment vehicles. Therefore, in October 1990, the Trustees selected Brinson Partners, Inc. (Brinson) of Chicago, Illinois to manage the alternative investment vehicles to be offered to participants. In addition, an existing block of WCIC stock was delivered to Brinson to dispose of at its discretion. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Other than the WCIC stock, the goal of the Trustees was to liquidate all of the Plan's other assets and to deliver cash to Brinson which would be invested at the direction of the participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant represents that such stock constitutes qualifying employer securities within the meaning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 407(d)(5) of the Act. However, the Department expresses no opinion, herein, on whether the stock satisfied the terms and conditions of section 407(d)(5) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From October 1990 through the end of 1990, the Trustees proceeded to liquidate the Plan's investments. The bulk of the liquidations took place in December 1990. However, certain of the Plan's assets, including the subject Assets, were difficult to sell, primarily due to their small investment size and high servicing costs. Therefore, the Trustees believed their only alternative was to sell the Assets to Bank Western. Thus, the trades were arranged on December 27, 1990. The Plan paid no fees or commissions to Bank Western in connection with the sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The following Asset Summary Table reflects, in pertinent part, the status of the Assets at the time of the December 1990 sale. In addition, the table shows the Asset sales that have been exempted by the Department and discussed further herein in Representation 7. Presented below are descriptions of the Assets as summarized in the table.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Warning by French left France's ruling Socialists launched their campaign for next March's election yesterday with a warning that their forecast rout would give the political right boundless control over the state. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy told a seminar of Socialist election candidates a parliament totally in the hands of right-wing parties would be 'a darkroom.' Mr Edmond Alphandery, a centrist politician, yesterday turned down the job of France's junior European Community Commissioner, saying he would rather run for re-election to the French parliament next spring, writes David Buchan in Paris.</p>

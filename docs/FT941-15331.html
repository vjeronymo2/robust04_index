			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Medeva US rehabilitation The US Food and Drug Administration has rehabilitated a US subsidiary of Medeva, the UK drugs company, seven months after it issued a warning that a plant in California did not meet production standards. Last June, the FDA followed up its warning by asking US government agencies not to renew contracts with MD Pharmaceutical, whose plant near Los Angeles had been criticised. Medeva said that the FDA, 'had determined that (MD) may once again be considered as a supplier of drug products to agencies of the US government.' Mr Bernard Taylor, Medeva's chairman, said that the total cost to the company of meeting the FDA's criticisms had been about Pounds 1m. There would be further annual costs of 'less than Pounds 1m' in maintaining the new practices at the plant. No contracts had been lost during the last seven months, said Mr Taylor, because the first renewal dates were not until March. Sales of the drug made at MD's plant - an amphetamine called methylphenidate  -were worth Pounds 23m in 1992.</p>

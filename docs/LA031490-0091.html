What good is it to play a (tough  regular-season) schedule if it doesn't mean anything at the end?" Bonvicini  asked after learning Long Beach (24-8) had been placed in the West Regional  with second-ranked Stanford and fifth-ranked Nevada Las Vegas.  </P> <P> If the 49ers beat Cal (17-11) tonight, they travel to Nacogdoches, Tex., for a  game against No. 6-ranked Stephen F. Austin (27-2).  </P> <P> Stephen F. Austin is one of the top four seeded teams in the regional.

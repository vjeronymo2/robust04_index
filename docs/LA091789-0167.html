			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UCLA CATCHES SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> BRUINS WIN, 28-25, ON SNEAK BY JOHNSON WITH 2:39 LEFT  </P> <P> No. 20 UCLA needed a one-yard touchdown sneak by quarterback Bret Johnson with  2:39 to play to score a 28-25 comeback victory over winless San Diego State  Saturday night before 31,639 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Johnson's touchdown came a little more than four minutes after running back  Darrin Wagner's 31-yard touchdown run had given the Aztecs (0-2) a 25-21 lead.  </P> <P> The touchdown capped a nine-play, 57-yard drive that allowed the Bruins (1-1)  to avoid their first loss ever in 13 games against the Aztecs.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of these kids," said SDSU Coach Al Luginbill, "and tonight everybody  saw why. I see it in practice every day."  </P> <P> Said SDSU quarterback Dan McGwire: "This offense can explode any time. It's  volatile, especially the running game. We just fell short tonight. These games  are hard; we're trying to keep our heads high."  </P> <P> If there were any question that this would be some UCLA team other the one that  lost to Tennessee, 24-6, in its opener the week before, it was dispelled early.  </P> <P> All it took was a 73-yard run for a touchdown on a fake punt by senior nickel  back John Wesselman to give the Aztecs a 7-0 lead with 3:49 left in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> It was the first time since this 67-year-old series was resumed in 1984 that  San Diego State led in a game. The run was a warning that this game would be  closer to UCLA 18-15 victory in 1984 than than the lopsided UCLA victories of  the next four years.  </P> <P> In the early going, the Bruins looked like anything but the top 20 team they  are. They struggled to take a 14-10 halftime lead against a San Diego State  team that had lost at Air Force Sept. 2 in its opener, 52-36.  </P> <P> This also was the same Aztec program, though not the same team, that the Bruins  had beaten the past three years by a combined score of 151-34. But regardless  of improvement the Aztecs showed this time, the Bruins demonstrated many of  their problems were their own doing.  </P> <P> They again had difficulty defensively. They yielded 234 yards to the Aztecs in  the first half; that was as many as the Bruins gave up to the Aztecs in their  entire 59-6 victory in the Rose Bowl last year. And unlike past years when they  were able to physically overmatch the Aztecs on both lines, San Diego State  held its own up front.  </P> <P> This appeared to be a much more brazen Aztec team than the Bruins were used to  playing. Luginbill, was not afraid to gamble on big plays.  </P> <P> He not only successfully used the fake punt, but risked a throw to the goal  line late in second quarter on fourth-and-one from the UCLA 21. That pass by  McGwire was intercepted by strong safety Matt Darby, but the message again was  clear: This San Diego State team was not about to roll over.  </P> <P> The Bruins appeared ready to exert their traditional dominance of the Aztecs  midway through the first quarter, starting a long drive that took them deep  into San Diego State territory. But the drive ended abruptly with an  interception and the Aztecs then turned to a touch of trickery.  </P> <P> UCLA had moved to the Aztec 27 when Johnson attempted to complete a pass to  tailback Brian Brown. But the ball was high and Brown could only tip it over  his head and into the hands of San Diego State cornerback Clark Moses at the  Aztec 17.  </P> <P> Moses returned the ball five yards to the San Diego State 22. The drive stalled  after three plays netted five yards, and the Aztecs went into punt formation.  But instead of snapping the ball to punter Joe Santos, the ball was hiked to  the short man, Wesselman.  </P> <P> Wesselman, a senior from West Torrance High School, took the snap and dashed  around the right side untouched. He eluded Shawn Wills, who had been set up as  the return man, at the UCLA 45 and then outraced strong safety Mark McGill to  the end zone.  </P> <P> "We worked very hard on our kicking game," Luginbill said. "I told me club if  we work on something very hard, we're going to use it in the game."  </P> <P> The Bruins wasted little time responding. They went on their longest drive,  moving 79 yards in eight plays to tie the score at 7-7 on a 38-yard pass to  flanker Scott Miller from Johnson with 12 seconds left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The Bruins went ahead 14-7 on their next possession. This time they went 71  yards in 10 plays, the drive ending on a one-yard dive by freshman tailback  Kevin Williams.  </P> <P> The touchdown drive put the Bruins ahead for the first time, but it had a  price. Wills sprained his right ankle midway through the drive and did not  return. Wills, who led the Bruins with 62 yards on 11 carries against  Tennessee, had 29 yards on four carries against the Aztecs. His departure left  Brown to carry the rushing load.  </P> <P> Brown finished with 99 yards on 32 carries.  </P> <P> The Aztecs tried their second gamble on the next series. Faced with a  fourth-and-one at the UCLA 21, the Aztecs not only elected to go for a first  down rather than attempt would have been a 38-yard field goal but tried to gain  the yardage through the air.  </P> <P> McGwire attempted a pass to Jimmy Raye near the left front of the end zone, but  Darby stepped in to make the interception.  </P> <P> But the Bruins could do nothing with that bit of good fortune and the Aztecs  took over at their 40 with 2:56 left in the half after a 52-yard punt by Kirk  Maggio.  </P> <P> The Aztecs went into their two-minute offense, driving for a fourth-and-one to  the UCLA 9 with 10 seconds left. The Aztecs used their last time out to set up  for a 26-yard field goal by Andy Trakas that cut the lead to 14-10.  </P> <P> The Bruins had a chance in the third quarter to again go ahead by a touchdown,  but Alfredo Velasco's 42-yard field goal attempt with 10:54 left was low and  was blocked at the line by lineman Brad Burton.  </P> <P> The third quarter ended scoreless, but that was only because the clock ran out  two plays before the Bruins could add their third touchdown.  </P> <P> But like most else in the game, this did not come easily either for the Bruins.  They needed two tries from less than a yard away before Williams finally snuck  around the left side for his second touchdown and a 21-10 lead at 14:18.  </P> <P> The first attempt ended with fullback Maury Toy being stopped as he attempted  to crash the middle of the line. The second was successful but only because of  the persistence of Williams, a freshman from Spring, Tex. He tried the left  side, and when he found no opening, he kept sliding farther outside, eventually  getting by two Aztec defenders and into the end zone.  </P> <P> But the Aztecs would not go away. They drove 74 yards on 10 plays on their next  possession, which ended when Wagner slipped around the right side for a  one-yard touchdown run with 11:24 to play.  </P> <P> The gambler in Luginbill came out again on the conversion, but not before a  momentary mix-up. Luginbill apparently wanted to try for a two-point conversion  but before the team could get the word, Trakas attempted a conversion kick  while McGwire was running on the field and the Aztecs were called for too many  men on the field. But the penalty turned out to be the break the Aztecs needed.  </P> <P> That gave them a second chance to get McGwire on the field. And this time he  completed the two-point pass to Raye in the end zone. That brought the Aztecs  to within 21-18 where a field goal could have given them a tie and a moral  victory.  </P> <P> But safety Morey Paul and Wagner would combine a few minutes later to give them  more than that.  </P> <P> On the third play after Wagner's touchdown, Paul intercepted the second Johnson  pass of the game at the San Diego State 47.  </P> <P> At first, it appeared as if the Aztecs would not benefit as a holding penalty  and sack forced them into a third-and-31 at their 27. But McGwire connected on  a 30-yard pass to wide receiver Dennis Arey on third down. And then another  Aztec gamble worked when McGwire snuck over for a first down on a  fourth-and-one to keep the drived alive at the UCLA 42.  </P> <P> Three plays later, Wagner dashed down the right side for his second touchdown  -- a 31-yarder that included a move that left free safety Eric Turner on his  rump.  </P> <P> That gave the Aztecs a 25-21 lead and forced the final Bruin rally.  </P></p>

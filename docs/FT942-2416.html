			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / China warms to Hong Kong task: Beijing is talking of improved relations with the UK One of Hong Kong's few remaining colonial mansions, painstakingly restored to its full 19th-century splendour, is the venue this week for a test of whether an apparent thaw in Sino-British relations is real or imagined. A three-day meeting begins tomorrow at 28 Kennedy Road, in Hong Kong's fashionable mid-levels district, of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), the body established to oversee the nitty gritty of Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997. The meeting - the 29th JLG since 1985 - comes at a time when Hong Kong has been encouraged to hope for an end to the political stand-off which has held up a critical revision of the colony's law, and vital infrastructure projects such as a container terminal and new airport. Since the spring, Beijing has been sending signals that China wants to get back to business with Britain and resolve outstanding issues about Hong Kong. The strongest indication came last week with a report that Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, had spoken of the need to 'correct and improve' relations with Britain. On Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, while declining to confirm Mr Qian's remarks made last Tuesday to a visiting group of Hong Kong trade unionists, said: 'The Chinese side hopes that the difficulties on the question of Hong Kong will not affect ties between the two countries in other areas.' The most compelling explanation for China's apparent change of heart is self-interest. At the end of this month there will be just three years to go until China resumes sovereignty over, and responsibility for, Hong Kong, and much needs to be done. According to a senior Hong Kong government official, Beijing's appreciation of the difficulties of achieving a smooth transition without active British assistance is beginning to override hostility towards Governor Chris Patten and his administration. Negotiations for the financing of the colony's HKDollars 158.2bn (Pounds 13.6bn) airport project, conducted in earnest for the past two months after earlier delays, may have now entered the final phase. China has promised a meeting of the Sino-British committee to discuss airport finance before the end of the month. The Hong Kong government last week said it would go to the Legislative Council (LegCo) on July 1 for HKDollars 15bn of financing to build the airport terminal and runway. Both sides say their differences are small. But a possible snag is that the timing for the meeting on the airport may coincide with a LegCo vote on June 29 on Mr Patten's democracy legislation. However there are signs that Beijing has put the row about Hong Kong politics behind it and wants to move on. Hong Kong government officials have also been heartened by China's request that the development of the colony's container terminal be included on the agenda for this week's JLG. Approval for both projects was held up pending the outcome of bilateral talks about Hong Kong's political development. These talks ended last year with Mr Patten going it alone. China has always said it is concerned about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, a claim which would be difficult to sustain if it continued to hold up projects vital to Hong Kong's economic well-being. Although many signs of improvement can be identified there are, as yet, no agreements. Indeed, an accord on the issue of military land, which the UK had hoped to sign at this week's JLG meeting, dissolved before British negotiators' eyes a month ago. The Hong Kong government had undertaken to build and outfit a naval base large enough for a modern aircraft carrier. But Chinese negotiators have demanded a large increase in the naval base's size and also want to keep a lot of the military land which they had previously agreed to return to the government. In spite of the setbacks, the UK has attempted to encourage a more moderate line from Beijing by avoiding policy measures which might anger China. As one Foreign Office official put it: 'In my judgment, the community is thoroughly fed up with confrontation. It is much better to slow things down and handle the essentials in a steady way.' Over the past month, and to the disenchantment of pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong, Mr Patten has rebuffed calls for a freedom of information law, a human rights commission, and visas for two leading Chinese dissidents wanting to speak at a meeting commemorating the June 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Some officials claim that the confluence of these events was simply coincidence, but democracy activists believe that Mr Patten and the British government do not have the stomach for a fight.</p>

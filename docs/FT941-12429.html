			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Maastricht 'should be put off for 10 years' The Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union should be delayed for 10 years, Mr Uwe Jens, economic policy spokesman for Germany's opposition Social Democrat party, said yesterday. During a visit to London, Mr Jens said the 1999 target date for Emu should be extended by 10 years, since Germany and other EU members were not able to fulfil the economic criteria for membership of a currency union. According to opinion polls, the SPD stands a good chance of taking power or sharing it in a coalition with the ruling Christian Democrats after Germany's elections in October. Although Mr Jens stressed his remarks were not official SPD policy, they will strengthen the impression that Emu has slipped well down the political priorities of both leading German parties. Mr Jens said he wanted all 12 members of the European Union to join Emu simultaneously, as Europe could 'split up' if a small group went ahead first. He coupled his remarks on Emu with a plea for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates faster to spur economic growth. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, was less independent than the SPD would like him to be, in view of his political links to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. If the SPD came to power, it would probably raise some taxes on consumption and environmentally damaging products to help finance public spending on job creation. 'Our main goal is to reduce unemployment,' he said. However, he ruled out heavy deficit spending, as public sector borrowing was already too high. Reflecting the need to save budgetary funds, Mr Jens said he 'did not rule out' that an SPD government would seek to renegotiate Germany's contributions to the EU.</p>

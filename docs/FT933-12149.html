			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: A vintage year at Drottningholm - Opera ELISABETH Soderstrom's long and glorious career in opera began in 1947, on the stage of the Drottningholm Court Theatre (she sang Mozart's Bastienne). The latest development of that career seems, therefore, peculiarly apt and symmetrically satisfying: she has taken over artistic direction of the annual summer festival at the Stockholm royal palace. This year's programme represents her first go. Four main events are dotted across the three-and-a-half month schedule (May 20 - September 4): a Haydn opera and a Figaro ballet provided by Stockholm Royal Opera forces and, in home-grown productions, a Gretry comedie-ballet and an Italian comic opera by the Spaniard Vicente Martn y Soler. Nicholas McGegan, a British 'period'-conscious opera conductor of ever-increasing international renown, takes over as music director; John Cox, a favoured Soderstrom collaborator from her Glyndebourne days, is one of this year's producers. To judge from the two shows that I saw, Gretry's Zemire et Azor (1771) and Martn's Una cosa rara (1786), the Soderstrom era at Drottningholm has been launched in high style. A visitor's pleasure in this most perfectly preserved and artistically inspiring of the world's 18th century theatres is likely to be bounteous even when the fare is only moderately interesting or modest in execution levels. Since this year both shows were operas of high interest - operas hugely successful in their day that are eminently worth the re-discovery in ours - and both performances were full of vitality, one's cup was in danger of running over. Arnold Ostman, the previous Drottningholm artistic and musical director, pursued over his 12 years in office a survey of the peaks of 18th century opera - in other words, Mozart and Gluck. Soderstrom, wanting to examine the territory around those peaks, has with Gretry and Martn launched a programme which she subtitles 'Perspectives on Mozart'. Una cosa rara, an obvious candidate for any such enterprise, was composed on a text by Da Ponte and given in Vienna six months after Figaro, with many of the first Figaro singers in its cast. It is full of Mozartian-sounding music; indeed, most opera people know of the opera, if at all, through Mozart's witty 'in-joke' quotation from Martn's Act 1 finale in the supper scene of Don Giovanni. But there is far more to Una cosa rara - as a British colleague said at interval, as we stumbled out on to the Drottningholm lawns high on all the zest, buoyancy and inventiveness on offer, 'Where has this opera been all our lives?' Da Ponte's libretto, with a heroine who remains true to her shepherd beloved in spite of various attempts on her virtue from higher up the social scale, is a brilliantly plotted eight-hander up to the halfway mark which loses pace and impetus thereafter. This, and the sense one gains that Martn's melodies, structural elaborations and character developments lack sustained depth for all their captivating charm and telling detail, may be responsible for the opera's relative neglect. (In fact, modern revivals are not unknown  -a 1968 London fringe staging featured the young Josephine Barstow and Alan Opie - and a recording from Barcelona has reached CD format.) Nevertheless, in the light of McGegan's marvellously enjoyable account of Una cosa rara - keyed-up, brightly coloured, theatrically zestful at every moment - even relative neglect seems incomprehensible. There is a Spanish accent to many of the tunes, a Spanish patina to much of the scoring, (Martn started life as a Madrid zarzuela composer); it is this that underlines the distinctness of the opera's musical and dramatic character, and brings to a halt the inevitable game of contrast-and-compare with Mozart. Francisco Negrin's production, though based (as everything always is) on the Drottningholm stock of 'authentic' scenic components, was modern in an irritatingly unstylish way - too much farce, double-take and general knockabout, too much extraneously imposed dance movement. This was the only blot on the evening (and, in truth, only a minor one). In the opera's two leading roles, the faithful Lilla and the Queen (who offers wise counsel in difficult situations), the young Swedish soprano Elisabeth Berg and the more internationally experienced Swedish soprano Lena Nordin produced exactly the poised, unpushed tones required for the theatre. Among the men there was a tendency to loudness-for-its-own-sake, but no real weakness. Zemire et Azor, a Beecham favourite, most affecting of all Beauty and the Beast operas, is another apt perspective on Mozart (who is said to have treasured his Gretry vocal score, and remembered Ali, the opera's servant-figure, when creating Papageno). It is also a beam of light on penetration of Gluckian ideals into French opera of all types in the latter part of the 18th century, promoting and sustaining as it does a line of simplicity - melodies catchy and characterful at first hearing, scoring light yet full of concealed subtleties - whose underlying strengths a Drottningholm production is admirably placed to flatter. John Cox, at his best working in small theatres on intimate, elegantly fashioned subjects, was an admirable Gretry producer, Louis Langree a sensitive, careful Gretry conductor. The cast, while short on outstanding voices, was balanced, musical, uniformly attractive. The opera was given in the Swedish translation first used in the era of Gustaf III himself, and - as with the Martn - vaut le voyage. Drottningholm Festival season sponsored by Swedish Shell.</p>

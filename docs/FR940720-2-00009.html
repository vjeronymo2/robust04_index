			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The range of dumping margins of seamless pipe from Argentina based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioner is 66.57 percent to 108.13 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Brazil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Brazil, petitioner based USP on U.S. price quotes to a distributor. Petitioner made adjustments for freight and insurance, port and handling charges and U.S. duties paid. Petitioner adjusted USP to account for the tax levied on seamless pipe in the home market. Petitioner also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base. Finally, petitioner adjusted USP to account for the difference in level of trade between the home market and U.S. market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner based FMV on home market price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner adjusted the prices for home market taxes not included in the prices. Petitioner made a tax offset for the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The range of dumping margins of seamless pipe from Brazil based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioner is 79.83 percent to 130.08 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Germany  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Germany, petitioner based USP on U.S. price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner made adjustments for distributor mark-up, freight and insurance, port and handling charges and U.S. duties paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner was unable to obtain home market prices. Moreover, petitioner was unable to develop a meaningful constructed value as petitioner claims it operates a substantially different production process than the German manufacturer of the subject merchandise. Therefore, petitioner based FMV on third country prices in Britain, which was the only information reasonably available to it. Petitioner obtained ex-warehouse and delivered prices from three British distributors of subject merchandise from Germany. Petitioner made adjustments for the distributor mark-up, delivery charges, where appropriate, and transportation charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The range of dumping margins of seamless pipe from Germany based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioner is 11.67 percent to 57.72 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Italy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Italy, petitioner based USP on U.S. price quotes to an end-user.

Petitioner made a tax offset for the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner based FMV on home market price quotes to an end-user.

Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports of seamless pipe from Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Determination by the International Trade Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The International Trade Commission (ITC) will determine by August 8, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of seamless pipe from Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination will result in the investigations being terminated; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barbara R.

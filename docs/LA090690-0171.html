			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> FIRING NEW SALVO IN CULTURAL BATTLE;  </P> <P> STAGE: MULTIMEDIA ARTIST DANIEL MARTINEZ MASTERMINDS A HUGE COLLABORATION TO  CREATE THE URBAN EPIC 'IGNORE THE DENTS.' HE CALLS IT 'AN OPERA FOR PEOPLE WHO  HATE OPERA.'  </P> <P> Within earshot of the massive freeway interchange that runs like a fissure  through East Los Angeles and separates that Latino community from downtown,  Daniel Martinez's windowless industrial-zone studio is filled with the workaday  detritus of the multimedia artist.  </P> <P> On the north wall is a stark image of a skull against a yellow and red  background. Sketches, half-finished works and graphics materials seem to ooze  out of every corner. It's a work-crazed environment, and filling the air is the  radio voice of President Bush, conducting a press conference on the Persian  Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Talk of a foreign war doesn't seem to faze Martinez. Recalling how he and his  Chicano friends experienced police beatings and invasion of privacy, as well as  dragnet operations that would shut down their neighborhood streets, he says,  "We've been at war all the time. Since my childhood, I've been in the middle of  a cultural war."  </P> <P> Now, the 32-year-old Martinez has decided to take the offensive, translate that  war into an epic about his city and time (subtitled "a micro-urban opera") and  call it "Ignore the Dents." The fireworks will happen this Friday and Saturday  at the Million Dollar Theatre.  </P> <P> The grand old movie palace on Broadway is a theater Martinez, best-known as a  maker of large installations that mix media and explore themes of freedom and  totalitarianism, has found an attractive site for some time. He says that he  needs the theater's size to contain what he calls "an opera for people who hate  opera."  </P> <P> It also may be opera for people who love art shows that bring together many  forms and sensibilities. As mastermind behind the project -- nine months in the  making -- director Martinez called on the services of Harry Gamboa Jr.  (script), VinZula Kara (music), Patricia Pretzinger (choreography), Paul Chavez  (sound), Aubrey Wilson (set and light design), Diane Gamboa (costumes and  props), Erica Bornstein (assistant director), Liz Young (lobby and theater  design) and Gibran and Jim Evans (graphic design).  </P> <P> "I call us 'The Dents,' and we're going to remain a group until the  millennium," Martinez vowed. All of them are rising or established figures in  the art world, their individual contributions meant to both stand alone and  blend into the whole "Dents" performance.  </P> <P> "Diane has made variations on the kind of paper costumes which she's exhibited  before," said Martinez. "Liz's work inside the Million Dollar really is an  installation, a well as an entry into the world of the piece. Gibran and Jim  have designed a program (over 80 pages, but kept to an affordable $3) that's a  work of art in itself.  </P> <P> "This was a chance to bring 10 minds together. The festival provided us (with a  commission) a crack in the door. Now that we're in, we'll blow up the city,"  insisted the wiry, intense Martinez.  </P> <P> With so many combined visions, this can sound like the Installation/Performance  That Ate L.A. But Martinez, in conversation, is always referring to what he  feels are the foundation blocks of "Ignore the Dents": Harry Gamboa's text,  Kara's score, and Martinez's own aesthetic passion for Dadaism, Futurism and  Situationism.  </P> <P> "This is an intellectual spectacle, not an entertainment. But Harry's writing  keeps it funny."  </P> <P> The work, though, wasn't so funny when "we met for a month, but couldn't settle  on any ideas."  </P> <P> Gamboa recalled that when they did settle on the title, "things came together."  Martinez, noting how their favorite pastime is regaling each other with  stories, set his old pal free to come up with stories, rather than the libretti  opera normally requires.  </P> <P> Harry delivered: a solo piece about a dying man in an electric chair (played by  Manazar Gamboa, spiritual godfather to Martinez's Latino artist peers); a tale  about a scam; "The Atlas Aria," about the Earth spinning out of orbit; "The  Asphalt Aria," to be sung by opera singers Charles Lane, Luz Maria Garcia and  Andrew Koch; a story of a photographer facing censorship, and one about a young  homeless man who goes over the edge.  </P> <P> And more. "My deal with Harry was simple," Martinez revealed. "I trusted him to  write whatever he wanted, and he trusted me to direct them however I wanted."  </P> <P> Kara, who crafts a personal music/sound style called "Popkret" (musique  concrete and pop), read Harry's pieces and researched opera history. Kara and  Martinez eventually structured a 13-part form -- each part both a story and a  variation on an opera composer, from Monteverdi, through Bach, Verdi, Wagner  and Philip Glass.  </P> <P> "This is performance art," explained Martinez, "since the show won't come  together until Friday night. I see it as one big show, with a break between  nights." The live element will be spiced by Kara's own music samplings, a live  ensemble, and Martinez acting as stage manager, moving scenes on and off as he  sees fit.  </P> <P> "Friends ask me if I'm afraid of doing this. But if I have an idea, I just do  it." Another recently completed Martinez idea was a design for a future Metro  Rail station. "I have my father in me," he said. "He helped design the first  lunar satellite. He wasn't a math wiz, but he had the right instincts.  </P> <P> "I know the street. It's a place of human drama. People try to forget about it,  so we're gonna bring it to them."  </P></p>

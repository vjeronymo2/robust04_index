			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Sales rise but shops peg prices, says CBI RETAIL sales rose again last month, but shop managers still lack the confidence to put up prices, a Confederation of British Industry survey showed yesterday. Speaking at the launch of the CBI's quarterly distributive trades survey, Mr Nigel Whittaker, distributive trades panel chairman, warned that tax increases in the November Budget could damage the 'modest recovery in high street activity'. The CBI said the increase in sales in August, following similar improvements in June and July, was accompanied by the lowest year-on-year rise in shop prices in the 10 years since the survey was first conducted. Mr Whittaker added: 'Part of the growth in high street business may have been achieved by retailers setting low prices to win business in competitive market conditions.' While the improvement in retail sales appears to be well-established, the pace of the upturn is uneven. The survey showed a patchy recovery across sectors. Some traders reported small sales rises and, in general, retailers with just one store had trade volumes below last year's levels. Motor traders had their best August for five years. The outlook for wholesalers was unpromising. They reported a slowdown in activity since spring and expect sales growth over the next three months to fall further. The strongest improvements were in clothing, furniture and carpet shops. Sales for grocers, shoe shops and chemists were also buoyant. A balance of 31 per cent of retailers reported increased sales in the year to August, compared with 32 and 30 per cent in July and June.</p>

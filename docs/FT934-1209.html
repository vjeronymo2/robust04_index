			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Beirut bomb attack on Phalange leaders Two people were killed and 130 injured by a bomb at the headquarters of Lebanon's right-wing Christian Phalange party in east Beirut last night. Mr George Shahin, a spokesman for the party, said most of the casualties occurred in the main meeting hall, where committee members were holding their weekly session with Mr Salah Matar, a party leader. Mr George Saadeh, head of the Phalange, was not at the meeting, according to Voice of Lebanon radio. The attack was the worst case of domestic political violence in Lebanon for more than two years and came as the government was having some success in restructuring the economy and attracting redevelopment funds. The previously dominant role of Lebanon's Christian Maronite community has been eroded by 17 years of civil war, an internal power struggle, and by the 1989 Taif agreement providing for more equitable power-sharing among the country's communities. The decision by many Maronites to boycott last year's general elections, in protest at the Taif agreement and continuing Syrian influence in Lebanon, was widely considered to have backfired. It left the Christian community embittered and inadequately represented at official level. While some Maronites argue for a total break from the central government, others believe it is necessary to come to terms with Mr Rafiq al-Hariri, the prime minister, and even to acknowledge that it is impossible in the short term to force a Syrian troop withdrawal.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Blair to tell party it must press ahead with reform: Left makes gains on executive as unions take hard line on minimum wage Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, will respond today to another bout of infighting with a warning to his party's Blackpool conference that it must press ahead with its modernisation programme. His annual conference debut as party leader - previewed by aides as 'bold and uncompromising' - will follow a renewed attempt yesterday by leaders of the main trades unions to set the agenda for Labour's economic strategy. Mr Blair will tell delegates that 'new ideas, new thinking and new Labour' are essential for the renewal of Britain. Urging party unity for the sake of winning the next general election, he will add: 'I want you with me in our task of renewal. I want you with me head and heart.' During a sometimes irritable start to the week-long conference, Mr John Edmonds and Mr Bill Morris, leaders respectively of the GMB and the TGWU general workers unions, led a series of calls for the party to fix its proposed minimum wage at half male median earnings. Mr Blair, however, insisted that although the principle of a national minimum rate for all workers was sacrosanct, the details of its implementation would be fixed by the party's economic commission. He made clear that the system would have to be introduced flexibly, with exemptions for young people, if it were not to have a damaging impact on employment. The party leadership suffered a setback when the annual poll for the party's national executive committee saw the election of two leftwing MPs - Ms Diane Abbott and Mr Dennis Skinner. Mr Blair retains a commanding majority on the policymaking executive, but two of his strongest supporters - Ms Marjorie Mowlam and Mr Chris Smith - failed to win places. In a thinly veiled attack on the economic policies spelt out at the conference by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, Mr Edmonds demanded that Labour should fix a firm target for full employment. He told delegates that over the next year it must 'mix some concrete in with the rhetoric'. The decision by the union leaders to flex their political muscle over pay and employment coincided with signs of renewed disquiet on the left of the party over Mr Blair's insistence that middle-income earners will not suffer through the party's tax plans. Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, is thought to be concerned that the present stance might leave the party trapped by a pre-election cut in income tax rates by the government. In those circumstances, Labour might be forced to abandon either its pledge not to raise taxes on middle-income earners or to drop key spending pledges. Mr Brown used his conference appearance to attack the 'tax privileges' which he said subsidised 'boardroom privilege'. Reaffirming that a Labour government would restrict executive share options and tighten up residency rules for the rich, he said Labour would 'rewrite the tax rules for the undeserving rich'. In what may be the most important speech of his political life, Mr Blair will tell the party that the ditching of traditional policies does not mark a rejection of its core values. Marking out the dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives, he will set the party's central ambition as the spread of opportunity and social justice. But his aides insisted he would leave no doubt of his determination to widen the party's appeal to a suspicious electorate. Blow to Blair as leftwingers win NEC seats, Page 8</p>

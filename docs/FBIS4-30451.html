			<p>BFN     [Text] China wants to reach a final settlement with the  Philippines and other claimants to the Spratly Islands, but only  through bilateral discussions and not through the international  group like the United Nations or ASEAN. This was the stand  conveyed by Premier Li Peng of China to a Philippine Government  and business delegation led by Philippine Vice President Joseph  Estrada in a meeting held in Beijing.    Li told Estrada that the discussions must be held with one  country at a time, and not in a conference hosted by any  international group.    Estrada noted, however, that the Philippines will stick to  the position taken by ASEAN in 1992 -- that its members with  claims over the Spratlys must negotiate with China and claimant  Vietnam as a group. But Estrada showed his strong (?compose)  that the Philippines would seek all peaceful means to resolve  the problem.    Apart from the Philippines, China, and Vietnam, other  claimants to the Spratlys are Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia.</p>

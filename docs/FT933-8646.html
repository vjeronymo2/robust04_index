			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / NatWest sets out on a mission to explain: The bank's aim of removing risk on mortgages NATIONAL WESTMINSTER'S warning to 12,000 customers that it is considering securitising their mortgages is likely to provoke some perplexity. One reason why this funding method has not spread as fast in the UK as in the US has been the difficulty of explaining it to investors, let alone borrowers. Banks, however, have an increasing incentive to make their intention clear. Mortgages have emerged as the single part of their UK loan portfolios which has expanded rapidly this year, so they have come under more pressure to ensure that it does not absorb too much capital. Lenders securitise their assets in the UK by establishing a company to hold mortgages. The company raises the money to pay the bank by issuing debt securities to investors on which the interest payments are funded by mortgage repayments. The investors take the risk of default on the repayments. This has two advantages for banks. First, it removes the default risk from balance sheets. Although NatWest will retain control of setting interest rates, it passes on risk. But more importantly, securitisation takes the asset itself off the balance sheet and does not absorb bank capital. NatWest emphasised yesterday that it did not need to free capital. Banks' ability to expand loans if there were a sharp economic recovery, however, could be constrained. Their ratio of core capital to assets weighted by risk is in several cases below a 'well-capitalised bank' in the US definition. Securitisation of mortgages - or other assets such as the payments due on credit cards which have been securitised in the US - also means banks can work their capital harder. They can raise the return on equity on which investors rate them by swapping interest payments for a capital payment. Although Barclays Bank has ventured into mortgage securitisation - issuing Pounds 175m of mortgage-backed securities in 1989 through a vehicle company called Gracechurch Mortgage Finance - NatWest's move signals renewed interest. Barclays is already working on further mortgage securitisation in the US. For customers it is a rather more imponderable business. Mr Richard Ferrett, head of asset management at NatWest, yesterday insisted that it would make no difference. The process would be invisible to the borrower. 'We are going to adhere to whatever customer reaction we get and respect their wishes,' he said. It seems likely though that opposition will stem from incomprehension rather than an obvious objection to the practice. Yet the process raises a number of questions for borrowers. One is whether banks' general attitudes to mortgage default will be affected. Investors will be less keen to invest in securities where there appears to be a risk of repayments being interrupted. Banks cannot allow default among borrowers, and then ensure that interest payments on the securities are maintained by paying them separately. To qualify under regulatory rules to be removed from balance sheets, the risks of securities have to pass from the bank to the investor. In practice, banks try to ensure a steady flow of interest payments by 'self-insuring' the issues. This means packaging enough mortgages together to allow some defaults without affecting the payments. But widespread use of securitisation could gradually change bank attitudes towards default. A second issue for borrowers is whether banks are likely to tilt borrowing towards types of mortgages that can easily be securitised. This could mean mortgages outside areas with high rates of default, thereby increasing conservatism among mortgage lenders.</p>

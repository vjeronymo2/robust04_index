He regretted that although crimes of racist nature such as  those in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the lates one in occupied  Palestine, have increased of late, "the horrifying aspects of  the crimes are treated lightly by world news agencies."    Verdinejad expressed hope that nanap members, bearing in  mind  the principle of free-thinking of the non-aligned movement and  their own professional responsibilities would do their best to  convey the message of the long-suffering people to the world and  expose the criminals.    The message emphasized that the murder and the massacre of  civilians by the military, in the name of human rights and  freedom, should be stopped as soon as possible.    More than 60 fasting Muslims were gunned down in cold blood  at the Prophet Ibrahim mosque in al-Khalil by Zionist agents  last Friday.</p>

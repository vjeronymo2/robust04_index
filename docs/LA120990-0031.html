			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED AND BLACK  </P> <P> As an honorary member of the Iroquois Confederation, I applaud Kevin Costner's  film "Dances With Wolves."  </P> <P> It's a long bow shot better than its antecedents ("A Man Called Horse," etc.)  in capturing the Sioux Indian Nation's culture.  </P> <P> Now what next? Well, for every white who took the blanket, there were at least  a hundred of another American culture -- and color -- who did. I'm referring to  Afro-Americans. They joined many Indian tribes.  </P> <P> Isn't it time for films about them? If I recall my history, red and black  always got along better than red and white.  </P> <P> SHELDON STARK  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

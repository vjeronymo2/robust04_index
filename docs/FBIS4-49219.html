			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Some Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing </F> Committee Regulations Concerning Strengthening Inspection and  Supervision of the Implementation of Laws and Regulations  adopted at the Eighth Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous  Region People's Congress Standing Committee on 25 February 1994"  -- XIZANG RIBAO headline]    [Text] To maintain the dignity of the law, promote the  implementation of laws and regulations, and enable the Tibet  Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing Committee to be  more effective in inspecting and supervising the implementation  of laws and regulations, the following regulations have been  formulated, in accordance with the PRC Constitution as well as  relevant laws and regulations and as a result of practical  experiences summed up in recent years, to carry out the  inspection and supervision of laws and regulations (hereafter  abbreviated as law enforcement inspection):    1. The Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing  Committee and special Tibet People's Congress committees conduct  inspect and supervise the implementation of laws and regulations  as well as resolutions and decisions with legal nature  formulated by the National People's Congress [NPC], the NPC  Standing Committee, the Tibet People's Congress, and the Tibet  People's Congress Standing Committee. It is necessary to focus  the law enforcement inspection of a period on such major issues  as reform, opening up, socialist modernization, safeguarding the  unification of the motherland, and enhancing the unity of all  nationalities. Special efforts should be made to strengthen  inspection and supervision of the enforcement of laws and  regulations concerning a socialist market economy so as to  protect and promote the development of a socialist market  economy.    2. While inspecting law enforcement, the standing  committee and all specialized committees of the Tibet People's  Congress should primarily inspect and supervise how laws and  regulations are being enforced by authorities in charge of law  enforcement, and see to it that the regional government and its  departments, the regional higher people's court, and the  regional people's procuratorate take timely actions to deal with  problems emerging in the enforcement of laws and regulations.  The inspection groups should not handle problems directly.    3. Law enforcement inspection should proceed according to  plan. The plan should include what, how, when, and where the  inspection will be conducted, as well as other requirements.  The Tibet People's Congress Standing Committee General Office  should submit its plan to the standing committee chairman and  vice chairmen meeting for approval and then submit the plan to  the standing committee for the record. The regional people's  congress standing committee general office, or the specialized  people's congress committees, will notify the regional people's  government and its related departments, the regional higher  people's court, and the regional people's procuratorate, as well  as standing committees of relevant municipal, county (or  prefectural) people's congresses and liaison departments of the  autonomous region in various prefectures about the inspection  plan.    4. Inspection groups must be formed in such a manner that  they are small but capable, efficient, and mobile. The regional  people's congress standing committee inspection group should be  composed of a head and several group members. The head should  be selected from among standing committee members at the  people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen  meeting. Specialized committees should form their own  inspection groups. The standing committee and specialized  committees may recruit deputies to the regional people's  congress and relevant experts to be members of their inspection  groups. They may also invite people of authorities in charge of  enforcement of law and regulations, or people in charge of  municipal and county (or prefectural) people's congress standing  committees, to take part in inspection.    5. The inspection groups' members and staff personnel should  be knowledgeable about the relevant laws, regulations, and  policies. They should collect information about the enforcement  of these laws and regulations and hear reports by authorities in  charge of enforcement of laws and regulations.    6. The inspection groups should go deep into the realities  of  life and the masses at the grass-roots to understand the actual  state of how laws and regulations are being enforced and to  study enforcement problems through hearing reports, holding  meetings, interviewing individuals, conducting surveys, and  conducting on-the- spot study. Relevant departments and local  authorities should support their work and provide them with  actual information and other needed assistance.    7. After the inspection, inspection reports must be prepared  under the supervision of the heads of inspection groups.  Contents of the reports should include a comprehensive review  of the ways the laws and regulations they have inspected were  enforced; analysis of the causes of problems about the  enforcement of laws and regulations; suggestions for improving  law enforcement; and suggestions for amending, supplementing,  and interpreting the laws and regulations. The reports must  state facts objectively and truthfully, and they must not evade  problems.    8. The regional people's congress standing committee  chairman and vice chairmen meeting should request the standing  committee to place on its agenda the law enforcement inspection  report prepared by the regional people's congress standing  committee inspection group. The meeting will decide whether it  should request the standing committee to place the law  enforcement reports prepared by the regional people's congress'  specialized committees on its agenda. For those reports placed  on the agenda, they should be delivered by the heads of the law  enforcement inspection groups at standing committee meetings and  examined and discussed there. People of authorities in charge of  enforcement of laws and regulations should hear the views and  answer questions at the meetings. Standing committee members  may raise questions with regard to major issues concerning the  enforcement of laws and regulations. When necessary, the  standing committee should come up with a resolution.  Specialized committees should examine and discuss their own law  enforcement reports that are not placed on the standing  committee's agenda.    9. The law enforcement inspection report examined by the  regional people's congress standing committee and the views it  expresses should be referred to authorities in charge of  enforcement of laws and regulations, and these authorities  should earnestly improve their law enforcement and, within six  months, submit a written report to the standing committee about  their improvement measures and the results they have achieved.  When necessary, the regional people's congress standing  committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting should request the  standing committee place the report on its agenda for  examination. For law enforcement reports examined by  specialized committees of the regional people's congress as well  as the views they have expressed in examining the reports, the  specialized committees should refer them to authorities in  charge of enforcement of laws and regulations, and these  authorities should report to the specialized committees on how  they have improved their way of enforcing laws. If the  specialized committees are not satisfied with the reports, they  may request the standing committee to reexamine the reports.    10. For major typical cases of lawlessness discovered during  the inspection, the regional people's congress standing  committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting may refer them to  the specialized committees and the standing committee's  administrative office for investigation. The investigation  results should be reported to the regional people's congress  standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting, and the  meeting may request relevant authorities handle the problems  within a specific period. The relevant authorities should  report the results in a timely manner. When necessary, the  regional people's congress standing committee chairman and vice  chairmen meeting may request the standing committee examine the  results. For specially major typical cases of lawlessness, the  standing committee may exercise its legal rights and form an ad  hoc committee or group to investigate the cases. The standing  committee will not directly handle these cases, which should be  dealt with by authorities in charge of enforcement of laws and  regulations strictly in accordance with legal procedures.    11. The media should report and publicize in a timely manner  the law enforcement inspection carried out by the regional  people's congress standing committee. The regional people's  congress general office may hold news briefings to inform the  media about the inspection. The public may be informed of the  major typical cases of lawlessness discovered during the course  of inspection as well as the results of handling the cases.</p>

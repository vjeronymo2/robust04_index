			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Hopes rise in US-Japan trade talks US and Japanese officials yesterday went into their fifth day of trade talks in Washington amid expectations they were headed towards agreement on at least some of their disputes. Tokyo's Ministry of Finance yesterday unexpectedly sent to Washington an official responsible for bilateral negotiations on opening up Japan's insurance market - Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, vice-chief of the International Financial Bureau - in an apparent move to help push the talks forward. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday did not deny a press report that this set of talks soon could be nearing a conclusion. He has been denying that the US is in retreat from its original intention to negotiate a series of strong 'results-oriented' agreements. 'My impression is we are really backing off,' said Mr Alan Tonelson, research director of the Economic Strategy Institute, which has close ties with the administration. Mr Kantor, he said, might have lost control of the negotiations to the State Department, where there is concern that US-Japan trade disputes are threatening the broader relationship and the administration's Asia trade policy. This created the impression in Washington that the negotiators were ready to 'harvest the gains' of previous talks and reach deals on those sectors the Japanese government can most influence: government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications and insurance liberalisation. Vehicles and vehicle parts could be set aside for the time. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister, yesterday summoned his chief cabinet secretary, Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, who was until recently trade minister, as well as officials from the key ministries of trade, foreign affairs and finance, to his official residence to discuss how the trade talks could be taken forward before the Group of Seven meeting in July. He told the bureaucrats to try to ensure that yesterday's negotiations on the groundwork for resuming the talks were a success. 'We are negotiating very extensively. The talks are at a very delicate stage now,' Mr Hata told a group of reporters. Japanese officials played down speculation in the press that a breakthrough might be possible because of a softer US stance, but were clearly doing their best to keep the momentum going. 'There are talks scheduled this week on global co-operation, so officials are scheduled to be in Washington anyway,' one foreign ministry official said. The hope is that the unofficial talks aimed at resuming the more contentious parts of the framework talks, which began last week, could take advantage of that coincidence and be made official, he said.</p>

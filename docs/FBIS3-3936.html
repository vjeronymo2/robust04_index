The government, which has prioritised railways, will give 29  billion yuan ($3.3 billion) for construction this year.    The original investment target for this year was 41.7  billion  ($4.8 billion).    But the planned funding will out-strip last year's input by  6.5 billion yuan ($747 million), said a Railways Ministry source.    The ministry will build 2,100 kilometres of new lines,  double- track 1,335 kiloemtres of existing single-track  capacity, and electrify another 194 kilometres of railway.    The government agenda is topped by seven key railway  projects, which are underway.    And quality engineering and labour safety will be  prioritised.    The Beijing-Kowloon Railway will get 1,386 kilometres of new  line by the end of this year.    Roadbeds, bridges and tunnels along its projected  2,538-kilometre length will also be completed.    The north-south thoroughfare project kicked off in early  1993. Over 1,700 kilometres of track will have been completed on  it by the end of 1994.    The Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway, will be double-tracked along its  entire 1,620 kilometres by the year's end. But only half of the  new second track will be up and running by then.    Workers will finish construction and electrification of the  new 498-kilometre Baoji-Zhongwei line in the northern Shaanxi  Province and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.    And the new 252-kilometre Houma-Yueshan line will be laid  and  electrified within the year.    A 154-kilometre section of the Hangzhou-Zhuzhou Railway will  be double-tracked and another 166 kilometres of dual-track line  will be opened to traffic.    Construction on the 898-kilometre Nanning-Kunming Railway,  which is the toughest building project, will press ahead.    And work will continue on a huge new passenger station in  west Beijing.    The national rail network this year plans to move 1.56  billion tons of freight, which includes 640 million tons of coal.    A project 1.04 billion people will catch trains this year.    The cargo and passenger targets are close to last year's  figures, said the ministry.</p>

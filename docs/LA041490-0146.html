			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARACHUTES FLY HIGH IN SMALL WORLD;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THIS SINGING TRIO IS STARTING TO GET NOTICED AND THE MEMBERS HOPE THE  GROUP WILL BECOME "THE BEATLES OF CHILDREN'S MUSIC" IN FIVE YEARS.  </P> <P> Move over Raffi, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois and Bram's "Elephant Show." In  five years, Parachute Express hopes to be "the Beatles of children's music."  </P> <P> Parachute who?  </P> <P> Parachute Express is a trio of thirtysomething adults -- Donny Becker, Janice  Hubbard and Stephen Michael Schwartz -- who are starting to get noticed for  their sophisticated vocal harmonies and participatory, movement-oriented  lyrics.  </P> <P> Not yet the kind of notice reserved for the aforementioned Canadian stars who  have dominated the children's music market. But with credits that include one  cable-TV concert for the Disney Channel's Kaleidoscope series, two videos, five  albums, 14 shows at Knott's Berry Farm's Camp Snoopy last September, sellout  crowds and a national touring schedule, this emerging talent is understandably  optimistic.  </P> <P> After hopscotch East and West Coast tour stops, including a stop Saturday in  Glendale, its next Orange County appearance will be at Anaheim's Celebrity  Theatre on June 30.  </P> <P> During an interview at Schwartz's Glendale home, the chemistry that binds the  trio together was evident -- they're unrelated, but like close siblings often  finish each other's sentences and speak in chorus.  </P> <P> The "Beatles" comparison was a laughing, unison response to being asked about  their hopes for the future. "Raffi can be Elvis," Hubbard conceded.  </P> <P> Becker got serious. "Raffi does important work; he really has paved the way. We  don't talk about our vision that much, but we believe in our music, and the  chemistry between us feels so real, I think we'll continue to grow."  </P> <P> Parachute Express has already outgrown the traditional, mostly public-domain  folk sound of its 1985 first album, "Shakin' It." The group has found its niche  in a slick mix of original songs in musical styles geared to young audiences,  from '50s doo-wop and '60s rock, to R&amp;B and pop.  </P> <P> "Our music sort of touches a baby-boomer nerve," Schwartz said.  </P> <P> It's feel-good music, dedicated to helping "a small child feel bigger in his  world," Hubbard said. Songs range from goofy -- "Doo-Wacka-Doo" and  "Goo-Goo-Giggly-I-Oh!," to practical -- "Tie a Bow," to lyrical -- "Pioneer  Baby" and "Indian Lullaby."  </P> <P> Kevin Odegard, director of creative services for the music publishing company  Filmtrax Copyright Holdings, while not professionally involved with the group,  offers high praise.  </P> <P> "I discovered them as a parent going to elementary-school fairs," he said, "and  became a fan because my kids walked around humming their melodies. The songs  are well-written and well-crafted in the way great pop songs are.  </P> <P> "In live performances," he said, "they have that same performance vibe as Raffi  -- non-threatening, accessible and friendly."  </P> <P> Parachute Express began as a non-performing, four-member group recording music  for Gymboree, a movement/play program for parents and preschoolers.  </P> <P> Becker, a singer and former elementary school teacher, was, with wife Adrien,  an early Gymboree franchise owner who decided to enhance the program with  music.  </P> <P> He enlisted his brother-in-law, Rick Cunha, and neighbor Schwartz. Both men are  professional singers and songwriters; Schwartz is also an actor and a former  preschool teacher; Cunha is an engineer.  </P> <P> Schwartz brought in singer-songwriter Hubbard, a friend from the '70s when they  both were members of Story Theatre, the groundbreaking fairy-tale theater  founded by Paul Sills.  </P> <P> "We were just putting music together for Donny's program," Schwartz explained.  "We weren't aware of what this was going to become."  </P> <P> Public performances began when parents wanted to know where they could see the  group.  </P> <P> The quartet became a trio when Cunha, who has other professional interests,  opted out of performing. He's still involved as both a musician and engineer.  Schwartz's wife, Althea, co-manages the trio with producer/musician Peter  Dergee.  </P> <P> They're eager to stress that they're proud of the Gymboree affiliation, but  it's time to move on.  </P> <P> "We don't want to be known as the ambassadors of Gymboree," said Becker. "Even  when we began, we tried to make music that existed on its own."  </P> <P> Besides the vocals, Becker and Schwartz play guitar; Hubbard plays the banjo  and the flute. Performances are lively, with "choreography, space work and  mime," using live and taped music. "We're 5 years old on stage," Becker  enthused.  </P> <P> Becker, 41, a dad with two young children, is jocularly referred to by the  others as "grandpa." Hubbard, single, is 37; Schwartz, 36, has an 8-year-old  son.  </P> <P> After a Parachute Express concert, "I'd like kids to come away with a feel for  music and a sense of wonder at what the songs were about," Hubbard said.  </P> <P> "Children are incredible critics," Schwartz said. "If we even try to fake it,  we'll be busted, because kids know the truth. The minute we forget who we're  doing it for, it's time to check out."  </P> <P> Hubbard added, "We stay connected, so it's fresh every single time."  </P> <P> "We always go for something a little different," Stephen said.  </P> <P> "And it comes across as real," Becker added.  </P> <P>  Parachute Express will be at Glendale High Auditorium today at 2:30 p.m.;  tickets: sold out; information: (818) 548-9246; at the San Diego Children's  Festival at Mariner's Point in Mission Bay for 10 performances, April 25-29,  Tickets: $2-$3 (festival admission), Information: (619) 234-5002; and at the  Celebrity Theatre, 201 E.

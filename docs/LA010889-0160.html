			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NONSMOKING ORDINANCE, SO FAR, PROVES TO BE NO HAZARD TO ECONOMIC HEALTH  </P> <P> Where there's tobacco smoke, there's usually fire. But few sparks have ignited  in the nearly six months since the San Diego County Board of Supervisors  approved a tough ordinance that severely restricts smoking in restaurants and  workplaces in unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> County officials interpret the paucity of complaints -- from smokers,  nonsmokers or businesses -- as evidence that the ordinance, widely regarded as  one of the most stringent of its kind in the nation, is working.  </P> <P> Some nonsmoking advocates and others, however, suggest that the ordinance's  track record and potential long-term impact are still as hazy as the air in a  room full of chain-smokers.  </P> <P> "The general impression is, so far, so good," said Debbie Kelley, program  director of the local American Lung Assn. office. "But there's still a lot of  uncertainty, particularly about the workplace. There, it's not very clear to  anyone what's happening."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Doesn't Care  </P> <P> A major reason for that uncertainty is that, because the law is limited to only  the county's unincorporated region, it has attracted relatively little public  attention -- much less, proponents say, than would a comparable ordinance in  the city of San Diego.  </P> <P> The problems associated with that low public profile have been compounded by  the county's deliberately low-key enforcement of the measure, a style that  stems as much from administrators' desire to avoid heavy-handed tactics as from  budgetary constraints that make frequent inspections economically impractical.  </P> <P> "I suspect that less than 5% of the affected individuals even know this law is  on the books," said Bob Ottilie, a lawyer who represents a business group  concerned about the city's consideration of a similar ordinance. "I don't doubt  that most people who are aware of it are complying. But the real reason there  have been so few complaints may be that it's been pretty invisible to this  point."  </P> <P> Although acknowledging that the ordinance is only a first step toward his goal  of an eventually smoke-free environment in most public places, Supervisor Leon  Williams, the measure's sponsor, argues that it  </P> <P> already has made significant strides toward protecting nonsmokers from the  annoyance and health hazards of secondhand smoke.  </P> <P> "We've still got a long way to go, but the ordinance has helped to raise the  public's consciousness," Williams said. "I detect a difference in people's  attitudes in terms of their willingness to light up a cigarette under someone  else's nose. Even if it does nothing more than make smokers become a little  more considerate toward nonsmokers, that's progress."  </P> <P> Approved last July, the county ordinance requires restaurants to designate at  least 50% of their indoor seating capacity as a no-smoking area. Previously,  restaurants had been required to provide only enough no-smoking space to meet  demand, a vague rule that allowed restaurateurs to establish their own  guidelines.  </P> <P> The measure also requires employers to ban smoking in shared work areas,  prohibits smoking in private offices unless doors are closed and no nonsmokers  are present, and requires hotels and motels to provide enough nonsmoking rooms  to meet demand. Smoking also is prohibited in most health facilities, waiting  areas and service lines in business establishments and public areas such as  restrooms.  </P> <P> In recognition of the fact that some businesses attract clienteles that include  a large percentage of smokers, bars, lounges, bowling centers, pool halls and  some other facilities were exempted from the 50% space requirement.  </P> <P> A lifelong nonsmoker, Williams explained that his primary motive in proposing  the ordinance was drawn from the growing medical evidence on how the inhalation  of smoke can harm the health of nonsmokers. Dr. David Burns, an associate  professor at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, testified before the  supervisors last summer that medical evidence suggests that as many as 3,000  people die annually as a result of so-called "secondhand" smoke.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to say people don't have the right to smoke," Williams said.  "But they don't have the right to hurt other people in the process. . . . As a  county, we're not trying to legislate anyone's behavior. Our thrust here is the  public's health."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only 25 Complaints  </P> <P> Although county officials have received hundreds of inquiries about the  ordinance since it took effect in August, there have been only 25 formal  complaints -- a fact that they cite as proof of widespread public acceptance  and compliance.  </P> <P> "Judging from the number of complaints, the ordinance seems to be working,"  said Willie Pugh, a county health education associate who heads the enforcement  effort. "We get a lot of calls asking us to interpret the ordinance, but actual  complaints have been rare."  </P> <P> Others, however, suggest that the low number of complaints may also reflect the  public's unwillingness to report violations -- or unfamiliarity with how to do  so. Nonsmoking diners who believe that a restaurant has failed to set aside  sufficient nonsmoking tables, for instance, might be more inclined to forget  about the experience -- or to decide simply not to patronize the restaurant  again -- than to file a complaint with the county.  </P> <P> Although some restaurants have posted signs listing a county Health Department  telephone number where suspected violations may be reported, many others simply  post plain smoking and no-smoking signs. Under the ordinance, the wording and  placement of such signs is at the business owners' discretion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Violations Unreported  </P> <P> The county's decision to rely primarily on voluntary compliance also is seen as  a contributing factor to the low number of complaints. In the absence of  regular enforcement inspections by county officials, many violations likely go  unreported.  </P> <P> "There probably are more violations than we hear about," Pugh conceded. "But  they're not very blatant things, or they'd be reported." In addition, county  health inspectors have begun checking compliance with the anti-smoking  ordinance as part of their routine inspections of restaurants' sanitary  standards, Pugh added.  </P> <P> Most of the complaints that have been received have been settled by telephone  calls from Pugh's office to the businesses, followed up by letters asking  compliance within 10 days and -- in a few cases -- on-site visits by county  health staffers. Ordinance violators are subject to fines ranging from $50 for  a first offense to $250 for the third and each subsequent violation within a  year. To date, however, no legal action has been taken against any business.  </P> <P> When the supervisors debated the ordinance last summer, representatives of the  restaurant and hotel industry spoke in opposition to it, complaining that it  would be an economic burden that could cost them smokers' business. Although  county workers are charged with enforcing the measure, business officials  complained that practical day-to-day enforcement would be their unwelcome  responsibility.  </P> <P> Today, most of those groups, although still not pleased with the ordinance,  grudgingly admit that the economic and other difficulties posed by it have not  been as severe as they feared.  </P> <P> "The best way to put it is it's something we can live with," said Paul  McIntyre, executive director of the San Diego Restaurant Assn. "It's helped  that the county hasn't been hard-nosed about enforcing it. The county's shown  that it's not out to put anyone out of business over this."  </P> <P> Many restaurant operators say that, aside from minor occasional grumbling from  customers, they have heard no serious complaints from either smokers or  nonsmokers.  </P> <P> Jim Becker, the owner of Hernandez' Hideaway,  </P> <P> alongside Lake Hodges, said that about two-thirds of his clientele smokes.  Nevertheless, Becker said that "about 98% of the people we get here accept (the  ordinance's restrictions) without complaining. Every couple weeks, you might  get a gripe. But no major problems."  </P> <P> Similarly, George Nourani, the manager of Mille Fleurs, a posh Rancho Santa Fe  restaurant, said most of his customers -- generally split about 2-to-1 in favor  of nonsmokers -- have been "very accommodating, very cooperative." In  particular, Nourani said, smokers have not complained about longer waits for  tables in smoking areas or, on occasion, being seated in nonsmoking areas.  </P> <P> Not all restaurateurs, however, are as sanguine about the ordinance,  notwithstanding the lack of major problems.  </P> <P> "This is just another . . . law where government tells me how to run my  business," said Dan DeLong, the manager of the T-Bone Family Restaurant in  Lakeside. "But it's the law, so people go along with it, even though they might  not like it. Such is life."  </P> <P> Calling the county ordinance an "unfair, inequitable law that doesn't leave a  good taste in everybody's mouth," Harry Florentine, manager of the San Diego  Tavern and Restaurant Assn., said his organization is pondering a legal  challenge.  </P> <P> "You're infringing on rights when you get into a selective enforcement thing  like this," Florentine said. Like some other restaurant representatives,  Florentine expressed a preference for the county's previous ordinance over  Williams' proposal, praising the earlier law's flexibility in allowing  restaurateurs to "self-regulate by keeping the public happy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Him Business  </P> <P> Before last summer, restaurant owners could adjust the size of their smoking  and nonsmoking sections to meet the needs of their customers at any particular  time. But the 50% space requirement, Florentine and others argue, causes some  seats in both smoking and nonsmoking areas to often go unused.  </P> <P> "Nobody's gone bankrupt, but I'm sure this has cost some businesses money,"  Florentine said.  </P> <P> Although the supervisors disagree with restaurateurs on that point, they  conceded at the time they passed the ordinance that the 50% requirement would  be impractical for certain businesses such as bars, cocktail lounges, bowling  centers, card rooms and pool halls that attract many smokers.  </P> <P> "Certain establishments are inherently smoke-filled rooms," Supervisor Brian  Bilbray said.  </P> <P> The other exemptions to the ordinance include jails, stores that deal  exclusively in tobacco products and accessories, hotel meeting rooms in use for  private social functions, psychiatric facilities and drug clinics, and private  offices assigned to a single person from which smoke cannot drift to no-smoking  areas.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, businesses may apply for hardship exemptions. Of the three  applications received since August, two have been approved -- one involving a  jewelry store run by two handicapped Vietnam veterans and the other for a  restaurant where patrons' entrance through the bar made it difficult to comply  with the ordinance's requirement of smoke-free waiting areas. A Spring Valley  beauty parlor was turned down in its request.  </P> <P> Mirroring restaurants' experience, private employers have reported no major  problems complying with the ordinance's ban on smoking in shared work areas. As  a practical matter, that provision has resulted in many workplaces being  declared entirely off limits to smokers, though employees are permitted to  smoke behind closed doors in private offices when no nonsmokers are present.  </P> <P> Paul Wark, the division manager of Robertshaw Controls Co., said that the floor  layout of the firm's Fallbrook factory left managers with little choice but to  ban smoking inside the 330-employee plant.  </P> <P> "At our place, if you're inside the building, you're in a shared work space,"  Wark said, chuckling. Though smokers now must go outside to smoke, "We haven't  heard a bit of static about it," he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Small Firms  </P> <P> The Lung Assn.'s Kelley, however, questions whether all businesses are  complying with the ordinance, noting that most of the 5,800 businesses in the  unincorporated areas are small firms with only a handful of employees. In such  an environment, workers may be hesitant to report infractions, she said.  </P> <P> "Most of these businesses are family-run or close to it, so you'd feel almost  like a traitor if you reported someone," Kelley said. Moreover, although  employees who file complaints are guaranteed confidentiality to protect against  retaliation by employers or co-workers, in most cases it would not be difficult  for workers in a small office to determine the tipster, she added.  </P> <P> In contrast to the specific numerical formulas or other provisions governing  smoking in restaurants and workplaces, the ordinance establishes a more general  guideline for hotels and motels, saying simply that there should be sufficient  nonsmoking rooms to meet demand.  </P> <P> Although there again have been no major complaints from hoteliers, Jim Durbin,  chairman of the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Assn., said it is "too early for a  verdict" on how the measure has affected his industry. Like restaurateurs,  hotel owners are concerned about any arbitrary standards that could force rooms  to remain vacant, though that has not been a problem to date.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ignored by Other Cities  </P> <P> One major disappointment felt by Williams and other supporters of the county  measure is that, contrary to their hopes, the ordinance has not yet been copied  by cities throughout the county. At the time of the measure's passage, the  county sent letters to the 18 local incorporated cities urging them to adopt  similar measures. To date, however, none have.  </P> <P> County health official Pugh, however, said he believes that many smaller cities  are waiting to see how the city of San Diego handles the issue early this year.  A city task force has been reviewing the county's anti-smoking measure for  several months and is expected to forward its recommendations to the council  next month.  </P> <P> "The city's the key," Pugh said. "If San Diego goes along with it, I think  you'll start to see action from the other cities too."  </P> <P> And Williams, who in the past often complained about "getting a lung full of  smoke" even while walking down the halls of the County Administration Center,  said that the issue has to be evaluated from a long-range perspective.  </P> <P> "On such an emotional issue, you're not going to change thinking overnight,"  Williams said. "But this is an important step, because it clearly shifts the  momentum toward nonsmokers. This is a gradual process, and we still have a lot  of educating to do. Still, every time you go to work or a restaurant and aren't  exposed to smoke, you can tell -- and smell -- that we're moving in the right  direction."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ahmad Hamud by Khalid </F> al-Mash'an "during a dinner banquet at his residence" on 6 March]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Al-Mash'an] An international  newspaper published the photo of a Kuwaiti citizen, who was  arrested in Iraq on charges of espionage against Iraq. Has this  citizen been identified? And what is your response to Iraq's  accusation that this citizen was sent by the Kuwaiti  Intelligence Service?    [Hamud] The Iraqi regime has always tried to hamper any  progress in Kuwait. It has always tried to tarnish Kuwait's  image in front of the international community. I believe this  story was fabricated by the Iraqi media, which has experience in  such fabrications.    We will not try to identify this person because he might be  an Iraqi who was wearing a Kuwait dress and claimed to be a  Kuwaiti citizen. The Iraqi regime is used to such farces. This  person might have also been in Kuwait before the invasion and  the Iraqi regime is now claiming that he works for Kuwaiti  Intelligence.    The Iraqi regime is known for these fabrications. I believe  that if there were Nobel prizes for media fabrications the Iraqi  regime would be the winner. [passage omitted]    [Al-Mash'an] There have been reports that another trench  will  be dug on the northern border. What is the purpose of this?    [Hamud] A plan has been set to build a security wall. One of  its phases is to dig the trench. Once the digging of the trench  is completed we will embark on the second phase, etc., until we  finish the three-phase plan. [passage omitted]    [Al-Mash'an] When will the Central Committee begin to study  the status of the al-Bidun [stateless persons]? Did the  committee create a plan to solve this problem?    [Hamud] The Central Committee is working to set up its  headquarters and to recruit employees. After the 'Id, I will  meet with the Central Committee to create a plan, lay its  foundations, and begin the committee's working plan.    The committee will then announce the steps it will follow in  its work. It will also explain the way to submit applications  to this committee.    I would like to settle this issue as soon as possible. I am  confident that the brothers who were consulted and who agreed to  be members of the committee will do their utmost. We wish them  success in their work to solve this problem. [passage omitted]</p>

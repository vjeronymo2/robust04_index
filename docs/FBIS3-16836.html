Your SEGODNYA  correspondent was told in Russia's State Committee for the  Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor] with  reference to information from the Swiss headquarters of the  NucNet European Nuclear Society (based on the information from  Ukraine's State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety) that the events at the AES unfolded as follows:    At 2100 local time, a power cable of 0.4 kilovolts ignited  in  the engine room of the first reactor. The firemen put out the  fire at 2110. Despite that the chiefs decided to discontinue  the generator's operation and it was shut down. Ukraine's State  Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety  rated this incident grade 1 on the seven-point INES scale.    Commenting on this occurrence, Yuriy Rogozhin, press service  head of the Russian State Committee for the Supervision of  Nuclear and Radiation Safety, stated in an interview with your  SEGODNYA correspondent that a rather dubious situation prevails  in CIS nuclear power engineering. For example, the Russian  State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation  Safety had received information about the accident at  Khmelnitskiy AES through the channels of foreign news agencies.  This despite an agreement on exchanging information about this  sort of occurrences signed between the two committees in 1992.  The agreement was sealed at the intergovernment level a year  later. Incidentally, as this issue went to print the Russian  counterparts had not been alerted to the Khmelnitskiy incident  by Ukraine's State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety.</p>

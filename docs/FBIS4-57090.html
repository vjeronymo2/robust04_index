			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama, 10 May (PL) -- Panamanian President-elect  Ernesto Perez Balladares said on the night of 9 May that during  his administration, Panama will maintain first-rate and  respectful relations with Cuba.    Asked about the topic by journalists, Perez Balladares noted  that relations with Cuba will be the same as those maintained  with any other nation. Perez Balladares, a 47-year-old  businessman, added that relations between the two nations will  be characterized by respect for the systems prevailing in each  country and noninterference in their respective internal affairs.    Panamanian-Cuban relations were virtually annulled following  the U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 December 1989 and operate only  at the level of acting charge d'affaires.    Perez Balladares, who will be proclaimed winner of the 8 May  elections on 12 or 13 May, was nominated by the Democratic  Revolutionary Party, which the U.S. military intervention  removed from power.</p>

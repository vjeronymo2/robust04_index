			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NUNN URGES EUROPE TROOP CUT TO 75,000  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said today the Pentagon should plan on cutting European  troop levels by up to two-thirds in five years and suggested the Navy think  about making do with as few as 10 aircraft carriers.  </P> <P> The influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a major  address laying out his ideas about how U.S. forces should be reorganized in  view of the reduced threat, also proposed a greater reliance on reserve forces  and suggested informal military cooperation with France.  </P> <P> And Nunn, who in a few days will announce his proposals to reduce the  Administration's fiscal 1991 defense budget, said cuts proposed by House  Democratic leaders are too deep, but are "within the realm of responsibility."  </P> <P> There are currently about 310,000 troops in Europe, mostly in West Germany, and  the United States has proposed going down to 225,000 in all of Europe, with  195,000 in the central area.  </P> <P> "Despite the Administration's view that 195,000 U.S. troops in central Europe  is a 'floor' below which the United States cannot reduce, that is not the right  assumption," Nunn said.  </P> <P> "I think we must begin planning for a significantly lower level in the years  ahead. I agree with former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger that we  should start planning on a residual force in Europe on the order of 75,000 to  100,000 troops within five years."  </P> <P> Nunn, noting pressures for housing and other services in Germany and calls for  lower troop levels there, added later to reporters, "I believe the question  will be whether that may be too many for the Germans in three or four years."  </P> <P> France long ago pulled its military forces out of NATO, preferring to chart its  own military course in Europe, but recently has started joint exercises with  Britain and even West Germany.  </P> <P> Nunn said he is not seeking a formal arrangement with France, but asked, "Why  can't the French and the Americans have occasional exercises involving French  ports and airfields?"  </P></p>

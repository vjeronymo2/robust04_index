			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] A top official of the Japan Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP], which is participating in the joint floor group  "Kaishin," told reporters that even if the other coalition  parties offer to reconsider the idea of forming "Kaishin" to ask  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to return to the  coalition, it believes that the SDPJ is no longer in a position  to be persuaded. He thus indicated that the possibility of the  SDPJ's changing its mind is scarce.    Remarks by Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation]  Chairman Akira Yamagishi follow:    [Begin recording] "Jiyuto" [Liberal Party] was unilaterally  allowed into the framework of the coalition without prior  consultations. This is a change of the coalition's framework.  From the SDPJ's viewpoint, this is breach of faith, and it is  inevitable for the SDPJ to think the other coalition parties are  trying to eliminate it. [end recording]</p>

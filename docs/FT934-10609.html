			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Blagden shares dive 26p after warning SHARES IN Blagden Industries, the packaging and chemicals group, tumbled 26p to 138p yesterday after the company warned that profits for the current year were unlikely to exceed Pounds 2.5m. The decline from the previous year's Pounds 7.63m reflects the intense competitive pressures on the steel drum business within the group's packaging division. Blagden said trading conditions for the first half of 1993 had remained substantially unchanged from those of the second half of last year. However, since the announcement in August of halved interim profits of Pounds 3m, prices of steel drums had fallen in Germany and this had led to significant price reductions across Europe. The company added that with the extra burden of the increased price of steel (up about 4 per cent in the third quarter of 1993) operating margins had been eroded. This was, however, in common with its competitors in the European drum market, where Blagden is a leading player in an industry burdened by overcapacity. In contrast, both the chemicals and protective equipment divisions continued to trade well. Blagden said it had identified further cost-cutting measures and a number of business initiatives to improve longer-term profitability. At the interim stage, the company stressed the need for 'prudent husbanding' of resources, in cutting the dividend from 4.5p to 1.5p.</p>

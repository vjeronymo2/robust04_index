			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MARKET TUNES IN TO DATRON DESPITE DEFENSE CUTBACKS  </P> <P> In these days of defense budget cuts, Datron Systems in Simi Valley wouldn't  seem to have a chance of appealing to investors.  </P> <P> After all, Datron is a small electronics concern that sells its products mainly  to defense and other U.S. government agencies. Datron's products, which  accounted for sales of $37 million in its fiscal year ended March 31, include  antennas for tracking satellites, simulators for jet pilots and military  radios.  </P> <P> Datron's stock is thinly traded, making it harder for investors to buy or sell  at prices they want, when they want. The company has a modest 2.7 million  shares outstanding, and 25% of those are held by company insiders. Only a  handful of Wall Street analysts bother to follow Datron.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm's President  </P> <P> "Conventional wisdom dictates that small-capitalization defense electronics  companies should be shunned" by the market, especially when defense spending is  shrinking, said David A. Derby, Datron's president and chief executive.  </P> <P> But so much for conventional wisdom. Investors are increasingly taking note of  Datron, and its stock, which closed Friday at $12 a share in over-the-counter  trading, is hovering near its all-time high since the company went public for  $8.875 a share in 1985.  </P> <P> Why? Datron's sales have jumped 65% over the past two years; its profit doubled  in the same period to $3.5 million in fiscal 1988, and its order backlog is  climbing sharply.  </P> <P> Moreover, investors see Datron -- a diversified company despite its small size  -- evading the budget-cutters' knives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Order Cuts Doubts  </P> <P> "They just don't seem to be involved in the types of programs that seem likely  to get canceled," said Edward G. Shufro, a partner in the New York  money-management firm Shufro, Rose &amp; Ehrman, which is Datron's biggest  stockholder with 18% of its shares.  </P> <P> Datron, Shufro and other investors are betting that the defense cutbacks will  focus mostly on armaments, with the government building fewer missiles, planes  and ships. They see a continued need for Datron's antennas, radios and  simulators even if the Defense Department orders fewer guns and bullets.  </P> <P> "We're in the communications business, not the defense business," said Derby, a  48-year-old Iowa native who helped start Datron in 1969. "Whether there's a  500-ship Navy or a 600-ship Navy doesn't make much difference to us. We will  continue to have a Navy . . . somebody's got to talk to the ships" with the  help of Datron's antennas, he said.  </P> <P> Datron also is looking beyond the military. In April, it received an  $18-million, four-year subcontract from Raytheon to provide the mount and other  primary mechanical parts of antennas for use on the Terminal Doppler Weather  Radar system, a federal program aimed at helping airline pilots detect  dangerous wind-shear conditions near airports.  </P> <P> That program helped Datron's order backlog surge to a record $36 million as of  June 30, up from $28 million three months earlier.  </P> <P> Datron also jumped recently into the market for sophisticated training  simulators for pilots. They're not the simulators that depict a cockpit;  rather, they are systems that send simulated radar and missile-attack signals  to pilots flying real military jets nearby. The idea is to test the pilot under  actual flying conditions.  </P> <P> The system, which sits atop a flatbed truck so that it can be moved and  surprise the pilots, "does everything except fire a missile" at the jets, Derby  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth Seen  </P> <P> The simulators are "going to be an area of significant growth" for Datron,  predicted Lawrence Harris of the investment firm Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards  in Los Angeles. He said the simulator business should provide about $5 million  of Datron's sales this fiscal year, up from $3 million last year.  </P> <P> Datron, which has 350 employees, also makes high-frequency radio systems for  the military and other agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service, that want to  communicate over the horizon without using satellites or wires to transmit  their signals. The radios' frequencies reach the upper atmosphere and bounce  over the horizon to enable the users to talk.  </P> <P> Datron got into that business in 1985 by acquiring Trans World Communications  for $9 million, and Bateman Eichler's Harris predicts that the radio group will  kick in about $13 million of Datron's estimated $43 million in sales this year.  </P> <P> But the heart of Datron's business is its satellite antenna and communications  business, which accounts for more than half of its sales. These include  ground-based antenna stations, which are several stories high and are used to  track satellites and electronically change their orbit. They cost upwards of $1  million each.  </P> <P> The satellites might be used by the military for surveillance, or might be  so-called "earth resources" satellites that monitor weather patterns or  photograph crop yields.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Satellite Antennas  </P> <P> Datron's products also include antennas no more than six feet high that are  placed aboard Navy ships to track the military's satellite system (MILSTAR).  Since 1976, Datron has delivered 408 such antennas to the Navy, and 31 more are  to be shipped.  </P> <P> Overall, analysts estimate that Datron's work on MILSTAR equipment could total  up to $100 million over the next decade.  </P> <P> In a sense, Datron is not a manufacturer of its products; it's more of an  assembler. Datron's engineers design an antenna, the company then buys many of  its components (although it makes some of its own) and then assembles the  equipment for delivery.  </P> <P> Datron's expertise is in designing and building the guts of a system -- the  base, all the mechanical parts, the electronic systems -- then it buys a dish  to complete the product.  </P> <P> "We are not a factory that stamps out metal panels for antennas," Derby said.  </P> <P> Datron has plenty of competition. Scientific-Atlanta vies with Datron in  satellite-tracking antennas, and General Dynamics makes simulators for jet  pilots.  </P> <P> Datron was started by Derby and seven other people and remained privately held  for 10 years. The company grew slowly, in part because the founder-owners  focused heavily on developing their products and not enough in marketing them,  he said.  </P> <P> In 1979, the company was acquired by Hale Technology Corp., a San  Francisco-based concern that has since liquidated; but by 1985, Datron was spun  off into a publicly held concern again. Derby was named chief executive in  1982.  </P> <P> Derby, an amateur pilot, attended what is now Cal State Northridge, studying  electronics, and also was an electronics technician in the Navy between 1959  and 1962. He first worked for Litton Industries, then for a company called  Canoga Electronics, which also made antennas. That's where he met Datron's  other co-founders.  </P> <P> In an interview, Derby compared himself to little more than the coach of a team  -- a coach who earned $381,500 in salary and other compensation last year.  </P> <P> "I cannot design any of our products," he said, "and I certainly cannot produce  them. I can't do anything other than define the plays that we need to run and  get the people we need to run them to want to."  </P> <P> So what's his next series of plays?  </P> <P> "We have to build the best product at the lowest price," he said. "It's  simple."  </P></p>

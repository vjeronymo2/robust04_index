			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Lean times for Britons who eat for their country On Christmas Day, Mr John Smith, the British Labour party leader, his wife and three daughters will be tucking into the finest turkey dinner the Holy Land can provide as guests of Mr and Mrs Andrew Burns, the British ambassador and his wife, in Tel Aviv. For the Burns, like many of the Foreign Office's 217 heads of posts abroad, regard entertaining, however festive, as work; and few diplomats - ever mindful of esprit de corps - have been tempted to follow Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who cancelled his Christmas party for the press - a less-than-lavish affair of mulled wine and cold mince pies at Number 11. Even so, ghosts are looming over the feast. Not only has the FO been squeezed in public spending rounds, but the devaluation of the pound after its exit from the exchange rate mechanism last September has taken its toll on the spending power of British posts abroad. Ambassadors and their spouses - who receive an annual entertainments allowance - are reporting a pinch this year and are steeled for further parsimony. But there are still good reasons for dining to remain, as Lord Palmerston put it, the soul of diplomacy. Lady Fall, the wife of the British ambassador in Moscow, held six parties this season. They included a buffet-and-sketches event for staff, two children's parties (for the British community and children of Russian staff) and a dance for the Russian staff. As she spends in three currencies - roubles, dollars and sterling - her costs are a 'nightmare' to control. She economises by serving 'Australian bubbly or Spanish fizzy', keeping champagne for 'special occasions involving the French ambassador'. 'We know we're heading for a crunch but it hasn't come yet,' she says. 'This city is very frustrating and parties are good for morale.' Mrs Sarah Burns also regards Christmas as a time of official morale-boosting. She has given a children's party at which her husband played Santa; a carol party - at which the prize exhibit was not the plum pudding but a large ham, smuggled in from one of the only shops in Israel with a bootleg stock of pork; and tonight a carol party which will end up in Manger Square in Bethlehem. As for expense, 'the annual budget has been cut and we won't personally be quite so lavish', says Mrs Burns. 'But a turkey is a turkey.' She feels, however, that most economies are already in place, even though she has provided meals for 4,000 people in her first year in the post. 'Everything is accountable. I wish I'd done a hotel management course before becoming an ambassador's wife,' she says. In Washington, Lady Renwick is spared such worries by a social staff and a streamlined diary. She is simply giving a large children's party and a buffet dinner for 250 people (embassy staff and British press). All those lunches and dinners mount up fast, and the Foreign Office is under continuous pressure to cut costs further. Total annual expenditure on diplomatic service hospitality in 1992-93 was Pounds 7m, up from Pounds 5.7m in the previous year and Pounds 3.5m in 1975-76. Diplomats, however, are adamant that spending on what they call the 'entertainments workload' delivers value for money, and helps boost British exports and interests.</p>

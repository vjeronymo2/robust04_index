			<p>BFN     [Text] Shantou, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Li Ka-shing, noted Hong  Kong tycoon, has begun to invest in the energy, communications  and housing of Shantou City, Guangdong Province.    His investment has reached about 4 billion yuan since the  beginning of this year.    The projects include a bay bridge, four power plants, a  container wharf at Zhuchigang Port, and a cement factory.    In late April, Li signed an agreement with Shantou Municipal  Government on a housing project with a total floor space of 1.2  million square meters.    The project will be completed by the end of 2000 and is  expected to accommodate 70,000 residents.    In previous years, Li, chairman of the board of directors of  Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. of Hong Kong, mainly supported  Shantou's development of public services.    As early as in 1982, Li donated funds for a university in  Shantou.    His donations to the university have added up to 887 million  HK dollars.</p>

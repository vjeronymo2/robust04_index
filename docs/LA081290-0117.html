			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BARRY CONVICTED ON 1 COUNT; JURY DEADLOCKS ON 12 OTHERS;  </P> <P> COCAINE: WASHINGTON'S MAYOR IS ACQUITTED ON ANOTHER CHARGE, AND A MISTRIAL IS  DECLARED ON THE MORE SERIOUS COUNTS. THE TWO MISDEMEANOR VERDICTS RETURNED WILL  STAND.  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry was convicted Friday on one misdemeanor count of cocaine  possession and acquitted of another by a federal court jury that declared  itself hopelessly deadlocked on 12 other drug and perjury charges.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson declared a mistrial on the  deadlocked counts and set a Sept. 17 hearing to allow the prosecution to say if  it wishes to retry Barry on those charges.  </P> <P> The verdicts returned by the jury on the two misdemeanor counts will stand.  </P> <P> Barry, a three-term mayor who had predicted that no jury in Washington would  convict him, hugged his supporters and defense team in court and smiled at  reporters when the mistrial was declared.  </P> <P> It was a stunning end to a six-week trial that featured an FBI videotape of the  mayor smoking crack cocaine in a sting operation.  </P> <P> Barry had insisted all along that he had been singled out by vindictive federal  prosecutors. He said the government spent millions trying to convict him, and  the case created racial tension in the nation's capital.  </P> <P> The jury found Barry guilty of charges that he possessed cocaine in November  1989 with longtime associate Doris Crenshaw. Crenshaw testified that she  snorted cocaine with the mayor in her hotel room.  </P> <P> Barry was found innocent of charges that he possessed cocaine on Sept. 7, 1989.  </P> <P> The jury was hung on the three most serious counts, felony charges of lying to  a federal grand jury about his dealings with Charles Lewis, a convicted cocaine  dealer who was one of the government's chief witnesses.  </P> <P> It also couldn't agree on a verdict on the cocaine possession charge stemming  from the FBI sting operation. In the FBI videotape, Barry was seen smoking  crack cocaine with former girlfriend Rasheeda Moore at the Vista Hotel on Jan.  18.  </P> <P> All told, Barry had been charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, three  counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine and conceal  its use.  </P> <P> The mayor said repeatedly that he never used cocaine, and it wasn't until  closing arguments that Mundy acknowledged that Barry had used the drug. Even  so, Mundy said the government had failed to produce the specifics of its case.  </P> <P> As he left the courthouse, Barry was mobbed by supporters urging him to seek  reelection. Barry had said that he would not run for a fourth term, but there  has been speculation in recent days that he would change his mind and run as an  independent.  </P> <P> "He is relieved, obviously, and this is his 202nd day chemical free," his press  secretary Lurma Rackley said.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Jay Stephens was heckled as he defended the prosecution of the  mayor.  </P> <P> He said that on the single conviction, the jury had held "Mr. Barry accountable  for his criminal conduct and he must now accept responsibility for that  conduct."  </P> <P> He said he would review the case before deciding whether to seek a retrial.  Jackson scheduled a hearing for Sept. 17.  </P> <P> The judge had asked the jury whether it wanted to resume deliberations on the  remaining 12 counts. After conferring in the jury room, the panel said it was  deadlocked.  </P> <P> "I am prepared to declare a mistrial on the remaining 12 charges," Jackson  said.  </P> <P> Mundy responded, "I move. . . ." and Jackson nodded in assent.  </P> <P> The cocaine possession charge is a misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of  one year in jail and a $100,000 fine.  </P> <P> Barry was released on his own recognizance.  </P> <P> Thirteen witnesses testified during the trial that they had seen the mayor use  drugs about 200 times. Mundy conceded that the mayor was an occasional cocaine  user, but said the prosecution had relied on liars to make its case and had  failed to prove the charges.  </P> <P> The mayor's trial focused attention anew on race relations in the nation's  capital, a city whose population is 70% black.  </P> <P> Several black leaders suggested that Barry was prosecuted simply because he is  a high-profile black politician. Among them was Nation of Islam Minister Louis  Farrakhan, who was at first barred from attending the trial.  </P> <P> Two whites sat on the 12-member jury. The jury foreman was a white man.  </P> <P> Barry came to the city in 1965, a civil rights worker. Three years later, after  the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the city erupted in its  worst racial violence. Barry was often credited with cooling tempers in the  aftermath.  </P> <P> Barry had lost much of his support among white voters even before his arrest in  January.  </P> <P> "The majority of whites are just plain annoyed and angry and just want this guy  to go," D.C. Councilman Jim Nathanson said before the trial began. Nathanson,  who is white, represents a predominantly white district.  </P> <P> Many in the black community felt betrayed by the mayor, who had made appearance  after appearance preaching the evils of drugs to the city's youth.  </P> <P> After his arrest, Barry admitted to a problem with alcohol and prescription  drugs, and he entered out-of-state treatment programs.  </P> <P> During six weeks of testimony, a parade of prosecution witnesses alleged that  the mayor had snorted cocaine and smoked crack, opium and marijuana 200 times  in a seven-year span.  </P> <P> Barry's lawyers asserted that the prosecution witnesses -- many of them  admitted drug users -- were lying in an attempt to ease their own legal  problems.  </P> <P> The verdict is the culmination of a criminal investigation that began in  December, 1988, after the mayor's visits to Lewis' hotel room in Washington,  D.C.  </P> <P> Lewis testified that Barry used cocaine and crack repeatedly on two trips to  the Virgin Islands. He said they also smoked crack in a Washington, D.C., hotel  room, where he said Barry became so paranoid that he unscrewed bathroom light  bulbs to get them checked for surveillance devices.  </P> <P> He testified that they conspired to cover up their drug use when police began  investigating a complaint that Lewis had offered crack to a hotel maid.  </P> <P> Lewis began cooperating with the government a year ago, after he was convicted  of drug charges in the Virgin Islands.  </P> <P> Barry's lawyers depicted Lewis as a liar who fabricated allegations of drug use  to shorten his time in prison.  </P> <P> Moore, the government's star witness, testified that she and Barry used drugs  together "at least 100 times" in hotels, boats and homes around the city from  1986 to 1989. They were lovers for two years, then simply partners in drug use,  she said.  </P> <P> The defense attacked Moore's credibility and motives.  </P> <P> She was nearly broke and in trouble with the police when the FBI asked her to  cooperate in the sting operation, she admitted.  </P> <P> She almost never provided the court with any dates for her alleged drug use  with Barry, saying she wasn't good with numbers. The defense suggested she was  making up the stories and didn't want to give dates because they might conflict  with Barry's out-of-town trips.  </P></p>

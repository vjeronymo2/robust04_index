			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / More pilots urged for ships COMMERCIAL PRESSURE to take the most direct route between Norway and North America forced the master of the oil tanker Braer to risk polluting the Shetland coastline, professional pilots told the Donaldson public inquiry yesterday. Captain Phillip Grey, in a joint submission for the Deep Sea and North Sea Pilots' Associations, said the safer - but longer - route to the Atlantic was through the North Sea and the English Channel. Captain Grey said: 'He (the master) would have been safe, but probably soon out of work. His charterer could claim the extra distance and time involved.' Pilot organisations urged the inquiry, which is considering the wider implications of the oil spill in January, to recommend greater use of pilotage to take vessels along vulnerable coasts. The Department of Transport has refused to support calls for mandatory pilotage for such routes as the Minches and the Pentland Firth. In a memorandum to the inquiry the government said it would be unnecessary and might be prohibitively expensive. 'The department is not aware of any water around the UK, outside harbours and regularly used by shipping, where the risk of collision or grounding is high and where the compulsory requirement for a pilot would be likely to reduce that risk.' The hearing resumes on May 11.</p>

Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian delegation, informed  U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross of the decision reached by  the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese delegations. He pointed out  that the decision had been personally made by the  representatives of the various Arab delegations.    Israeli sources expressed the assessment that this was an  indication of the desire of Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan not to  exacerbate the tensions generated by the Hebron massacre.    Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington told  our  correspondent Arye Golan that Israel was prepared to launch  continuous negotiations with the Palestinians in Washington  starting this Wednesday [2 March], as proposed by President  Clinton; however, this was now up to the PLO.    Political sources in Jerusalem expressed regret at the break  in the talks, noting that this was merely a temporary hiatus  which did not mean that the peace process had been halted.    The resumption of the Security Council's debate on the  Hebron  massacre has been put off due to the PLO's demand to include  Jerusalem in the resolution calling for guarantees for the  security of the Palestinians in the territories. Israel is  prepared to accept this formula but refuses to include Jerusalem  in it. Israel has also rejected the PLO demand to include a  clause on a temporary international presence in the territories.    Gad Ya'aqobi, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations,  said  that the international presence stipulated in the Declaration of  Principles signed between the PLO and Israel referred to foreign  observers that would be deployed with the mutual consent of both  parties during the Israeli withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza  Strip. The Security Council is not convening because of the  disagreement over these two issues. For the time being,  agreement has only been reached on issuing a condemnation of the  Hebron massacre and a call for accelerated peace negotiations.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 28 February  reports that "political sources in Jerusalem believe that the  United States will take action to resume the peace talks after  the Security Council issues its resolutions. Yesterday, Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin received a letter from UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus- Ghali. The secretary general called on  Israel to agree to an international or foreign presence in the  territories as stipulated by the Declaration of Principles  signed in Oslo, although that document mentions the issue from a  different aspect. Butrus-Ghali justifies his position by saying  that stationing an international presence in the territories  would constitute a confidence building measure between Israel  and the Palestinians. Officials in Jerusalem, however, have  categorically rejected this demand. Jerusalem officials also  clarified that no additional decisions would be taken beyond  those made by the cabinet yesterday."]</p>

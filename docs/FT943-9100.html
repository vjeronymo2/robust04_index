			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Storm at Bastille sinks its conductor: Paris opera house rocked by last-minute dismissal Yet another drama has unfolded at the scandal-scarred Opera Bastille in Paris with the dismissal yesterday of Mr Myung Whun Chung, the acclaimed South Korean conductor, as its artistic director only a month before the start of its new season. Mr Chung won praise at the Bastille for productions such as Shostakovitch's Macbeth. However, his tenure in Paris has been clouded by the highly-publicised problems of the Bastille. It has fared well in terms of attendance but has been plagued by strikes and financial difficulties since its glittering opening by President Francois Mitterrand as a state-of-the-art 'people's opera' on the 200th anniversary of the 1789 French revolution. The departure of Mr Chung, 41, who joined the Bastille five years ago following the firing of Mr Daniel Barenboim, the Israeli-born conductor, ends weeks of wrangling between him and the Paris Opera's new management team led by Mr Hugues Gall. Mr Gall is a former bureaucrat who was appointed director-designate last summer after the election victory of Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government. Mr Chung had been brought into the Bastille by Mr Gall's predecessor, Mr Pierre Berge, feisty head of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house and a close friend of Mr Mitterrand. The appointment of Mr Gall, whose operatic empire includes the 19th century Garnier opera house and Opera-Comique as well as the brand new FFr3bn (Pounds 360m) Bastille, immediately sparked speculation about the Korean's future. The behind-the-scenes battle between the two men came out into the open on Thursday when Le Monde newspaper published an interview with Mr Chung. The conductor claimed that the new management was trying to curb his artistic freedom and to change the terms of his contract, which was to run until the year 2000 with a sliding scale salary rising to FFr8m in his final year. Although Mr Chung told Le Monde that he would be willing to make 'a significant financial sacrifice' to stay at the Bastille, he made it quite clear that he was not willing to relinquish his power over the choice of productions or artistes. However, Mr Gall has made no secret of his intention to exercise full authority over every aspect of the Paris Opera's activities. The Opera yesterday issued a formal statement saying that it had terminated Mr Chung's employment because he had rejected all its proposals to shorten his contract. The Korean was said to be considering legal action. Mr Gall now faces the challenge of getting to grips with all of the Bastille's problems, as well as pressing ahead with his plan to shed 119 of the Paris Opera's 1,700 staff and preparing for the start of the Bastille's new season on September 19 without an artistic director.</p>

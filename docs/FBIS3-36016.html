The participants unanimously described the dismissals of  Stanislav Shushkevich and the "power" ministers as a  nomenklatura's coup and a path to Kebich dictatorship, which  will eventually lead to a collapse of the state and economy.    The members of the conference expressed their intention to  unify activities of all patriotic-democratic forces to resist  the dictatorship. Unification is to be discussed at the next  meeting.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HE TAKES HEAT FOR PHILADELPHIA'S BIG PROBLEMS;  </P> <P> FOR MAYOR GOODE, LITTLE BROTHERLY LOVE  </P> <P> The nation's birthplace has big problems, and its mayor, once mentioned as a  potential vice president, is taking the heat.  </P> <P> Philadelphians complain about too few police, dirty streets and reduced  services. They blame Mayor W. Wilson Goode, whom they have forced to back off  from a proposed $70-million tax increase. Even a political ally of the mayor  says he has been "a disappointment."  </P> <P> Democratic presidential candidate Walter F. Mondale mentioned Goode as a  possible running mate in 1984, but that was before the 1985 debacle that  forever damaged the mayor's image. When police, with Goode's approval,  confronted the radical MOVE group, 11 people were killed and scores of homes  were destroyed by fire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Halts Interview  </P> <P> Although Goode has insisted that things in Philadelphia are not as bad as  critics claim, last week, he abruptly cut off a telephone interview on the  first question: Is the city in trouble?  </P> <P> "I don't want to talk about it," he said. "Just say the mayor doesn't want to  comment."  </P> <P> Challenges remain for Goode, the first black mayor of the nation's  fifth-largest city, who is nearly halfway through his second four-year term.  </P> <P> Since he reversed the city's commitment to building a new courthouse and jail  after $30 million had been spent on it, Goode faces the wrath of the legal  community and a federal court that has ordered the city to relieve prison  crowding. Forced by public pressure to back off the tax increase, Goode is  trying to put together a budget amid projections of a $100-million deficit and  the clamor for more services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Panel Rebuffs Proposal  </P> <P> Even a special Tax Policy and Budget Review Committee appointed by Goode  rebuffed the mayor's tax proposal.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be a whitewash and it wasn't. That in itself indicates the  severity of the problem," said W. Thacher Longstreth, the senior Republican on  the City Council.  </P> <P> Many say that Goode hasn't been a good manager, and even supporters such as  Edward Mezvinsky, former Pennsylvania Democratic chairman and co-chairman of  Goode's 1987 reelection campaign, acknowledge that the mayor is in a political  bind.  </P> <P> "He's got to take unpopular positions because there is a lot less money  available," Mezvinsky said. "The city has to make it on its own. It's got to  pull in its belt and cut out unnecessary services. It has to be done if the  city is going to survive."  </P> <P> At recent town meetings, which Goode arranged this winter in a futile effort to  sell his tax plan, tempers frequently flared as citizens confronted the  frustrated, sometimes angry mayor to demand more police, cleaner streets and a  crackdown on drug dealing in neighborhoods.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ex-Mayor Withholds Comment  </P> <P> Former Mayor William Green, under whom Goode was city managing director, would  not comment on the managerial style of his successor.  </P> <P> "The facts speak for themselves," Green said.  </P> <P> Several top Democrats did not return phone calls or refused to comment publicly  on the mayor's standing. The political ally who called Goode a disappointment  would speak only on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> "He really isn't running the city well. He is not a dishonest person and is  trying to do his best, but integrity isn't enough to manage, and his  mismanagement has allowed his detractors to have a field day, which has  undermined his effectiveness," the Goode ally said.  </P> <P> "This city is more divided today than ever before. All the blame isn't Goode's  alone. Others have to share it, like the council, like the business community,  the judiciary. Everyone seems to have an ax to grind . . . and Goode has been  unable to bring the diverse elements together so the city can be run well," the  ally said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GOP Smells Blood  </P> <P> Republicans looking ahead to this fall's district attorney and city controller  elections smell blood. It's been nearly four decades since Republicans last  controlled the government of this city, which has a 3-to-1 Democratic  registration.  </P> <P> "If you listen, you can hear people saying Philadelphia is ready for a complete  change in government and politics," state Sen. M. Joseph Rocks, the GOP choice  for controller, said.  </P> <P> Goode has shown he is listening. He said recently he would hire 400 more police  this year, and then add 300 more in each of the next three years to a force  that now numbers about 6,000 (down from the 7,800 when he took office in 1984).  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fourth-quarter earnings tumble sharply at Amoco FOURTH-QUARTER earnings of Amoco, the US oil and natural gas group with large interests in chemicals, fell to Dollars 200m, or 40 cents a share, from Dollars 538m, or Dollars 1.07, in the corresponding quarter of 1990, Reuter reports from Chicago. The group attributed the fall to lower crude oil prices and higher exploration expenses. Crude oil prices averaged Dollars 20 a barrel, or more than Dollars 10 a barrel below the 1990 fourth-quarter level. Exploration expenses were up Dollars 85m. Amoco added that its chemical operations incurred a loss in the quarter, reflecting a soft economy and industry overcapacity. Amoco's 1991 full-year profits declined to Dollars 1.53bn, or Dollars 3.07 a share, from Dollars 1.91bn, or Dollars 3.77, in 1990. The 1991 net includes a Dollars 311m, or 62 cents-a-share gain. Worldwide capital and exploration expenditures in 1991 amounted to Dollars 3.9bn, compared with Dollars 3.7bn in 1990. Amoco recently announced a capital and exploration expenditure budget of Dollars 3.7bn for 1992. Domestic exploration and production operations earned Dollars 107m in the fourth quarter, while foreign exploration and production earnings amounted to Dollars 46m.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Mandela urges halt to strikes President Nelson Mandela yesterday appealed to South African workers to curb their right to strike following a recent spate of industrial stoppages that threatened the country's development by frightening away foreign investment, agencies report from Johannesburg. Mr Mandela, speaking at the national convention of the Congress of South Africa Trade Unions, said: 'There are at least 5m people who are unemployed, who don't know where to find food, who don't know where to find a place to sleep. That is your problem to solve.' He urged the 1,700 union delegates not to look at their own personal interest or those of their unions but to 'create conditions where business can expand' and jobs be created. Meanwhile, car industry workers streamed back to work yesterday after a five-week strike. Assembly lines opened in all but one of South Africa's seven car plants after the union decided to restart pay talks. Since June there have also been strikes and walkouts in the metal, paper, mining, oil, and road freight industries. The South African Chamber of Business has put the cumulative loss of production as a result of recent strikes at about R3bn (Pounds 535m), or 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product.</p>

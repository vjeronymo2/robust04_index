			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: InterCity turns trains to hotels INTERCITY is taking steps to earn at least some revenue during tomorrow's planned 24-hour rail strike, Roy Terry writes. Rather than see its fleet of 125 Pullmans standing idle at Paddington station, InterCity is offering sleeper accommodation for commuters tonight and tomorrow. The cost is Pounds 20 a night for a shared cabin and Pounds 30 a night for a single cabin. In addition, a full first class Pullman dining service is available from 8pm. Weary travellers or, in this case, non-travellers, may retire to their sleeper berths at 9.30pm. They will be awakened with a BR coffee. InterCity said: 'We are trying to give something back to our customers in difficult circumstances by offering a service to meet a known demand.' There have been some bookings, and BR expects many more. A similar service at Euston and King's Cross in previous years proved very popular. Bookings can be made by calling 071 922 6766.</p>

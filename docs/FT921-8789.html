			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Pricking the asset bubble 8.7) One of the gloomier theories gaining ground in the financial markets these days is that of asset deflation. In the 1980s, runs the argument, retail price inflation of the previous decade gave way to similarly rampant inflation in assets such as shares, houses and commercial property. Nomura calculates that in the 1960s and 1970s the value of purely financial assets in the developed economies grew at broadly the same rate as nominal GDP. In the 1980s it grew between one and a half and two times as fast. On the reasonable assumption that the earlier trend represents normality, how are we to get back to it? The answer, plainly, is through a combination of asset price deflation and general inflation: the more of one, the less of the other. Asset inflation in the 1980s was at its sharpest in Japan, producing a sixfold rise in equity prices. Since Japanese general inflation is negligible, the result has been a collapse of 46 per cent in the market's nominal value from its end-1989 peak. In the UK, general inflation has played a much greater part in the process of adjustment. Thus, though the FT-SE is now 3 per cent higher in nominal terms than at its pre-crash peak in 1987, in real terms it is down by 23 per cent. Considering that house prices in London and the south-east are down by around a quarter in nominal terms since their peak in 1989, this is only reassuring up to a point. But when it comes to Wall Street, the thesis becomes positively worrying. In the course of the 1980s the price of US equities more than trebled, with yields almost halving in the process. But still the market reaches into new territory. In nominal terms it is up by 19 per cent from its 1987 peak. Even adjusted for general inflation, it is down only 1 per cent since then. The past week has shown the resulting divergence to perfection. The Dow reached yet another record on Wednesday. On Friday, Tokyo dipped again below its danger level of 21,000. It is conceivable that the general theory is missing something, and that the level of US equities is somehow justified. It may be that the US economy can shrug off the debt which helped the asset inflation in the first place. It may also be that US consumers, despite their high gearing and reportedly low confidence, will continue responding to lower interest rates by punting on Wall Street rather than paying down their mortgages. It is also possible that Tokyo will hold above the level which becomes critical to the Japanese financial structure, despite a growing air of nervousness among domestic investors. The trouble is that for either Tokyo or Wall Street to go wrong would do further damage to confidence in markets worldwide. It is asking a good deal for both to go right.</p>

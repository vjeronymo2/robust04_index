			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Mayborn maintains growth record A third consecutive year of profit growth at Mayborn Group saw the USM-quoted fabric dyes, baby products and florists' sundries concern raise pre-tax figures by 30 per cent from Pounds 2.73m to Pounds 3.55m in 1992. Turnover was up 9 per cent from Pounds 33m to Pounds 36.1m. The group continued to be cash generative during the second half resulting in net borrowings being cut from Pounds 2.44m to Pounds 194,000 at the year end, giving gearing of 2 per cent (35 per cent). In view of the profit and cash improvement, the final dividend is raised to 3.4p for a total of 5p (4.2p). Earnings per share rose from 10.1p to 12.4p. Mr Ian Peacock, chairman, said the fabric dyes division had another particularly successful year, and after adjusting for the recent contraction of the Dylon France operation turnover was up 14 per cent and operating profits ahead 47 per cent to Pounds 1.5m. Turnover of the baby products side increased by 12 per cent, while profits grew 15 per cent. The florists' sundries side, however, incurred a small operating loss on turnover 6 per cent higher.</p>

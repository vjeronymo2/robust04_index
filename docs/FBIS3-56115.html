			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Zhilin report under the "Elections" rubric: </F> "Bagrov Accused of Not Playing by the Rules"]    [Text] A group of candidates running for the republic's  presidency has issued a statement in Crimea accusing Nikolay  Bagrov of breaking the rules of the election campaign.    Among other things, Bagrov's rivals complain that Nikolay  Vasilyevich's loyalists are constantly trying to discredit all  other participants in the election campaign. They are also  indignant at the fact that Ukrainian government newspapers,  radio, and television have given their backing to Bagrov. This  put the contenders at a disadvantage from the outset.    A MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent has learned that the  Kiev  authorities support Nikolay Bagrov, seeing him as an instrument  of Ukraine's national policy. He announced his bid for the  presidency only after chiefs of a pro-Kravchuk foundation called  "The New Generation" -- Shmelev, who is also Kravchuk's adviser,  and Buryak -- conducted active work with him from 27 October to  1 November. It is noteworthy that Messrs. Shmelev and Buryak  arrived in Crimea by car incognito. Mr. Shevyev, chairman of  the Crimea's Economic Revival Party, who received the emissaries  from Kiev, arranged confidential meetings for them with Bagrov  in the "Yuzhnyy" sanatorium. After Shmelev and Buryak, who  incidentally supervise the center for assistance to the  presidential authority, spoke to Bagrov, the latter decided to  try his luck in the presidential elections.    As soon as Kiev's envoys left Crimea, terror swept the  region. On 6 November, Yuriy Asmanov, leader of the Crimean  Tatars National Movement, was assassinated. Black Sea Fleet  officers perish one after another. Tensions begin to rise in  the region along with a campaign aimed at discrediting all  candidates for the presidency except Nikolay Bagrov.</p>

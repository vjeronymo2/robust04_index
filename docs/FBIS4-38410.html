			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at the </F> conference of leadership personnel of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service: "I Demand That You Act Vigorously,  Bravely, and Decisively"]    [Text] The aim of our meeting today is to map out  paths to develop the service and define its place and role in  the overall system of ensuring Russia's security in today's  conditions.    Profound economic and political reforms are under way in the  country. People's way of life is being turned upside down.  Global changes are occurring in the international situation.    Russia must take its proper place in the world community and  ensure effective protection of its independence, integrity, and  historical identity.    This is precisely why the country needs strong and  combatable  special services both today and in the future, and this includes  the counterintelligence organs.    We need new approaches to the system of ensuring the  security of the Russian Federation.    First and foremost we need an accurate, professional, and  prompt analysis of many factors and circumstances in order to  identify the real threats to the security of the Russian  Federation. The country's leadership expects from you accurate  assessments of the possible consequences of these threats and  the best ways to neutralize or eliminate them.    It is important that we possess reliable, systematic, and  unabridged knowledge of the situation inside the Russian  Federation and around it. We need advance information with  variant forecasts and appropriate draft proposals on possible  management or political solutions.    I categorically disagree with the view that the information  and analysis work of the counterintelligence service should be  performed only on instructions from above.    This is a profoundly erroneous stance! On the contrary, we  need as much initiative as possible. Waiting around for  instructions is just a nonstate approach. If you like, it is a  question that touches on the professional honor of the  counterintelligence service.    I would also like to clarify the line of argument that  the counterintelligence organs stand outside politics. As far  as individual staffers are concerned, they are certainly not  allowed to combine their work with political activity, that is  to say to serve the interests of a particular party or social  organization.    But the Federal Service is a state organ. Its main purpose  is to execute state policy. This must be clearly understood by  all staffers and by their leaders in particular.    Personnel in state service, wherever they may work, have  just  one policy -- that of the state. To be outside this policy is a  sure sign of professional unsuitability.    We want Russia to become a truly strong and effective  state. We want democratic institutions to develop not just in  word but in deed. We want guarantees of human rights to be  strengthened.    This is precisely why we will demand that all organs and  structures of the executive branch accurately follow the  priorities of state policy. This is our principled line.    Your service is called upon to perform primarily  counterintelligence functions.    Whatever changes may occurr in Russia and the world, we are  still a long way from the day when the counterintelligence  services will have nothing to do.    Unfortunately, there are forces in the world which have set  themselves the aim to weaken Russia and turn it into a feeble  competitor with a cheap labor force and low intellectual  potential. There are those who want to appropriate Russia's  natural wealth and take possession of our advanced technologies  in space, military, and other spheres.    The main rule is that any action capable of damaging  national  interests should be prevented or neutralized. From whatever  direction it might come.    There can be no question of any exceptions.    But I would like to emphasize that the efficacy of your work  is not judged by the number of spies you apprehend. Your task  is not just to expose but primarily to prevent intelligence  activities in Russia.    Let us not fool ourselves: There is as yet no reliable  protection in Russia against the gathering of information and  the establishment of agents networks. The reasons for this are  loopholes in the laws, our open borders, falling standards in  discipline, the cost of comercialization, and other factors.    The counterintelligence service is aware of all this more  clearly than anyone else. It is precisely you who are obliged  to inform the organs of power about this and to persistently  propose specific solutions from an organizational and legal  point of view.    The collapse of the system of state secrets is causing  serious alarm.    The Law "On State Secrets" came into force in Russia in  1993. But a new system for the protection of secrets based on it  has not as yet been created.    It is essential to make full use of the powers granted you.  First and foremost the right to monitor that the demands  regarding the protection of state secrets are carried out  precisely. Your assistance in elaborating and implementing  procedural [rezhimnyy] measures is especially needed by nonstate  structures.    An exceptionally important area of your activities is the  struggle against illegal infringement of the constitutional  system.    It is no secret to anyone that there are in Russia certain  parties and movements, as well as public figures and citizens,  who are banking on this. Illegal methods do not always receive  the proper rebuff. Part of this problem is down to your  shortcomings.    There is absolutely no justification for blaming this on an  alleged lack of the necessary legal base for exposing and  putting a stop to unconstitutional activity.    Yes, our legislation is not perfect. But we have enough  existing legal norms for counterintelligence work to neutralize  extremist plans.    I will make only one amplification on a matter of principle.  This work should be based not on the monitoring of citizens'  political conduct and views, but on the exposure, prevention,  and thwarting of unconstitutional and other illegal activities.    This is a most important factor which will make it possible  to avoid the counterintelligence organs becoming organs of  political investigation.    Interethnic contradictions are one of the basic factors  causing tension in Russia.    The conflicts in Chechnya, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia are  assuming a protracted nature, and are throwing the country into  a ferment.    Enormous resources are being diverted in order to settle  them  and to eliminate the consequences. The intervention of the  Armed Forces, law enforcement bodies and other departments is  needed. Innocent people are perishing as the contradictions are  being resolved. Tens of thousands of people are becoming  refugees.    In these conditions the forecasts for the development of  events and suggestions of essential measures are extremely  important. There is patently a lack of efficiency at the present  time. I am drawing this to the most serious attention not only  of the leadership of the FCS but also the leaders of the  territorial organs. The whole arsenal of forces and resources  of the FCS must be brought into play and new, nonstereotyped  methods of work must be actively sought.    Inaction and irresolution are fraught with the most serious  consequences. These include a decline in the prestige of the  authorities both in the center and at local level, and a  critical reduction of the level of personal security, extremism,  and chaos for years to come in whole regions.    In the face of these dangers sluggishness and unconcern are  not only impermissible but criminal.    The paramount task for Russia today is to surmount the  economic crisis. Therefore I ask you to pay special attention  to questions of counterintelligence backup for the protection of  the Russian economy.    At present we are protecting Russian economic interests  poorly. There is no system or assertiveness in the FCS's actions  in this area. We must not go on trailing in the wake of events  and only reacting to them (even then belatedly at times).    Of course, ensuring economic security is a statewide task. I  address this criticism to everyone -- to economic departments,  above all. The time has come for the government to work out a  strategy of Russia's economic security.    Counterintelligence must act selectively in the economic  sphere.    I am talking, first, of questions to which the answers can  only be given by the special service and no other state organ.    Second, of the most vital state requirements or "sore  points."    Third, everything must be done to ensure that Russia does  not  end up "on the sidelines" of the world economy. It is necessary  to preserve progressive economic, scientific, and technical  potential and to ensure our export potential. This is a task  not only for science, industry, and foreign economic  departments. For this the special services must also make an  effort.    In addition, we must have a detailed picture of the  preconditions for possible extraordinary occurrences  (explosions, fires, accidents, disasters, and so on). I can  state without exaggeration that every major extraordinary  occurrence now deals a painful blow to Russia's entire economy  and to the social well-being of citizens.    We must have exhaustive knowledge of the threats associated  with flawed technologies for storing, neutralizing, and  destroying the waste material from dangerous production  processes and nuclear and chemical materials and weapons. The  use of Russia's territory to bury ecologically dangerous  materials illegally imported from abroad constitutes a special  question.    Active counterintelligence work in this area will not only  help the state to save considerable funds but will also save  people's lives.    Counterintelligence backup for conversion is one of the  most important problems.    Conversion is a commandment of the times. But we do not  travel the same road as those to whom conversion and scientific  and technical regression mean one and the same thing. For us  these concepts are incompatible. Our task today is to hold on  to Russia's advanced positions in scientific and technical  development, and tomorrow to expand them.    Russia's defense capability can on no account be allowed to  be weakened. Secrets of state importance concentrated in this  sphere cannot be allowed to go abroad.    This task cannot be resolved without selfless activity by  the  FCS.    At the same time counterintelligence must not hamper the  expansion of international cooperation within the framework of  interstate agreements and existing legislation.    The iron curtain has collapsed! Not just between states but  also between people. International contacts will develop in the  ascendant. You must accumulate experience of work in conditions  of an open society and a market economy.    The further we get from total bans, the more professionally  and delicately counterintelligence must operate.    I cannot ignore the question of crime.    Smuggling has become widespread in recent years. We are  incurring tremendous losses as a result of the uncontrolled  export from the country of raw materials, semimanufactures, and  objects of art, culture, and our spiritual heritage. Financial  assets are being taken out of circulation and are settling in  foreign banks. Frequently the damage is irreparable!    Therefore the struggle against these phenomena is one of the  priorities of the FCS and its organs.    Smuggling is associated with other grave crimes --  embezzlement, bribery, currency swindles, illegal crossings of  the state border, and so on. Therefore your efforts here must  be stepped up constantly.    I am talking of exposing all the links of criminal chains,  of  tracking down international groups of smugglers and rendering  them harmless.    Close businesslike cooperation will be required between the  FCS and customs organs, the Federal Border Service, and internal  affairs organs.    Unfortunately, the criminalization of society is continuing.  Violent crimes by organized groups are acquiring forms of  criminal terrorism.    The growing corruptness of power structures and of law  enforcement and other state organs is extremely dangerous to the  state. Particularly in the sphere of the redistribution of  property.    Certain successes have been scored recently in the fight  against crime. But the results, on the whole, are  unsatisfactory. Just like the efforts of counterintelligence in  this sphere.    Organized crime is no longer limited to the sphere of  ordinary criminal activity. It persistently seeks admission to  big-time politics and access to the administration of the state  and its regions. This is your problem.    The FCS must counter such attempts with all its operational  and operational-technical potential. In collaboration with the  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the Tax Police, it must  expose criminal sources of funding for political campaigns, the  links between statesmen and politicians and the organizers of  criminal fraternities which seek to get their people into the  organs of power, and, indeed, which are primed with funds from  abroad.    All the above applies in full measure also to the problems  of  the uncontrolled proliferation of firearms and narcotics.    The task of the FCS' operational subdivisions is to take  original, decisive, and at times even bold measures to eradicate  these phenomena, which are extremely dangerous to society.    Only thus can the ongoing situation be influenced for the  better. I know that counterintelligence officers have always  been distinguished by a creative, original, and unexpected  approach to their work. This was and remains the supreme sign  of professionalism, the object of your legitimate pride.    To achieve a breakthrough in the struggle against the most  dangerous manifestations of crime is a task that is worthy of  you.    But there is also another side to the fulfillment of this  task. You and you colleagues to this day have to bear a heavy  load of responsibility for the crimes of past security organs,  which you did not commit. Above all for the mass repressions of  Stalinism.    Life changes, the state and people change, but the old  alienation is evaporating too slowly.    I think that it is precisely the active participation of the  FCS in the struggle against crime -- this paramount danger to  the ordinary citizen -- that will finally close this subject.    Achieve a breakthrough in this field, protect Russians  against crime, and, I am sure, they will thank you. The icy  wall of fear and mistrust will crumble once and for all. I am  confident that this is necessary not only to the  counterintelligence service, but to Russian society as a whole.    The FCS contains military counterintelligence subivisions.  They have special tasks -- to know the situation in the Army,  to protect it from those who want to get their hands on military  secrets and facilities.    The merits of military counterintelligence officers are  considerable, but the results of their activity must be  significantly more substantial.    A special word on the proliferation of arms from Army dumps  throughout the country. Now in Maritime Kray, now in Irkutsk,  now in other regions, fires are breaking out in munition stores.    Where are the advance warnings about violation of the  conditions of the storage of munitions?! But perhaps the fires  in the stores are no accident? And another question: From what  stores are weapons being delivered to "hot" spots?    Military counterintelligence must provide the answers.    Russia's nuclear security is an extremely important,  cardinal  problem. The proliferation of nuclear and other categories of  weapons of mass destruction within the country and beyond cannot  be allowed. This is also our international obligation.    I expect regular briefings from the counterintelligence  service on all aspects of this problem. Special attention must  be paid to anticipating and resolutely thwarting attempts to  gain unauthorized access to nuclear components. There have been  no cases of "nuclear terrorism" in Russia, and there must be  none.    The active formation of a state border is now under way in  Russia. Counterintelligence is a component of the forces and  resources needed to protect it.    It is important that we maintain good-neighhborly relations  with neighboring states. At the same time we are doing  everything necessary to increase the security level of the  borders and Russia's exclusive economic zone.    We know that the situation on the Russian border is not  peaceful at the moment. And there is vast scope for activity  for you here.    In the near future we will discuss questions of guarding our  country's borders in the Security Council. I have no doubt that  S.V. Stepashin, who is a permanent member of the council, will  report what the FCS sees as the solution to border problems.    I am well aware that tackling the complex tasks facing your  service will make special demands on the people working here.    A counterintelligence officer's work requires great  resilience, the ability to think in an innovative way and to  operate using initiative within tight time constraints, and  under a great mental and physical load.    This is why, in setting up the FCS and carrying out the  professional certification [of personnel], I demanded a careful  and attentive approach toward every staffer.    A professional counterintelligence officer, especially a  leader, is formed over many years. We cannot allow ourselves to  take an irresponsible attitude toward any of you. All cases of  superficial certification must be investigated very carefully.  Worthy, committed, and energetic staffers must be brought into  play in the work.    Will the FCS be further reformed? This question is  constantly asked by your colleagues. This is the answer: Yes,  it will. But it is not a question of any new, radical shakeup  but of changes which will take time.    There is no country in the world in which a constant  improvement of special services is not takiong place. Your  department is no exception. There is one aim -- to increase the  effectiveness of counterintelligence.    When we embarked on breaking up the KGB, for political  motives among other things, we by no means denied -- and do not  deny -- the need for fairly reliable and close coordination of  the work of the various former parts of it which have been  divided into autonomous structures, as well as of the Armed  Forces General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU]. We  are thinking about what kind of collaboration mechanism there  should be. Mainly it must obviously rely on bilateral relations  and on forming operational groups to tackle certain tasks of one  kind or another which include representatives of various special  services.    I have carefully considered the results of the meeting of  your collegium together with the FIS directorate [direktorat]  and have concluded that in this respect you are on the right  road.    In this auditorium I cannot fail to talk about the specific  characteristics of local FCS organs.    We take as our basis the principle that there cannot be a  "Nizhniy Novgorod" or a "Maritime Kray" counterintelligence  service. We have one counterintelligence service -- Russian  counterintelligence, organized in a strict hierarchy,  independent of local authorities. Under the constitution it is  subordinate to the Russian president.    This status does not preclude but presupposes close  cooperation and mutual assistance between FCS subdivisions and  the executive organs of republics, krays, and oblasts.    Let me stress that priorities have been set. No distortions  in ensuring regional security to the detriment of federal  security are permissible. Otherwise both people unaware of what  state security is and the FCS director will be held responsible.    Very serious attention must be devoted to questions  regarding  the training of a new generation of counterintelligence officers.    Today a counterintelligence potential is being developed  which will give a return in five to 10 years. Programs for  training and retraining personnel must be carefully reviewed.  Prompt changes must be made in them in the light of the  development of the legal and normative base and the  clarification of priorities for the FCS' activity. You have  everything necessary for this.    I will also say a few words about the role of leaders. The  indispensable requirements with regard to them are a high degree  of professionalism, competency, responsibility, loyalty to the  motherland, honesty and integrity, and the ability to make the  collective follow their lead. Putting it in military terms, a  leader must be prepared to give the command "Do as I do," and  carry it out better than his subordinates.    These are the kind of leaders and operatives we will support  and create the necessary conditions for. But above all we will  demand fruitful work.    In talking about FCS personnel I cannot bypass the problem  of  their probity and incorruptibility. Everything must be done to  ensure that the best traditions here are not only maintained but  also strengthened. As regards this question the position of all  leaders and personnel apparatuses must be a principled one.    It has been reported to me that there are differences in the  level of social protection for staffers of various special  services and law-enforcement organs. And not in favor of FCS  staffers.    I will say frankly that I am against "leveling." But if it  is a question of substantial distortions in the wages of  different departments, we will rectify it.    Your calling and your professional duty is to ensure the  security of the individual, society, and the state. The main  conditions for this are well known to all: Civil peace in  Russia must be maintained and strengthened, revolutionary  upheavals must be prevented, and the profound economic crisis  must be overcome.    We will be able to achieve this by consolidating our Russian  state in action. The Russian Federal Counterintelligence  Service is one of its important, inalienable institutions. Your  service must be strong and have a flexible structure. Its  extensive possibilities must be effectively used in the defense  of Russians both in the country and abroad, in the defense of  Russian interests against the aspirations of foreign  intelligence services and other criminal encroachments.    Therefore I firmly recommend -- get rid of achronisms.  Therefore I demand: Act energetically, boldly, and  decisively.    I sincerely wish you success in your work, which is  difficult  and dangerous, but vitally necessary to Russia.</p>

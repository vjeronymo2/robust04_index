			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistani government plans to increase sugar duty THE PAKISTANI government is considering an increase in import duty on sugar, in the country's annual budget to be announced next week, as a measure to boost the domestic sugar market. However, the new rate of duty has still not been decided. A senior government official said yesterday that the measure was a way to cut down on sugar imports at a time when a rise in domestic sugar production had already created a surplus. The country's sugar mills have produced at least 2.3m tonnes since October last year, while another 50,000 tonnes are expected to be produced this month. Surplus sugar stocks depress prices in the local market and therefore create economic difficulties for sugar mill owners and sugar-cane farmers, officials and traders say. Although wheat, cotton and rice account for about 70 per cent of the country's annual crop output, sugar-cane is right behind them as one of the more important crops of the remaining 30 per cent. The government has also been trying to promote sugar trading in the private sector as a way to reduce the public sector's participation in commodity trading. Pakistan's imports of sugar during the past 9 months have largely been secured through operators in the private sector, officials say.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Bank push to improve China environment The World Bank plans greater emphasis on environmental projects and education and less on infrastructure, in its lending to China, its largest borrower, Mr Ernest Stern, managing director, said in Beijing yesterday. The bank would seek to encourage increased private involvement in power generation and other infrastructure projects. Mr Stern told an international business seminar. This would involve more co-financing arrangements. 'Private involvement in infrastructure can bring additional benefits that go beyond finance, including management expertise and new technology. In the globalised economy, those benefits are of increasing importance.' About 40 per cent of the World Bank's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 7.6bn) lending programme in China has been earmarked for infrastructure. Lending to China is now running at about Dollars 3bn annually. Mr Stern said the bank's first big co-financing operation in China for a large power project in Jiangsu province, west of Shanghai, could serve as a model for other such ventures. The Bank provided a Dollars 350m loan and guarantees for a Dollars 120m syndicated loan facility denominated in eurodollars and yen. But he warned that much greater attention to the costs of environmental degradation was required not only in China but throughout East Asia. 'Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in East Asia are three times those of Latin America,' he said. 'China alone accounts for almost half of total carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries.' Air pollution in some Chinese cities was 'chronically bad', less than a third of wastewater was subject to treatment, and an estimated 7m hectares of farmland had been degraded by excessive use of pesticides and fertilisers, he noted. World Bank concern about the impact of China's rapid economic growth on the environment was reflected in the fact that environmental operations were the fastest-growing element of the bank's lending programme. Recent loans included Dollars 150m to improve Shanghai's environment and water supply, and Dollars 250m to support pollution control and waste management in Jiangsu Province.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, 5 June (YONHAP) -- China is expected not  to exercise the veto when the U.N. Security Council resolves to  impose sanctions on North Korea for its suspected nuclear  safeguards violations, a ranking South Korean official  accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his tour of Uzbekistan  said Sunday.    South Korea and related countries stand firmly for effective  international sanctions against North Korea, he said, adding  negotiations on the sanctions are under way among permanent U.N.  Security Council member countries and related nations.    But full-dress negotiations on a draft U.N. Security Council  resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue will start after  President Kim returns to Seoul Tuesday, he said.    Senior presidential foreign affairs and security aide Chong  Chong-uk said the government is maintaining close contact with  the U.S. Government, while consulting with friendly nations  about a number of measures to cope with the tension over North  Korea's nuclear standoff.    The situation now is not worsening and there is no special  development of the situation on the Korean peninsula, he added.    President Kim, receiving reports on the movements in Seoul  and the United Nations in relation to the North Korean nuclear  issue from Chong before his departure for Samarkand, told him to  stay in Tashkent and have a thorough grasp of developments of  the nuclear issue. Chong was to accompany Kim on his visit to  the old Uzbek capital city.    While in Moscow and Tashkent, Kim was briefed by his aides  on  what was discussed in the Unification and Security Policy  Coordination Council in Seoul and nuclear ambassador Kim  Sam-hon's activities in Washington, Chong said.</p>

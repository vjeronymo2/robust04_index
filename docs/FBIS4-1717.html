			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stability Is a Condition for Speeding Up </F> Reform and Development"]    [Text] In the course of establishing our socialist market  economy system, there always exists the problem of correctly  understanding and handling well the relationship among reform,  development, and stability. Development is an aim, reform a  motive force, and stability a condition; none of them is  dispensable.    Our country now has entered a new historical period of  development. The entire party and people throughout the country  are implementing the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, and are struggling hard for the  establishment of the socialist market economy system. The whole  country is experiencing political stability, economic  development, nationality solidarity, and social progress. Just  like various parts in the whole country, the situation in Hunan  is also gratifying. However, we must realize soberly that  factors of instability still exist in society. Internationally  speaking, peace and development are the main theme and trend of  the contemporary world, and this is beneficial to us. However,  owing to the fact that the imperialists have not given up their  designs for the subjugation of our country, and that they hate  to see the rise of powerful China, they always have treated  economic invasion, cultural infiltration, and political  subversion as fixed policies against our country. They have  tried to compel us to submit. A handful of hostile elements at  home and a tiny number of sabotaging elements within society  coordinate with reactionary forces abroad in an attempt to  create trouble. In society, local ruffians, despots, and  criminal elements are swollen with arrogance. Various kinds of  criminal activities are rampant, and the number of gang crimes  has increased. In some areas, the ugly phenomena of  prostitution and the patronizing of prostitutes cannot be  eliminated, despite repeated bans. Drug taking and drug  trafficking also are spreading. As far as potential trouble is  concerned, at present state-owned enterprises are suffering from  severe losses, and the number of enterprises in a state of  suspended or partially suspended production is rising, while the  prices of goods are increasing by a fairly large margin. Some  workers and staff members are encountering difficulties in their  daily lives. Last year, our province suffered from the severe  calamities of floods and waterlogging. In spite of the fact  that various localities have taken active measures, and have  done a solid job in providing disaster relief, and that the  situation in those affected areas is good as a whole, many  people there still have difficulties in their livelihood. In  addition, we also face the historical problems of migration in  the reservoir area, and of making proper arrangements for the  placement of demobilized servicemen. If we fail to solve these  problems well, they too might become factors for instability.  For this reason, we must on no account treat them lightly. On  the contrary, we must be prepared for danger in times of peace,  and must attach importance to these factors of instability. In  the meantime, we must take powerful measures to eliminate these  factors so as to ensure the smooth progress of reform and  development.    Some comrades ask: Since our present central task is to  grasp reform and develop the economy, how can we spend time and  effort on reform? This kind of understanding is incorrect.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has stressed repeatedly that the  overriding issue in China is to maintain stability. It is, of  course, correct to grasp reform and development wholeheartedly.  Leaders at all levels must concentrate their efforts on reform,  and must grasp economic construction. However, this does not  mean that it is unnecessary for us to grasp stability.  Stability, reform and development complement each other. Only  by seizing on the fine opportunity, deepening reform, and  speeding up development can we consolidate the political  situation of stability and unity. Only by safeguarding social  stability can we guarantee the smooth progress of reform and  development. It is a completely wrong view to set stability  against reform and development.    The feelings of the masses are the key to social and  political stability. This is what we call "popular feelings,"  or "people's will." At present, the problem of public order is  a factor that affects the feelings of the masses. With regard  to the problem of public order, public security departments, of  course, must grasp it. CPC Committees and governments at all  levels, and the number-one men of the party and government in  particular, must treat the work of stabilizing public order as  their own responsibility. If a place is always in a mess, if  something happens here today and there tomorrow, if the masses  are devoid of a sense of security, and if foreign businessmen do  not dare to come, can the economy of the place develop? Can the  reform there be deepened? If the secretary and county  magistrate of the place are always busy dealing with these  issues, can they concentrate their energy on economic  construction, reform, and opening up? Therefore, it is  imperative to grasp public order well, and to maintain social  stability. Ensuring safety in each place should be regarded as a  target for the term of office of our party and government  leading cadres. This target should be linked directly with the  assessment of their achievements in work, and their promotions  and awards. Leaders at all levels must adopt forceful measures  to grasp public order well, and to remove various kinds of  instability factors and hidden dangers. They must make greater  efforts to severely and strictly crack down on criminal,  economic, and other offenders in accordance with the law. On no  account should they be soft on them.    This year, nine major reform measures are to be promulgated  in our province. They are unprecedented in terms of scope,  depth, dynamics, and degree of difficulty. They definitely will  touch on people's ideological concepts, and on the vital  interests of the masses and cadres as well. Those who have a  lower tolerance may be disgruntled in this way or that. This  requires us to do the work of getting their thinking  straightened out. For example, while carrying out housing  reform, a number of people may have no money to buy their own  houses for a period of time; they will complain about this.  With regard to the reform of the medical system, some people  who see doctors frequently must pay part of the medical  expenses. Those cadres and masses who currently enjoy free  medical care may feel more inconvenienced now than the past.  They will have complaints about this. With regard to the  masses who were affected by fairly serious natural disasters  last year, and have encountered difficulties in their life, they  will be disgruntled if we fail to help them solve these  difficulties promptly. In particular, the problem of commodity  prices can directly affect the "food baskets" and "grain bags"  of the masses. Currently this is a hot topic for conversation  among the masses. In addition, public transport is also a  problem that can affect the feelings of the masses. If we fail  to take expeditious and decisive measures to curb price hikes  and straighten out transport order, stability and unity will be  affected. If we do our work well in this regard, it will play a  very great role in maintaining stability. If we fail to handle  this matter well, it will encourage the growth of those factors  of instability. Therefore, leaders at all levels not only must  set their sights on the development of reform, but also must pay  attention to and make efforts to grasp social stability. They  must go deep among the masses, listen to their voice, and  understand their demands. They must be truly concerned about  the weal and woe of the people, and must promptly help them  solve difficulties arising in production, work, study, and  livelihood. If their difficulties cannot be solved for a period  of time, it is necessary to explain this to them. The masses  are reasonable; as long as we keep them in our hearts, always  think of them, and do our work for them in their households so  that it strikes a chord in their hearts, the broad masses of  people will conscientiously safeguard stability and unity. If  the people's minds are at rest, and they unite as one to advance  courageously, stability and unity can be ensured. There is no  doubt that it will be beneficial to speeding up reform and  accelerating development.    Today's situation of stability has not come about easily.  All of society must conscientiously value and safeguard it.  People's organizations and various circles in society must give  play to their own strong points so as to help the party and  government do mass work well, and make contributions to  maintaining stability. As long as several hundreds of thousands  of cadres, tens of thousands of party members, and millions upon  millions of the masses can conscientiously safeguard stability  and unity, social stability definitely can be consolidated day  by day, and there will be fine conditions for reform and  development. In this way, we can concentrate our efforts on  promoting the economy, make a new leap forward, and advance to a  new height by the end of this century.</p>

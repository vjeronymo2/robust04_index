			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Malange Province is experiencing a serious  political, military, social, and economic situation. Famine and  insecurity are making the lives of people hell and they are  trying to leave the city of Malange at all costs. Malange  Provincial Governor Flavio Fernandes has described the situation  in the following manner:    [Begin recording] [Fernandes] The political and military  situation continues to be very serious in this province. The  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has  increased its operations against the people. It has been mining  paths which access farming areas and it has been abducting and  ambushing people. Furthermore, UNITA has also carried out  several raids on strategic parts of the city to destroy  infrastructure. We can say that we have practically not had a  single day without fighting. To us, therefore, the situation  continues to be very serious and we are doing everything in our  power to change it.    [Unidentified reporter] Could you comment on social  conditions here?    [Fernandes] Well, the people continue to experience a very  serious situation. We are going through a time of serious  famine. You, the correspondents, who have taken the care to  visit the distribution centers, know we are experiencing high  levels of serious malnutrition, running at about 34.5 percent.  [sentence as heard] These days, and in our modern world, such  figures are inadmissible.    [Reporter] Are there any plans to turn the problem around  and  ensure that people do not have to survive on aid grants?    [Fernandes] Yes. In addition to the work that we are doing  with nongovernmental organizations and the international  community, we are working with UNICEF and plans were recently  approved concerning an estimated $2 million in aid for children.  We are also preparing our proposals, which will obviously be  included in the government's plan of action.    [Reporter] While that does not happen, though, people will  have to continue living on humanitarian aid?    [Fernandes] Unfortunately, that is the case. I must tell you  frankly that we have had very little support from the central  government so far. Basically, we are surviving on international  aid. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIT TO GUIDE?  </P> <P> The film critics of The Times have picked the best films of the '80s ("Films of  the '80s -- Critics Recall the Best," Dec. 24). Sheila Benson says that this  "was one of the sorriest decades in the annals of film."  </P> <P> I too would yet consider this a sorry decade if I believed that the films cited  by the Times' critics were indeed the best. Look at the choices!  </P> <P> Peter Rainer, Kevin Thomas and Michael Wilmington chose 19 foreign films among  their 30 choices. They include such films as "The Makioka Sisters,"  "Himatsuri," "The Legend of Surami Fortress" and "Heimat."  </P> <P> It is not surprising that in the lists of Benson, Rainer, Thomas and Wilmington  only one of the 10 top-grossing films of the decade ("E.T.") receives any  mention.  </P> <P> One no longer expects that film critics will share the preferences of the  filmgoing public for whom reviews are written. But even such commercial and  critical successes as "Rain Man," "Amadeus," "Chariots of Fire" and "Platoon"  receive no mention at all on the Times' critics lists.  </P> <P> Some unquestionably good films ("E.T.," "Hannah and Her Sisters," "Raging  Bull") do make the lists, but the most-mentioned film of all is "Blue Velvet,"  a film Benson calls "a stylized vision of the rot below."  </P> <P> How can readers of The Times who are looking for guidance on what films to see  rely on the judgment of a group of critics whose taste in films range from the  totally obscure ("Heimat") to the utterly strange ("Blue Velvet")?  </P> <P> CRAIG LANCASTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: It's all in the voice - Radio LAST WEEK, Radio 3's play alternated the 15th century and the 20th. This week's, Adam Thorpe's Offa's Daughter, is set in the 9th, though Offa, King of Mercia, lives in the 8th, from AD 757 to 796. But it is his daughter Eadburgh we deal with, following her from youth to age. She married, and murdered, Offa's dependent, the King of Wessex, lacing his goblet with powdered glass - not intending it for him but for his vassal Felix. When we meet her in old-age, she is taken for a beggar, her robes and finery all gone but for a gold ring bearing Offa's likeness. At Pavia, in Lombardy, she encounters Brother Edward, whom she had known in Mercia, in charge of a scroll to be carried back there. This actually happens at the start of the play; the rest of the tale is told to Edward to win his sympathy. Only one thing matters to her now, to get her faithful servant Theya, into comfort and clean linen, as she promised when they were young. So once again we have these time-shifts, with characters spliced at different ages. Director Jeremy Mortimer has a useful company: Eadburgh, who is Sian Phillips at Pavia, is Tara Fitzgerald in her flighty period, an effective amalgam. Mature Edward is Richard Johnson; Linus Roache his younger counterpart; Melanie Hudson the servant Theya, who clearly models herself on her mistress. I have to confess that I do not much like time-split plays. As listeners wrote to Christopher Dunkley's Feedback last week, the association of voice with character is one of radio's principal requisites, and it is a great help if the character remains constant. Ronald Harwood's The Dresser (Radio 4, Monday) provided a total contrast. It presents, from offstage, a performance of King Lear, in a provincial theatre in wartime, played by a touring company under an ageing actor known only as 'Sir'. There is never any doubt about what is going on or who is speaking. The action is mostly in Sir's dressing-room; as Sir is played by Freddie Jones (who gave it in the West End in 1980) and his eponymous dresser is Michael Palin, in his first venture into radio drama, the clarity is ideal. Adaptation and direction are both by David Blount. It is not a great play, but very enjoyable, and certainly authentic, for the author was dresser to Sir Donald Wolfit (who, he insists, was not the model for Sir). Sir has collapsed on the day of his Lear, and the action covers the efforts of Norman, his dresser, to restore him to form and see him through the play whenever there are troubles. Sundry incidents involving Sir's wife and the theatre company are all resolved by Norman's inventive loyalty. Yet Sir dies in his dressing-room after the play, and Norman shows a touching mixture of affection and resentment at the old actor's ingratitude for long service. What with a new biography and a memorial tablet in Poets' Corner, Anthony Trollope is still with us. Last week Radio 4 began six Wednesday talks by Richard Mullen, not biography but study of Trollope's reactions to various facets of his time. The first was about marriage, in which he was involved fairly early, and this week's dealt with Ireland, where he lived for many years. Extra liveliness was added by Paul Rogers's playing as Trollope. Worth following.</p>

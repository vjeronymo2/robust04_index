			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / BJP politician shot dead in Bombay Bombay police yesterday increased security for the city's politicians, following the shooting of Mr Ramdas Nayak, local president of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party and a strong critic of political corruption. Mr Nayak, who was 53, was shot yesterday morning by two men on motorcycles armed with automatic rifles who pumped 54 bullets into his car near his home in central Bombay. Mr Nayak's police bodyguard was also killed. Police believe Mr Nayak may have been killed by enemies in the criminal underworld. His death follows a string of incidents in the past 18 months which have highlighted connections between politicians and criminals in Bombay. First, the investigation into the terrorist bombings last March in which more than 250 people died, revealed ties between some of the suspects and city politicians. Next, in May this year, Mr Suneet Khatau, a wealthy textile mill-owner with political influence, was shot in his Mercedes car, allegedly because of a property dispute. In July, Mr G R Khairnar, a senior civil servant at Bombay Municipal Corporation, was suspended after he accused city politicians of corruption. Mr Khairnar's suspension caused widespread public protests and boosted a popular anti-corruption campaign. This week, Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which has its capital in Bombay, and a former defence minister, was alleged in court to have ties with the criminal underworld. Mr Ulhas Joshi, a police deputy inspector-general, claimed in a sworn affidavit that Mr Pawar had links with two named associates of Mr Dawood Ibrahim, an underworld boss wanted for questioning by police investigating last year's bomb blasts. Mr Joshi is in court fighting an anti-corruption investigation against him which he alleges was launched unfairly at the behest of Mr Pawar. Mr Pawar yesterday dismissed Mr Joshi's claims as untrue. Mr Nayak's killing was condemned by Mr L K Advani, the BJP's national president.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Banco Popular advances to trail-blazing Pta49bn BANCO POPULAR, the smallest of Spain's national commercial banks, yesterday reported net profits of Pta49.7bn (Dollars 494m) for last year, a 15 per cent rise on 1990 and what will probably prove to be one of the best bank performances of 1991. Popular, which is regularly rated as the world's most profitable bank and has just been chosen by Euromoney magazine as the world's best managed, improved its return on average assets last year to 2.01 per cent from 1.87 per cent in 1990. The bank reported a 17 per cent increase in fee income, reflecting a general move among big Spanish banks away from their traditional retail strongholds. Despite a near doubling of bad debt provisions, to Pta18.2bn, the bank improved cash flow by 7.7 per cent to Pta112.2bn. Spain's Banco Central Hispanoamericano has reached a deal with Catalan bank La Caixa to sell its majority stake in property group Inmobiliaria Colonial, according to the Spanish stock market commission. BCH controls 63.8 per cent of Colonial.</p>

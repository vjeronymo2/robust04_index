			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article for PRENSA LATINA by Javier Rodriquez: </F> "Cuba: The Permanence of a Conference"]    [Text] "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference recently  held in Havana united officials, intellectuals, and analysts  with more than 200 Cuban emigrants, and achieved its greatest  accomplishment in a common determination: the consensus on the  need to maintain contacts until their relations are totally  normal.    Trapped in the web of the Cuban-U.S. dispute, used by  several  U.S. Administrations in their campaigns against the island, the  emigrants witnessed in the past decades how their relations with  their country of origin have became tangled and have felt an  isolation that goes beyond the family circle.    The conference, convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, also  had the virtue of revealing the existence of groups of nationals  who are located in dozens of countries on several continents,  even though, due to its geographic proximity and that it is a  historic path, emigrants have always headed for the United  States as their first choice.    The people present at the conference held a wide range of  political and ideological positions. They, however, concurred  in rejecting Washington's economic and commercial blockade of  Cuba.    The main topic of the previously agreed agenda was  emigration  regulations. The level of information, however, offered to the  participants with regard to the country's economic,  institutional, and cultural situation amply exceeded rigid  models or undesired exclusions.    Four special interventions introduced very important  explanations of further bilateral relations and also served to  specify the level of participation the emigrants can have in the  life and daily business of their own country.    Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the  People's Government (parliament,) exhaustively explained, not  only the operation of that government body, but also the truly  participative nature of Cuba's current democratic system.    As an example, Alarcon described the people's recent debates  on measures to reorganize the country's finances. He rejected  the adoption of multiparty politics due to its divisive nature  and the damage it could cause to the unity of the population in  such difficult times.    Of great interest to all, according to what was said by  several of the guests, was the panorama of Cuban cultural life  portrayed by Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and  Artists (UNEAC). Prieto called for maintaining Cuban culture as  the central theme in every work, whether it belongs to an  emigrant or not.    Vice President Carlos Lage examined the situation of the  Cuban economy and said the efforts being made by the entire  population, which can also include those who live abroad, will  give Cuba the possibility of surmounting the crisis triggered by  the U.S. blockade and the disappearance of the eastern European  socialist bloc.    It fell on Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to announce the  package of measures dictated by the government in its wish to  contribute decisively to the normalization of ties with the  emigrants, which is desired by all.    Truthfully, the measures corresponded, in some cases, to  requests that had already been made by the guests. Robaina's  announcement was received enthusiastically by the plenary.    The creation of a special department in the Foreign Ministry  to handle emigration affairs, the authorization to allow  emigrants' children to enroll in Cuban universities, and the  elimination of the clause that sets five years as the minimum  period between visits to Cuba by those who reside abroad were  some of the measures. Also, the revocation of the requirement  that those who come to visit relatives pay for a hotel room, the  possibility of investing in sectors that have been earmarked as  a priority by the Cuban Government, and the printing of a  publication addressed to the emigrants abroad, completed the  announcement. The main breakthrough, however, came just a few  hours after President Fidel Castro received the conference  participants at the Palace of the Revolution.    The participants met directly with parliamentarians to study  the draft citizenship bill, with youth and women leaders, and  later with the UNEAC board to study other levels of future  participation. Those were the first steps in consolidating the  endeavor that started with the conference.    The positive climate, which was witnessed by more than 150  domestic and foreign journalists, was present in the opinions  expressed by many of the participants in the conference,  including those who, possessing a political position different  to that of the Cuban Government, sought to contribute to the  common effort.    Several analysts and media representatives have pointed out  that confronted with such a reality, the attacks of the ultra  conservative groups living in the United States turned out to be  totally futile.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Recession trims Williams to Pounds 72m WILLIAMS HOLDINGS, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday signalled its intention to fund future acquisitions from borrowings as it unveiled a 6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the six months ended June 30. The pre-tax figure fell from Pounds 76.5m to Pounds 72m on increased sales of Pounds 493.8m (Pounds 470.6m). Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic continued to be affected by the recession. Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, said realisation that the group could not pay for future acquisitions by issuing shares had led to a change of policy on debt. The group has therefore established long-term borrowing facilities of Dollars 370m (Pounds 185m), repayable in ten years, to help fund future acquisitions. Borrowings at the year-end were expected to be between Pounds 120m and Pounds 140m, representing gearing of under 40 per cent. In the short-term the group would have net cash of about Pounds 30m. Mr McGowan said the group had learnt from its failed hostile bid for Racal Electronics last year - launched as an all-share offer - that paper offers were unlikely to succeed when financial markets were depressed. He said: 'Perhaps we will never do any contested bids because we are not prepared to over pay. However, we are exploring a series of possibilities. More companies are under pressure to sell and their prices are more realistic.' Engineering suffered the biggest setback. Trading profits dived from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 4.3m because of a fall in orders for military bridges in the Far East. Trading profits of the fire and safety international division fell to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 22.2m) as de-stocking in the aviation industry resulted in a sharp decline in the purchase of spares. Yale and Valor, the security products company acquired last year, continued to boost profits. The locks businesses helped the European consumer and building products side increase trading profits from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 32.2m. The North American consumer and building products activities benefited from the integration of Yale and NuTone which saw its trading profits climb from Pounds 15m to Pounds 22.6m. An extraordinary item of Pounds 6m related to the sale of the group's investment of just under 10 per cent in Racal after taking into account the loss associated with the sale of Spencer Clark Metal Industries. Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 10.9p to 9p. The interim dividend is held at 5p. See Lex</p>

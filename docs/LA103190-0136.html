			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-TEACHER GETS PROBATION IN ABUSE OF 5  STUDENTS  </P> <P> A former special education teacher convicted of verbally and physically abusing  five seriously handicapped students at a San Pedro school was sentenced this  week to two years' probation and ordered to undergo counseling.  </P> <P> San Pedro Municipal Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz also ordered Juanita  Barnett, 59, to perform 200 hours of community service and barred her from  working with children under age 13.  </P> <P> Barnett was convicted in August on five counts of willful cruelty toward a  child. A jury found that she had threatened children in her class at Willenberg  Special Education Center and struck them with her hands, a hairbrush and a  jigsaw puzzle, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Juana Webman.  </P> <P> Smaltz said overwhelming support from the community and Barnett's 26-year  record of service made her conclude that the abuse was aberrant behavior by a  "a lady who cares very much about children."  </P></p>

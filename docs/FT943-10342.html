			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Kidder Peabody investigation blames Jett for false profits Kidder Peabody yesterday tried again to put an end to the bond trading scandal which has dogged it since April by publishing an investigation it commissioned into the affair. The report pins the blame on Mr Joseph Jett, the government bond trader who Kidder has claimed created Dollars 350m (Pounds 226m) of fictitious profits in its government bond trading business in order to boost his own performance bonus. It adds that 'lax oversight, as well as poor judgments and missed opportunities' on the part of Kidder executives meant that Mr Jett's false profits were not identified for more than two years. Mr Jett's lawyer, Mr Kenneth Warner, called the report 'predictably one-sided and incomplete', and said his client would be vindicated 'when a truly independent investigation is completed'. Mr Jett's sacking in April prompted widespread concern on Wall Street about Kidder's financial health, and led General Electric, its parent, to issue a series of statements of support for the firm. The fall-out led eventually to the departure of Mr Michael Carpenter, Kidder's chief executive. Mr Edward Cerullo, head of Kidder's fixed income division, also left in recent weeks. According to yesterday's report, Mr Cerullo's supervision of Mr Jett was 'seriously deficient', though it adds: 'It is clear that he and Jett were not co-conspirators.' Kidder said yesterday it had also sacked Mr Melvin Mullin, who was directly responsible for supervising Mr Jett until February 1993. The investigation was carried out by Mr Gary Lynch, who as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division in the 1980s pursued Mr Michael Milken and Mr Ivan Boesky, both of whom were later convicted. Mr Jett has claimed that the disputed trades were carried out at the request of his superiors, and were intended to put a gloss on Kidder's financial position by removing securities from its balance sheet. His trades are understood to have been the subject of investigation by a number of authorities since April, though no charges have been brought.</p>

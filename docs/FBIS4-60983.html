			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Gordiyenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A special commission  has started an investigation into yesterday's incident at  airport at Khorog (the administrative center of Gorno-Badakhshan  autonomous oblast), in which armed opposition fighters seized a  military aircraft from Uzbekistan. The ITAR-TASS correspondent  was told today over the telephone by informed sources in  Tajikistan's Government circles that because of conflicting  reports from Khorog it is impossible to confirm or refute the  definition of the incident as a "seizure" of the cargo delivered  by the AN-26 aircraft from Uzbekistan to Khorog pending  completion of the commission's work.    Meanwhile, as was reported earlier, Uzbekistan's Defense  Ministry confirmed yesterday that the cargo described as  "humanitarian aid" had indeed been prepared for delivery to  Gorno-Badakhshan. But for unknown reasons the relevant bodies  in Tajikistan were not informed beforehand about the time when  the state border would be crossed. The aircraft landed at 1500  local time at the Khorog airport. After the landing the runway  and the approaches to the airport were cordoned off by fighters  from a detachment of "Tajik Self-Defense Forces." The cargo on  board was taken away. In view of this, military sources in  Dushanbe do not rule out the possibility that contacts have been  established between certain forces in Uzbekistan and fighters in  the Pamir mountains, and that these contacts have some bearing  on the situation in the region.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Up, up and away The number of scheduled airlines continues to increase in spite of predictions of another big collective financial loss for the industry for 1993. Worldwide, 110 scheduled airlines started services last year, while another 84 closed shop, either through failures, withdrawals from scheduled flights or mergers. According to a year-end survey by ABC World Airways Guide the net gain of 26 last year was 50 per cent more than in 1992. Among airlines starting scheduled services in 1993 were the Bahamas-based Laker Airways, Air 2000 and British World Airlines, two UK carriers which to date had been exclusively charter, and nine new entrants in CIS states. Famous names to disappear from the scheduled market include UTA (merged with Air France), Denmark's Sterling Airways, Nationair of Canada and MGM Grand Air in the US.</p>

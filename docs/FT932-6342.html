			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Howard Clark back at Lehman Brothers WALL Street investment bank Lehman Brothers announced yesterday that Mr Howard Clark Jr, its former chairman, would return to the company as vice-chairman. He will be given special responsibility for handling and developing corporate client relationships worldwide. Mr Clark, 49, ran Shearson Lehman Brothers between 1990 and 1993, but was ousted in February when Mr James Robinson, head of the firm's parent, American Express, replaced him as chairman. Soon after, however, Mr Robinson was forced out at American Express, and the firm's Shearson retail brokerage and asset management operation was sold to Primerica for more than Dollars 1bn. Mr Clark's appointment came as something of a surprise to industry observers, who had expected the former Shearson head to join one of the several big Wall Street investment banking firms which had approached him after his departure from Shearson in March. Although Mr Clark was an experienced investment banker, Shearson struggled during his tenure as chairman, making meagre profits or large losses at a time when the securities industry was recoverying from the lean years of the late 1980s.</p>

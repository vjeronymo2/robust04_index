			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TUNA FISHERMEN FEAR DECISION MAY BE FINAL BLOW  </P> <P> The American tuna fishing industry, which has made a home here since World War  II, has absorbed its share of shocks.  </P> <P> Foreign governments have seized boats. Foreign fleets have slashed prices on  tuna, aggressively selling their catch into the U.S. market. One U.S. cannery  after another was shuttered.  </P> <P> Still, the American fleet survived, if at times just barely.  </P> <P> But the most devastating blow of all may have come Thursday, boat owners and  industry officials say, when when the three largest U.S. tuna canners announced  they would no longer buy or sell tuna caught using methods that kill or injure  dolphins.  </P> <P> Marietta Zolezzi, whose husband Julius owns and operates four tuna boats based  in San Diego, called the canners' action "devastating and tragic. We've been  fighting this for 20 years."  </P> <P> Tuna boat owner Leo Correia said he did not know if he could remain in  business. "The damage is all done . . . I don't know what I'm going to do."  </P> <P> "This could be the last nail on the American tuna boats," said Peter Schmidt,  president of Marco Seattle, whose Campbell Industries subsidiary in San Diego  is one of the world's leading builders of the boats that use massive nets, or  seines, to catch tuna.  </P> <P> The 40 giant boats called purse seiners that are based here catch the bulk of  their tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific where, for reasons that remain a  mystery to marine scientists, large schools of tuna are accompanied by schools  of dolphins. To envelop the tuna in the huge umbrella-shaped purse seine nets,  the boats invariably snare and drown dolphins.  </P> <P> The number of dolphins killed by U.S tuna boats, which catch about 15% of the  world tuna supply, has declined from 108,000 in 1976 to 12,643 last year,  largely because of the presence of National Marine Fishery Service observers on  each voyage. That's significantly below the government's maximum quota of  20,500 dolphins that can legally be killed annually by U.S. tuna fishermen.  Implicit in the quota, fishermen say, is an admission by the government that  some dolphin deaths are inevitable in purse seining.  </P> <P> Despite the improvement, the level of kills is still too high to satisfy  environmentalists, whose years of pressure finally caused tuna canners to  switch their policy.  </P> <P> The U.S. tuna fleet now views the alternatives to traditional fishing  techniques and patterns as unappealing.  </P> <P> American boats can try to fish in other regions such as the Indian Ocean or  Western Pacific Ocean where the dolphin phenomenon does not exist. But those  regions are the scenes of intense competition among Asian, French and Spanish  boats. Many of the boats in the American fleet are too small to make that great  a voyage anyway.  </P> <P> The fleet could go after schools of smaller fish in the Eastern Pacific which  do not attract dolphins, but tuna industry officials say catching "juvenile"  tuna would be both inefficient and harmful to tuna preservation.  </P> <P> Going after smaller fish also would require the boats to get closer to foreign  shores, raising the risk of seizure by foreign governments who enforce 200-mile  territorial limits, said August Felando, president of the American Tunaboat  Association, a San Diego-based trade group that includes 40 locally based tuna  boat owners.  </P> <P> Felando ruled out as impractical a large-scale switch to other methods of tuna  fishing such as pole-and-bait and long-line fishing, both of which require far  more workers. The pole-and-bait technique involves using lures to catch tuna in  feeding frenzies and long line fishing is the use of one huge line with  hundreds of baited hooks.  </P> <P> Over the past 35 years, the tuna industry's technology and capital investment  have revolved around the giant purse seiner boats, Felando said, which can  measure up to 220 feet in length, weigh 1,500 tons or more and cost $10 million  each. There are about 380 of the ships operating in the world, of which 65 are  registered in the United States.  </P> <P> Industry officials were skeptical that the U.S. canners' policy switch would  significantly reduce the killing of dolphins. Foreign tuna seiners would  continue to fish in the Eastern Pacific but without the supervision of National  Marine Fishery Service observers.  </P> <P> Schmidt foresees the possibility that foreigners' catch could be shipped to  U.S. canneries via freezer cargo ships, in which tuna from various fishing  grounds are mixed together, including tuna caught beneath dolphins. In such  cases, government inspectors would have a hard time determining if tuna was in  fact dolphin-safe.  </P> <P> Up to now, U.S. tuna fishers have proven a hardy lot, adjusting to a series of  setbacks over which they have had little control. But the number of tuna  seiners based here has steadily decreased from the peak of 130 vessels in 1976  that caught a total of 300,000 tons of tuna to the current 40 boats that last  year caught 275,000 tons, Felando said.  </P> <P> The purse seining method was developed by San Diego fishermen in the 1950s as a  reaction to what Felando described as the "dumping" of low-cost tuna onto the  U.S. market by Japanese fishermen in an attempt to drive the U.S. fleet from  the seas. The huge purse seiners not only dramatically increased the size of  each boat's catch, but the fishing technique relieved boat operators from the  time and expense of catching and maintaining live-bait fish on board.  </P> <P> The highly productive Eastern Pacific fishing ground, a triangular area that  stretches from San Diego to Chile to Hawaii, increasingly has been fished by  tuna boat association members in preference to areas closer to shore partially  in response to foreign seizures of U.S. tuna boats. Most of the seizures took  place after the boats intruded in what the governments held were territorial  waters.  </P> <P> The local boat owners have also been affected by the closure of nearly all  canneries located on the U.S. mainland. The last of the six canneries once  located in San Diego closed down in 1984 and local boat owners must now unload  their fish at cannery plants in American Samoa and Puerto Rico.  </P></p>

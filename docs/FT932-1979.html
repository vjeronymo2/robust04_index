			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (1): Calmer but not yet prospering - The worst may be over in the crisis which has swept over the region's financial institutions in the past two years. But it will be at least another two years before the banks recover from the loan losses that plague them THE fearsome storm in the Nordic financial system, which crashed over Norway at the turn of the decade and went on to engulf Sweden and Finland last year, has left in its wake a wretched trail of banks with no capital, banks with crippling burdens of bad loans and banks which have collapsed into the arms of reluctant but incumbent governments. The crisis has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, exacerbated the problems of governments otherwise trying to lessen the state's role in the economy and, not least, disrupted the smooth operation of financial institutions just as the Nordic countries are struggling to emerge from what is for some the deepest recession since the 1930s. As 1993 progresses, there are signs that the worst may be over: most banks in the region have shown improved under- lying performance in their first quarter results and some a reduction in their loan losses; a trend of falling interest rates and an uptick in economic growth next year has fuelled a recovery in bank stocks still traded publicly; Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's top bank, has successfully launched a Dollars 170m share issue to help rebuild its capital base; the first, albeit tentative, moves towards reprivatisation of nationalised banks have been made in Sweden and Norway. But an atmosphere of nervous caution still prevails, with many in the industry worried that further squalls may yet buffet the banks. Economic recovery will be fragile, with the banks highly susceptible to any reversal of the downward trend in interest rates. With unemployment at post-war highs  -the rate is 17 per cent in Finland - there are worries over increasing defaults in the personal sector. Already it is clear that losses will dominate the banking sector again in 1993 and a return to profit in 1994 is far from certain for many of the region's top banks. 'Uncertainty with regard to developments during the rest of the year must be considered great,' Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the chief executive of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, warned shareholders after he issued encouraging first quarter figures. 'Lending losses as well as the volume of problem loans remain on a very high level. Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to draw conclusions concerning the outcome of the whole year on the basis of the figures for the first few months. Besides, there is substantial uncertainty about the general business climate and the economy as a whole.' It is hard to overstate the scale of the Nordic banking crisis. Of the region's major banks, only the better-capital- ised Danish banks and Sweden's Handelsbanken have avoided state aid, although they too have suffered losses. The insurance sector was also dragged down, with its problems compounded by the collapse of Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Hafnia following their abortive attempt to take over Sweden's Skandia. The full impact was first felt in Norway, where combined net losses of NKr16bn in 1991 saw the country's top three banks, Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, rescued from insolvency by the state. Den norske Bank is now 70 per cent state-owned, the other two wholly state- owned. Last year, it was the turn of Sweden and Finland. In Swe- den, two of the top four banks, Gotabanken and Nordbanken, had to be bailed out and taken over completely by the govern- ment. S-E-Banken was forced to request state aid, and, at time of writing, is still negotiating a package to ensure that it does not fall below international capital adequacy levels. In Finland, every bank has received some state support and two, Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland, have been nationalised. To date, the authorities in the three countries have together put up more than Dollars 21bn in capital injections, loans and guarantees to support the banks and the figure is set to rise signif- icantly. Total write-offs and problem loans across the region were around Dollars 15bn last year. The causes of the crisis varied from country to country. In Norway, a slump in oil prices jolted the system; in Finland, the loss of trade with the Soviet Union precipitated a huge economic reverse which sucked in the banks; in Sweden, a spate of property lending in the late 1980s backfired spectacularly when property prices in Sweden and the UK collapsed. The common factor, however, was rapid deregulation of credit and foreign exchange controls in the 1980s. These combined with an economic boom, tax breaks on borrowing and interest rates typically lagging collateral asset value growth to lead the banks into what can now clearly be seen to have been reckless lending on a grand scale. In the aftermath, it is not surprising that bank managements have reacted by instituting much tougher credit control policies. Scrutiny of lending has typically been centralised and tightened through mechanisms such as senior credit approval committees. 'We have become very conservative,' said a senior executive at Norway's Christiania Bank. 'It's not so good for our customers, but we are happier to take the risk of losing a customer than make a hasty decision.' However, the real burden of clearing up the mess has been taken on by governments. Faced with the potential collapse of their banking systems, the authorities in Sweden, Finland and Norway argued that they had little choice but to step in to ensure the continued operation of their countries' payments systems and to reassure international creditors. This has not only cost lots of taxpayers' money. It has raised difficult questions about the process of restructuring the banks to position them for eventual reprivatisation while ensuring competitive neutrality. The Danish authorities, unlike their neighbours to the north, have held back from providing blanket deposit guarantees or specific support to their banks. 'This is deliberate,' says Mr Eigil Molgaard, director general of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. 'It has been done to prevent private banks from speculating in government support, to avoid competitive distortions and of course to prevent what are in reality the unlimited drawings on the government's budget funds which we have seen in the other countries.' Certainly, the other countries are now embroiled in an expensive tangle of support and ownership which will take years to unscramble. In Norway and Finland, government funds were set up with the initial intention to restructure what were officially regarded as overbanked systems through mergers and other rationalisation measures. But these have stumbled. Their respective governments have for the moment shelved any action while they await recommendations commissioned from international banking consultants. In Sweden, the preferred route has been to treat each bank on a case-by-case basis through the newly-created Bank Support Authority. Stockholm has also adopted the course, in the case of Gotabanken and Nordbanken, of extracting their bad assets into so-called 'bad banks' which will remain in state hands while the laundered parent banks are sold off. One notable consequence of this is that the state is set to become a large-scale holder of commercial property, and is likely to remain so for a decade or more. Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, accepts that such action by a market-orientated government is painful, but she says it has been unavoidable. Aid for the banks, including S-E-Banken, is being constructed so as not 'unduly to create unfairness' to still independent Handelsbanken, she says. Nevertheless, Nordbanken's bounce back to profit after being freed of no less than SKr67bn in bad assets is a hard pill for rival Handelsbanken to swallow. But Mrs Wibble says her main concern now is to avoid 'a credit crunch' by putting a further squeeze on the ailing banks which could damage the prospects of a return to growth next year after three successive years of shrinkage in the economy. As the governments wrestle with the long process of putting their banking systems back on their feet, there is one remedy none is reaching for: re-regulation of the financial system. It is universally accepted that it was not the lifting of controls which caused the crisis, but the way the banks behaved in a deregulated environment. Besides, re-regulation is not an option as long as Finland, Norway and Sweden continue to seek membership by 1995 of the European Community, with whose banking regime they will have to conform.</p>

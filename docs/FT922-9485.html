			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: MPs gain question time MEMBERS OF parliament will be able to ask questions directly about the Citizen's Charter for the first time under the new arrangements for departmental questions to be approved by the Commons today. There will also be an extended opportunity to ask questions on the arts, with Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, having a 40-minute question slot once every four weeks. Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter, will face questions from MPs for 20 minutes once every three weeks. Mr John Taylor, the new junior minister in the lord chancellor's department, will answer MPs' questions for 15 minutes once every six weeks. Energy matters will be subsumed in the hour-long monthly slot for questions to trade and industry ministers. The new arrangements for questions have been made quickly, but there is some uncertainty about when the all-party committees that monitor departments can be set up. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, is keen to see them established early, but at present there are difficulties about the timing of opposition nominations. Labour party rules say that no frontbench spokesman can be a select committee member. Until the shadow cabinet elections are over - in late July  -and junior spokesmanships agreed, therefore, it will not be clear who will be available and keen to serve on the committees, including perhaps those who may have lost places in the frontbench team. Other Commons committees such as the public accounts committee and the committee looking at European legislation are likely to be established more quickly. The parties will have to decide whether there should be a committee to monitor the national heritage department. The Opposition hopes that the two extra Tory MPs for Scottish seats will mean that in this parliament, unlike the last, a Scottish affairs committee will be appointed. Labour will also be pressing for the chairmanship of at least one additional departmental committee, beyond the four it holds already. As a further element in the Commons' becoming operational again, the three deputy Speakers, who will take turns at substituting for the Speaker in presiding over MPs' debates, were appointed yesterday. Mr Michael Morris, Tory MP for Northampton South, was appointed the senior deputy Speaker, as chairman of ways and means. Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, the Labour MP for Pontefract, and Dame Janet Fookes, the Tory MP for Plymouth Drake, are the other two deputies.</p>

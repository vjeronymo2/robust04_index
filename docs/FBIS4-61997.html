			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] We will begin with the news from Toompea. The  Riigikogu's plenary session is working this afternoon and has  adopted the law on political parties. Gunnar Paal reports.    [Begin recording] [Paal] According to the law on political  parties that has just been adopted, a party must have at least  1,000 members. This is the decision taken today by the  Riigikogu, with 65 votes in favor, four against, and three  abstentions, as it adopted the law on political parties in its  entirety. Constitutional Commission Chairman Mart Nutt: Will  the law on political parties cast doubt on the future of a whole  string of small parties?    [Nutt] Not at all. As is known, the parties that are already  operating do not have to reregister according to this law on  parties. All they must do is bring their constitutions and  programs in line with the requirements of the new law. This  means that if they are below the 1,000 member limit, this will  not serve as a basis for them to wind up their activity. Also,  the parties that will be set up before the next Riigikogu  elections will do so according to the previous principle, which  means the requirement is 200 members. The new requirement of  1,000 members will come into force only after the next Riigikogu  elections. It is aimed at strengthening parties. The parties  operating now will drop out of the party register only if they  fail to get any of their candidates into the Riigikogu during  the next two elections. This is a logical path to follow  because those parties who fail to make their mark on the  political map, those parties have no point. [passage omitted]</p>

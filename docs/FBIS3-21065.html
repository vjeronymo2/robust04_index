They break down a  variety of undesirable compounds like ammonia and highly toxic  problem materials. The simulation of growth processes in the  tanks is necessary in the investigation of decomposition  processes. Wolfgang Tappe of the Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH  (Institute for Biotechnology IBT 3, 52425 Juelich) has now  developed a bioreactor system which is suitable for these tasks.    As Tappe reported in Juelich, bacteria have a very low  growth  rate in the soil and in the water as well as in purification  plants. The supply of nutrients is often so low that it allows  bacteria only to survive but not to grow. The investigation of  these processes in important in view of the role of bacteria in  decomposing toxic materials. But with conventional bioreactor  systems the simulation of such growth conditions is either  impossible or possible only to a very limited degree. In a  continuouly operating laboratory bioreactor a certain amount of  fresh nutrient solution is added per unit of time and the  corresponding amount of used medium removed. In the process  biomass is lost which must be replaced by the growth of bacteria  in the reactor. But if the maximal growth rate of the organisms  is very low the danger exists that the lost biomass cannot be  replaced.    In activated sludge plants the medium generation spans are  between 150 and 500 hours, and thus are relatively long.  Conventional bioreactor systems are often overextended in  simulating these growth conditions. Since the addition of  nutrient solution in this case is very low, it sometimes happens  that an even distribution in the reactor is not achieved. The  result is that the bacterial population is no longer  homogeneous. Some bacteria grow more rapidly than others.    In the Juelich reactor the solution of this problem involves  reservation of the biomass. The main difference in comparison to  conventional, continuously running reactors is the separately  arranged filtration module. That is where the used medium is  filtered while retaining the bacteria. The filtration is not  simple, since the round filter tends to become clogged. Tappe  solved this problem with a cross-flow technique. Close over the  membrane is a revolving magnetic stirring rod, which creates a  current moving diagonally to the direction of filtration  (cross-flow). With this device clogging can be successfully  prevented.    The module is surrounded by a refined steel housing and is  connected to the reactor container by means of tubing and pumps.  In this way a continuous addition of nutrients can be achieved  without loss of biomass, and bacteria with very low growth rates  can be investigated. These growth conditions are very close to  the actual conditions in activated sludge tanks. The filtration  module of the Juelich system can also be used for on-line  supervision of purification plants. It provides a sample free of  biomass from which chemical parameters can be determined.</p>

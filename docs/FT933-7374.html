			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: 'No-load' pioneer passes the performance test - A look at a fund which does not make an initial charge / Unit Trusts: Lazard's European Growth THE CONCEPT of a 'no-load' fund, a collective equity vehicle without an initial charge, is common in the US. In the UK, such funds are still rare, with the norm being initial charges of 5-6 per cent. One UK fund management group which has blazed a trail is Lazard, which abolished the initial charge on its trusts in 1988. Such a charging structure can make quite a difference to investors. The bid-offer spread on Lazard's European Growth fund on August 1 was just 0.88 per cent; on the average European trust, the spread was 5.91 per cent. That means an investor who puts Pounds 100 into the Lazard trust had Pounds 99.12 of his money working for him; in the average European trust, that sum would be just Pounds 94.09. Many in the unit trust industry argue that charges are a relatively unimportant issue. What really matters, in their view, is performance. Lazard's European Growth trust does not fall down on that score. According to Micropal, it was second out of 92 European unit trusts over the five years to August 1, with growth of 129.8 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested). The trust's record is consistent. It is fifth (out of 120 funds) over three years, growing by 24.8 per cent and 16th (out of 128) funds over one year, with a return of 28.1 per cent. The European Growth trust was set up in October 1986. 'We previously had trusts for in-house clients but we did not have an authorised vehicle which could be sold directly to the public' says Patricia Maxwell-Arnot, who has managed the trust since launch. The strong performance has helped to attract investors, although the fund does not pay commission. When launched, the fund had just under Pounds 3m under management; it has now passed the Pounds 100m mark. Like the Schroder UK Enterprise fund, covered in last week's issue, Lazard European Growth invests in a limited number of stocks - 44 at present. But whereas the Schroder fund sees this concentration as part of its 'aggressive' approach, Lazard's Maxwell-Arnot says 'We see ourselves as risk-averse prudent investors. We think about the downside as much as the upside.' 'The big danger of investment is buying things and then finding you can't sell them,' adds Maxwell-Arnot. 'Accordingly, we focus on marketability and opt for large markets, and large stocks.' In terms of stock selection, Maxwell-Arnot says: 'We are looking for companies which are undervalued, because if something is cheap, the downside is limited. We look at valuation measures such as price to cashflow and price to book (asset value) rather than at price-earnings ratios. The turnover of our fund is very low.' She adds: 'We identify shares which are good value and stick with them.' The largest 10 holdings are: SIP (the Italian telecoms group), UBS (the Swiss bank), Deutsche Bank (the German bank), ABN-Amro Bank (the Dutch bank), Axa (the French insurance group), Roche (the Swiss pharmaceuticals group), Schering (the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group), BMW (the German car maker), Bayer (the German chemicals company) and Valeo (the French car components group). The top 10 shows a concentration of financial companies, which Maxwell-Arnot believes will benefit from falling interest rates. Some stocks such as UBS have already risen sharply, but she says 'it is still cheaply rated relative to other banks and in terms of quality is one of the best in Europe.' Other selections fit the Lazard criteria for undervaluation. SIP is seen as exceptionally cheap at a price of 1.5 times cashflow. Maxwell-Arnot says Schering is priced at seven times cashflow which she sees as a very cheap rating for a company which has declared it is going to sell off its non-pharmaceutical interests. In terms of geographical allocation, the fund is overweight in Switzerland (19.4 per cent of the portfolio), Netherlands (13.5 per cent), and France (27 per cent). The rest of the portfolio is split between Germany (20.2 per cent), Italy (9.1 per cent), Spain (4.2 per cent), Sweden (3.2 per cent) and Belgium (2.8 per cent). Maxwell-Arnot says: 'Our biggest underweight position has been in Scandinavia,' - a strategy which has not proved helpful to the fund's performance but which flows from the trust's concentration on Europe's larger markets. Looking ahead, Maxwell-Arnot is bullish about the prospects for European equities. 'On a price-to-cashflow ratio, European markets look very cheap relative to the US and the UK. European equities also look cheap relative to bonds.' 'French interest rates will come down, as reality dawns on PM Balladur. Rates are too high, given the level of unemployment and the state of the economy.' Across Europe, she argues that the low yields on cash and bonds will cause the valuations of stocks to rise. Charges. As highlighted above, the fund has no initial charge. The annual charge is 1.5 per cent. The minimum investment in the fund is quite high, by industry standards, at Pounds 5,000. The trust is Pepable, but Lazard has no specific plan attached to it.</p>

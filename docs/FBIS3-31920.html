The Piranhas will be fitted onto patrol fighter planes  by mid-1996 after being built by the Mectron Engenharia and  receiving approval from the Navy institutes. This is a priority  project for the Aeronautics Ministry, which wishes to replace  the 150 U.S. missiles purchased 20 years ago that still equip  Brazilian combat planes. Brigadier Nelson Taveira, director of  the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA), said that there is the  possibility of exporting these missiles. The initial production  capability will be 10 missiles per month. With a fund of $8.8  million, the Piranha is being developed by engineers from the  Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA). Mectron will review  the electronic parts and the missile guide control. As this is  a teleguided weapon, parts of its plans will be modernized with  the help of the CTA experts.</p>

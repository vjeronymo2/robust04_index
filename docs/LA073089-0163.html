			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROD STEWART A NO-SHOW AT CONCERT  </P> <P> A Rod Stewart concert was canceled for the second night in a row Saturday when  the rock star failed to appear for an 8 p.m. performance at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> The show was produced by Bill Silva Presents, but concert promoters and Sports  Arena officials were not available for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Reason Given for Absence  </P> <P> A man who answered the phone Saturday night at the Sports Arena administrative  offices said there was no reason given for Stewart's no-show. The worker, who  asked not to be identified, said the thousands of fans were notified at 8 p.m.,  when the show was scheduled to start, about Stewart's absence. More than an  hour later, he added, most of the crowd was still in the arena, "kind of angry,  kind of mad."  </P> <P> "They're just sitting down. They don't want to go home. There's a whole bunch  of them mad and a lot of police around here. The stage crew is carrying out all  of his equipment right now."  </P> <P> A police spokesman said extra police were sent to the arena but no major  incidents were reported at 9:30 p.m.  </P> <P> "Most of his fans are older. We don't anticipate any problems," the spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Stewart was scheduled to perform Friday night, but the concert was canceled  earlier in the day when his staff reported that a truck carrying the singer's  equipment from his last concert in Fresno had broken down.  </P> <P> There was no official word on whether the concert would be rescheduled.  However, the man who answered the phone at the Sports Arena office said that  fans were told that Stewart would perform on Tuesday night.  </P></p>

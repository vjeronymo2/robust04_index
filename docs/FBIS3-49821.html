			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 15 January (TANJUG) -- The main  committee of the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] today expelled  from the party 11 federal deputies because of "the most arrogant  violation of the programme and statute." All of them, in  keeping with the law and the legal acts of the Depos [Democratic  Movement of Serbia] coalition, have had their mandates as  deputies wthdrawn, the main committee of the SPO has announced.    Slobodan Rakitic, Strahinja Kastratovic, Radomir Urosevic,  Pavle Premovic, Obren Joksimovic, Radenko Jokovic, Branislav  Rakus, Vojislav Nedeljkovic, Zoran Cirkovic, Jovan Babic, and  Jovan Tomic were expelled as members of the SPO.    Of the 122 members of the main committee who attended the  session, 111 voted for the expulsions, five opposed, and six  abstained.    In keeping with the law and legal acts of the Depos  coalition, the main committee also elected 11 new SPO deputies  to the Yugoslav Assembly. They will replace those who have been  deputies hitherto and who had their mandates withdrawn by the  party today. The new SPO federal deputies on the Depos  coalition electoral list are: Dr. Gordana Anicic and Prof.  Tomislav Jeremic (Belgrade electoral district), Dr. Danilo  Beukovic and Engineer Pera Sijacki (Novi Sad electoral  district), Dr. Dragoslav Isakovic and Dr. Dusan Vasic (Uzice  electoral district), lawyer Nikola Koca Djordjevic and Prof.  Milos Filipovic (Kragujevac electoral district), graduate  engineer Dragoljub Janes (Nis electoral district), and lawyer  Sreten Nesih (Leskovac electoral district). [only 10 names as  received]    The main committee rejected all the allegations contained in  the letter of the 11 former federal deputies as untrue and  designed only to undermine the electoral success of the SPO and  Depos. The main committee assessed "the sad fact that the  signatories sent their pamphlet-style letter, which was untrue  and not based on the facts, to state television and not to the  party authorities" as the most arrogant violation of the SPO  program and statute.    Everything was carried out in accordance with a scenario  prepared in conjunction with the special political command of  the ruling regime, which is tasked with smashing and shaming the  democratic opposition, and especially the SPO and Depos as the  most powerful opposition forces, the statement says.

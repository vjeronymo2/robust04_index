			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REVELERS OFFERED FREE, SAFE WAY HOME;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY: NEW YEAR'S EVE DRINKERS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO GETTING BEHIND THE  WHEEL.  </P> <P> While New Year's Eve celebrators have been bombarded with messages urging them  not to drink and drive, a quieter effort has been made to offer those who have  been drinking a safe alternative to trying to swerve their way home.  </P> <P> Two taxi companies, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a hospital system, a beer  distributor and a towing service are using their resources to offer drinkers  free rides home.  </P> <P> "We'll be able to handle anybody who calls," said Larry Slagle, president of  the Yellow Cab in North Orange County, one of two taxi companies offering free  rides home in cooperation with MADD, CareUnit and Straub Distribution Co. "We  won't take you to another establishment, but we'll take you home."  </P> <P> Further, midnight will usher in not only the New Year but also a new state law  that lowers the blood-alcohol level for drunk driving from 0.10 to 0.08.  </P> <P> That means that many people who were legally considered sober enough to drive  after a few drinks earlier in the evening may not be after midnight, and may  need a ride home.  </P> <P> Even people whose blood-alcohol level is below the legal limit may be affected  by their drinking, with altered judgment and slowed reflexes posing a danger to  themselves and others on the road, authorities say.  </P> <P> Anyone who does not want to drive home is welcome to use the services, sponsors  of the free ride programs said.  </P> <P> "All we want is to make sure they don't have an accident on the way home,"  Slagle said.  </P> <P> CareCab and Taxi Time are the only free taxi services that have publicized  their efforts among bars, nightclubs and police stations countywide. They will  offer a combined force of about 300 cabs for free rides home.  </P> <P> Both services will take would-be drivers home or to a residence -- provided  there is no party in progress -- within 20 miles for free, but for longer  drives, riders will have to pay the difference.  </P> <P> CareCab, the 10th annual program co-sponsored by MADD and CareUnit Hospitals,  will operate from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m., every night from today to Jan. 2 and can be  reached from anywhere in the county at (800) 422-4143.  </P> <P> Taxi Time, which is underwritten by Yellow Cab of North Orange County and Coast  Yellow Cab, and publicized by Straub Distributing Co., runs 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.  until Jan. 2. Calls to (714) 535-2211 or (714) 546-1311 must be placed by an  employee of a bar or restaurant.  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach Police Department is also operating a taxi service, called  Tipsy Taxi, which is not free and is available only to city residents by  calling (714) 494-1121.  </P> <P> Slagle said that representatives from Straub distributed information about Taxi  Time to area bars and restaurants to encourage employees to watch patrons and  offer the service if they believe it is necessary.  </P> <P> Organizers of several large public New Year's Eve parties throughout the county  have not planned safe-ride programs of their own and expect to direct patrons  to CareCab and Taxi Time.  </P> <P> For example, the Irvine Hilton and Towers boasts a nearly sold-out New Year's  Eve celebration in all its dinner, dancing and party rooms but has nothing  particular planned for the number of potential drunk drivers resulting from the  festivities. "Not all these people will be staying here in the hotel," so  party-goers will be referred to the free services, said Jim Martinez, a bellman  at the hotel.  </P> <P> As another alternative for North County residents, Tri-Star Towing is offering  five of its rigs for free tow services and rides home for residents living in  or near Fullerton, Brea, Placentia and Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> Owner Glenn Gorman said drivers should call (714) 771-7111 if they need a free  tow. "All they have to do is call," he said. "We'll deliver them and their car  to a safe place. . . . If you were going to drink and drive, there is an  alternative."  </P> <P> Law enforcement agencies will be out in full force tonight, with many city  police employing extra officers for teams whose sole responsibility is to scout  out people driving under the influence of alcohol.  </P> <P> In addition, the Anaheim police will set up sobriety checkpoints throughout the  city. And the California Highway Patrol reminds drivers that they may be  responsible for the cost of emergency roadside care -- such as a response by  paramedics -- because state law allows emergency response agencies to bill  drunk drivers for services.  </P> <P> All of those beefed-up law enforcement programs for New Year's Eve come on top  of the everyday monetary incentive to keep drivers off the roads if they have  been drinking -- namely, a potential $1,000 fine for first-time offenders, said  Joe David of the CHP.  </P> <P> "We'll be looking for them," said Lt. John Foster of the Huntington Beach  Police. "If they don't have a (safe) ride home, we'll give them one -- to our  'hotel.' " Foster was referring to the city jail.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / First dividend cut at Ladbroke The new management of the Ladbroke hotels, betting and do-it-yourself group yesterday cut the dividend for the first time since it became a public company in 1967. Mr John Jackson, who has taken over from Mr Cyril Stein as chairman, said it was no longer in the group's interest to continue paying dividends uncovered by earnings. The cut was part of full-year figures, which showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 62.1m, compared with Pounds 5.2m in 1992, after much lower exceptional charges. Before exceptionals, the profit figure fell to Pounds 117.5m from Pounds 148.6m. The final dividend was cut from 6.23p to 1.08p, bringing the total payout to 6p - 46 per cent down on 1992. It was covered by earnings per share before exceptionals of 7.13p. However, earnings after exceptionals were 2.32p, compared with a loss of 3.11p. Turnover for the year rose to Pounds 4.3bn, from Pounds 4.2bn. The Pounds 55.4m exceptional charges resulted from stock write-downs and management reorganisation at Texas Homecare, and property revaluations. The group reported that trading at its Hilton International hotels subsidiary remained difficult, and that substantial pruning of product lines was necessary at Texas. Mr Jackson said the group continued to talk to potential buyers of its property division, which had flat profits, before exceptionals, of Pounds 41.4m. Year-end net debt fell from Pounds 1.34bn to Pounds 1.27bn. A Pounds 394.1m reduction in the value of hotel and investment properties resulted in a rise in gearing to 58 per cent from 53 per cent. Ladbroke said, however, that in the first half of 1994, it would receive Pounds 83m from property sales to Burford Holdings. A further Dollars 125m (Pounds 85.6m) would be received in January 1995 from the surrender of Hilton's management contract in Hong Kong. Taking these into account, pro-forma gearing was 49 per cent. Mr George said he was examining possible changes in the running of the group's divisions and their relationship with Ladbroke head office. Mr Tommaso Zanzotto, formerly of American Express, joined the group this week as head of Hilton International. Mr Mike Smith, a main board member of Bowater, will head the gaming and betting division from May. Mr John Coleman, previously with Burton, has been running Texas since September.

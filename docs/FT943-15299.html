			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Private View: The song of Streisand's little sister Both songbirds were hatched in the same Brooklyn nest. She was the shy one, her sister the noisy one. She was the fat one, her sister the skinny one. 'Kids used to make fun of me,' said Roslyn Kind. 'I would go to the theatre and they'd say: 'Oh, you'll know Barbra's sister when she comes because she cracks the sidewalk with every step.' 'When my sister opened in Funny Girl, I was a size 20.' (That's an English size 18: Roslyn was 14 years old.) 'People thought I was her aunt. I don't consider that the happiest experience in anyone's life.' Yet, whoever deals the cards dealt these two girls fairly equal hands. Roslyn was nearly nine years younger than Barbra, but prettier. Her voice was lower but sounded as good - some said even better. If you close your eyes it is hard to tell them apart: the same timbre, the same attack, the same vocal tricks. If it were not for the genes you would say Roslyn Kind, nightclub singer, was just mimicking Barbra Streisand, superstar. Lady Luck has not smiled on Streisand's little sister. On the first night of her London debut at the Cafe Royal last week - cabaret tickets at Pounds 20 a head - her pianist was taken to hospital in a state of collapse. Two months before, Barbra had filled London's 26,000-seater Wembley Arena at prices up to Pounds 260. Roslyn was signed by RCA while still a teenager and made her first album, Give Me You, as soon as she left school. There was a second album, but no third. She has appeared on Broadway. The first of her two small films was called I'm Going to be Famous, the second The Underachievers. And her biggest television success so far was some guest appearances in a sitcom called Gimme A Break. For the most part, she has soldiered round the cabaret circuit, earning some nice reviews. And if she feels her career has been horribly handicapped, she is careful to hide her resentment. In spite of a sleepless night worrying about her pianist, she was able next morning to smile sweetly through the inevitable questions and to expatiate on what she kept calling 'the search for Roslyn Kind'. Did you try to follow Barbra? 'I always looked up to my big sister, but I looked up to my big brother, too.' (He is 17 years older than her, and a property developer.) 'I loved my sister a lot and I missed her when she left home.' Did you try to imitate her? 'When I got to see shows, I would buy the album and sing all the parts in the mirror. I was the insecure, shy, overweight child. I got out of myself in those moments. I would look in the mirror and I didn't see the fat, overweight girl. I saw this other character.' She warbled a couple of snatches. 'I didn't imitate her. I sang all the albums - it might be Petula Clark or one of the other British singers. Barbra was just someone else who was a performer, who happened to be my sister who I was very proud of.' The girls are, in fact, half-sisters. Diana, their mother, married Emanuel Streisand, who had a PhD in English and taught at a reform school for boys in New York; he died when Barbra was a baby. Her second husband was Louis Kind, a divorced tailor, second-hand car salesman and estate agent. The couple separated when he was over 60 and their child, Roslyn, only four. Barbra has blamed a loveless childhood for her determination to become a star. One biographer claims Louis Kind called the girls Beauty and the Beast. Was it true, I asked Roslyn, that your father rejected Barbra and favoured you? 'I was too young to know. The only thing I know is I was Little Miss Angel, Miss Goody Two-Shoes, and my sister was probably more rambunctious and rebellious. But, usually, those are the ones that really break out, the ones that grow up to be the movers and shakers. 'Whatever the case, I know my sister was in dire need of a father image because she didn't know her father. And she needed a dad.' Roslyn said her father loved children. Perhaps he had just failed to see how much Barbra needed his admiration. Although their singing talent comes from their mother (the grandfather was a cantor in a Russian synagogue), she was protective, conventional and untypically reserved for a Brooklyn housewife. 'She never laid compliments on us, which is maybe what made us all fight for who and what we are, to get out there and prove ourselves. My father, may he rest in peace, was the total opposite. I became this golden child to him. He blew it all out of proportion and my mother never said anything. She was only proud within - but, as a child, you don't understand that.' Following her own divorce, Roslyn lives with her 85-year-old mother in Los Angeles. 'My mom came from what her parents dealt her: love is having a roof over your head, clothes on your back and food on the table and she wasn't demonstrative. Not to me, either. She's a much different lady now. 'So my sister took it in one way and I in another. To her, I was always so sweet and so this and that, and I had to come to a place where I felt that I don't have to be someone's doormat in order to be loved. So that was my lesson, you see.' With such emotional complications in the background, it is hardly surprising that both women should have had problems with men. Barbra married actor Elliot Gould in her early 20s and had a son; they were divorced eight years later. She has knocked around with Hollywood glamour boys such as Warren Beatty and Ryan O'Neal, and last year turned up to watch Andre Agassi at Wimbledon. Roslyn's love life seems to have been calmer. She was in her early 30s before she married Randy Stone, a casting director. He was younger and on the way up but within six months, she said, things were not working out. 'He loved my feistiness. Unfortunately, I don't think he was ready for marriage, though he thought he was.' Do you have children? 'Not yet. I have a little puppy.' She giggled, cutely. Roslyn now has a boyfriend, a lawyer in Philadelphia, of whom it is clear she has hopes. I asked her if she found men easier to handle than her sister does. 'It's not easy when a woman is very strong. She's a strong lady. I mean, my sister's very vulnerable but she has a very strong side also.' Are you like that? 'I think men are intimidated by me before they even meet me. Does that make sense? Because I am preceded by the fact that I am Barbra's sister.' Roslyn began to describe, with a hint of bitterness now, how she had lost roles in the past because of her sister's famously neurotic pernicketiness. 'They hear my sister is difficult,' she said, cautiously. 'My sister wants of anybody else the best that she would ask of herself. That's all.' Then added: 'It's not a fair position to be in.' She describes herself as a logical person who thinks before she speaks. She reads about psychic phenomena and stories of reincarnation. 'It started grabbing my interest when I was on the road and searching for Roslyn Kind.' She made it sound like someone else. You're a bit of a New Ager? 'I am New Age.' You have crystals and things? 'I certainly do.' She laughed, prettily. 'I carry one with me all the time. I usually carry one on stage with me. I have a balancing disc that I lost somewhere in my travels.' What's that? 'If anything is ailing or you want more energy in a certain part of your body, you lay the copper side on it for a few moments and meditate. So, before I go on stage, I put it on my vocal chords while I'm holding my crystal and say affirmations.' I asked her if she envied Barbra's fame and millions. She did not answer directly but said, softly: 'I'm very proud of my sister.' Are you content to perform for the sort of money you get? 'The money isn't so bad.' Comparisons made with her sister's earnings were unfair. 'Nor am I fighting to make in one night what she makes on one ticket. That's an untruth. 'I would like to be making some more. It would be unrealistic to say I want to do this at this level all my life. Obviously, you wanna grow. I don't think I need to be the monumental star that my sister is: she's lost a lot of privacy through it.' Do you wonder sometimes why she got so much and you did not? 'Some people are meant to make it. Their destinies are making it early. My destiny was maybe learning about myself as a person first before I could make it in any other way, or even find the right person in my life. I had to discover Roslyn Kind. I put a lot of years into that. 'I guess in a way I'm not totally a show business person. I'm a very real, everyday type person who loves to perform.' But you could have avoided all this . . . 'By not going into the business? Should I deny myself what I love doing most? I enjoy performing. I also know what is right for me. I will stay in.' Isn't there a point where one is just being obstinate? 'There are times I've thrown my hands in the air and said 'enough is enough'. But the moments I've done that, some kind of project comes through. The universe is telling me, 'Ros, don't stop'. Because you'll never know that it was a week away if you stop now.' Where would you like to get to? 'To the level where people appreciate my talent and come out looking for me, instead of me fighting so hard to be seen and to be accepted. I love to sing, I love to perform, and I would love to do it one day with my sister and share a stage just for one day.' Would she agree to that? 'Maybe.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fan Chun (5400 0689): "Guangzhou Military </F> Region's Recover-Hong Kong Exercises"]    [Text]  <H3>  "Ulterior Motives" in the Campaign To Criticize  Chris Patten </H3>   Hong Kong is in the run-up to its return to the Chinese  mainland, but this run-up is faced with many variables, for  China and Britain have parted company, "each going its own way."  Beijing's repeated references to recovering Hong Kong ahead of  schedule make the "run-up" even more unpredictable....    One sign drawing special attention is that the entire city  of  Beijing has been "mobilized spiritually," and public opinion has  been prepared for "the elimination of the proxies of the British  colonialists."    Friends in Beijing's political circles told this writer that  they also have noticed the CPC's tune in the campaign to  criticize Chris Patten -- exaggerating the matter and raising  the Hong Kong issue to the higher plane of "safeguarding the  motherland." According to their analysis, the CPC top  leadership "has ulterior motives" in this move, for the British  have never said that they will hold on to Hong Kong after 1 July  1997; moreover, what worries the Beijing authorities most does  not seem to be Hong Kong's economy (they believe that with the  backing of the huge mainland market, Hong Kong's role as a  "window" will not be weakened; on the contrary, Hong Kong will  become more prosperous than before), but the ways to "rule over"  the 6 million Hong Kong people. They believe that under Hong  Kong's present situation -- wherein democrats, who Beijing  considers "anti-China" elements who are attempting to turn Hong  Kong into chaos, still enjoy the popular support of the public  -- Hong Kong may "get out of control" after 1997. Friends in  Beijing said jokingly: Everything would be OK if democrats in  Hong Kong enjoyed as little credibility as the members of the  Preliminary Working Committee [PWC]!  <H3>  Jiang Zemin Stresses the Need To "Eliminate the Influence of  British Colonialism" </H3>   We can get an inkling of the matter from Jiang Zemin's  recent  speech on the Hong Kong issue.    In the speech he delivered at a Political Bureau meeting at  the beginning of this month [January], Jiang Zemin stressed the  following points: National sovereignty is above all else, and  Hong Kong's sustained stability and development is the  foundation. Alongside the changes in Hong Kong's political  situation, the central authorities, based on the aforementioned  line and policies, will draw up resolute decisions and measures  to safeguard national sovereignty, eliminate the evil legacy of  British colonialism and the pernicious influence of the proxies  of British colonialists, and put into practice the PRC's policy  of "one country, two systems."    Does the "elimination of the evil legacy of British  colonialism and the pernicious influence of the proxies of  British colonialists" mean that a campaign of political  "disinfection" will be carried out in Hong Kong after 1997?    On 10 January, the key points of Jiang Zemin's speech were  relayed to the ministries, commissions, and the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, as well as to the  party committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities.  <H5>  Qian Qichen Again Clarifies the Chinese Side's Bottom Line </H5>   The speech by Qian Qichen, who is in charge of Hong Kong  affairs, also was relayed to the ministries, commissions, and  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, as  well as to the party committees of all provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities. In his speech, he made a  thoroughgoing analysis of Hong Kong's present situation, and  emphatically pointed out the British authorities "plot." His  speech is divided into the following three parts:    1. Britain has changed its China policy;    2. Britain's purpose in deliberately sabotaging the Joint  Declaration and the agreements already reached between the two  countries;    3. The initiative is always in China's hands.    Qian Qichen stressed in his speech that Sino-British  relations will turn for the worse as a result of Britain's  plotted moves to sabotage the Joint Declaration and to openly  deny any agreements already reached between the two countries.  This is an inevitable result of Britain's China policy, which  is formulated after the U.S. China policy, and Sino-British  relations will be unlikely to return to normal in the coming  three years or even for a considerable period to come. China  will not take the initiative to improve its ties with Britain.  It has never begged Britain for compromises, it does not  currently beg, nor will it do so in the future. This is the  policy of the Chinese Government toward Britain.  <H3>  Scaring People by Predicting the Emergence of "Chaotic  Phenomena" in Hong Kong </H3>   Qian Qichen then switched to another subject: "The further  Britain and the British Hong Kong Government slide down the  wrong road of violating and sabotaging the Joint Declaration and  the agreements already reached between the two countries, and of  denouncing the Basic Law, which is purely China's internal  affair, the easier it will be for us to find a fundamental  solution to the matter. Both the initiative and the timing are  in our hands. In order to prolong its rule in Hong Kong, the  British authorities have brought up in a planned way a number of  pro-British, pro-U.S., and anti-China ultra right forces to  contend with the government of the future special administrative  region [SAR], and to turn Hong Kong into a political city in  which foreign countries will scramble for spheres of influence.  In order to safeguard the national sovereignty and dignity of  the Chinese people, in addition to making political, propaganda,  and economic preparations, we also will follow the development  of the situation with close interest and prepare to pay certain  costs as long as we can deter Britain from succeeding with its  plot."    All this serves to show clearly the Beijing authorities'  state of mind, that is, the Beijing authorities wish for Hong  Kong to run into chaos so they can adopt "antiriot" measures  with perfect justice and eliminate all democratic figures who  now enjoy public support. If this is the case, even though they  are flying in the face of the people's will, they can cover the  truth with the signboard of "safeguarding national sovereignty  and dignity."    Qian Qichen also scared people by claiming that political  turmoil will take place in Hong Kong during the transitional  period and after China's recovery on 1 July 1994. British  colonialism and U.S. hegemonism undoubtedly will support the  anti-China ultra right forces in Hong Kong in stirring up  trouble and fanning the flames of disorder under all kinds of  pretenses with the aim of opposing the central government and  terminating colonial rule, the Basic Law, the PLA garrison, and  the PWC, which has been set up with the approval of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress. The central  government, however, is entirely capable of taking the situation  into its own hands and of coping with the sabotage of  pro-British, pro-U.S., and anti-China ultra right forces.  Anti-China ultra rightists who throw in their lot with foreign  forces with the intention of stirring up trouble are only a tiny  minority in Hong Kong.  <H5>  Deliberately Strangling Hong Kong's Democrats </H5>   This writer once reported in the 1993 December Issue of  CHENG  MING that the CPC had already drawn up a blacklist of Hong Kong  people, and without any legal trial have determined their nature  as "anti-China ultra rightists with the intention of stirring up  disorder in Hong Kong" by using the same standards as those used  for "counter-revolutionaries" on the mainland. The fact that  Qian Qichen foresaw a disordered and chaotic Hong Kong, and that  he placed all the blame on Hong Kong's democrats, who China  considers "thorns in its flesh," obviously shows that China  intends to spare none of these democrats when the time comes.    People cannot help asking: Now that Beijing believes that  "anti-China ultra rightists who intend to stir up disorder in  Hong Kong" are only a tiny minority in Hong Kong, why take these  people so seriously, make so many threats in a such a flustered  and exasperated manner, and stress the issue over and over  again? How can the PRC, as large and great as it is, be  perplexed by "this tiny minority" of people?  <H3>  The Ultimate Target of the CPC Is To Counter the Hong Kong  People </H3>   As a matter of fact, by acting against democrats in Hong  Kong, the CPC ultimately aims at countering the overwhelming  majority of Hong Kong people. Having lived in a free and  well-informed society for such a long time, the Hong Kong people  have developed their own political views and moral standards.  The 4 June incident, which took place in Beijing in 1989, as  well as the CPC's encirclement and suppression of democrats in  Hong Kong will not shake their fixed beliefs easily. A recent  public opinion poll has showed that the Hong Kong United  Democrats, who are considered enemies by the CPC, still are the  most popular political party in Hong Kong. By comparison, the  Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-China  base camp, ranks last on the list. Another public opinion poll  also has showed that most Hong Kong people share the Hong Kong  governor's view that PWC members lack credibility and cannot  represent the interests of any group. Under such circumstances,  the greatest difficulty facing the CPC in its recovery of Hong  Kong is how to bring about a U-turn in the ideology of the Hong  Kong people and make them recognize the outlook of value  practiced in their socialist motherland.  <H5>  "We Have the Ability To Recover Hong Kong in a Single Night" </H5>   There have been many conjectures concerning the CPC's  recovery of Hong Kong ahead of schedule. People generally  believe that Beijing will not take such a reckless action. Qian  Qichen gave a clear-cut answer on this issue: "The Chinese  Government has studied this issue carefully and has made a  decision, that is, if the British side wishes to return Hong  Kong to us tomorrow, we will tell them: Alright, on the same  night. However, we are not going to give them a receipt."    It also was revealed in Qian Qichen's relayed report that  the  relevant sides have made sufficient preparations: Once drastic  changes or turmoil take place in Hong Kong, the PLA basically is  able to bring the situation under control within four hours.  <H3>  A Military Maneuver Aiming at Quelling Turbulence in Hong  Kong </H3>   I do not believe the following is a fabricated story:  According to a source from the Guangzhou Military Region, on 2  January, crack troops from the 12th Regiment, the 25th Division  of a group army garrisoning Guangdong's Conghua Prefecture and  the special mobile forces of the 7th Regiment under the  Guangdong Provincial District carried out a joint military  maneuver code-named "Success 240," a contingency exercise aiming  at stamping out any political turmoil or political incidents  stirred up by Britain during Hong Kong's transitional period.  With the airborne support of a helicopter regiment under an air  unit of the ground force, the entire maneuver took only 200  minutes to complete. It turns out that Qian Qichen's boast that  "turbulence in Hong Kong can be put down" within four hours (240  minutes) is based on this latest military exercise. What  particularly should be mentioned is that the "240" in the  codename of the maneuver refers to the maneuver's predetermined  length of 240 minutes. Yet, the exercise went so smoothly that  it came to a successful end in only 200 minutes.    Many senior-ranking officials showed up and watched the  "Success 240" military maneuver, among whom were Lei Mingqiu,  deputy political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region and  commander of a group army, as well as officials from the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. The Guangzhou  Military Region held a summarization meeting on the second day  following the conclusion of the maneuver. At the meeting, Xie  Fei, member of the CPC Political Bureau, read out a message of  congratulations from the State Council on this "tremendously  successful military exercise."    It affords food for thought that the congratulatory message  was sent by the State Council, not by the CPC Central Military  Commission. Does this mean that the CPC's arrangements for  using military means to recover Hong Kong also are in the run-up?</p>

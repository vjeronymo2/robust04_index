			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: India fumes at US 'flammable' skirt ban The Indian government yesterday said it would seek a lifting of the US ban on the import of Indian rayon-cotton textile skirts, imposed because they were 'dangerously flammable'. Indian exporters have reacted with dismay to last week's decision by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to recall more than 250,000 skirts, in the biggest ever recall of clothing. India exported more than Rs1bn (Dollars 31.8m) worth of the skirts to the US last year, and no accidents have yet been reported. The Indian government yesterday told parliament it would convene a meeting of exporters this week in an effort to get the ban lifted. The meeting is not expected to consider ways of making the skirts less flammable. The commission claimed the skirts, which sell for between Dollars 6 and Dollars 80, 'burnt faster than newspaper'. However, Indian exporters describe the ban as 'inexplicable'. 'We cannot fathom why they have clamped down on only Indian rayon skirts when China, Korea and Hong Kong also supply the same fabrics,' says Ms Manju Dhingra, director of Orient Craft, a Delhi-based garment export house, which sells to leading fashion stores across the US, including Gap. Asked whether the skirts could be treated to become less flammable, she said: 'The basic element of the fabric cannot be changed.' US Customs last month held up a consignment of the skirts, objecting to their inclusion under the 'folklore' provision of a bilateral agreement with India, which allows for non-quota imports. US officials said the skirts did not conform to the traditional Indian 'ghagra' skirts, because most of them had elastic waistbands. However, they later accepted Indian arguments that the waistbands were a 'modern convenience' and the skirts were released without the imposition of quotas. Indian commerce ministry officials say the timing of the ban, so soon after the US Custom's objection, makes it difficult to believe that consumer safety is the only reason for the ban. 'This seems like an attempt to impose non-tariff barriers, with the US specially targeting India,' said an official. Textile importers and retailers in the US have also expressed dismay at the ban and are sceptical about whether skirts from other countries have also been tested.</p>

"We know there are two to four tanks and since the beginning  of January there have been two multiple rocket launchers  sighted," Vanasse, an intelligence officer, said in an interview  with AFP.    But he said that while Bosnian Moslem and Croat armies had  clearly not met the noon (1100 GMT) Monday deadline to withdraw  all heavy weapons from some 350 kilometres (210 miles) of front  lines, the ceasefire remained a success.    "We know they don't want war. The implementation of the  agreement was under their initiative.    "They've been fighting for a year and nothing's changed.  Both sides are losing," Vanasse said. The Moslem-Croat  fighting is in three main areas, two of them totally isolated  pockets held by the HVO.    Mortars and anti-aircraft guns were to be pulled back 10  kilometres (six miles) from front lines and tanks and artillery  20 kilometres (12 miles).    Weapons not withdrawn by the Croats in the enclaves were to  be placed under UNPROFOR control in five collection sites. The  Moslems have room to withdraw their weapons, Vanasse said. The  Moslems have requested 1,200 litres of fuel to move their guns,  UN press officer Captain Niels Otto Pedersen of Denmark said  Tuesday in Kislejak.    He said that on Sunday Croat forces had handed in 57 heavy  weapons in the Vitez pocket, mainly mortars but including some  multiple rocket launchers.    Captain Raymond Belanger, press officer for the Canadians in  Visoko, said it was clear the two sides had "not fixed a  realistic deadline." He said the same caution had to be applied  to the setting up of UN checkpoints to replace those of the  warring parties and guarantee free access on crucial roads.  [passage omitted]    The Croats have refused to take down their checkpoints at  some sites. Belanger said of one, only a few hundred metres  (yards) in front of a UNPROFOR site on the road from Kiseljak to  Visoko: "It's there. We leave it there. They let people  through.    "We're just trying to let things calm down."    Meanwhile, at the Kiseljak arms collection point, the  Canadian troops have two tanks with 50 mm guns deployed to  protect the former brick factory, now gutted and empty, that  houses the surrendered weapons.    Dube said the Croatians had wanted to leave two of their men  to watch over the weapons but this was refused. The  Sarajevo-style heavy arms withdrawal that began Monday for  warring Croats and Moslems provides that arms left with UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops are not to be recuperated.    The Canadians said they were ready to fight to keep anyone  from taking the weapons, which included a 14.5 mm machine gun,  two M-60 heavy machine guns, six 82 mm mortars, and three 120 mm  mortars.

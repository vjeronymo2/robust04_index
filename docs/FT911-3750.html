At a conference at Stratford-upon-Avon to mark Shakespeare's birth he deplored the shortage of nursery education, the low stay-on rate among 16-year-olds, excessive specialisation at sixth-form level and the collapse of the apprenticeship system. He also expressed astonishment at the absence of Shakespeare from some GCSE and A-level English courses.

The  simulator will improve the ability of the operators to control  the power station in case of a breakdown or an accident. The  simulator can also be used to test the effects of the plans to  transform the plant's operations.    The delivery, worth about 1 million Finnish markkas, is  financed by the Commerce and Industry Ministry and the Foreign  Ministry. The delivery has been made within the framework of  the safety improvement program for nuclear power stations in  Russia. The simulator, which will be shipped to Kola in April,  is scheduled to be operational in September.</p>

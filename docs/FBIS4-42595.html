			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis today expressed the  conviction that all the right conditions exist for the National  Council to reach a consensus regarding the future direction of  the Cyprus issue, in light of the Butrus-Ghali report. Speaking  after the meeting of the National Council this morning,  President Kliridhis said that the Greek Cypriot side should not  celebrate about the Butrus-Ghali report because a report is not  a solution of the Cyprus issue. However, he described the UN  secretary general's position -- that efforts to solve the Cyprus  issue have gone on for years but have not produced results  because the Turkish side does not have the political will -- as  very positive.    President Kliridhis said that during the National Council  meeting today, there was a very good discussion which will  continue Wednesday [8 June] after the political parties discuss  the whole issue in their respective committees. The president  said that during the meeting, he made suggestions to the parties  and then a discussion followed. He said that before we go to  Athens for discussions, we will decide what line we will follow,  but we will not announce any decisions that we make here. Asked  when the political leadership will go to Athens for talks, the  president said the trip would take place after the 12 June  elections for European Parliament. It should be noted that  immediately following the National Council meeting, the  president received Greek Ambassador Alexandros Sandhis, whom he  briefed about the Council's meeting.    The National Council meeting was attended by Ioannis Matsis  and Alekos Markidhis on behalf of the Democratic Rally [DISI],  Dhimitrios Khristofias and Andreas Khristou on behalf of AKEL  [Restorative Party of the Working People], Spiros Kiprianou and  Tasos Papadhopoulos on behalf of DIKO [Democratic Party], and  Vasos Lissaridhis and Takis Khatzidhimistriou on behalf of EDEK  [United Democratic Union of Cyprus]. The meeting was also  attended by House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos,  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, and Ioannis Kasoulidhis,  deputy minister to President Pandelis Kouros and government  spokesman.</p>

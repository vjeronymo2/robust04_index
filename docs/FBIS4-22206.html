			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Senior Lt. Yuriy Povkh, under the rubric "The </F> National Army": "Clipped Wings, or Why Have Innocent Young  Pilots Proved Guilty?"]    [Text] Breaking the silence of the frosty winter morning,  the silver-winged fighter planes thundered over the town. Its  residents, who have lately grown unaccustomed to regular  flights, watched in amazement as the ferociously elegant MIGs  performed steep 360-degree turns. A flight day was beginning.    This was a day out of the ordinary for the pilots of the  fighter regiment. For some, this meant the opportunity to rise  once again into the skies, feel themselves masters in the air,  see for themselves how obediently their fearsome military  machines were behaving -- these marvels of late  twentieth-century engineering. Yet, the usual bravura intonation  was lacking in the words "out of the ordinary": One could hear  undisguised bitterness and sadness in the voices of the pilots  when the talk turned to flying. Why? Because they compared the  flights they had just completed to offering a drop of water to  someone dying of thirst in the desert.    That is why the pilots took extreme care as they lifted  their  winged machines into the sky. Moreover, the weather that day did  not give them much joy: Dense snow that hid the horizon  alternated with brilliant sunshine. At times, this produced a  kind of "cocktail" -- a term used by the aviators to describe  difficult weather conditions -- over the airfield and the  designated flying zone.    Nonetheless, none of this prevented Col. V. Yavorskyy, the  commander of the regiment, and his subordinates from  demonstrating their excellent flying skills. Thus, Maj. Valeriy  Nedbay, the senior navigator, performed his assignment with  distinction by executing a difficult flight, hitting his target,  and landing with the help of stand-by controls. An equal degree  of proficiency was exhibited by Maj. Vyacheslav Kamchatnyy and  Maj. Mykola Onyshchenko, captains Andriy Lyashenko, Vyacheslav  Kovalenko, Vitaliy Bryzhadov, and others. In other words, they  showed that "there was still powder in the old powder horns."    Unfortunately, however, many pilots, who are regarded as  young, were not given the opportunity to rise into the skies.  All they could do was watch their colleagues from the ground.    Captain Viktor Ostapenko was one of those who remained on  the  ground. As it turned out, this had nothing to do with his age.  He has been an officer for five years. Under the earlier  standards, he would have been wearing the insignia of airman  second class for the last two years. But this has not happened.  This is not because of any failing on Viktor's part. Nor can we  talk of failings on the part of any of the other pilots; we need  only recall that they are often called peculiar because of their  fanatical devotion to the skies. It is the chronic scarcity of  fuel that has clipped the wings of Ostapenko and his colleagues,  (he is hardly alone).    As a result, the airman has meager flight experience. During  all of last year, he spent only four hours in the air. An absurd  figure, to say the least. But even this figure is misleading,  because Capt. Ostapenko spent the lion's share of this time on  routine testing of the level of his proficiency. Every fighter  pilot has to undergo such testing during the year. This is  hardly a matter of improving flying skills; it is a matter of  not losing the level of qualification already attained.    For the sake of comparison, let me say that a pilot in the  U.S. Air Force, who has flown fewer than 50 hours in any year,  is regarded as potentially accident-prone and is kept under  watchful observation by his command.    Obviously, it would be wrong to say that everything has been  allowed to drift in the regiment and that good bread is being  wasted on the pilots. Clearly, the command of the regiment does  not currently have the forces and means that are at the disposal  of the armies of developed countries. Consequently, the unit is  conducting systematic instruction closely linked with combat  training. The pilots are improving their theoretical knowledge  and tempering their bodies physically. (Most often, this  consists of cross-country races [kros], which, through the irony  of fate, are conducted on the landing strip). Instruction on the  shooting range is not at all rare these days. In a word, Col.  Yavorskyy is doing everything in his power to ensure that the  regiment assigned to him should remain a fighting unit.    But you must admit that the pilot's job is to fight in the  air and not on the ground. What will be the consequences of this  kind of "freeze" in the training of air personnel? I heard the  answer to this question from Lt. Col. Mykola Horyachov, senior  airman and inspector of the rayon directorate of the  anti-aircraft defense force [PPO]. Commenting on the existing  situation, he said:    "At present, there has been a virtual halt in the training  of  young pilots in the regiment for reasons that we all know. Small  wonder, therefore, that potentially promising officers, who have  served for five to seven years, are openly admitting that they  are afraid to fly. `If things go on this way, there will be more  takeoffs than landings,' say the pilots. And they are right.  Because the making of a professional pilot has always been  closely linked with the mentorship or more experienced pilots.  Unfortunately, we do not have this today. It is always easier to  destroy something than to build it. The `old men' will retire in  a few years, and the young lads will not even have an  opportunity to feel the safety of wings. Because the experience  amassed in bits and pieces by more than one generation of  fighter pilots will remain unutilized. There is absolutely no  doubt that all of this will have a negative impact on the future  fate of the aviation of Ukraine's anti-aircraft defense  component [PPO]."    A pessimistic prognosis, as you can see. One would very much  like to believe that Lt. Col. M. Horyachyy's words are not  prophetic. But reality dictates its own logic. A closer  examination reveals that the problem is not solely confined to  the fuel shortage. The technical condition of the airplanes  themselves is also of concern to everybody. First and foremost,  the condition of the so-  called "sparok", which are used to train pilots and to refresh  their skills. There are only two such planes left in the  regiment. A third has been sent for repairs to Russia, and, it  appears, that is the end of that trainer airplane. The regiment  cannot perform these intricate repairs on its own. Our eastern  neighbor also makes new spare parts and motors. How are these  training fighter planes, which require continual maintenance  because they are the most frequently used, to be kept in the  proper technical condition? In other words, even if fuel were to  become available, regular flights might not be possible.    It might be possible to partly maintain pilot training at  the  necessary level by using flight simulators. But this, too, is  not as simple as it sounds. These expensive machines were left  at the previous location where the regiment was stationed, and  now the lack of funds makes it difficult to transport them to  the regiment's new headquarters. They cannot be transported like  bricks, because they are delicate machines, filled with  electronics. Moreover, the need for repeated assembly will  inevitably have an adverse effect on the future use of these  flight simulators.    And so, like Mohammed who was forced to go to the mountain  when it failed to come to him, the pilots now travel hundreds of  kilometers to "fly" the flight simulators; moreover, spending  large sums of both the state's and their own money to do so.    But the flight simulators are not the most serious problem  to  have resulted from the redeployment of the regiment. The move  itself shook the whole system of the aviators' lives to its very  foundations, as they say. Specifically because of the  relocation, some dozen and a half pilots, most of whom held  command posts, have left the regiment. And those who remained  were adversely affected by this "experiment." It "ran over them"  like a steam roller. The equipment was transported, but  apparently no one gave much thought to the people. The following  statistics tell the whole sad story: 40 percent of the officers  and warrant officers have apartments at their former place of  service. And those who had no apartments to begin with have sent  their families to live with their parents. They themselves live  in barracks.    Recently, still another problem was added to all the  problems  that the regiment already has: Complete disarray in providing  the regiment with financial security. Not once have the aviators  received their pay on time at their new location. The delays  have lasted up to a month. On the day that I visited the  regiment, the delay had substantially exceeded even this period  of time. And there is no one to complain to that you have a  family and children, who need to eat every day. As to the  transfer pay that is to be paid when a serviceman is stationed  to a new location, close to 40 percent of the officers and  warrant officers simply never got it. By now, the galloping  inflation has "eaten up" this money.    Small wonder that in this difficult situation requests for  discharge from the Armed Forces have come down like autumn  leaves. Close to two dozen pilots (!) and thirty engineers and  technicians have expressed their desire to leave the army. The  pilots are not deterred even by the fact that they are unlikely  to find a job in their specialty in civilian life. Currently,  civil aviation's own pilots do not know what to do with  themselves. Moreover, it is no easy matter to retrain a fighter  ace into a civilian slow-speed cruiser [tykhokhid]. The  difference between these two kinds of flying equipment is  approximately as great as between a Formula-one racing car and  the Zaporozhets.    Nevertheless, those who have decided to leave the army are  resolved to do so at any price. Some are even prepared to give  up their pensions -- their rightful reward for service -- just  as long as they are allowed to leave. But the highest staff does  not act on the requests of these officers, and, in my view, the  given situation was very aptly described by one of those who  wants to leave:    "It is as if we had been sold into slavery -- they neither  allow us to serve nor to leave."    Incidentally, the overwhelming majority of officers who have  expressed a desire to be discharged into the reserves are airmen  first class -- the army's golden fund, as it were, the mentors  of the young. How can one help but recall the words of Lt. Col.  Horyachyy?    They say that the pilots who do not have the opportunity to  fly in their units will soon be sent to flight schools. There  they will once again pilot training airplanes. Undoubtedly, even  this desperate step could keep the situation under control for a  while. But for how long? Will this provide a fundamental  solution to the problem, considering that these schools are  themselves maintained on "starvation rations"?    It seems to me that the processes that are currently under  way in the aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are becoming  more and more reminiscent of a well-planned diversion, aimed at  depriving the country of its fighter aviation in the shortest  possible time. Judging by the statements of some people's  deputies, they still fail to understand (three years later) the  need for an army, regarding it as no more than an obedient  supplier of military equipment that can be sold to fill some of  the holes in the state budget.    To be sure, equipment can be replaced in time (although  this,  too, is very problematical), but what to do about the people who  when asked on the questionnaire "Will you serve in the Armed  Forces if the present situation remains unchanged?" unanimously  anwered "No!"    A pilot must fly. Always, the harshest punishment for a  pilot  was to be kept from flying. Today, through no fault of their  own, most flight personnel have been punished in just such a  way. And now the once most combat capable regiment, which has  glorious military traditions and a huge collective store of  experience, is being forced to give up one by one the high  positions it had won. Just a short time ago, its pilots were the  visiting card, as it were, of all our Armed Forces. There is  hardly a high-ranking guest to whom they did not demonstrate  their skills -- in the skies of Ukraine, as well as abroad!    Here is but one situation that I witnessed. I recall the  outburst of astonishment from those present in the fall of last  year at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the  liberation of Kiev, when the fighter pilots emerged out of a  thick fog and streaked like lightning above the steep banks of  the Dnieper. On that occasion, they did what few aviators are  able to do...    I firmly believe that pilots are born. Naturally, you can  teach a person to operate a complicated fighting machine and to  transport large shipments, but you cannot instill a love of the  sky in an individual. This requires an inner passion of the  soul, a vocation -- a strong amalgam of strength, courage, and  will. The celebrated French writer and professional pilot,  Antoine de St. Exupery, was a thousand times right when he wrote  that he would give all the gold in the world to experience just  one flight.    Apart from this purely spiritual aspect, there is also an  economic one. This, too, cannot be overlooked.    * * *    Have you ever considered how much the state spends to train  a  single pilot? It turns out that it spends the same amount as to  train twenty physicians! And all these funds come from the  pockets of taxpayers. That being the case, should we treat our  pilots in such a thoughtless manner and clip their wings?</p>

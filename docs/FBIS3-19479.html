			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federation of German Chambers of  Industry and Commerce [DIHT] has demanded further measures  against high unemployment from the partners to the wage  negotiations and the Federal Government. These should include  low wages for simple work, wage cuts, and changes in social and  labor market policy.    A resolution by the DIHT Executive Committee, entitled  "Policy for More Employment," which was published in Bonn on  Thursday [17 March], says: "In order to control the reduction  of employment, the parties to the wage contracts must also  facilitate wage cuts, which make it possible to continue  employment, even in the case of low utilization of production  capacities."    The partners to the wage negotiations should agree on lower  wages than so far for simple work. They must take into account  that after reunification, labor "is now available in  comparatively larger amounts than capital." This is an  important cause of unemployment, especially in eastern Germany.  Therefore, east German wages must be adjusted to the west  German level more slowly than in the past.    DIHT calls on the politicians to lower social security  contributions. Performances by unemployment and pension  insurance arising from reunification should be financed by the  state. Active labor market policy must be accessible for more  unemployed by reducing the expenditure for the individual.    Furthermore, DIHT demands that reprivatized companies in  eastern Germany should be exempt from high severance pay in case  of lay-offs. They should be treated like newly founded  companies, which are not obligated to implement social plans  during the first four years.</p>

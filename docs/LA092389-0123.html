			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ANDERSEN EVOKES GHOST OF TROUBADOURS  </P> <P> While the notion of what folk music is hasn't been quite the same since Bob  Dylan plugged in with a band, there is still much to be said for the voice of  the lone troubadour in that music, with a strong case being made by Dylan  contemporary Eric Andersen's solo set Thursday at Bogart's in Long Beach.  </P> <P> With songs drawn largely from his current "Ghosts Upon the Road" album,  Andersen -- working alone with a guitar and mouth harp -- was able to evoke the  solitary wanderer's acute vision and romanticism that had marked his best early  work. That was no mean task, considering the "Ghosts" album comes laden with a  Winnebago-load of overly portentous and dramatized arrangements.  </P> <P> But released by Andersen's direct stage delivery and evocative voice, "Listen  to the Rain" revealed a fragile beauty, while the down-scaled "Too Many Times  (I Will Try)" came across as an intensely personal anthem.  </P> <P> Announced as a "murder ballad" for people tired of love songs, the half-spoken  "Trouble in Paris" favorably recalled Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks" narrative  style. In a 13-song set that also included the mid-'60s' "Close the Door  Lightly When You Go" and "More Often Than Not" from 1972's "Blue River" album,  the only number which didn't connect was the 10-minute autobiographical  narrative "Ghosts on the Road." The recollection of his scuffling days lacked  the small details and insights needed to make the story breathe. JIM WASHBURN  </P></p>

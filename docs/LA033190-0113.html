			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BANKING PANEL OKS RYAN; HE ADMITS DRUG USE IN '70S  </P> <P> The Senate Banking Committee approved by one vote Friday the nomination of T.  Timothy Ryan Jr. to be the nation's top savings and loan regulator, and Ryan  disclosed hours later he had told government officials that he used marijuana  and cocaine in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Banking Committee members were aware of Ryan's statements to the FBI about his  past drug use, the Bush Administration said.  </P> <P> After the disclosures were made public, the Administration immediately  reaffirmed its strong support for Ryan to head the Office of Thrift  Supervision, which regulates the nation's beleaguered trillion-dollar S&amp;L  industry.  </P> <P> "Prior to my nomination, I disclosed both on my FBI forms and verbally to the  White House, Treasury and the FBI that early in the 1970s, I smoked marijuana  on a few occasions and tried cocaine once, perhaps twice," Ryan said in a  statement issued late Friday.  </P> <P> "I regret this mistake," Ryan said. "I do not regret having voluntarily  disclosed this information."  </P> <P> Ryan's statement was issued after NBC broadcast a story concerning his  admission of drug usage, citing unnamed senators as the source of the  information.  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who drafted Ryan for the thrift  regulator's job, issued a strong defense of his nominee.  </P> <P> "It's a sad day when information from confidential FBI reports is leaked,"  Brady said in a statement.  </P> <P> "Before Timothy Ryan's nomination, the White House and the Treasury Department  were made fully aware of the facts in the FBI report. Now a majority of the  Senate Banking Committee has recommended his confirmation in full knowledge of  these same facts."  </P> <P> The admission of drug use should not "deter the full Senate from acting  promptly and favorably on Mr. Ryan's recommendation," Brady said.  </P> <P> The public disclosure of Ryan's admissions will add a new burden to an already  tough struggle for confirmation by the full Senate. He faces serious questions  about his lack of financial experience.  </P> <P> After intense personal lobbying on his behalf by Brady, two Democrats joined  the committee's Republicans to prevail in an 11-to-10 vote for Ryan, a pension  lawyer with no experience in the finance business.  </P> <P> The full Senate will vote Wednesday on whether to confirm Ryan as director of  the Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision.  </P> <P> Ryan's victory was an unexpected rebuff to Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.),  the Banking Committee chairman. "In a nation of 240 million people" it is  "beyond comprehension" that the Administration cannot find someone more  qualified, Riegle said before the vote. Ryan, 44, a former Labor Department  official, was counsel to the 1988 Bush presidential campaign.  </P> <P> The White House wants Ryan installed before April 11, when a federal appeals  court will consider whether the Office of Thrift Supervision is operating  illegally because its first director, M. Danny Wall, was never confirmed by the  Senate. A lower court had blocked the agency from seizing an S&amp;L, citing  the lack of Senate confirmation.  </P> <P> The OTS has authorized the government seizure of more than 150 S&amp;Ls and has  set tough capital standards for thrift institutions in accordance with overhaul  legislation passed last year. The official confirmation of an OTS director  would remove legal uncertainties about the agency's authority.  </P> <P> Brady, who recruited Ryan for the agency job, hailed the committee vote. Ryan  "has the qualities to be a strong and effective leader of the Office of Thrift  Supervision and we urge the Senate to confirm him promptly," Brady said.  </P> <P> Administration officials acknowledge that Ryan is a novice in the complex field  of banking and finance, but say no better candidate is available. White House  Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Friday, "We want somebody who can handle  the law and is pretty tough and can go in there and straighten out the problems  of this industry.  </P> <P> "If this were an easy job, we would have people lining up at the door to get  it," Fitzwater said. "And believe me, there are not people lining up at the  door to get it."  </P> <P> Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah) said those experienced in finance would be deterred by  a rule that forbids a person holding such a federal post from taking a job in a  related industry for two years after leaving government.  </P> <P> "We may reach the point where Mother Teresa is the only one confirmed for a  government post or some Ralph Nader neuter who has never experienced anything,"  Garn said.  </P> <P> But Democrats were not persuaded and repeatedly complained during the debate  about Ryan's credentials.  </P> <P> The collapse of hundreds of S&amp;Ls into insolvency has produced "the most  costly financial debacle in American history," raising important questions  about the role of an independent thrift industry and federal deposit insurance,  but Ryan "does not seem to have given these issues any real thought," said Sen.  Alan Cranston (D-Calif.).  </P> <P> Ryan has "no experience and no knowledge of what he's getting into," said Sen.  Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.).  </P> <P> In his lobbying effort, Brady was persuasive with other Democrats. Sen. Terry  Sanford (D-N.C.) cast his vote for Ryan by proxy. Sen. Richard Shelby (D-Ala.)  spoke briefly during the committee session, praising Ryan as an "intelligent  generalist" with a "good educational background."  </P> <P> "I'm going to be thinking about it . . . it's probably a matter the whole  Senate should take up," Shelby said, remaining silent through the rest of the  discussion until the final vote, when he supported Ryan.  </P></p>

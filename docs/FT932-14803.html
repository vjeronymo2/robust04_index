			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Gillette raises earnings before account changes GILLETTE, the shaving and consumer products group, yesterday announced that after-tax profits rose to Dollars 142.3m in the first quarter of 1993 before accounting-related changes. This compared with Dollars 129.4m last year. After a Dollars 138.6m charge, mainly stemming from the new accounting treatment of post-retirement benefits, net profits in the first quarter of 1993 fell to Dollars 3.7m. Earnings per share, ahead of accounting changes, increased by 10.3 per cent, at 64 cents. Gillette also announced a 16.7 per cent increase in the company's dividend. Gillette's first-quarter sales showed little change year-on-year at Dollars 1.22bn. Operating profits were up by Dollars 262.4m, a 6 per cent rise. The company said the first quarter reflected strong blade and razor sales in the US and in Latin America, but continued weakness in Europe and expenses related to the launch of its new Gillette Series male toiletries line.</p>

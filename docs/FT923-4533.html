			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Tour operator ceases trading TOUR operator DHG (UK), which specialised in package holidays to Turkey, has ceased trading, the Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday. There are an estimated 3,000 people now abroad with the company and they will be able to complete their holidays before being flown back to Britain. The CAA said that people due to travel up to midnight tonight should report at the airport as arranged. Other customers with advance bookings would get a full refund. The company, based in Twickenham, London, traded as Flights Delight, South African Delight Holidays and Turkish Delight Holidays, and arranged seat-only flights to Mediterranean countries in addition to its Turkey operation, the CAA said. The authority has called in the Pounds 1.3m bond which was required for the company's air-travel organiser's licence authorising up to 56,516 passengers. The money will be used to fund the flights and refunds. The CAA advised customers to keep in touch with their travel agents. People who booked direct with the company can contact the CAA this morning on 071-832 5620. This afternoon and tomorrow they should ring 081-759 2195, and from Monday, 071-832 5620.</p>

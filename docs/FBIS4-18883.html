			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel considers  Hungary's and Poland's membership applications to be one of the  central issues during Germany's European Union [EU] presidency.  Following Hungary's recent application, Poland was the second of  the Central and East European countries to apply for membership  on Friday [8 April]. He will consider himself as advocate of  these applications since political and economic stability in the  Central and East European states is "in our very own interest,"  Kinkel said.</p>

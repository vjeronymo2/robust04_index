			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Bank of Kazakhstan held a news  conference devoted to the financial and credit situation in the  Republic. National Bank Chairman Daulet Sembayev and his  deputies answered numerous questions and said that "the banking  system has not yet been properly formed in our state." Founders  of commercial banks pursued only one aim--to ensure themselves  with credits--and did not take into consideration the needs of  their customers. In addition, they were short of money and  qualified personnel. The possibilities of such banks were  reduced to a minimum due to granting unjustified or wrongly  documented soft loans. A great deal of work is currently being  done in localities in order to increase the authorized funds of  loan granting banks and to reduce the interference of local  administrations in these banks' work. The board of the National  Bank came to a logically based conclusion: Decisions on  granting soft loans should be made primarily by the government  and banks, to this effect, should be given additional money.  The board of the National Bank will hold news conferences  regularly. This will enable the population to make an informed  choice and to participate in various financial events and not to  fall prey to dubious deals. The number of other transgressions  will also decrease.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Matej More: "Stabilization Only As a Model"] </F>   [Excerpts] Macedonia has started to carry out a  stabilization program that has already begun to show initial  results, although perhaps only temporary ones.    [Passage omitted] The social product (in material terms)  declined in 1991 and 1992 by 11 and 15 percent, respectively.  The recessionary trends also continued in 1993. After an almost  16-percent decline in industrial production in 1992, during the  first seven months of 1993 industrial production was 15.3  percent lower than during the same period in 1992 (most heavily  affected were the paper industry, with a 34 percent decline, the  footwear and leather industries, with 35.2 percent, and  metallurgy, with 24 percent). It is estimated that both the  social product and industrial production fell another 15 percent  in 1993. In 1992 the social product amounted to only $818 per  capita, and last year it probably declined to $657.    Other economic areas are also falling behind. Agriculture  has  been seriously affected (also because of the drought); it is  estimated that agricultural production was between 15 and 20  percent lower than during the previous year. Construction (in  terms of the number of hours worked) will reach a negative  growth rate during the first seven months of 10 percent  (compared to the same period the previous year), and in terms of  value, during all of last year it was even 30 percent lower than  one year earlier. Overnight stays in tourism grew somewhat, but  only at the expense of domestic guests (28.1 percent), whereas  the number of foreign overnight stays remained at the level of  the previous year, which was already more or less at an  extremely low level, since the war events in the former  Yugoslavia had already almost completely cut Macedonia off from  tourist foreign exchange income the year before. Investments in  capital assets are also continuing to decline. In 1993 their  share in the social product was 15 percent, whereas in 1990 it  was still 17.7 percent.    Unemployment is at the extremely high level of 27.4 percent,  and is still growing. More than 174,000 people are unemployed.  It is interesting that in recent years this figure almost did  not increase, in spite of large declines in production. Thus, in  the middle of 1992 there were 172,000 people unemployed, and at  the end of 1991, 166,900. In the first half of 1993 it grew by  1.5 percent. This indicates high latent unemployment, and also  the fact that people in Macedonia are trying in every possible  way to prevent a growth of unemployment and the resulting social  tension, even at the price of artificially maintaining  employment. This, of course, will only be possible for a while  longer. Sooner or later it will be necessary to restructure the  economy and also start to solve the problems in the real  economic sphere. Then we can expect a major growth in  unemployment.    Just like the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], until  recently Macedonia was also solving more and more of its  problems by printing money. This, on top of the significantly  reduced supply of the Macedonian market, and the significantly  increased transportation costs (because of the above-mentioned  transportation difficulties, etc.), was reflected last year in  1,691 percent inflation. The year 1993 began with a rapid growth  of prices (15.6 percent in January, as much as 32.5 percent in  February, and 8.5 percent in March). Later Macedonia started to  carry out a stabilization program that is already showing  initial results (although perhaps only temporary ones). The  National Bank is conducting a restrictive monetary policy;  selective loans have been eliminated; in May there was a  transition to a sliding exchange rate for the new Macedonian  currency, the denar. Inflation fell to 3.4 percent in April, and  in June there was even deflation (a 0.9 percent decline in  retail prices). The renewed jumps in July and August (7.7  percent and 9.5 percent), however, indicate that the  stabilization was rather short-lived. In fact, the external  shocks, along with the small size of the Macedonian economy and  the high correlation between changes in the exchange rate and  price growth, are rapidly stimulating a new inflationary spiral.  This is particularly true since Macedonia has a large budget  deficit (at the level of 6.5 percent of the social product in  1992 and even 10 percent this year), which can be rapidly  monetized, while there is a real danger of a new explosion of  wages, which already thwarted the stabilization program once  last year.    The situation in Macedonia, to be sure, is not as critical  as  in the FRY, but recently there has also been a severe decline in  the standard of living here (real wages in 1991 fell by 13  percent, and a year later by 33 percent). In spite of this, real  average wages are still between 250 and 300 German marks. The  situation, however, is also being alleviated by the very strong  and rapidly developing gray economy, which according to some  estimates is already reaching 25 percent of officially recorded  production.    Macedonian finances are in a rather weak position. Most of  the financial resources have been blocked at the National Bank  of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. Foreign exchange reserves are  approximately at the level of $130 million and are increasing  negligibly (by $1 million a week). With its slow recognition on  the international scene, the country has been virtually cut off  from international loans and aid. It was only during last year,  with loans from the Soros Foundation and the receipt of some  foreign aid (Macedonia was granted aid in the amount of $120  million by the United States and 30 million ECU by the EC as a  sort of compensation for the damages it suffered as a result of  the UN sanctions against Serbia) somewhat alleviated matters.  This was also helped somewhat by mobilization of the foreign  exchange funds received from the sale of socialized apartments.    On the other hand, it is estimated that the country has more  than $1 billion in foreign debt (as of 30 June 1993 Macedonia  owed $848 million for the principal and $349 million in  interest). The lack of sources of foreign exchange has put  Macedonia in a position in which it cannot meet its debt  obligations. In addition to the unpaid $128 million from last  year there is also another $165 million, which Macedonia will  likewise not be able to service without additional foreign  financial aid.    Macedonia has an already traditional foreign trade deficit,  which was previously mostly covered by the Yugoslav federation.  Ever since independence, foreign trade has been seriously  affected. Of the countries on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia, trade is taking place more or less normally only  with Slovenia, which is becoming an increasingly more important  trading partner for the Macedonians. Croatia has introduced  tariffs on imports of Macedonian goods; the FRY is under an  embargo anyway. There are also difficulties, primarily in regard  to transportation, in trade with the EC and East European  countries. According to the Macedonian government's data, the  trade deficit was otherwise significantly reduced in 1992 (to $7  million from $225 million in 1991 and $418 million in 1990), and  in 1993, after a surplus in the first quarter, the deficit is  expected to rise again to the level of $80 million. Furthermore,  there has also been an almost complete disappearance of foreign  exchange earnings from tourism, which previously brought $50  million a year; foreign exchange remittances from abroad are  also down to a third of those before the collapse of Yugoslavia.    The government has already taken some steps toward  strengthening market forces. Central subsidies have been  reduced, the independence of management has been strengthened,  likewise price controls have been mostly eliminated, and only a  small number of basic food and energy products are still under  state control. Recently a privatization law was also passed,  which introduces somewhat different models of privatization from  those we are familiar with from other East European countries  and Slovenia, and for which Macedonia has received very positive  evaluations by the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development. Its basic goal is to lead to a change in the  management of enterprises as soon as possible. Enterprises will  be sold in terms of a majority share (51 percent). The aim of  this is to find a new majority owner and manager immediately.  Small investors will only be able to buy the remaining shares  (49 percent), in smaller amounts. In contrast to other East  European models and also the Slovene one, an enterprise, instead  of having a multitude of dispersed owners, will already have a  majority owner and manager at the very beginning. At the same  time, this will also prevent someone with a smaller share (for  example 10 percent) from acquiring the exclusive right to manage  the enterprise. Privatization does not include distribution for  free, and instead workers have the right to a 30 percent  purchase at a discount of up to 70 percent.    The volume of Slovene-Macedonian trade has significantly  declined from 1990 to the present. In 1990 Macedonia, although  it was within Yugoslavia, was an extremely important trading  partner for Croatia, the present FRY, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Calculated on the basis of the average exchange rate, Slovene  exports to that country amounted to $586 million (on the basis  of statistics from the SDK [Public Auditing Service], which  monitored internal flows in Yugoslavia and are not completely  comparable with the foreign trade statistics, so these figures  should be taken with a grain of salt), which is more than we  exported to Austria in 1992, and approximately at the level of  exports to France. In 1990 and 1992 our sales to Macedonia  declined abruptly, but still reached about $382 million in 1991  and $133 million in 1992. It is interesting that trade with  Macedonia increased substantially in 1993. While trade with  other parts of the former Yugoslavia is still declining, the  volume of trade with Macedonia in the first nine months of last  year almost doubled in comparison with the same period in 1992.  Macedonia has thus broken through to seventh place among  Slovenia's most important trading partners. By September exports  to Macedonia ($145 million) had already exceeded the total for  1992, while during the same period in the previous year they  only amounted to $77 million. We traditionally have a surplus in  trade with Macedonia. In 1992 it was about $55 million, and last  year it was already $77 million.    Several factors contributed to the extraordinary increase in  trade. On one hand, it probably involves a gradual  normalization, after the drastic decline during the crisis years  of 1991 and 1992, to which the reestablished transportation  routes like the ferry link between Koper and Durres (and further  on to Skopje), but also the regular air link between Ljubljana  and Skopje, also contributed in their own way. On the other  hand, part of that trade probably also conceals some goods that  after arriving in Macedonia seek a further path into Serbia,  which is otherwise, in theory, isolated.    In terms of structure, most of our exports are  pharmaceutical  and cosmetic products, which last year represented a fifth of  all Slovene exports, and exports of paper, textile, and wood  products are also important. Significant items in imports are  copper, electrical cables, textile products and clothing, and of  course also Macedonian wine (this year import duties were  eliminated) and fruits and vegetables, etc. Both economies are  showing strong interest in increased cooperation. A large number  of Slovene enterprises are present in the Macedonian market in  the form of joint firms or representations (for example,  Gorenje, Peko, Kompas, Planika, Stol Kamnik, Libela, and so  forth). Among other things, the Macedonians are also interested  in establishing a bank in Slovenia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 May (EFE) -- A group of senators,  who were elected on 18 January 1993 in elections described as  fraudulent, are planning to appoint Judge Emile Jonassain,  former Supreme Court president, as temporary Haitian president  tomorrow, 11 May.    The legislators, led by Bernard Sansaricq, who leads one of  the Senate Board of Directors, made the decision today during a  session described as irregular. Nevertheless, Jonassain said he  is officially unaware of the decision.    Sansaricq sent Jonassain a copy of the decree adopted during  the session, which has been described as illegal. He also sent  a copy to General Raoul Cedras, Armed Forces chief, and Frantz  Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

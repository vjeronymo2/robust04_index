			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VICTIMS IN PLANE CRASH IDENTIFIED AS AGOURA HILLS FAMILY  </P> <P> An Agoura Hills couple and their 3-month-old daughter died in a single-engine  plane crash in northern San Diego County that went undiscovered for four days,  authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Richard Vander Heide, 40, his wife, Nancy, 38, and their daughter, Willow, died  Oct. 28 after their Piper Colt crashed in a canyon about a mile north of  Oceanside Airport, San Diego County Deputy Coroner George Dickason said.  </P> <P> According to a flight plan filed by Vander Heide, he planned to fly his  two-seat plane from Oceanside Airport to Camarillo Airport in Ventura County,  about an hour away. Federal Aviation Administration Inspector Larry Lehr said  Vander Heide's plane crashed and burst into flames shortly after taking off  about 10:45 p.m. in heavy fog. Camarillo Airport has no control tower.  </P> <P> The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board.  </P> <P> There were no witnesses to the crash and the burned wreckage went undiscovered  until a man hunting rattlesnakes in the canyon found it and told authorities.  </P> <P> Lehr said the family was not missed immediately because they had no close  relatives in Southern California. The family was identified Wednesday.  </P> <P> Relatives said Richard Vander Heide was a used-textbook distributor who aspired  to be a commercial pilot. His father, Ralph, said his son moved to California  from Michigan about five years ago because he thought he could fly more and  because he "loved the coast."  </P> <P> The couple was married about eight years. Nancy Vander Heide was a homemaker,  said Kathryn McDonald, Vander Heide's sister. Willow was their only child.  </P> <P> The couple, badly burned in the accident, was identified by dental records and  injuries sustained in another plane crash four years ago in Northern  California. Lehr said the couple required surgery after their Cessna ran out of  gas over Ukiah and crashed into a redwood tree in January, 1986.  </P> <P> San Diego County Deputy Coroner Max Murphy said there was no way to positively  identify the baby through medical or dental records, but that investigators  were certain the child was the couple's.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER SIMON: WORDS TO THE CLASS OF '90: 'DARE MIGHTY THINGS'  </P> <P> What I Would Have Told Those Wellesley Graduates If They Had Invited Me to  Their Commencement Instead of Barbara Bush:  </P> <P> It is tempting to tell the graduates gathered here today that you are now  embarking on the best years of your lives.  </P> <P> It is tempting, but it would be a lie.  </P> <P> The best years of your lives are over. I hope you enjoyed them. It is downhill  from here. These last 22 years have been a free ride for most of you: You've  gotten free food, free rent and free clothing. Now it is time to pay up. And  pay up you will.  </P> <P> Your first big problem is that you were born one generation too late.  </P> <P> You probably expect to have a life better than your parents had. But you won't.  In fact, you will have to pay for all your parents' mistakes.  </P> <P> I won't bore you with the details, but just for starters you are going to have  to pay off the savings and loan crisis.  </P> <P> The total is anybody's guess, but current estimates say it is going to cost  more than World War II. I am not kidding.  </P> <P> Your parents' generation could pay for it themselves, but, frankly, they'd  rather not. Instead of raising their own taxes, they'd rather borrow the money  and have your generation pay off the debt.  </P> <P> When I graduated from college in 1970, my generation had the feeling that a  seismic shift in American life was going on and, young as we were, we were  ready to take power.  </P> <P> I hope none of you feels that way today, because it's not going to happen. Your  parents are baby boomers, now in their 40s. This means they will rule America  at least for the next 25 years.  </P> <P> They will not only hold the top political jobs and head the major corporations,  but they will also make up a huge voting bloc in their retirement.  </P> <P> And they are going to stick it to you. One obvious example is Social Security:  You will have to work very long and very hard to pay the Social Security  benefits that your parents will receive.  </P> <P> Consider it a bill for the last 22 years of pizzas.  </P> <P> And don't expect your parents to be eager to turn the country over to you when  your turn comes. This is another change in American life. For the first time,  parents feel they are better educated than their children.  </P> <P> Ridiculous? Last year, a Gallup survey found that 25% of all college students  did not know in what year Columbus discovered America; 23% confused the  Communist Manifesto with the U.S. Constitution; 58% did not know Plato wrote  "The Republic" and less than half knew what the Magna Carta was.  </P> <P> The reason is not difficult to discern: About 38% of all colleges allow  students to graduate without taking a single history course and 45% require no  American or English literature.  </P> <P> A few days after the survey results were announced, I received a letter from a  student at the Baltimore campus of the University of Maryland. "First of all,"  she wrote, "as we are not required to take basic courses of history and  literature, why should we study something that we really don't enjoy or feel we  will never use in the future?"  </P> <P> Why indeed? Why do anything not required and possibly not enjoyable?  </P> <P> Why, even for a moment in a four-year experience, should you do something even  slightly daring? Why take a risk and do something that might be "useful" in  ways you never dreamed?  </P> <P> Why be more than mediocre when mediocrity is all that life demands of you?  </P> <P> Mediocrity will get you through. It always has. It got you through high school  and through college and, let me assure you, it will get you through the job  market.  </P> <P> In a few days, I will speak to a journalism class at George Washington  University (unless they dump me for Barbara Bush).  </P> <P> I will tell the students what I always tell them: They need not be more than  mediocre to get a job on a newspaper in America today.  </P> <P> Then I will also tell them that if they choose to be more than mediocre,  however, the rewards can be enormous. They can learn great things and do great  things and be as a shining star in the heavens.  </P> <P> They will laugh when I say this. They always do. But I will tell them they can  live today in the same spirit as the American pioneers lived: They can push  forward into the wilderness and into the unknown. They need not play it safe.  They need not be mediocre.  </P> <P> All commencement speeches have to quote somebody. So I will quote Theodore  Roosevelt. He was once a President of the United States. Reading about him may  no longer be required:  </P> <P> "Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though  checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither  enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows  not victory or defeat."  </P> <P> You graduates can go forth from this day to live in the gray twilight. Many of  you will. And for those who do, I have but one piece of advice: Learn to speak  Japanese.  </P> <P> But some of you will strive to solve our nation's problems in bold and creative  ways, to do better than your parents did, to show the world the promise that is  still America.  </P> <P> I can give you no guarantee of success.  </P> <P> You will have only the vast satisfaction of having dared a mighty thing.  </P> <P> Thank you.  </P> <P> Now, can anyone validate my parking?  </P></p>

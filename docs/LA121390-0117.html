			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUSTED BANGLADESH PRESIDENT AND WIFE ARRESTED  </P> <P> Police and soldiers arrested ousted Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammed  Ershad and his wife on Wednesday, and the government said he will face trial on  charges ranging from gold smuggling to plundering money from the nation.  </P> <P> Police launched a manhunt for 13 former ministers in Ershad's Cabinet after  acting President Shahabuddin Ahmed ordered their arrests, officials said.  </P> <P> "The former president has been kept in safe custody," Interior Ministry  Secretary Azimuddin Ahmed said.  </P> <P> Ershad, who seized power in a 1982 military coup, was arrested with his wife,  Roushan Ara, in Dhaka's military garrison area where he had been living since  his resignation last week.  </P> <P> The couple's two adopted children -- a son and a daughter -- and Ershad's  mother-in-law were allowed to accompany them into detention at the former  British high commissioner's residence in the Gulshan diplomatic enclave, Ahmed  said.  </P> <P> Officials said a special tribunal headed by a High Court judge will be set up  to try Ershad on charges ranging from gold smuggling to nepotism and plundering  money from the impoverished country.  </P> <P> As reports of the arrest spread, curious Dhaka residents lined roads to the  army headquarters. But the fallen general had been whisked away hours earlier.  </P> <P> "I wish I could see the shame-faced dictator," said one young man standing  outside the garrison.  </P> <P> "The bird has changed cages," said another.  </P> <P> The acting president ordered the arrest of 14 former Cabinet members, including  former Interior Minister Mahmudul Hasan, who was placed under house arrest  Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Others have been hiding but we have launched a manhunt to seize them," a  senior police officer said.  </P> <P> Ershad stepped down and transferred power to former Chief Justice Shahabuddin  after a violent campaign by 22 opposition parties.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DYEING LAWNS;  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA RESIDENTS TAKE UNUSUAL STEPS TO KEEP GRASS GREEN IN THE  DROUGHT-STRICKEN CITY  </P> <P> Dawn Clark's cat gingerly walked across the newly painted lawn, stopped  suddenly and looked bewildered. The cat sniffed tentatively, then bolted off  the grass and spent the next few minutes trying to lick flecks of paint off its  paws.  </P> <P> The lawn was recently mowed and as green as a billiard table. But while it  looked like a typical lawn, it didn't feel like one.  </P> <P> "Scratchy," Clark said, after taking off her shoes and walking across the  grass. "It doesn't feel quite right."  </P> <P> Santa Barbara residents have devised a number of innovative ways to keep their  yards green since the city, faced with a nearly 50% water shortage for the  year, declared a "drought emergency" in late February and became the first city  in Southern California to ban lawn watering.  </P> <P> Clark's cat had just experienced one: Several landscape companies now offer  lawn painting services and local nurseries are stocking their shelves with  green paint and pump sprayers.  </P> <P> "At least once a day someone comes in and buys green paint," said Martin Senn,  a manager at La Sumida Nursery. "After working hard all day, some people don't  want to come home to a brown lawn."  </P> <P> Other residents are spreading a variety of green substances over their brown  lawns, using shower water for irrigation or paying one of the numerous water  companies now in business in Santa Barbara to pull up to their houses in tanker  trucks and spray their yards with fire hoses.  </P> <P> These companies buy water from private wells, and don't use city water, so the  three "drought officers" from the Public Works Department can't stop them from  watering lawns. More than a dozen water companies have sprung up in Santa  Barbara since the lawn-watering ban began.  </P> <P> Because of the high price for the service -- up to $100 or more for each  watering -- the drought has created a class structure and divided the community  between those who can afford to buy water or dig wells on their estates, and  those whose lawns will die.  </P> <P> Companies that sell building material also have been doing a booming business.  It appears that many Santa Barbarans would rather cover their yards with a  variety of inorganic substances -- including green concrete -- than have a  blemished lawn.  </P> <P> Some residents have removed their lawns, and others have just covered them with  green gravel, stone or bark in the hopes that when the drought is over they can  revive the lawns, said Bob McNall, owner of McNall Building Material.  </P> <P> During the last few months a number of new businesses have opened that install  gray water systems -- water piped from sinks, showers and washing machines --  to landscaping. And as water bills rise dramatically, plumbers say, those who  once found used water offensive, suddenly have overcome their aversion.  </P> <P> In affluent communities such as Hope Ranch and Montecito -- also hit hard by  the drought -- an increasing number of residents are digging wells in their  back yards so they will be assured a constant source of water for landscaping.  Santa Barbara prohibits residents from drilling wells, but because it is legal  in many nearby cities drilling companies from throughout the county have been  flooded with calls.  </P> <P> "People are getting pretty paranoid . . . they're afraid that one of these days  they won't be able to get any water at all," said Jim Beane, manager of  Southern Deep Well Drilling. "At least with a well, you don't have to rely on  outside sources."  </P> <P> But some residents with wells have flaunted their abundance of water and  angered neighbors, who have been watching their lawns die. In Hope Ranch, Saudi  Arabian financier Essam Khashoggi created a stir by building on his large  estate a 1 1/4-acre pond -- with a dock for rowboats -- that he intends to fill  with well water. But the pond was built last year without all the required  permits, and county zoning officials will decide later in the month whether he  can fill it with water.  </P> <P> In Montecito, almost 100 people have received county permits to drill wells in  the last few months, including billionaire corporate raider Harold Simmons, who  ignored the worsening water shortage last year and drowned his 23-acre estate  in a continuous cascade of water. He was fined $25,000 in 1989 by the Montecito  Water District, which estimated he used enough water to supply an average  family of four for 28 years. And Simmons is based in Dallas and only spends  about 10 days a month at his Montecito estate.  </P> <P> The water district last year finally was forced to sharply restrict the flow of  water to his home. But since Simmons recently drilled a well on his property  and started receiving regular shipments of water from a tanker company, he has  been able to keep his estate lush and green -- legally.  </P> <P> Dawn Clark decided to hire a landscaper to paint her front lawn after she saw  the grass slowly deteriorate from green, to yellow, to a pale sienna. Her  husband, Duke, she said, is very meticulous and "likes a lawn to look like a  lawn."  </P> <P> Walter Barrows, a landscaper who painted the lawn, said he has received more  than 30 calls a week since he began advertising his grass-painting service. He  charges $45 to paint the average-size lawn with an "environmentally safe"  vegetable dye, which will stay green, he said, for about six weeks.  </P> <P> "This kind of thing is done all over the country with football fields, lawn  tennis courts and golf greens," Barrows said. "But this is only a very  temporary solution . . . we've got to have water within the next year or all  the landscaping and rare trees in this city are going to be in trouble."  </P> <P> While all of Southern California is suffering from a water shortage, the  drought in the Santa Barbara area may be the most severe. Unlike Los Angeles  and other areas in the state that have access to water from Northern California  and the Colorado River, Santa Barbara relies almost entirely on ground-water  supplies and rainwater. And Santa Barbara is entering its seventh year without  adequate rainfall.  </P> <P> City officials are considering a number of unusual proposals for emergency  supplies, including bringing in water by rail car from Colorado, importing  Canadian water by barge, building a large seawater desalination plant and using  an oil pipeline to transport water from Northern California.  </P> <P> The city hopes to have several alternative sources of water by the fall of  1991, said Pete Ramsdell, drought awareness manager for Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> And since the city increased water rates, banned lawn watering and prohibited  residents from using hoses on trees and shrubs -- only drip irrigation systems  and watering by hand-held buckets are allowed -- water use has decreased by  about 40%, Ramsdell said.  </P> <P> Some residents have chosen simply to pay premium prices for water rather than  conserve. Companies obtain their water supplies from private wells on ranches  throughout the county and then charge homeowners between $100 and $200 --  depending on the size of the house -- for a good soaking. Some residents and  local motels pay for the service every other week.  </P> <P> "For our business, it's worth the money to keep our lawns green and our  landscaping looking good," said Debbie Neer, manager of the Franciscan Inn.  "People come to Santa Barbara because it's so beautiful. . . . We can't afford  to lose that reputation."  </P> <P> John Price had a water truck that supplied the carwashes he owns, but people  who wanted their lawns irrigated stopped him so many times during the last two  months that he decided to go into the water business. He opened a company  called Channel Water Service and now has five trucks and 350 regular customers.  </P> <P> In addition to his tanker trucks, Price has 10 water trailers that he  temporarily connects directly to customers' sprinkler systems. He also paints  lawns, fills swimming pools and rents water storage tanks -- with pumps and  hoses -- that he refills regularly so customers can do the watering themselves.  </P> <P> "This wasn't something I planned to get into," said Price, as he watched one of  his employees hose down a front lawn. "But I figured if people wanted my water  so bad that they'd stop me on the street, it had to be a decent business."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  </P> <P> Once again, I am struck by how the debate over capital punishment (editorial,  "The Ultimate Outrage," June 27) misses, in my opinion, the most basic issue:  Can a truly civilized society legitimize and institutionalize the taking of  lives? Anyone's life.  </P> <P> Thus, it becomes irrelevant and specious to argue whether it is more or less  moral, or more or less appropriate, or is "cruel and unusual punishment" to  execute teen-agers rather than adults, or cop killers rather than  little-old-lady killers.  </P> <P> I have never heard an argument in favor of the death penalty which made sense.  The manifest content of most of the arguments seems a thin disguise covering  the underlying pursuit of vengeance, another example of outcome (ends) clouding  the issue of process (means).  </P> <P> Why, people ask, should we pay to house criminals over the course of their  lifetimes? Because society must be protected from those who would do it or its  component members harm, and killing people is not the way a civilized society  ought protect itself.  </P> <P> SANFORD M. REDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

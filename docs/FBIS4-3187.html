			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition  today moved closer to an agreement on the future government  policy and a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, a senior coalition official said.    At two rounds of talks, the coalition executives confirmed  that the ruling parties will stick to a policy accord reached  before the formation of Hosokawa's cabinet last August, said  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan  -- SDPJ] Secretary General Wataro Kubo.    They also shared the view that an early Diet (parliament)  approval of the overdue fiscal 1994 budget is the top priority  for the next government and that the new administration should  formulate a budget for fiscal 1995 featuring speedy improvement  in lifestyle, Kubo told a press conference.    He said the representatives from the ruling parties ironed  out differences on such key issues as political reform, economic  reform mainly through deregulation, Japan-U.S. relations and  administrative reform and decentralization.    They, however, failed to agree on two issues of immediate  concern -- Tokyo's stance toward the nuclear issue on the Korean  Peninsula and tax system reform.    If an accord is reached among them, the coalition parties  will nominate Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as their single  candidate for the premiership to succeed Hosokawa, who abruptly  decided on April 8 to resign over dubious financial matters and  a Diet business deadlock.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO DISCUSS PRESCHOOL CHANGES  </P> <P> The City Council will discuss changes in the city's preschool at its meeting  tonight.  </P> <P> Since city staff members decided to hire a nonprofit group to operate the Child  Development Program, the plan has drawn criticism from some parents.  </P> <P> They are upset that Mothers at Work plans to increase fees for the child care  program from $225 per month -- an average of $10.50 per day -- to $15 per day  when it takes over in March.  </P> <P> Parents were also upset because misunderstandings between Mothers at Work and  day care staff led to the resignation of several teachers.  </P> <P> City staff members met to iron out differences with a group of parents and  teachers Thursday, but some are not satisfied.  </P> <P> The council has several options. It could continue the current program, hire  the teachers as regular employees, implement the contract with Mothers at Work  or discontinue the program.  </P> <P> If the council approves the contract, which was signed in late December, it  could choose to offset the fee increases with a city subsidy until the summer,  when more spots are available in other child care programs. The staff estimates  that the subsidy for four months would cost the city $25,640.  </P> <P> City Manager William A. Huston has said that the city decided to hire an  outside group to run the program after independent contractors who teach there  approached the city and requested benefits, which they do not receive.  </P> <P> The benefits are expensive to provide, and even without them, the program has  already been losing about $2,400 a month during the last three months,  according to staff estimates.  </P> <P> Under the contract with Mothers at Work, the teachers will receive benefits.

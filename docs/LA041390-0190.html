			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES OFF SCANT 0.2% IN MARCH;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: EXCLUDING VOLATILE FOOD AND ENERGY, OTHER SECTORS POST INCREASES IN  MONTH.  </P> <P> Falling gasoline and vegetable prices pushed wholesale prices down 0.2% in  March, the first drop in seven months, the government said today.  </P> <P> The decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index followed no change  in February and a huge 1.8% gain in January.  </P> <P> A cold snap in December caused the January price spurt by killing Gulf Coast  vegetable crops and producing a fuel oil shortage.  </P> <P> Energy prices began their recovery in February and were joined by food prices  last month.  </P> <P> For the first quarter, overall prices advanced at an annual rate of 6.7%, well  above the 4.8% rise for all of last year. However, analysts expect wholesale  inflation for 1990 will be a little below last year's rate. They anticipate  continued declines for food and energy in the next few months.  </P> <P> The March report was better than expected. Most economists had predicted a  slight increase of 0.1% or 0.2%.  </P> <P> Food prices dropped 0.6% in March, the sharpest decline since June. Vegetables,  particularly tomatoes, celery and cabbage, declined 25.5%, the biggest drop on  record going back to 1967. However, that marked only a partial recovery from  gains of 23.3% in February and 58% in January.  </P> <P> Prices also fell for beef and veal, dairy products and coffee. They rose for  eggs, rice, pasta, pork, chickens, turkeys, fish, soft drinks and cooking oils.  </P> <P> Energy prices overall dropped 2.4% in March after a fall of 5% in February and  an increase of 13.6% in January.  </P> <P> Gasoline was down 2.8% and natural gas declined 2.5%. Fuel oil prices went up  10.6% but they had fallen 30.2% the month before.  </P> <P> Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a moderate 0.3% in  March after gains of 0.4% in February and 0.1% in January. Economists look to  these so-called core prices as a better indication of underlying inflationary  pressures.  </P> <P> Clothing prices for men and children fell, while the cost of women's clothing  rose. Passenger car prices, in the face of weak auto sales, declined 0.3% in  March after no change in February and a 0.7% fall in January.  </P> <P> The various changes put the index for all finished goods, one stop short of  retail, at 117.0 in March. That means a hypothetical selection of goods which  cost $100 in 1982 cost $117 last month, up from $112.10 a year earlier.  </P> <P> Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also eased in  March. Intermediate goods showed no change while crude goods fell 1.4%. An  example of the three processing stages would be bread for finished goods, flour  for intermediate and wheat for crude.  </P> <P> The moderate inflation report should please the Federal Reserve Board which has  been using relatively high interest rates to dampen demand and thus cool  inflation.  </P> <P> But analysts cautioned against reading too much into recent months' numbers,  which have been sent on a roller-coaster ride by the effect of the weather on  food and energy prices.  </P> <P> "The numbers in the next few months could give us a false sense of euphoria  just as the number in January gave us a false sense of gloom," said economist  Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.  </P></p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bank embarks on a gilt-edged campaign - A look at attempts to attract retail and institutional investment in UK government bonds Marketing is not among the Bank of England's traditional strengths, yet through force of circumstance it is having to learn this most central of commercial skills. With the government's return to a hefty Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, the Bank has been forced to sell large amounts of UK government bonds, otherwise known as gilts. And while the Bank has sometimes in the past been less than thrilled to hear criticisms of the gilt market, the need to shift large volumes of stock in recent years has prompted the central bank to listen rather more carefully to outsiders' suggestions as to how the market could be improved. 'We do have a marketing strategy for gilts which is directed towards encouraging long-term interest among the widest possible range of investors in gilts,' says Ian Plenderleith, the Bank's associate director with responsibility for markets. Hence the steady campaign to promote gilts to retail and institutional investors, both UK and foreign. The Bank's marketing is described by some bond analysts as distinctly low-key, and in sharp contrast to the flamboyant marketing campaign seen across the Channel. The French government recently coaxed FFr110bn (Pounds 12.5bn) out of private investors with the launch of the so-called Balladur Bond, using a glitzy and aggressive marketing campaign in the media. The bonds can be held in tax-free savings schemes and will be convertible into privatisation shares, making them very attractive to retail investors. The Bank has no intention of launching a comparable Major Bond or Eddie Bond (after the Bank's governor). Its own information campaign for private investors has been rather more subdued, consisting of a simple, clearly written booklet, provided free to the public. The Bank claims its booklet is doing well and that over 300,000 small investors have applied for their free copies. In addition, between 1,500 and 2,000 small investors now participate at the Bank's regular gilt auctions using the non-competitive bid system. Their total bids of around Pounds 10m are peanuts compared with the size of the auctions (often over Pounds 3bn) but the Bank appears pleased to have stimulated their interest. Gilts are free of capital gains tax already, but one suggestion to attract more retail investors (especially those in the top tax band) has been to make the income tax-free too, possibly by allowing gilts to be held in special schemes similar to PEPs and TESSAs. As the government is currently looking at ways of cutting spending, however, it seems unlikely that such a tax-break will be introduced - at least in the foreseeable future. For the big players in the gilt market - the institutional investors at home and overseas - the Bank has already won praise for the way in which it has resolutely improved the liquidity of particular benchmark issues. It regularly sounds out the close-knit fraternity of gilt-edged market-makers (GEMMs), and then sets out to meet those requests for improved liquidity. The Bank has also moved to a monthly auction calendar - a change forced upon it by the sheer volume of stock which needed to be sold - which means GEMMs have a better idea of when new supply is likely to hit the market. It has, however, proved harder for the GEMMs to coax the Bank into considering other improvements. For a couple of years, foreign investors have begged the Bank to let them settle gilt trades using the two international clearing systems, known as Cedel and Euroclear. At present, overseas investors have to settle gilts through the Bank's Central Gilts Office. While the service provided is very efficient, for the international investor who already holds and settles a wide range of European government bonds and eurobonds in Cedel or Euroclear it is far more convenient to have all their holdings handled under one roof. The Bank has at last relented on this front, and Cedel, Euroclear and the CGO are sorting out computer links and administration to make this possible. Despite the heavy burden of gilt issuance, the Bank has been successful at selling stock, to domestic institutions and to overseas investors. It has been helped by an economic climate conducive to investment in fixed income instruments: inflation has fallen, allowing interest rates to come down and prompting a rally in the gilt market which started in 1990. But the success is no reason for complacency: it is essential the Bank ensures that the products it sells, namely gilts, remain as attractive as possible to a range of investors, by being prepared to allow the evolution of the gilt market to continue.</p>

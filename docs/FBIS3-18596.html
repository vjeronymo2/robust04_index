			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- After contradictory reports on the  alleged involvement of German companies in the construction of a  poison gas factory in Libya, doubts have been voiced about the  Federal Government's information policy. On Deutschlandfunk  radio, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] security expert  Norbert Gansel said on Friday [4 March] that the Federal  Government held back information on German assistance for the  construction of a new poison gas plant in the city of Tarhuna,  some 60 km outside Tripoli. Gansel described the government's  information as contradictory and as playing down the matter.    Bernd Schmidbauer, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU],  the responsible official in the Chancellor's Office for the  coordination of the intelligence services, said last night on  ZDF's [Second German Television Channel] "Heute Journal"  program, that since the summer of 1992, the Federal Government  has "not just had vague indications, but very specific  indications" that a subterranean facility was being built in a  dry valley in Tarhuna. Various German companies had been warned  beforehand. The parliamentary state secretary in the Economics  Ministry, Reinhard Goehner (CDU), during question hour in  Parliament, initially only spoke of "vague indications" that the  government has had for about 1.5 years.    Schmidbauer, however, said that the plant was discovered and  "uncovered" in the summer of 1992. All "necessary steps" were  initiated in international cooperation to warn all "relevant  companies," the state minister stressed. There is "not a single  clue pointing to a German company that is furnishing this  facility," but information shows that the material that was used  for the construction of the tunnel is machinery that is  available anywhere in the world and "could also come from  Germany." Schmidbauer said that, for the first time, it was  then possible to identify the project before its completion.    On Friday, Schmidbauer rejected Gansel's accusations that  the  Federal Government did not tell Parliament the whole truth about  the "Tarhuna project." Herbert Schaefer, the author of the  report broadcast by ZDF, told DPA that Schmidbauer did "not tell  the truth" as far as the time at which the government found out  about the construction of the tunnel. The Federal Government  has known about the tunnel project and the probable involvement  of German companies since January 1989.    In February 1991, even more concrete indications about the  tunnel project became available. The Federal Export Office at  Eschborn near Frankfurt was "muzzled" by Bonn in 1991.  Officials there were not permitted to repeat in front of the  camera what they had said before, the author stated. On Friday,  the Federal Office said that the export to Libya of tunnel  drilling machines, tools, and equipment needed for the  construction of a tunnel have been banned since 7 April 1993.    A German company made headlines in the past in connection  with the construction of a poison gas plant in Libya. The  Imhausen-Chemie company of Lahr designed and constructed a  poison-gas plant worth 255 million German marks in the Libyan  city of Al-Rabitah. Under an identical name -- "Pharma 150" -- a  multipurpose chemical plant was built in Hong Kong, which served  as a camouflage address for the plans and goods that were in  reality shipped to Libya. The Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH,  which belongs to the then government-owned Salzgitter group, had  taken over the planning of all details and all engineering work  for the buildings of the project.</p>

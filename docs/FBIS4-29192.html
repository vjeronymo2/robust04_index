			<p>BFN     [Text] Niigata, June 15 KYODO -- International economic  sanctions against North Korea would result in mass starvation in  the country, a semiofficial research institute said Wednesday  [15 June].    The Economic Research Institute for North-East Asia,  partially financed by the Niigata prefectural and municipal  governments, argued that many of the 23 million North Koreans  will not be able to keep themselves alive if serious sanctions  take effect.    Tension over the country's suspected nuclear arms  development  program heightened further Monday when North Korea declared it  would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear safeguard watchdog.    The move drastically raised the prospect of early UN  sanctions against Pyongyang, or U.S.-coordinated sanctions along  with such countries as Japan and South Korea if there is no  agreement within the UN Security Council.    The institute, headed by economist Hisao Kanamori, said many  North Koreans are already living on the verge of hunger due to  an extreme dearth of food supplies.    Based on released statistics, the institute said food  supplies in the country, although on a steady decline, should  still be enough to provide a daily average of 2,000 kilocalories  per person, an amount sufficient for North Koreans to do  everyday work.    But the figure is deplorable for the ordinary citizen  because  of the priority given in food supplies to government bureaucrats  and military officials.    Also distorting the statistics is the fact that feed for  animals is included.    The institute has estimated that an average citizen receives  a meager 1,400 kilocalories of food every day, an amount that  makes active labor quite hard.    "We have made an estimation on the living conditions of  North  Koreans for which little information is available. We hope it  will serve as material for discussions on sanctions," said  Makoto Nobukuni, chief economist at the institute.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marc Paoloni report: "Public Infrastructure: The Twelve </F> Divided on Union Bonds"]    [Text] The European Union's image will not be tarnished by  a quarrel on the funding of major European transport and energy  networks. Finance ministers agreed yesterday in Luxembourg to  recommend to heads of state and government that they only  approve the list of 11 priority projects submitted to them.  They considered that in the current state of affairs, a  decision on a potential "Union Bond" issue could wait until the  next European Council meeting, scheduled for next December in  Essen. In other words, projects will go ahead and the Union  will worry later about additional funding if need be.    Perfectly aware that the dispute has been taking a turn for  the worse, the Twelve's finance ministers will no doubt be in a  hurry to confirm this approach next Monday [13 June]. Jacques  Delors himself seemed to have reconciled himself to the notion.  That is, he appeared to accept that studies on priority  projects should carry on without the European Council committing  itself right away to letting the Union turn to capital markets  in order to raise the funds needed to complement those already  earmarked. The latter are funds to come from national public  organizations, the EU budget, the European Investment Bank  (EIB), and private investors. The notion of a large-scale  "Union Bond" issue is therefore postponed indefinitely.    Of course, the quarrel appears rather preposterous in view  of  the actual amounts involved. These are rather trivial when  compared to the Twelve's initial ambitions. The white paper  approved at the Brussels Summit in December 1993 envisioned a  ECU220 billion investment from 1994 to 1999, including ECU120  billion to come from the Union. The problem was then to find  another ECU8 billion annually to complete funds earmarked in the  EU budget (ECU5 billion) and EIB loans (ECU7 billion) and hit  the yearly target of ECU20 billion.    Today, the amounts at stake are much lower. According to  estimates provided by European Commissioner Hennig  Christophersen, the mark has now been lowered to a mere ECU32  billion over six years for the various investments concerning  the 11 priority projects. With maximum contributions of ECU3.8  billion from the EU budget, ECU2 billion from the EIB (applying  its 15 percent maximum participation rule), about ECU11 billion  from member states, an estimated ECU1.6 from railway operators,  and ECU7 to ECU8 billion from private investors, the shortfall  would be a mere ECU4 to ECU5 billion by 2000. Nothing here that  warrants starting an EU crisis!    True, the European Commission wanted a precedent-setting  agreement in principle. However, one can understand most  capitals -- with Paris foremost among them -- when they consider  that this is no pressing issue. Especially since the EIB  indicated on Monday in Luxembourg that it would strive to  contribute more to the creation of the large networks under  consideration. "Provided that projects are viable and member  state determination and commitment are significant," EIB  President Brian Unwin said.    So, in the coming months, the projects selected so far will  be refined, with special attention being devoted to their cost  and the financial arrangements that could be devised. In such a  context, Brussels may try to show that such networks are  intended to nurture an economic synergy and therefore that the  self-funding approach is inappropriate: Instead, all regions  and industries likely to benefit from such networks should be  made to contribute more, one way or another.</p>

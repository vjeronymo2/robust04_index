			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOS COYOTES GREENS COULD BE MEAN FOR LPGA TOURNEY  </P> <P> When the LPGA returns to Orange County on Thursday after a two-year absence,  the players will find the golf course they are playing on in Buena Park, a city  known for its amusement park, anything but amusing.  </P> <P> The field in this inaugural 72-hole event, called the Nippon Travel -- MBS  Tournament, will be strong, but even the most skilled players on the tour will  be tested at Los Coyotes Country Club, a shapely patch of nature three miles up  the road from Knotts Berry Farm.  </P> <P> The course is longer than the normal LPGA layout, at 6,350 yards. Of the 33  courses on the tour's schedule, only 11 play longer than 6,300. But distance  alone is not what will make Los Coyotes a test.  </P> <P> Earlier in the summer a fungus got into the greens and ate away the roots of  grass, leaving bare patches scattered around the putting surfaces.  </P> <P> Even with the persistent efforts of the greenskeeper over the past few weeks to  rebuild and strengthen the weakened parts of the turf, some blotches remain,  although the greens are now reasonably playable, according to the LPGA's  on-site man, Jim Haley.  </P> <P> "They are a lot better than they were five weeks ago, and they should improve  each day," Haley said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The sensitive greens can't be cut as close as the LPGA normally prefers, so  they will be slower and perhaps less true.  </P> <P> This has a direct impact on the score card, since the correlation between play  on the greens and scoring is very high. The slowness of the greens will keep a  lot of scores bunched around the 68 to 71 range, players said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The players are coming off consecutive weeks in which they putted on very fast  greens.  </P> <P> "Last week's greens were so fast and so smooth, it's going to take a couple of  days to get a feel for these," Pat Bradley, one of the tournament favorites,  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "There are some rough spots and the ball is not going to roll true all the  time, I don't feel. As putts start to die at the hole, they will start to  jump."  </P> <P> Scores were high the last time an LPGA event was played at Los Coyotes. In  1971, when Kathy Whitworth, Sandra Haynie and Sandra Palmer were the leading  economic indicators of women's golf, Whitworth won the Suzuki Internationale  with a three-round score that was one-over par. There were only three over-par  victories in 21 tournaments that year.  </P> <P> Whitworth, who is entered in the tournament, is admittedly not playing well.  </P> <P> "I'll do well to make the (36-hole) cut," she said.  </P> <P> Whitworth says the long hitters will have an upper hand on this course. She  favors Bradley, Beth Daniel and Nancy Lopez.  </P> <P> Those players and others who can hit long will have a chance to reach two of  the par fives on the course in two shots, and those holes also will be the best  opportunities for birdies.  </P> <P> The course is in good condition overall, Whitworth said, but the conditions of  the greens will keep the scores from skyrocketing.  </P> <P> "The greens are bumpy, but that's just one of those things," she said. "They'll  get better each day we play, but they will still be slow."  </P> <P> The course conditions seem to favor Lopez, Whitworth says.  </P> <P> "Nancy is a very good slow-greens putter. She hits long enough and is a good  front-runner," Whitworth said.  </P> <P> That will be important this week. The finishing holes are not set up for any  come-from-behind heroics. A player with a two-shot lead coming into the final  four holes will be almost impossible to catch.  </P> <P> Lopez, this season's third-leading money winner and last year's player of the  year, has won twice this year, the LPGA Championship and the Atlantic City  tournament, and is seeking her fourth Vare Trophy, the award for the  lowest-scoring average. With a 70.77 average entering this tournament, Lopez  slipped into third place behind Daniel, but is close enough to remain highly  motivated. Lopez, who says her goal each year is to win the Vare trophy, was  not in top form in Seattle last week. She was on medication for a thyroid  condition and finished tied for 39th. And Lopez, whose repute for optimism is  well established, seemed to have no problems with the greens.  </P> <P> "I made more putts on these greens today than I did last week. The ball is  rolling real well," she said Tuesday. Bradley says of Lopez, "I think Nancy has  really been a much stronger factor when the greens haven't been to everyone  else's liking."  </P> <P> Daniel is the best player entering the tournament. She comes cruising in with  regained confidence, having won three tournaments in six weeks.  </P> <P> On Aug. 7, she won her first tournament in nearly four years. Since then she  has won two more, including the Safeco tournament last week in Seattle, giving  her 17 career victories.  </P> <P> Betsy King, the tour's leading-money winner, is not in the tournament. She is  taking some time off at home in Phoenix this week. She is assured of being this  season's leading-money winner, having earned $654,132. The record for earnings  in a year was $492,021, set by Bradley in 1986.  </P> <P> Daniel is second on the money list at $443,101 with three official tournaments  remaining.  </P> <P> Several other competitors have a good chance to win. Bradley, who has been  resurgent this season after overcoming a hyperthyroid problem last year, won  the Centinela tournament in April and has finished second four times.  </P> <P> Cindy Rarick finished second in Seattle last week and won in New Jersey in May.  Amy Alcott has won a tournament every year since 1975, except in 1987. Alcott  won in Boston two months ago and finished second in Seattle. For this  tournament, the front and back nines have been flip-flopped, primarily because  No. 9 makes a better finishing hole for television, and its contours and steep  hills make it superior for spectator viewing.  </P> <P> Although, there is no television for the tournament this year, the LPGA hopes  there will be in upcoming events. The tour has a three-year contract with Los  Coyotes.  </P> <P> The reversal of the nines poses another difficulty for the players. The four  finishing holes are all par fours, none are easy birdie holes, and two of them,  No. 15 (394 yards) and 17 (384 yards) are distinct bogey holes.  </P> <P> TOURNAMENT FACTS  </P> <P> Event: The $300,000 Nippon Travel-MBS golf tournament, Sept. 20-24.

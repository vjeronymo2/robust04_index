			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAST FORWARD;  </P> <P> CATCHING UP WITH 1990'S NEWSMAKERS;  </P> <P> MEDIA: SOME SAY THE PRACTICE OF 'OUTING' MAY HAVE BENEFITED GAY RIGHTS.  </P> <P> Outing, the phenomenon of exposing allegedly gay, lesbian or bisexual  personalities -- usually through the media -- continued to flourish throughout  1990, chiefly in the gay press and supermarket tabloids.  </P> <P> Increasing numbers of reportedly gay actors, politicians, entertainment moguls,  professional athletes and rock musicians were named in these publications, and  occasionally in mainstream media articles as well.  </P> <P> The debate over whether the practice is a form of psychological terrorism or a  powerful, political tool also raged on. But by year's end, some outing  proponents and opponents alike said the controversy may have benefited the gay  rights movement.  </P> <P> "Outing brought a whole new level of cutting-edge honesty. Anyone who is  helping (allegedly homosexual) celebrities hide is now seen as old-fashioned,"  says Michaelangelo Signorile, a gay gossip columnist for New York-based Outweek  magazine. Earlier this year, Signorile's reporting on the alleged bisexual  pursuits of the late Malcolm Forbes brought outing to the attention of many  mainstream media organizations.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we've seen the tabloids take to (outing) in a big way," adds  Signorile, whose publication continues to label or imply that various  personalities are gay or lesbian. "The mainstream media, I think, came down  against it for a lot of moral reasons, but in practice, I've seen them change.  For instance, I've seen a lot of the (mainstream) gossip columnists not writing  about (gay) people as if they're heterosexual any more. They're not sheltering  them. And I've seen more stars asked if they're gay in interviews in mainstream  publications."  </P> <P> Robert Bray, an outing opponent who serves as the public information director  for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, still believes in his  organization's position that gays and lesbians should not be forced from the  closet. But he says the outing debate had some positive side effects.  </P> <P> "The debate this caused in the mainstream media was unprecedented," he says.  "If there's a silver lining to the whole controversy, it's that the media  reported about the closet to a mass audience, that many gays live in shame in  the closet and how pervasive and contemptuous the stigma is.  </P> <P> "The real debate that outing caused was in newsrooms around the country as  reporters weighed the need for unbiased, accurate reporting with the sensitive  subject of a person's private life."  </P> <P> One gay-oriented publication, not particularly known for outing under its  previous editor, expects to become far more aggressive in reporting on  homosexuals in the closet. "We're in favor of outing," reports Richard  Rouilard, who earlier this year became the editor in chief of the Advocate, a  biweekly gay and lesbian magazine based in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We're working on outing stories on right-wing politicians and Vatican  officials. But they're investigative pieces. We don't do lists (of alleged gays  and lesbians). These stories are going to be properly sourced."  </P></p>

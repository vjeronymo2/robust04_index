			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE POLARIZES EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> I was shocked and then grimly satisfied to read the excerpt from the writing of  the Rev. Ellacuria. Clearly, he advocates and justifies terrorism, although not  at all creatively; the arguments he puts forth have been previously stated in  humanistic terms by philosophers, sociologists and psychologists for 200 or 300  years. And yet, he makes perfect sense.  </P> <P> Should not those who engage in, advocate, or support oppressive violence expect  to meet with violent punishment at the hands of those they have harmed? And  indeed, the Rev. Ellacuria, a supporter of the oppressive violence of  communism, which is even now being torn down by angry people all around the  world, has met with his own punishment. With his death, justice is served.  </P> <P> JIM NELSON  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

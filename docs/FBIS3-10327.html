			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "More and More Deportees"] </F>   [Text] There is no need for illegal immigrants who want to  go to the United States to arrive at that nation's border with  Mexico. It is in Mexican territory where those who are looking  for jobs in North America -- mostly Salvadorans -- fall into the  hands of the authorities to be subsequently sent to jail until  their deportation is processed.    If there is so much emphasis to travel to the United States  without meeting the requirements demanded by those authorities  it is because the [illegal alien] traffickers are successful  more than once. Of course this serves as propaganda for other  naive Salvadorans to start securing the $1,000 that it costs to  put them on the other side of the border for the Lord to help  them. According to reports we receive from Mexico, the  detentions continue. The Judicial Technical Police of that  nation have placed greater emphasis on looking for our people  and for those of other nations who do not have their documents  in order and who attempt, with practically nothing, to cross the  border. Once in North American territory they contact other  traffickers or relatives to start looking for a job so they can  stay. This of course is until immigration authorities uncover,  arrest, and deport them.    Previously, it was mostly the Central Americans who  struggled  to get on the other side, overcoming the risks in Mexican  territory. Now, however, the Asians have also joined in; these  are the ones who pay the traffickers the higher sums. The flow  of Salvadorans to Uncle Sam's land, however, does not decrease.  Once there, they hope to gains dollars to send back to their  relatives who they have left behind praying for them not to be  captured. The trip is not as easy as it seems. Reports from  those who have returned, deported from Mexico or the United  States, have declared that a trip without documents or with  false documents does not cost less than $1,000. The adventure  starts with obtaining that sum of money which does not include  food or the guarantee they will arrive in the "promised land."  Once they are deported they are back to their old activity.  Now they have to look for a job, not only to support their  family but also to pay back the loans they made to pay the  Salvadoran traffickers. It is said that these traffickers have  contact with the Mexican traffickers who in turn have contact  with those in the United States.    As we have pointed out in the past, the situation in the  United States is no longer the same; vigilance is now much  stricter. The conditions in some states, such as California, is  absolutely negative for illegal aliens. One must not forget a  deadline has been set for those who are already there in that  territory to meet the requirements demanded. That deadline is  approaching, and a large number of compatriots have  difficulties, created by the same North American authorities.  To speak clearly, The United States does not want immigrants,  and much less those who try to cross over flouting that nation's  laws.    Once again we bring up the issue to suggest to the  Salvadoran  immigration authorities to adopt an official campaign targeted  at those who want to live and work in the United States, in  order to send help to their families. They must be made to  understand that to fall in the hands of the traffickers is to  throw away their money, as they will be deported either from  Mexico or the United States. Once back they will be in worse  shape than before, including their health given the conditions  they had to face. If the immigration authorities try to explain  to the stubborn individuals who want to travel without the  required document by citing the very reports of the deportees,  it is possible that many will avoid that failure. They should  try to make their life here or travel to North America with the  required documents.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier-General Stanislaw Wozniak, chief </F> of the Department of Foreign Military Affairs at the Ministry of  National Defense, by Stanislaw Lukaszewski; place and date not  given: "The Army in International Politics"]    [Text] [Lukaszewski] You accompanied Defense Minister  Kolodziejczyk on his visit to France. One of the results of this  visit is that our Army is going to take part in joint maneuvers  with the French and German Armies. What tasks has the visit  imposed on your department?    [Wozniak] At their Paris meeting, the defense ministers of  Poland, France, and Germany opened a historic stage in the  history of mutual relations between these countries. The growth  of military bilateral contacts noted by the ministers provided a  basis to develop trilateral cooperation, including meetings of  experts and the holding of joint exercises. In this connection,  my department now has the task of preparing reports and analyses  that take into account the legislative peculiarities of each  country that is taking part in international exercises. The  ministers approved in principle the idea of a joint exercise  that would be held in France in the fall, with the participation  of French, German, and Polish troops. Polish observers would  also be present.    [Lukaszewski] In accordance with Polish security policy,  defense strategy, and foreign policy, this year's military  foreign policy is aimed at making Poland a member of European  security structures--i.e., the WEU [Western European Union], the  EU [European Union], and NATO. As the man responsible for  military foreign policy, what are the guiding principles of this  policy?    [Wozniak] The guiding principle is that European security is  indivisible, and Poland's efforts in this sphere are aimed at  creating an all-European security system that matches the  political-military challenges and expectations, as well as the  economic capabilities. We are trying to establish good political  and military relationships not only with our neighbors, but also  with other countries. We are concentrating on problems of  multilateral regional and all-European cooperation. We are  availing ourselves of existing international structures and  organizations in order to attain our objective.    [Lukaszewski] What do you think of the CSCE as the platform  of a new European security system?    [Wozniak] The CSCE is a major component of the process of  creating new European security structures. Our representatives  are taking part in CSCE talks on arms control and on confidence  and security-building measures. We are concerned that progress  be achieved in this sphere.    Within the CSCE, Poland has already been participating with  other countries in achieving stability in the region. Poland is  also taking part in extinguishing conflicts and supervising the  implementation of conventional arms-control agreements such as  the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the 1992 Vienna  document. We hope that the CSCE will lead to a cooperative  system of security in Europe.    However, the primary goal of Polish politics is full  membership in NATO. But, because this is going to take a long  time, Poland in the meantime is taking part in the work of the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which is also a major  component of the new European security.    [Lukaszewski] What are the other paths of military  cooperation for 1994?    [Wozniak] In our plans of cooperation with foreign defense  ministries and European military structures this year, we have  put greater emphasis on defense problems and the strengthening  of democratic control over the armed forces. We have also  suggested an exchange of experiences in planning and conducting  military exercises with the help of computer simulations. We  will also examine ways of guaranteeing good interpersonal  relationships and human rights inside the Army.    [Lukaszewski] What about relations with our neighbors?    [Wozniak] Agreements have been reached that will cause a  revival and an increase of good-neighborly relations. There will  be an increased flow of information, broader personal contacts,  and measures to increase the mutual trust between border zones.  For this purpose, there is going to be cooperation in military  training between neighboring military districts, as well as  between military units and training establishments on both sides  of the border.    [Lukaszewski] Have any details been established in this  sphere?    [Wozniak] Yes. We are going to send more of our soldiers to  be trained in foreign military academies. There are going to be  more exchange visits by officers on active duty and by military  lecturers. We are going to send soldiers on language training  and further training to the United States, Germany, France,  Great Britain, and Canada. We will try to send soldiers on  training sessions to Norway and Spain. In the Baltic Sea, we are  tightening contacts with the naval and coastal defense forces of  Germany and Denmark. We will continue to seek agreements with  the defense ministries of non-NATO countries on the basic paths  of military cooperation. Further ministerial agreements will be  concluded soon.    [Lukaszewski] Can you give any details?    [Wozniak] So far, we have concluded military cooperation  agreements with the defense ministries of 126 countries,  including all of our neighbors--i.e., Germany, Russia, Belarus,  Lithuania, Ukraine, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, as well as  Belgium, France, Latvia, Greece, the Netherlands, Hungary, and  Romania.    The extent and content of the cooperation varies from one  country to another. But, in every single case, there is a desire  to be open and to implement European agreements in security,  disarmament, and confidence-building measures.    [Lukaszewski] What do you think of the Partnership for  Peace?    [Wozniak] Poland has eagerly accepted the U.S. Partnership  for Peace initiative, viewing it as the first meaningful step in  the process of including the countries of Central and Eastern  Europe in the West European system of security. For us,  Partnership for Peace confirms NATO's commitment to the security  of all Europe.    [Lukaszewski] What is the situation with our eastern policy?    [Wozniak] Poland wants to open a new chapter in its eastern  policy. This need stems from the changes that are occurring on  the territory of the former USSR and from our relations with the  Russian Federation. In recent years, major progress has been  achieved in establishing equal relations with the new countries  on this territory. We consider our activity here as a major  contribution to the construction of all-European security.    [Lukaszewski] And what is your opinion of the  nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction?    [Wozniak] We attach particular importance to the  nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Poland was the  coauthor of the UN General Assembly resolution calling on all  member countries to sign the convention to ban chemical weapons  as soon as possible, which took place in Paris in January 1993.  The convention is a unique international agreement in the sphere  of disarmament. It imposes a complete and general ban on the use  of chemical weapons and introduces broad verification measures  at the same time. We hope this ban will be observed and extended  indefinitely.    [Lukaszewski] Right now, peace missions are an important  factor in stabilizing the military and political situation on a  global and regional scale. But let us discuss Polish involvement  in UN peace missions separately because that is also an  important and interesting topic.    [Wozniak] The involvement of Polish soldiers in  international  missions goes back almost 40 years. That provides another reason  for you to conduct an interview at the Department of Military  Foreign Affairs at the Defense Ministry. I suggest you talk to  one of my deputies about the participation of the Polish Armed  Forces in international activity in extinguishing conflicts and  restoring peace.</p>

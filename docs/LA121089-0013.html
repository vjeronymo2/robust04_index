			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: 'HEALER': JUST AN ECHO OF THE BOOGIEMASTER;  </P> <P> JOHN LEE HOOKER "THE HEALER." CHAMELEON **  </P> <P> Pairing the venerable boogiemaster with admirers ranging from Carlos Santana  and Bonnie Raitt to Los Lobos and Robert Cray was a great idea in theory . . .  but not in practice. The performances are lethargic, and the decision to drench  Hooker's voice in echo was a severe miscalculation. The title track sounds like  soft-focus Santana; "Think Twice Before You Go" is a limp attempt at one of Los  Lobos' roadhouse boogies; and Cray's contribution to "Baby Lee" is so anonymous  you can't even identify him. Only the collaborations with Bonnie Raitt and  George Thorogood squeeze out some sparks.  </P> <P>  Albums are rated on a scale of one (poor) to five (a classic) stars.DON  SNOWDEN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Feb 3 (ANTARA) -- Representatives of APEC  (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) member countries at a  meeting here Thursday agreed to elect the United States as  chairman of the forum's Budget and Administration Committee. The  meeting, officially called APEC Senior Officials Meeting  (APEC-SOM), is the first of a series of four scheduled to  prepare an APEC ministerial conference in November. With the  agreement reached at Thursday's meeting, the United States would  be the first country to lead the forum's Budget and  Administration Committee.    Saodah Syahruddin, an Indonesian delegate to the APEC-SOM,  said the United States was one of three nominees for the  position. The meeting eventually chose the United States in  view of its position as former chairman of APEC's first summit  meeting which took place in Seattle in November last year.    Mrs. Syahruddin, who is director of developing countries  economic cooperation at Indonesia's Foreign Ministry, explained  that the meeting also agreed to make it a convention that the  chairman of the last APEC summit meeting automatically becomes  chairman of APEC's Budget and Administration Committee for the  subsequent term.    This meant that after Indonesia acts as chairman of the  second APEC summit meeting scheduled for later this year, it  would thereafter also serve as the forum's Budget and  Administration Committee leader, she said. Mrs. Syahruddin said  delegates at Thursday's meeting earlier considered two other  ways of determining who would lead the Budget and Administration  Committee.    One proposal would have the chairman of a coming APEC summit  become the committee leader. The other would require the  chairman of the committee to be appointed based on an election  held annually. "But finally, all participants agreed that the  chairman of the last APEC summit meeting should serve as  chairman of the committee. This will be a permanent procedure,"  she said.    Mrs. Syahruddin also said APEC will not admit new members  during the next three years. The question of admitting new  members would be studied first, she added. Currently APEC has 17  members, namely the six countries grouped in ASEAN -- Brunei  Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,  Thailand, plus Australia, Canada, New Zealand, China, Taiwan,  Korea, Hongkong, Papua New Guinea, Japan, the United States, and  Mexico. At the Seattle summit, it was agreed that Chile would be  admitted as a member at the summit due to be convened in  Indonesia next November.    The APEC-SOM meeting opened last Wednesday and will end on  Friday. It is being attended by officials of its member  countries and three observers.</p>

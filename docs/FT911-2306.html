			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Bonn ready to play greater world role GERMANY IS prepared to assume greater international responsibilities, but is not seeking amendments in the United Nations Charter which would allow it become a permanent member of the Security Council, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, said yesterday. Mr Genscher, who had talks in London with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was clearly at pains to counter criticisms that Germany was reluctant to assume the international political responsibilities which its economic weight demanded. 'We do not want to renationalise our foreign policy,' Mr Genscher said, emphasising that Germany intended to exercise its international responsibilities through an integrated European Community. In the UN Security Council, it was perfectly possible for Germany fully to express its views to the two permanent members who were also members of the EC: Britain and France. He welcomed the fact that the British government under Mr Major was adopting a more constructive attitude towards the development of the EC. Stressing that a country's influence inside the Community was a reflection of how positive a stand it adopted towards the EC, Mr Genscher said: 'We see British policies are gaining weight and importance that further the interests of the Community.' He believed that an agreement on a common foreign and security policy would be reached this year.</p>

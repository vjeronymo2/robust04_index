			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (7): Fortune on the ebb tide - Recession has hit the Highlands THERE ARE depressing signs that the tide of good fortune which for the past few years has buoyed up the economy of many parts of the Highlands and Islands is ebbing. Most seriously, crisis affects the two offshore fabrication yards on the Moray Firth; a year ago, they were employing nearly 5,000 people between them. Now the total number of people employed at both yards is less than half that figure, and one of them may have no work at all by next March. The recession, which took so long to reach Scotland and its northern extremity, is now having a serious effect on the Highlands. Fewer tourists came last summer. Boarded up hotels, restaurants and bars dot the landscape, while manufacturers are suffering from the weakness of markets in the rest of Britain. As Mr Tony Mackay, an Inverness-based economist, says: 'Over the past 20 years the Highland economy has often done better than that of the UK and of Scotland as a whole. Now we are going to experience underperformance for five to ten years.' The 1980s were good for the Highlands. Although two big industrial plants, the aluminium smelter at Invergordon and a paper mill at Fort William, closed early in the decade, later economic development was more organic. The offshore steel fabrication yards were set up on the Moray Firth because they wanted to be there rather having to be coaxed to uneconomic locations. The same goes for the salmon farms established along the sealochs and inlets of the west coast, which created a few thousand jobs, revitalised some remote communities but dismayed conservationists and lovers of solitude. The Highland population was boosted by an influx of people from England and from other parts of Scotland - the co-called white settlers. They pushed up the populations of places such as the Isle of Skye, sometimes forcing house prices out of the range of the indigenous inhabitants but bringing more entrepreneurial spirit. Though emigration from places such as the Western Isles continued, the total population of the area covered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) - the development network which replaced the Highlands and Islands Development Board - rose from 364,000 to 370,000 between 1981 and 1991. Unemployment was 10.3 per cent in September, below the figure for Great Britain of 11.5 per cent but more than a percentage point worse than it had been a year before. Until recently the Inverness area was doing best: it has developed as the shopping and administrative centre for almost the whole area, and has been underpinned by the well-paid employment at the nearby fabrication yards. However, in July, the US-owned McDermott yard at Ardersier on the south side of the Moray Firth made 1,200 of its 2,500 employees redundant after an important order from Elf-Enterprise went elsewhere. Its current order book will be exhausted by February, and soon after that, if no new orders are gained, there will be be only a skeleton staff of about 100 keeping the facility operating on a care and maintenance basis. At Nigg on the north side, Highland Fabricators recently won an order from the Norwegian sector of the North Sea which will enable it to maintain at least 400 of its current workforce of 2,200 well into 1994. The crisis in the offshore market is still emphasised by the large number of idle drilling rigs tied up in the Cromarty Firth. The two yards face a dearth of orders as the current phase of offshore developments works its way out, and the market may not recover for three years. But employment at the yards has always fluctuated wildly; both rely, to a large extent, on sub-contractor labour rather than on large permanent workforces. 'It is very important that we retain both yards - they have given the economy critical mass,' says Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE. It is also considered important that as many families of the yards' employees stay living in the area, even if the menfolk go elsewhere for work. HIE has set up a task force to help workers increase their flexibility in the offshore industry by gaining extra qualifications. Down in the Cowal peninsula in the far south-west corner of the HIE area, about 800 jobs are being lost because of the closure, earlier this year, of the US Navy's Holy Loch submarine base. Argyll and the Isles Enterprise is working on a plan to assist the area by helping tourism and light manufacturing. Another gloomy spot is Caithness, where the Atomic Energy Authority's plant at Dounreay is gradually running down, threatening the economy of a sparsely populated area. It currently employs 1,600 people, making it easily the biggest employer, but the prototype fast reactor is scheduled to close in 1994, and the fuel reprocessing plant in 1997. By then employment, which was 2,100 in 1988, may have dropped to 530. Across the Highlands sheepfarming, the mainstay of crofters, faces changes because of the MacSharry reforms of the EC's Common Agriculture Policy. But Mr Donald MacRae at TSB Bank Scotland does not think the reforms are bad news for crofters, at least in the short term, because the proportion of the subsidy made up by the headage payment per sheep will increase and the total payment should also rise slightly. 'The problem is that there will be less incentive to improve quality, and the farmers are facing the political risk that the taxpayer will eventually say the whole thing is far too expensive,' he says. The next two years are likely to be bad for Highland fishermen as EC catch restrictions bite harder, but in the longer term the Highlands' share of Scottish white fish landings may increase as fishermen move west from the North Sea. The salmon farming industry is doing a little better, after several years of very low prices, now that Norway, the biggest producer, has cut overproduction, helping prices to rise. However, rationalisation is taking a toll: in September Marine Harvest, the leading producer, was sold by Unilever to MariFarms of the US (in which Hanson has a minority stake). The new owners are making 160 employees redundant, most of them in the Fort William area. At least these setbacks are hitting an economy more mature than it was a decade ago. There are more businesses and more accumulated wealth, and a better infrastructure of roads, bridges and digital telecommunications links. But it will be a severe test for the new HIE network of 10 local enterprise companies scattered over the region, with half the organisation's 300 staff, and devolved financial, social and environmental functions. Mr Robertson says HIE is giving people a power they never previously had, to change things in their areas. 'There couldn't be a better time for it to win its spurs.'</p>

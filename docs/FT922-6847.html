			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots MPs backing referendum delay debate INCENSED SCOTTISH Labour MPs delayed the start of the two-day Maastricht debate by some 25 minutes yesterday, deploying a series of parliamentary devices to stall scheduled Commons business. The ruses culminated with Mr John McAllion, the Labour MP for Dundee East, forcing a vote on the technical matter of whether 'strangers' or non-MPs should leave the chamber. The Tories were the 'strangers' referred to, he said, claiming the government was denying Scotland 'its democratic right' to a referendum on its constitutional future. The disruption followed a stormy session of Scottish questions in which the government ridiculed repeated Labour and Scottish National party demands for a referendum. To have such a referendum now on 'vague and unspecific philosophical concepts' would prove nothing and achieve nothing, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said, claiming the demands were being made only to cover the confusion over constitutional change in Labour ranks. Prior to the general election, he said, Labour opposed a referendum and planned to impose a Scottish assembly. The government was considering whether there were ways of 'continuing to make the government of Scotland responsive to Scotland's needs without undermining the unity of the UK.' Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said there was 'major room for improvement and a shift in the balance of power towards Scots running their own affairs within this country.' Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said that the real reason the government would not hold a referendum was that it had no confidence that its position would 'carry the day'. Mr Jim Sillars will stand down as deputy leader of the SNP when the the post comes up for re-election in September. Mr Sillars, who lost his seat at Glasgow Govan in the general election, said he intends to remain active in the party.</p>

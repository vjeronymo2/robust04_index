			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Refocused Sema displays 39% advance to Pounds 19.5m SEMA GROUP, the Anglo-French computing services company, yesterday reported a 39 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-December. The rise reflected the success of the group's strategy of focusing on systems integration with a high technical content. The profits figure increased to Pounds 19.5m compared with Pounds 14m, on turnover from continuing operations ahead 12.9 per cent from Pounds 369m to Pounds 416.7m. Operating profits increased to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 15.5m). Net interest income of Pounds 393,000 compared to net interest charges of Pounds 2.53m. Earnings per share improved by 20 per cent to 13.2p (11p) and the recommended final dividend is increased to 1.7p making a total distribution of 2.8p (2.6p) for the year. The results excluded a Pounds 15.4m net capital gain, recorded as an extraordinary profit, from the sale of Sofres, the group's market research company, in January last year. Proceeds of the sale were used to pay back borrowings and the group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 5m. Mr Pierre Bonelli, chief executive, described the results as a most satisfactory performance and by far the best since the 1988 merger which created Sema group. He added that the realignment of currencies last autumn produced only a minor benefit, adding Pounds 400,000 to pre-tax profits and 0.2p to earnings. Mr Bonelli said the improvement in profitability reflected a number of factors including the strong performance of Sema's facilities management business, which is now expanding from its UK base into Germany and Spain, coupled with the group's 'commanding strength' in specific systems integration markets. Systems integration turnover jumped 15.2 per cent to Pounds 318.2m while facilities management revenues improved 8.8 per cent to Pounds 59.7m. The BAeSEMA joint venture established in 1991 to bid for large defence contracts in Europe, the Far East and the Middle East made profits in its first full year, while Sema's losses in Germany were reduced following a restructuring. One of Sema's objectives this year is to develop its communications business following the formation last year of a joint venture with France Telecom in civil telecommunications.</p>

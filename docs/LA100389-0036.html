			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYLMAR COCAINE CENTER HANDLED ABOUT 60 TONS  </P> <P> Seven men arrested in connection with the seizure of 20 tons of cocaine at a  Sylmar warehouse were part of an operation that funneled at least 60 tons of  the drug into the country during the past two years, Los Angeles County Dist.  Atty. Ira Reiner said Monday.  </P> <P> Reiner told a news conference that his estimate stemmed from a preliminary  review of handwritten notes and ledgers confiscated at the Sylmar warehouse  along with $12.2 million in cash.  </P> <P> "They are about as large as you can get outside of Colombia," Reiner said of  the suspects. "We know that at a minimum, in the past two years 60 tons of  cocaine has passed through this warehouse."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Court Appearance  </P> <P> Reiner's allegations preceded a Los Angeles Municipal Court appearance by four  of the suspects arrested Friday in Los Angeles and surrounding cities.  </P> <P> James Romero McTague, 41, of El Paso; Mauricio Monroy, 36, of Mexico City; Hugo  Fernando Castillon, 32, of Sherman Oaks, and Miguel Gonzalez, 34, of Panorama  City, who has also said his name is Miguel Chavez and Ronald Reagan, were  denied bail. Their arraignment was scheduled for Friday.  </P> <P> Three other suspects were arrested Saturday night at Las Vegas' Flamingo Hilton  hotel -- Carlos Tapia Ponce, 68, allegedly a former Mexican customs officer;  his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, 34, and Carlos' brother, Hector Tapia, 66.  </P> <P> All appeared before a federal magistrate in Las Vegas on Monday, although  officials said they did not have enough evidence to charge Carlos' brother, who  was released.  </P> <P> Earlier Monday, Huntington Park police authorities took the extraordinary  precaution of moving the four suspects out of a jail facility in that community  to another undisclosed location, in part because of concerns for their safety.  </P> <P> "Their lives aren't worth a plugged nickel based on the doors they could open  up (for investigators)," Huntington Park Police Sgt. Hal Butler said. "It  really is the stuff movies are made of."  </P> <P> Butler said the move was prompted by "things . . . happening around the station  that weren't kosher, such as suspicious people inquiring about the prisoners  Sunday night."  </P> <P> Investigators said they have found additional evidence to show that the Los  Angeles operation was linked to warehouses in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez,  Mexico.  </P> <P> Huntington Park Police Detective D. J. Fitzgerald said phone numbers found  during the raids Thursday night at the Sylmar warehouse and at a penthouse  apartment in Sherman Oaks were traced to warehouses in El Paso and homes in  Juarez. The information was provided to Drug Enforcement Administration agents  in El Paso and Mexican authorities in Juarez and the locations were raided  Friday night.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald said the seized records and documents show no indications that the  drug network had any stop-off points on the transport route between El Paso and  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He said the documents have also provided leads in local spinoff investigations  of the drug network, but he declined to be more specific.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of information," he said. "It is going to take a long time to  go through it all."  </P> <P> In addition, DEA special agents discovered an underground storage facility  being excavated in one of six warehouses raided in east El Paso.  </P> <P> "DEA agents who tore down a false wall found a concealed room about the size of  a living room," said Ray Sepulveda, a DEA special agent in El Paso. "They had  been digging a pit down about 20 feet. It would have been a good hiding place  for narcotics."  </P> <P> At the news conference, Reiner said he planned to turn the Los Angeles cases  over to federal authorities in the hope that the suspects, if convicted, would  receive stiffer sentences under federal guidelines.  </P> <P> "Our reason for wanting this case prosecuted in federal court is a simple one,"  Reiner said. "The law in California provides for an absolute maximum sentence  in this case of about 21 years. But under the federal system and sentencing  guidelines, these individuals may well serve life in prison without the  possibility of parole."  </P> <P> Reacting to the Sylmar seizure, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) sought to compel  the Bush Administration to decide within a month whether Los Angeles should  qualify for emergency federal anti-drug assistance.  </P> <P> In letters to members of a House-Senate conference committee negotiating a  $9.4-billion drug funding bill, Cranston argued that the "shocking enormity" of  the 20-ton cocaine seizure in Los Angeles made clear that the nation "can no  longer afford additional delay."  </P></p>

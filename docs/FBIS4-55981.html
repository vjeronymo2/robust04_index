			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav </F> Klaus by Lucie Weissova; place and date not given -- live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Weissova] The NATO Council  last week agreed to offer Russia special status in the  Partnership for Peace program. You reacted to it in the daily  TELEGRAF by saying that it does not bother you at all because  Russia is still the second largest power with nuclear weapons  and that therefore it must be treated accordingly. Do you not  think that this position of Russia's poses a threat to small  states of central and Eastern Europe?    [Klaus] Russia is the position that it is. It is as big as  it is. It really possesses nuclear weapons. By its mere  existence it both poses and does not pose a threat to countries  around it and I think the way in which NATO, not us, has decided  to treat Russia is simply something that apparently corresponds  to the situation as it exists. The most essential thing for us  is that someone else has decided the matter rather than us, and  I believe strong words from us do not and indeed cannot lead  anywhere. We all have stressed that Partnership for Peace is an  individual program and that each country should contribute to  that program what it feels it can contribute -- how much and how  closely it wants to link itself to NATO. We also see that  individual countries are doing exactly this. [passage omitted]  Each country takes a different view and I think that strongly  worded statements from us aimed against Russia do not, in my  view, truly lead anywhere. [passage omitted]</p>

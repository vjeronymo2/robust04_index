			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Manual staff at ABB get 5% rise ABB Transportation, formerly Brel, the engineering subsidiary of British Rail, has agreed a 5 per cent wage rise for its 3,800 manual workers. In return they will give up the principle of last-in/first-out for those facing redundancy. ABB, part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri conglomerate, said it was keen to preserve its skill base and feared that if the last-in/first-out principle enshrined in the collective agreement was maintained it could lose key workers it had recently recruited. 'We will in future be able to select who is made redundant,' it said. The increase will improve the basic wages of skilled workers to Pounds 233.84 a week from Pounds 222.70. Last year ABB imposed a wage freeze on its employees who work at plants in York, Crewe and Derby. The agreement was concluded after prolonged negotiations with the RMT rail union and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering unions. It does not apply to the company's white-collar staff who have been offered a 2.5 per cent pay increase this year. In the event of future redundancies, ABB management is to introduce agreed criteria for deciding who should leave. This will cover length of service, qualifications and skills, flexibility, attendance, and the quantity and quality of work carried out. Since April 1989 when the company was privatised, its workforce has fallen from 9,000 to 5,000. Last year a third of ABB's 1,500 employees at the York plant were made redundant under the old method but, as a result, the company lost some workers it badly needed to retain. The company said last night that it had no plans for more redundancies at present.</p>

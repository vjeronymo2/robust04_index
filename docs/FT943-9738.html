			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firms against yen The dollar yesterday reached a six-week high against the yen, helped by sales of the Japanese currency against the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. Market conditions, however, were fairly quiet, and in the absence of any compelling fundamental factors to explain the dollar's relative strength, analysts were disinclined to attribute any significance to the move. The dollar finished in London at Y101.345, from Y100.48 on Friday, and at DM1.5811 from DM1.5822. In New York it ended at Y101.50 and DM1.5825. Traders reported that much of the yen selling was seen against the D-Mark, which closed at Y64.11 against the Japanese currency, from Y63.49 on Friday. Helped by this strength against the yen, the D-Mark was generally higher in Europe. It finished at FFr3.424 against the French franc from FFr3.422. The lira was fairly stable at L997.9/DM from L997.5, with the parliamentary recess having taken the spotlight off the fragile state of Italian politics. One currency to hold up fairly well against the D-Mark was sterling, which finished at DM2.4380, from DM2.4389 on Friday. It was also little changed against the dollar, at Dollars 1.542 from Dollars 1.5415. Analysts were slightly mystified by the firmer dollar, which seems as much to reflect a desire to sell the yen as to buy the US currency. Indeed, trade in D-Mark/yen was reported to have been at similar levels to that in dollar/yen. This suggests that the market was happy to sell yen, but preferred buying the D-Mark rather than dollars. The dollar has recovered from a post-war low of Y96.55 against the yen, and a 20-month low against the D-Mark of DM1.5165, on July 12. Mr Steve Barrow, international economist at Chemical Bank in London, said Y64 against the D-Mark was a significant technical level, and breach of it had probably prompted some short-covering by those who held long yen positions. Other factors supporting the dollar were the respite in US/Japan trade tensions, albeit temporary, and less foreign interest in the Nikkei share index. Figures from IDEA, the financial markets consultancy, show that foreigners were, during July, net sellers of the Nikkei index for the first time in 13 months. Previously, foreign purchases of the Nikkei had been a key reason for yen strength, but in July foreigners sold Dollars 2.17bn of Nikkei holdings. The dollar has recently tracked the performance of US bonds closely. For this reason, some analysts who are pessimistic about the short-term outlook for bonds hold a similar view about the dollar. This view holds that it will be difficult for bonds to stage much of a recovery this week given the release of consumer price and producer price figures and a Dollars 40bn quarterly Treasury refunding exercise. Following last week's strong employment report, sentiment has also shifted in favour of the Federal Reserve tightening policy, possibly at the August 16 FOMC meeting. Higher interest rates are normally associated with weaker bond markets. While US interest rate markets have been under pressure, the same, if not more so, can be said of Japan. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN - Amro in London, noted that over the past week the December Euroyen contract had fallen about 25 basis points to 97.35 from near to 97.6. This weakness in Japanese interest rate markets may account for some of the recent trend of Japanese funds to shift out of yen assets. One symptom of this trend will be the extent to which the Japanese participate in the quarterly refunding. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, commented: 'If Japanese institutions are on the threshold of recycling Japan's current account surplus, then dollar/yen could take off.' UK money markets seemed to have shaken off their recent concerns about higher UK rates. Three-month sterling LIBOR remained unchanged at 5 5/8 per cent, while sentiment in the futures market was more positive. Volumes were light, but the December short sterling contract finished six basis points higher at 93.40. The market was helped by subdued producer inflation data, with output prices unchanged in July, and input prices increasing at an annual 2.6 per cent. Net consumer lending, however, hit a record level in June. Analysts said this seemingly benign combination of firm economic growth without inflation problems was making UK assets more attractive and could explain why sterling had been stronger recently. In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 1.024bn assistance to the UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 1bn shortage. Overnight money traded between 2 per cent and 4 7/8 per cent. In Germany, call money rates started the week firmer at 5/5.10 per cent from 4.85/4.95 per cent on Friday. Rates are not expected to drop much before the weekly repo allocation tomorrow. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85 per cent.</p>

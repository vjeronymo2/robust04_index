			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / India's economic reforms defended A SENIOR Indian policy-maker said yesterday that economic reform was going ahead 'at a gradual pace', rejecting any suggestion that the government's programme was running out of steam. Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the economic affairs secretary and top economic adviser to Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said in an interview that there was no other way of carrying out change in a large democracy such as India. He added that the government's economic policies had been given a stamp of approval from an International Monetary Fund delegation, which last week completed a far-reaching review of India's economy and reforms. The IMF routinely carries out such reviews in countries that receive its support. The IMF is lending India money under a standby programme designed to help the country implement reforms to liberalise the economy after decades of heavy state intervention and regulation. India is also asking the IMF for an extended fund facility and an enhanced structural adjustment facility. These are longer-term loan programmes, which could start at the beginning of the 1993-1994 financial year next April and run for three years or more. The terms of these loans have yet to be settled. However, finance ministry officials believe that the Indian government and the IMF have broadly similar views of the likely economic targets. Mr Ahluwalia said that the next substantial announcements about the future economic reform programme would be contained in the budget for next year, which will be published in mid-February. The Indian economy has endured a sharp slowdown in growth since the reforms were introduced as the government has sought to bring inflation and difficulties with the balance of payments under control. Mr Ahluwalia predicted that signs of a strong recovery would emerge in the next few months, followed by more robust growth in the 1993-1994 financial year. By the mid-1990s the economy could be expanding at a rate of 6.5 per cent a year, compared with a likely 3.5 to 4 per cent in the current year.</p>

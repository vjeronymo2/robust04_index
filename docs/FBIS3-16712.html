There Has Been No Attempt"]    [Text] Yesterday rumors spread in Moscow about an attempt  on President Boris Yeltsin's life. KOMMERSANT-DAILY's  correspondent turned to the Russian Main Security Administration  [MSA] for comment. According to MSA information, what gave rise  to the rumor was the following event.    Andrey Oligov, press secretary of the president's Main  Security Administration, said that on 15 March security officers  at the president's summer house detained a 45-year-old local  resident who tried to sneak into the compound. The intruder  said that he entered the guarded territory because he was  looking for his missing son, a serviceman. This information was  checked and proved to be correct; afterward the detainee was  released.    According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY information, yesterday at 1530  Aleksandr Korzhakov, chief of the presidential security service,  called the Kremlin from Sochi to say that no other incidents  have occurred on the territory of the presidential residence in  Sochi.    The president continues his vacation in Sochi; his health is  normal.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Plea to help Russia stabilise currency RUSSIA faces a disastrous wage-price spiral unless the west helps it set up a stabilisation fund as soon as possible, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the country's deputy prime minister and finance minister, warns. In the Financial Times today, Mr Gaidar appeals to finance ministers from the G7 group of industrial countries 'to give some indication of what might be available and on what conditions' at their meeting in Long Island at the weekend. A Russian stabilisation fund, similar to that provided for Poland to back the zloty in January 1990, is needed 'to peg the rouble at a reasonable rate . . . and must be announced as soon as possible', Mr Gaidar says. Unless people can see that inflation is to be capped, 'wages will increase again and we shall then be into a disastrous wage-price spiral', he adds. The government of Russian president Boris Yeltsin 'is pledged to radical economic reform' and has already put in place many key elements of its strategy, Mr Gaidar says. These include the freeing of markets for most goods and services and foreign exchange. But, Mr Gaidar argues, stabilising prices 'is the most difficult thing'. It involves balancing the budget, effective limits on lending to enterprises and stabilisation of the rouble. This last objective requires foreign exchange, which Russia no longer has. Thus, he pleads: 'Foreign assistance is urgently required in preparing a fund to stabilise the rouble.'

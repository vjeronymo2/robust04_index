			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ANTIBIOTICS, BISMUTH FOUND HELPFUL IN TREATING ULCERS  </P> <P> Question: I have been taking Tagamet for a couple of years to treat ulcers.  Unfortunately, when I stop the medicine, my stomach soon starts to hurt and the  ulcer returns.  </P> <P> I remember reading something in your column about a new approach to curing  ulcers. My doctor is skeptical. But if there is really a way to cure ulcers,  I'd rather be done with them once and for all than take Tagamet for the rest of  my life.  </P> <P> Answer: A controversy over the causes of stomach ulcers has raged for several  years. Many gastroenterologists doubted that ulcers could be infectious.  However, a consensus is growing that many ulcers are due to bacteria.  </P> <P> At the World Congress of Gastroenterology, Helicobacter pylori was recognized  as a major cause of ulcers. Treating with acid-suppressing drugs such as  antacids, Tagamet (cimetidine), or Zantac (ranitidine) can help heal the  lesion, but ulcers return in up to 80% of patients when the medicine is  discontinued.  </P> <P> Treatment with antibiotics and bismuth (Pepto-Bismol) appears to be much more  successful in eliminating the bug. Dr. Barry Marshall of the University of  Virginia, quoted in Medical World News, says, "We think we have a cure for this  bacterium and thus a cure for ulcer disease in probably 90% of patients."  </P> <P> Q: I used to take tryptophan to help me get to sleep, especially when I  traveled. Ever since the ban I have had to rely on non-prescription drugs,  which I don't like as well.  </P> <P> I am getting fed up with the government. It seems like a long time has gone by,  and I haven't heard anything about the cause of the tryptophan problem. Will  tryptophan become available again?  </P> <P> A: We too are disappointed that the investigation of this problem has gone so  slowly. Over a year ago the first reports of a rare blood disease called  eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) came to the FDA's attention. People  developed fatigue, fever and severe muscle pain, and some died.  </P> <P> The outbreak was traced to l-tryptophan. Investigators have linked EMS to a new  manufacturing process developed by one Japanese supplier, and the company has  recently identified the component associated with the epidemic.  </P> <P> We don't understand why the FDA has not kept the public better informed about  its progress in this investigation. If contamination from a single source was  the cause of the problem, it seems reasonable to expect that eventually  tryptophan could be sold to the public again.  </P></p>

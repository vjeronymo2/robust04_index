			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Travel: Round and round the Algarve - John Hopkins and his golfing friend Jenkins spend a long weekend in Portugal YOU MIGHT not have met my friend Jenkins. Jenkins spent years attending to mundane matters so that he could throw himself at one of life's greater challenges: reducing his golf handicap to scratch. He is quite close now, playing off five at Sunningdale. He reminds me of the man who, when asked how much golf he was playing, replied: 'Only days.' When I invited him for a long weekend's golf on Portugal's Algarve coast, there was a nanosecond of indecision. He was competing in the Sunningdale foursomes. He is always playing in something. 'I'd love to,' he said. 'When can we go?' We were to stay at the Quinta do Lago hotel and play golf on Quinta's A, B, C and D courses and at Vila Sol. Was it a feasible venue for a long weekend's golf or not? First day. The sun on our backs felt good as we piled the car high with clubs and drove slowly out of Faro airport. Jenkins rubbed his hands in anticipation of the golf we were going to play. 'The turf will be like velvet, the greens so fast and true I will not have to cock my wrists and do a full pivot,' he said. And then he gave a little whimper of excitement. When we checked in at the hotel, a receptionist smiled and wished me a happy birthday. Waiting for me in my room was a birthday cake. I rang to book a massage and as we concluded the conversation the masseuse said, with a tinkling laugh: 'Happy birthday, Mr Hopkins.' I wondered whether there was anyone in Portugal who did not know it was my birthday. My room overlooked a wildlife sanctuary and a sandy beach beyond. I rang Jenkins and suggested an exploratory walk. He was shocked. 'I thought we would play nine holes before supper.' The hotel receptionists found a tee-time for us and within half-an-hour we were battling against a strong, biting wind. Second day. Vila Sol, a few miles up the road, had staged the Portuguese Open the week before our visit and we were able to play the course from the same tees. The driving range was one of the best I have seen in Europe with regular yardage markers, firm turf from which to hit and good balls, far superior to the pawky range and mangy balls at Quinta. Though it only covers 100 of the available 300 acres, the Vila Sol course is tight and it will be much tighter when the 240 villa homes and 310 apartments are sold. It will then be reminiscent of some of the golf development in Spain, and I can't say worse than that. Too tight, I thought to myself on the second hole as I retrieved my ball from plot D6-3 on the right of the fairway. Third day. At 6.30am it is dark and cold, even on the Algarve in late March. Domingos da Silva, the managing director of Quinta, was wearing only shorts. He knew it would warm up. Soon the temperature was a comfortable 65' or so. Da Silva was accompanied by Stuart Woodman, director of golf at Trafalgar House's Vilar do Golf resort on Quinta. Da Silva, an ebullient Portuguese, took up golf only recently. He had a hockey player's short backswing and something approaching John Daly's power. He talked and walked fast and swung even faster, as though he resented having to be silent for the few seconds it took him to hit the ball. Sometimes he talked throughout his swing. 'The first time I played with Domingos he hit a three-iron further than I've ever seen,' said Woodman, a former touring pro. 'But he lacks a little in finesse. On another occasion he hit a huge drive to within 30 yards of the green, and when I came upon him he was about to play his second shot with his driver as well. 'You can't use your driver, Domingos' I said. 'Why not?' he replied. 'It worked so well for the last shot I thought I'd use it again'.' After our round we sat in the sun and sipped our beer, dreamily looking at some of the trees that make up the biggest collection of umbrella pines in the world. The faces around us were bronzed and smiling. The language was predominantly English. Fourth and fifth days. Another early start. It was barely light when we hit our first drives on the two other nines at Quinta that we had not yet played. After 99 holes in four days, my hands were blistered and my golf seemed to be getting worse. But Jenkins was in his element. 'I must say that if I had to play this course for the rest of my life I would not mind,' he said. At a time when so many new golf courses are just too hard for average golfers, it was refreshing to be able to cope with Quinta's four nine-hole lay-outs. Not every par 4 required a long iron or even a wood for a second shot. There was time on the flight home to assess the merits of Quinta do Lago as a venue for a weekend's golf. It has much to commend it over many places nearer Britain, not least the proximity of the hotel to the airport (20 minutes). Overall, my journey was less than six hours door-to-door (I live in north London). Furthermore, the flights work conveniently: it is possible to play golf on arriving at the hotel, and before departing. All this - plus guaranteed sunshine. John Hopkins flew c/o British Airways and was a guest of the Quinta do Lago hotel. Five and eight-day holidays inclusive of accommodation, breakfast and evening meals, guaranteed tee times and green fees (18 holes each day) at Quinta do Lago, Vila Sol or Vale do Lobo golf courses are available from approximately Pounds 335 and Pounds 605 respectively per person. Also included are transfers to Quinta do Lago golf course and one hour of tennis. Further information and reservations from Orient-Express Hotels in London, tel: 071-928-6000.</p>

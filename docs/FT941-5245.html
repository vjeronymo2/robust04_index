			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Malaysia aid probe will focus on earlier decisions MPs probing the UK's offer of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam project will increasingly focus their investigations on decisions taken before the signing of a protocol in March 1988 which linked arms and aid. In recent weeks ministers have admitted that the protocol, which was signed by Lord Younger, then defence secretary, contained an 'entanglement' between the sale of Pounds 1.3bn of defence equipment to Malaysia and an offer of about Pounds 200m in aid. Both the prime minister and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, have repeatedly said that this link was 'disentangled' in correspondence between the Malaysian and British authorities in June and August 1988. But members of the foreign affairs committee investigating Britain's decision to agree to the project will ask Lord Younger today why he felt he was able to give any assurance on aid to the Malaysians in the first place. They will want to know whether the Overseas Development Administration had been involved in the original offer of aid in the March 1988 protocol or whether the entire deal had been approved under the auspices of Baroness Thatcher, the then prime minister. One prominent member of the committee said yesterday: 'It looks to me like an independent foreign policy was being run from Number 10 Downing Street.' Mr John Major yesterday reiterated that ministers had acted properly in offering the aid package to Malaysia in parallel with the defence deal. He said that efforts to 'disentangle' the two packages after they had been linked showed that the government of the day was one 'with high standards not low standards'. However Mr Geoffrey Bindman, a senior partner of Bindman &amp; Partners and a well-known constitutional lawyer, said evidence already put before MPs established an 'overwhelming probability' that, in deciding to authorise the grant of aid for the dam, Mr Douglas Hurd had 'acted ultra vires (beyond his authority) and therefore unlawfully'. His legal advice is contained in a five-page document prepared for the World Development Movement, the pressure group that has been lobbying Parliament over the affair. Mr Bindman says Mr Hurd has personal responsibility for the 1980 Overseas Act which covers the provision of aid. He says that evidence before the Commons points 'very strongly' to the conclusion that the government may have breached the act.</p>

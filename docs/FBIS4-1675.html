			<p>BFN     [Text] Xiamen, April 3 (XINHUA) -- The delta of southern  Fujian has become the largest manufacturing center of blue jeans  in China.    From the streets to garment shops, in the post offices and  on  goods trains, blue jeans dot the landscape all year round in the  Xiamen-Quanzhou-Hangzhou delta.    The industry took off after blue jeans gained instant  popularity when they were introduced to the area from Hong Kong  and Taiwan in the 1980s.    The past decade witnessed garment factories "spring up like  bamboo shoots after spring rain". No-one can tell the exact  number of these factories and the amount of their production  except that truck-load upon truck-load of the clothes are being  transported to other parts of China daily.    Many big producers have set up special counters in  department  stores in large cities. Some have even made inroads in other  countries' markets.    In the midst of tough competition, manufacturers are  upgrading equipment and turning out new designs at an  increasingly faster rate.    As a local factory director puts it: "Only when you lead the  trend can you survive."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgian Deputy Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili  told Interfax Sunday that as the peacekeeping operation was  getting underway, Georgian guerilla units were being withdrawn  from the Abkhazian bank of the Inguri River, in particular the  Kodor canyon and the Gali, Ochamchira and Sukhumi districts.    June 26 is the day when the operation officially started in  the Georgian-Abkhazian war zone. Russian paratrooper and  motorized infantry units, trained for peacekeeping operations,  are taking positions on both banks of the Inguri. Mine clearing  has started and a bridge on the river is being repaired which  will hopefully enable Georgian refugees to return to their home  in Abkhazia.    Nadareishvili said that nearly 30,000 refugees had returned  to the Gali District. The local authorities made jobs, bread  and sugar available to them. Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of  the Abkhazian parliament who visited the area three days ago and  talked to its residents, did not rule out the possibility of  setting up local government made up of Georgians.    Nadareishvili admitted that the return of refugees to the  Gali District would probably take 12 to 18 months.    He said that Georgian could hardly be able to maintain its  territorial integrity as long as the Abkhazians dictate their  own terms.</p>

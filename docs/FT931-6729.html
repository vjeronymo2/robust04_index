			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / The Long View: Chemical reactions SO ICI has decided to tear itself in twain lest the bell should toll for the one-time bellwether. Its decision to recreate itself as Zeneca is a clear indication that the British economy no longer determines the shape of the stock market, but rather the other way around. I have referred before to the curious fact that the UK equity market has consistently outperformed many overseas markets in spite of the poor showing of the British economy. It happened again last year when the total return on UK equities was 20.6 per cent against 16.4 per cent on the World ex-UK Index. Over the past decade the average UK annual return has been 18.8 per cent compared with 15.6 per cent overseas. Yet economic growth in Britain has averaged only 2.3 per cent a year over this period compared with 2.7 per cent in Germany and the US and 4.1 per cent in Japan. Industrial production has trailed still more badly in the UK. The share price action of ICI, of course, corresponds more closely to this dismal industrial picture. The UK stock market has been lifted by certain service sectors and by the monopoly utilities privatised at giveaway prices in the past ten years: these account for 11 per cent of the market's value and nearly 20 per cent of the underlying profits. Elsewhere, about half the profits of UK-listed companies are earned overseas. The poor old British economy has less and less relevance. The share price action has generally been good, but tension between British companies and their mainly institutional shareholders is regularly apparent. The 1980s takeover boom and the subsequent corporate governance debate were symptoms of that. So long as the shareholders are fed with a regular stream of dividends, however, there is little trouble. Between 1982 and 1992 capital investment by industrial and commercial companies grew 2.8 times (in nominal terms) but dividends increased twice as much. During the past two years of recession dividends have climbed 20 per cent while investment has been cut back by 13 per cent. There can be logic in this payment in adversity. Resources that cannot be invested profitably should be returned to shareholders. The shareholder's interest can be identified with national interest so long as the rest of the world is playing the same game. If not, the efficient stock market may operate as a doomsday machine for the destruction of domestic industry. High returns may only be achieved at a price. The aloofness of the British governing classes and the City of London from domestic industry has long been notorious. It was again highlighted by a document called Britain, Europe and the Square Mile, published earlier this month by the European Policy Forum. In pleading the City's special self-interest in European integration, the paper argued that if the UK detached itself from the core of the European community there would be a risk to foreign direct investment. It did not explain why the UK has become so much more dependent on foreign investment than any other large EC economy. Meanwhile, in this year's wave of rights issues, the City has been eagerly helping UK companies make large acquisitions in France, the US and elsewhere. As these companies rely more and more on foreign earnings they find it difficult to maintain dividend growth without exhausting their UK tax allowances. Typically, their response is to call for tax concessions from the British government rather than to adopt the low payout policies of companies in most economies. Dividends are generally sparse in other leading industrial countries because the effective ownership of industry is in the hands of the state, of interlocking domestic corporate interests including banks, or of private families. None of these interest groups have much need for income; all have a strong commitment to the domestic economy. The freewheeling British structure leads, in contrast, to an international portfolio approach on the part of both institutional investors and corporate empire-builders. The US is rather similar, but is better-placed to protect its industries - as in the latest row over steel anti-dumping duties, and the renewed Airbus dispute - than the UK. Here is a rough-and-ready summary of the recent decline of British industry. The profit-driven corporate sector has consistently withdrawn resources from underperforming sectors, specially heavy industry, a trend exaggerated by phases of extreme overvaluation of sterling. There were arguments in favour of this in the context of a growing and liberalising global economy, but we are moving into an era of recession and protectionism. Recent policies have led to the appearance of a structural trade gap. Eventual devaluation has been the logical response, but this will bring help on any substantial scale only to labour-intensive manufacturing sectors. Heavy industries which are, say, energy-intensive, and face subsidised competition, will gain little benefit. ICI has long cross-subsidised its heavy chemicals operations but this anomaly has been ruthlessly exposed by the stock market, prompted by Lord Hanson. The rump of ICI will stand little chance of survival. Inward investment has been one answer to domestic shortfalls, but is it durable? The Dutch state has naturally been unwilling to go on supporting Leyland, and it will prove highly dangerous to rely, over anything other than the short term, on lossmaking Nissan to revive the British motor industry; remember that Nissan and the other Japanese manufacturers no longer benefit from a freakishly low cost of capital, as they did in the 1980s. Britain long ago lost its motor-cycle sector. It has since lost its domestically-owned car industry too. As things are going the steel, aircraft and basic chemicals industries will not be far behind. Zeneca, I fear, has nothing to do with motor-cycle maintenance.</p>

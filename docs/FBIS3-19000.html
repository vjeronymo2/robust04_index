			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to DPA information, an agent  of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) has been arrested on  suspicion of espionage in Moscow. On Friday [11 March],  Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel did not want to confirm to the  press in Bonn that the arrested man worked for the BND, but it  was reported in a statement from the Chancellor's Office that  the Moscow counterintelligence service had confirmed the arrest  of a Russian citizen. However, effects on Russian-German  relations were not feared. In answer to an inquiry, the BND  refused to make any statement.    Vogel continued by saying that it is a fact that  intelligence  services exist all over the world. Their work need not always  have political effects. The intelligence services of Germany  and Russia also cooperate in several respects. Vogel pointed out  that official representatives of the German and Russian  intelligence services are accredited in the embassies in Moscow  or Bonn. In this way, cooperation, for example in the field of  drugs and the combating of terrorism, is possible. The Russian  counterintelligence service has not been able to produce any  proof of intelligence service activities of the arrested man.    The Chancellor's Office statement says that Bernd  Schmidbauer, coordinator responsible for the German intelligence  services, had a long and exhaustive talk with Safanov, deputy  head of the Russian counterintelligence service, on Friday  morning. "Mr. Safanov confirmed the arrest of a Russian  citizen, but he made it clear at the same time that, from  Russia's point of view, the affair is of no consequence for the  political relations with the FRG."    According to the Chancellor's Office, the open questions are  to "be clarified exclusively in a constructive way at the level  of the intelligence services," it was stated. Accordingly,  Schmidbauer discussed the further proceedings with his partner  in the talks. In the talks, the Russian side did not report on  any details about the arrested person or on available proof of  activities on behalf of a foreign intelligence service, it was  stated.    In Bonn security circles, it was stated that there might be  a  connection with the espionage affair around Aldrich Ames in  Washington. On 21 February, Ames, a high-ranking employee of  the U.S. intelligence service, the CIA, and his wife Maria  Rosario were arrested on suspicion of espionage for Russia in  the United States. The U.S. intelligence services had found the  supposed double agent Ames, who is charged with the death of 10  U.S. agents, with the help of Stasi intelligence service  documents. Security experts have assumed that the BND man in  Moscow might have been exposed by information from Ames.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Denmark's Ecu1bn issue attracts firm demand A CLUTCH of sovereign and supranational borrowers tapped the Eurobond market yesterday, boosting investor interest in an otherwise lacklustre market. Denmark launched its long-awaited Ecu1bn 10-year bond offering, which is listed in Copenhagen but will be traded internationally. The deal, priced to yield six basis points more than the 8 1/2 per cent French Treasury issue due 2002, met firm demand from institutional investors, even though the pricing was not considered generous. Many fund managers had made room in their portfolios for the Denmark offering as the deal was first announced several months ago. However, the deal did not excite the same enthusiasm as other quasi-governmental bond issues in the sector, such as the UK deal last year. The delay was caused by the technical difficulties of creating bonds that could be traded and settled both in Denmark and internationally. The issue is structured like a Eurobond, with clearing through Euroclear and Cedel, but is also registered, and can be cleared through, the Danish Securities Centre. Denmark's benchmark Ecu bond was prompted by political motives rather than any need for funds. The proceeds of the issue will be added to foreign exchange reserves, but the Danish government was keen to place Copenhagen on the map as an Ecu trading centre. Dealers in Denmark said that domestic demand had been better than expected, accounting for placement of around 25 per cent of the transaction. Danish investors, who have no tradition of buying Ecu bonds, will be encouraged to be more active in the market by the establishment of a repo market and a market making system. Den Danske Bank and Unibank, the joint bookrunners, will act as domestic market-makers, along with Bikuben, Jyske Bank, and Sydbank. Also in the Ecu sector, the World Bank launched a small offering of five-year bonds. Dealers said the pricing of the Ecu150m deal to yield less than the five-year French government Ecu OAT issue was over-ambitious. However, lead-manager Credit Lyonnaise reported strong demand from Italian investors for whom the World Bank name is exempt from withholding tax. In the dollar sector, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Austria-guaranteed Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB) each raised five-year debt. The EIB's Dollars 500m deal was considered rather aggressively priced at a yield spread of 12 basis points above the five-year US Treasury yield. However, five-year sovereign and supranational paper has outperformed the rest of the market due to stronger investor demand for quality issues. Goldman Sachs underwrote the entire transaction, with only a small selling group; consequently, it was hard to gauge how much paper had been sold. A Dollars 200m five-year deal for OKB, priced to yield 25 basis points above the five-year Treasury, met strong demand from institutional investors.</p>

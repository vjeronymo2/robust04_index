			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: SENIORS PUT MAJOR EMPHASIS ON CONVENIENCE  </P> <P> It seems that international travel for senior citizens is decided not so much  by destinations and dollars as by comfort and convenience.  </P> <P> Where to go and what it will cost are still major factors, especially for older  seniors constricted in discretionary travel spending. These seniors look for  travel value.  </P> <P> Seniors have had their flings with solo travel. They've had it with airport  hassles, baggage checking, transfers, finding hotels and restaurants and all  the other details that seem adventurous to the young.  </P> <P> The answer often lies in escorted tours. These tours lack some freedom of  choice but make up for it in security and the convenience of letting couriers  and guides do all the work.  </P> <P> Generally, seniors seek leisurely tours, as few as possible one-night stays,  shorter tour days, or at least no long, seemingly unending motor-coach drives.  </P> <P> For the most part they prefer meal- and entertainment-inclusive tours. And they  prefer to travel with their peers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Specialists  </P> <P> Many Southern California travel and tour agents specialize in such tours. Most  are also members of STRAC, the organization dedicated to making travel easier  and better.  </P> <P> Here are some of these agents and their international travel plans for spring  and summer. (All prices are per person, based on sharing a double room and  leaving from Los Angeles.)  </P> <P> Richard Adams Tours: Specialists in 12- to 15-day European tours with six trips  this year. Best of Britain, May 16-30, $2,395; Best of France, June 11-25,  $2,495; English and Scottish countryside, July 15-29, $2,795; Scandinavia, Aug.  6-20, $2,795; London to Paris, Aug. 21-Sept. 1, $2,295; Festive Alpine Tour,  Sept. 16-30, $2,695.  </P> <P> Gadabout Tours: Based in Palm Springs with several other Southern California  offices and one of the largest international travel programs. Part of its  series includes Australia Rail Sampler, 23 days, $4,125, leaving Sept. 26; New  Zealand Rail Sampler, 19 days, $3,679, leaving Oct. 18; a dozen European tours  and cruises, including Grand Europe, 17 days, $2,699, leaving May 30; Orient  Sampler (Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong and one-day excursion into China), 13  days, $2,274, leaving Nov. 2. Plus cruises in the South Pacific, China and the  Yangtze River and Far East Spice Islands, including Thailand, Indonesia and  Malaysia.  </P> <P> Giovanni Tours: An agency that features everything from pre-departure tours to  after-tour reunions. London Theater and Countryside (several spring departure  dates), eight days, $1,789; South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, March  30-April 18, $4,589; Grand Europe, two 23-day tours leaving June 27 or 29,  $3,689; Heart of the Orient, 14 days, Sept. 9 to 21, $2,989; Scandinavia, 17  days, Sept. 20-Oct. 6, $1,589. Giovanni also has international cruises and  several tours of the British Isles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Choices  </P> <P> Great Western Travel: This senior specialist has a wide variety of domestic and  Canadian tours and is a full-service agency representing all major tour  companies. Offers tours to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria,  East Germany and Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Taylor Tours and Cruises: Another full-service travel and tour agency and  specialist in cruises for seniors. Now finishing details on an 18-day,  eight-country tour of Europe leaving Sept. 2, $1,995.  </P> <P> Trieloff Tours: A wholesale tour operator with a wide variety of domestic,  Mexican, Caribbean and Canadian tours and cruises. Offers several international  tours for 1989, including Australia and New Zealand, 22 days, $4,299, departing  April 8; England, Scotland and Ireland, 22 days, $2,530, departing July 15.  </P> <P> These tour operators sell to the general public and work with many senior  organizations and clubs that offer international and domestic tours to their  members. In addition, there are several fine tour operators, also members of  STRAC, that deal only with senior tour groups.  </P> <P> Also, a variety of major tour wholesalers and special-interest tour operators  cater to mature travelers. A few work through travel agencies; the others use  direct mail and toll-free phone lines for information and reservations.  </P> <P> Working through travel agents are: Collette Tours, based in Pawtucket, R.I.,  with an extensive offering of escorted tours to Europe, Australia, Africa,  China and other international destinations; Insight Tours, with an office in  Irvine, specializing in motor-coach tours to Britain, Europe and the Eastern  Mediterranean; Love Holidays, which has widened its primarily Eastern Europe  tour program to include Britain and Ireland, Spain and Portugal, Morocco and  South America; and a recent entry, Frames Rickards Tours, with escorted tours  of Britain, Ireland and Europe.  </P> <P> The two major travel/study organizations appealing to mature travelers are  Interhostel, which offers primarily an international program, and Elderhostel,  which has some foreign destinations but a wider domestic program.  </P> <P> Finally there are the two biggest, AARP and Grand Circle. The American Assn. of  Retired Persons has an outstanding program of tours and cruises, all sold  direct by mail and phone.  </P> <P> Boston-based Grand Circle Travel has an ever-expanding series of international  tours and cruises and is considered a leader in the mature travel field.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> For more information:  </P> <P> Richard Adams Tours, P.O.

For purposes of this subpart, definitions in this section supersede definitions in other parts or subparts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Controlled loading rack  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a loading rack equipped with vapor collection and processing systems that reduce displaced vapor emissions to no more than 80 milligrams of total organic compounds per liter of gasoline loaded, as measured using the test methods and procedures in &sect;60.503 (a) through (c) of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equipment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means each valve, pump, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, and flange or other connector in the gasoline liquid transfer and vapor collection systems. This definition also includes the entire vapor processing system except the exhaust port(s) or stack(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gasoline tank truck  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a delivery tank truck or railcar used at bulk gasoline terminals which is loading gasoline or which has loaded gasoline on the immediately previous load.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In gasoline service  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means that a piece of equipment is used in a system that transfers gasoline or gasoline vapors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In VHAP service  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In VOC service  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means, for the purposes of this subpart, in gasoline service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating parameter value  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means an established value for control equipment or operating condition, which, if achieved by itself or combination with one or more other operating parameter values, determines that and owner or operator has complied with an applicable emission limit or standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pipeline breakout station  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a facility along a pipeline containing storage vessels used to temporarily store gasoline from the pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Uncontrolled loading rack  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a loading rack used to load gasoline tank trucks that is not a controlled loading rack.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vapor-tight gasoline tank truck  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a gasoline tank truck which has demonstrated within the 12 preceding months that its product delivery tank will sustain a pressure change of not more than 750 pascals (75 mm of water) within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to 4,500 pascals (450 mm of water) or evacuated to 1,500 pascals (150 mm of water). This capability is to be demonstrated using the pressure and vacuum test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 60 of this chapter, appendix A, Reference Method 27.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Volatile organic liquid  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (VOL) means, for the purposes of this subpart, gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;63.422  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Standards: Loading racks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each owner or operator of loading racks at a bulk gasoline terminal subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements in &sect;60.502 of 40 CFR part 60, subpart XX, of this chapter except for paragraphs (b) and (c) of that section.

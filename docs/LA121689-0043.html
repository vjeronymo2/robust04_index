			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO;  </P> <P> COUNTY'S RESIDENTS EAT LESS PRODUCE  </P> <P> Fresno County residents don't eat as many of the fruits and vegetables grown in  their region as residents of San Francisco and Los Angeles, according to a new  state survey. Twenty-six percent of the 252 Fresno County residents polled  between August and November said they are not in the habit of eating fresh  produce and 38% say they don't believe there is a link between diet and  disease. "I think people can be aware of agriculture in Fresno County but not  be aware of the role fruits and vegetables play in personal health," said Karen  Bunch, a research director for the Nutrition and Cancer Prevention Program,  which funded the survey.  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Scullery skulduggery - The odd case of the photocopied recipes ON THE desk in the busy office of one of London's top chefs sits a pile of correspondence between the restaurant's solicitors and a Citizen's Advice Bureau and an envelope containing a week's wages and a P45 awaiting the return of a young chef. The restaurant's head chef, who has a quite distinctive style, would be only too happy to hand these over personally if he could receive in exchange what he believes is rightly his: the copies of the recipes made without permission during this particular young chef's four-week apprenticeship. In many other trades and industries this story could easily appear under the headings 'industrial espionage' or 'theft of intellectual property' but in the catering business such phrases cannot be used. Recipes set restaurants apart and fill tables but it would take supreme arrogance to lay claim to 'an original recipe'. Just by changing small amounts of the basic ingredients anyone can formulate another 'original recipe'. Often what holds back young chefs is the lack of a repertoire of proven dishes. One answer could be to copy them. So how can you protect your own recipes? Unless, as chef, you are going to make everything yourself, you have to share your recipes with your staff and, to maintain their consistency, put them down on paper or on floppy discs (word processors have been almost as big a boon for the busy head chef as the food processor for his commis chefs). As head chef you must accept that you only achieved your exalted position by working first under a number of other chefs who were prepared to pass their knowledge on. On the way up you can take advantage of the catering industry's high turnover of personnel. But once you reach the top this becomes less of an advantage and more of a hazard. Chefs around the world try to protect themselves in two ways. The first is the trust that they show their staff and which they hope is reciprocated. In a busy kitchen - which may be densely populated from 8am to midnight seven days a week - it is hard to conceal anything. The names of your suppliers, your recipes and even your projected gross margins are open secrets. Equally, it is hard for a spy to find a quiet corner to scribble down the kitchen's secret formulae. But if you do manage this once you are unlikely to repeat the success. Although an impressive curriculum vitae helps secure promotion, it is not as important as a good reference. In their evaluation of their staff, chefs are frighteningly honest and always willing to air their opinions. In this particular case, the head chef checked the applicant's references with her former employers and put her to work on a four-week trial period on the basis that, if a permanent position became available, she would stay for a minimum of a year. There were, initially, the usual difficulties, mainly to do with the speed of her work and one or two complaints from fellow chefs that she was spending too much time copying recipes rather than working from the master recipe file. When she was confronted, the apprentice said she had just copied basic pastry recipes rather than anything more significant. The restaurant later deduced that the young chef had managed to copy approximately 150 of the restaurant's recipes by duping the rest of the kitchen into thinking she had the head chef's permission. She did this in the early evening when the proprietor went home between the lunch and dinner shifts. When the head chef, impressed by the applicant's obvious passion for bread and pastry, offered her a full time job he was therefore most surprised to be rebuffed. The apprentice would no longer commit herself for a year, as she had originally promised she would, and walked out. The head chef was naturally hurt and saddened by his misplaced trust and mistaken professional judgment. When, shortly afterwards, he met fellow chefs including Albert Roux, Rowley Leigh, Simon Hopkinson and Alastair Little around the lunch table one suggested recourse to lawyers, which has yielded the return of some recipes, but the others could offer nothing more concrete. Even the best kitchens, it seems, have failed to create a recipe that will replace trust in one's fellow man.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lower waste levels hit Leigh LEIGH INTERESTS, the waste management company, blamed lower levels of waste production in the south of England and a higher interest charge for a 43 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30. Profits fell from Pounds 7.12m to Pounds 4.08m on reduced sales of Pounds 52.3m (Pounds 58.9m). Borrowings rose to Pounds 40m (Pounds 25m) - mainly because of acquisitions last summer - giving gearing of 60 per cent. The interest charge increased to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1m). However, the shares rose 5p to close at 183p, partly out of relief that the profit fall was in line with the company's forecast earlier this year. Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said: 'The deepening recession in the south means that many of our customers are just not producing any more waste. We do not anticipate any upturn in the next half.' Turnover was also held back by the depressed state of the construction industry which affected the company's market for reclaiming contaminated land. The company says it is in a good position to take advantage of the move away from landfilling towards treatment of more liquid wastes. Over the past two years it has invested around Pounds 10m in 14 licenced treatment plants which treat liquid wastes. Mr Kent said the group was not looking to make any further acquisitions since its decision earlier this year to buy Gerrards Cross Waste Disposal Company, operating near the junction of the M40 and M25. Earnings per share fell to 4.4p (7.7p). The interim dividend is held at 2.46p.</p>

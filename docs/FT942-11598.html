			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / MoD may buy more tanks The Ministry of Defence is examining a tender submitted by Vickers for supplying the army with more Challenger Two tanks to supplement the 127 already ordered, the Commons was told last night. In a progress report on a comprehensive equipment programme for the army, Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, said a contract for attack helicopters was expected to be placed in the middle of next year. Mr Aitken confirmed that the outcome of the defence costs study 'Front Line First' would probably be announced before the Commons adjourned for the summer recess in July. He agreed with Mr Tom King, the former defence secretary, that there was no scope for further cuts in the strength of the army. Mr Aitken said the army was now at its 'correct and right strength' and this would remain the case even if it proved possible to withdraw troops from Northern Ireland. He denied that defence policy was being dictated by expenditure cuts imposed by the Treasury. The government was warned from both sides of the House that uncertainty created by the latest review of defence costs was affecting army morale. Mr King urged the government to announce the outcome of the current defence costs study as quickly as possible. He said the scaling down of commitments after withdrawal of forces from Belize and the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty would not justify any further reduction.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Serb politician charged in Belgrade crackdown MR Vuk Draskovic, Serbia's most prominent opposition leader, has been charged in court with seeking to overthrow the state's constitutional order. The charge, which could lead to a lengthy prison term, was the latest blow by the regime of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in a crackdown on its opponents. Mr Draskovic was arrested earlier this week after leading an anti-government demonstration in Belgrade and is reported to have been badly beaten. His lawyers said early today that he had also been charged with assaulting a police officer. The charges against him carry a penalty of up to 15 years' jail. Mr Draskovic was arrested along with his wife and about 20 members of his Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO). Lawyers said that Mr Draskovic's wife, too, was charged with attempting to overthrow the state and both would be kept in custody for at least 30 days. The Serbian authorities are already seeking a ban on the SPO. The crackdown on the party follows the ousting of Yugoslav federal president Dobrica Cosic through a parliamentary vote of no confidence brought by radical Serb deputies backed by Mr Milosevic's socialists. In the parliamentary manoeuvring, Mr Milosevic renewed his alliance with radical nationalists, after their relations had appeared under strain recently. Mr Vojislav Seselj, head of the Serbian Radical Party, described the Serbian president as 'a real patriot'. With the Serbian president asserting his grip on power, the mood in Belgrade was apprehensive yesterday. New police checkpoints were set up on roads around the city. For the first time since Mr Milosevic came to power in 1988, the police were an openly intimidating presence. Mr Milosevic is clearly determined to crack down heavily on any attempt by the opposition to exploit rising popular discontent over the economic impact of UN sanctions against Serbia. Police reinforcements have been brought in from as far as Kosovo in the past three days, diplomatic sources said. Mr Milosevic has strengthened the Serbian police force by 20,000 men in the past year, equipping special units with armoured vehicles and helicopters as well as rocket launchers and other weaponry. A year of sanctions has made life in Serbia increasingly uncomfortable, especially in Belgrade where the effects of large-scale lay-offs, soaring prices and periodic shortages are most keenly felt. The opposition has grown weaker since demonstrations last year, led by the flamboyant Mr Draskovic, demanding an end to the war in Bosnia, forced Mr Milosevic to call an early election.</p>

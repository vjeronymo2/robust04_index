			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mikel Ndreca: "Anti-Kosovar Provocation"] </F>   [Text] The Belgrade mass media reported a few days ago the  appointment of Zivorad Igic as ambassador of Yugoslavia (!) to  Albania. BUJKU rightly deplored this news.    As is well known, after the disintegration of AVNOJ  [Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia]  Yugoslavia, many states of Europe and the United States withdrew  their ambassadors from Belgrade, at the same time requesting the  withdrawal of the Yugoslav ambassadors from their countries.  Respecting this stand by other countries, the Republic of  Albania acted likewise by withdrawing its ambassador from  Belgrade and asking for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav  ambassador in Tirana.    A few days ago, the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]  Government issued a request for the revival of talks with the  democratic Republic of Albania at foreign-ministerial level. We  have not been informed of the response of the Albanian side.    How these possible talks will develop is not the concern of  this article. What interests the Kosovar Albanian public today  is the appointment of Zivorad Igic as ambassador to Tirana.    If the governments of the FRY and Serbia really do have a  sincere intention to renew relations of any kind with the  Republic of Albania, they must also think about the choice of  the person who will contribute toward promoting these relations.  Zivorad Igic is not such a man. His appointment to this  high-level diplomatic post in a country with whom relations have  cooled for well-known reasons has been taken as a serious  provocation by the Albanian people of Kosova. We do not believe  that the state and political authorities in Yugoslavia and  Serbia are unaware of this. And this is why....    Zivorad Igic, once a village schoolteacher (nothing wrong in  that) grew up almost in the Albanians' lap. He was  "distinguished" as an "ardent" supporter of the idea of  "brotherhood-and-unity and togetherness." From being a  journalist and media editor, at the end of Yugosiavia's  existence he "jumped" to the post of the (final) chairman of the  Kosova Socialist Alliance [SAWP]. After purging this  organization of Albanians at an early stage, he at the same time  sought the most drastic and brutal state measures against them.    After the final destruction of the League of Communists  [LCY]  and the SAWP, Igic joined the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS]  and assumed high office. In the first pluralist parliamentary  elections (in which the Albanians did not take place for  well-known reasons), he was elected a deputy to the Serbian  Assembly.    After the events of 1981, Zivorad Igic had slowly, but  systematically and in the most perfidious fashion, following the  "LCY line," involved himself in the anti-Albanian campaign.  Following the outbreak of the anti-Albanian national-chauvinist  popular hysteria and especially after 1987, Zivorad Igic devoted  himself heart and soul to this campaign. In his articles in  several Yugoslav newspapers, his appearance on LCY, SAWP, and  other political rostrums, on the floor of the parliaments of  Serbia and self-styled Yugoslavia, Zivorad Igic, more than  anyone else from Kosova, lied, slandered, and spat out  chauvinist gall against the Albanian people, accusing them of  treason, of destroying Yugoslavia, and of allegedly visiting  "violence," "terror," and "genocide" on the Serbian people in  Kosova and beyond for more than a century. In these articles  and speeches, Zivorad Igic insistently demanded the abolition of  Kosova's autonomy, the suspension of all its educational,  cultural, academic, health, and even economic institutions, and  the total destruction of the Kosova economy and its subjection  to that of serbia. The total destruction of all these  institutions and of the Kosova economy is the indisputable  "contribution" of Zivorad Igic, who, as a deputy of the Serbian  parliament, voted for all the necessary measures.    Zivorad Igic, a Kosova-born Serbian intellectual, not only  failed to raise the voice of reason against the most brutal  violence, terror, and genocide on the continent of Europe,  visited upon the Albanian people in Kosova by the present  Serbian regime, but, in his articles, appearances, and behavior  in the service of this regime, has powerfully aided  anti-Albanian policies, showing himself to be a sworn enemy of  the Albanian people. Finally, one must mention another matter  of principle of which the FRY Government is aware, but which it  ignores as something "nonexistent." It is well known that the  Republic of Albania has accepted the Republic of Kosova. The  choice of the Albanians of Kosova is well known both to  Yugoslavia today and the world. Despite the efforts of the  Yugoslav and Serbian Government to treat the Kosova issue as a  Serbian internal affair, this issue has become  internationalized, and the Albanians have no intention of  accepting a solution without the presence and guarantee of an  international factor. Zivorad Igic's appointment as the FRY's  representative in Tirana, or anywhere else, at this phase of  tense Albanian-Serbian (and Yugoslav) relations, cannot be  understood by the Albanians as anything other than an  intentional provocation. Sensible policies would not permit  such a thing. The Albanians of Kosova are vitally interested in  good, friendly, and sincere Albanian-Yugoslav relations, but  they can only come about after the question of Kosova is  conclusively solved. The appointment of the FRY ambassador from  Kosova suggests that the FRY Government wishes to quietly sweep  under the carpet Kosova as a free and independent entity, while  the Republic of Albania will be left "holding the baby,"  because, if it fails to accept this ambassador from Kosova, it  will be accused of "destabilizing" the situation in the Balkans.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Report says two-speed Europe could deprive south-east England of pounds 10bn income A TWO-SPEED Europe could deprive south-east England of annual income of up to Pounds 10bn, according to a report published today backing a full UK role in European integration. The study, by the European Policy Forum, was commissioned by the Corporation of London to underline the potential losses to the City if Britain failed to ratify the Maastricht treaty. The report says that Britain should maintain the policy of 'attachment' to Europe, practised particularly after the single market programme was drawn up in 1985. Britain, Europe and the Square Mile, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA.</p>

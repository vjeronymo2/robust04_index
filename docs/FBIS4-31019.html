			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 1 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Josef  Moravcik expressed his interest in meeting the new Hungarian  government as soon as possible at a press conference today and  said a "radical solution" to open questions between the two  countries could be expected before Slovakia's autumn elections.  General elections are to be held on September 30 and October 1.    He said he was satisfied that the Slovak-Hungarian  readmission agreement -- Bratislava's condition for the opening  of new border crossings -- was ready for signing. Slovakia was  also ready to sign an agreement dividing the waters of the  Danube between the canal to supply the Gabcikovo hydroelectric  power station and the old course of the river. "The basic aim is  to find a solution that will improve the environmental  situation," he said, adding that "all the possibilities (exist)  for achieving a solution."    The basic bilateral agreement on good neighborly relations  "must contain a guarantee of the inviolability of the borders",  which in Bratislava's view is a "condition without which  confidence cannot be established," he said.    He said some Slovaks were concerned about the possibility  the  borders with Hungary would be changed, but personally he did not  believe this was Hungary's intent.    Furthermore the agreement ought to safeguard minority rights  to the extent required by international norms, he said.  Slovakia insisted, however, on the rights of the individual and  opposed the conferment of collective rights for the  half-million-strong Hungarian minority.    Moravcik rejected the criticism recently leveled by Miklos  Duray, chairman of the Hungarian minority movement Egyutteles  that Moravcik's government was not honoring the pledges it made  on acceding to the European charter on minority languages and  community autonomy. He said cooperation with Hungarian minority  parties was reflected in the government policy declaration.    "We are not bound to any other document," he said. Slovakia  had refused to sign this pledge in the charter, and "Mr. Duray  knows this".</p>

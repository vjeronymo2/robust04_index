			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Yeltsin's foes unite in parliament's first session: Ultra-nationalists set to work with Communists Russia's new parliament got off to an acrimonious start yesterday with wrangling between Russia's Choice and an emerging alliance of Communists and ultra-nationalists. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, addressing the State Duma, or lower chamber, promised he would gear economic policy towards boosting industrial output and attacked radical reformers for trying to rush market reforms. 'The government will not allow ill-considered leaps forward and unreasonable shock actions,' he said. Mr Chernomyrdin's comments, underline the fact that he will have a large say in cabinet changes which are likely to diminish the influence of radical reformers in the government. After hours of procedural wrangling, the Duma decided on the number of deputies needed to register an official faction. Factions are allowed to speak in every debate and have a say in the membership of parliamentary committees. The maiden session confirmed expectations that Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, the Communists and Communist-orientated Agrarians, will be capable of working together when the need arises. Between them, they can command at least 211 seats out of a total of 444 (six are still to be filled), giving them the dominant position in the parliament and in some instances the ability to command an overall majority. But the Duma session gave some heart to Russia's Choice, the radical reformists. With the support of 96 deputies, they form the largest single group in the Duma, which could equip them in alliance with other pro-reform parties to block decisions they oppose or deprive a parliamentary session of a quorum. Deputies are to reconvene tomorrow after devoting today to more consultations on whom they will elect as speaker and as heads of parliamentary committees. The rouble fell against hard currencies for the second day running, ending the day at 1,293 against the dollar, only six up on the record low of 1,299 to the dollar. Analysts said that it reflected fears of instability in the government, rumours of the resignation of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, and a high demand for hard currency to buy imported goods before new import duties are imposed on March 1. Figures published by the Makroekon-link Institute, part of the State Statistics Committee, claimed that GDP would continue to contract this year, by about 5 per cent from 1993. It said that the gap between rich and poor would increase further, and that 35 per cent of the Russian population would earn below the official poverty level. The institute claimed the fall in production and living standards in Russia last year had been steeper than admitted by the economics ministry. The institute said that GDP slumped in 1993 by 12 per cent on 1992, and by 29 per cent on 1991, with national income down 13 per cent and production down 16 per cent on 1992.

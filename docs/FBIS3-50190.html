The Albanian minister of defence, Safet Zhulali,  expressed his pleasure for the first high raking American  meeting about the field of defence. He conveyed to the U.S.  delegation the greeting of the Albanian president and general  commander of the Armed Forces of Albania, Mr. Sali Berisha.  "This meeting is very important," Mr. Zhulali said, "for the  fact that it is being held right after the NATO summit, in which  the idea of Partnership for Peace was presented. This is  brilliant idea," he said further on, "which we support  unreservedly. We shall be totally committed to it, thus  realising cooperation with all democratic countries, especially  with the U.S.A. In this way, we will contribute to creation of  the conditions for Albania to become a NATO member.    Mr. Zhulali said that Albania is playing an important role  for the peace and stability in the Balkan region. "The latest  message of President Clinton conveyed to us by Ms. Albright is  encouraging and supports the bilateral cooperation between  Albania and the U.S.A."    Mr. Josef Crusel said that he was pleased to be in Albania  in  the lead of a high ranking delegation. "Through the photos of  former Secretary Baker during his visit to Albania we created  the image for the overthrow of the dictatorship in Albania.  This gives Albania a special place among us, Americans," Mr.  Crusel said. "I hope that our discussions will be very  productive regarding bilateral relations in the field of  security," Mr. Crusel said.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Loss expected at SAS after krona devaluation SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) is set to record a loss for the third successive year in 1992, following the devaluation of the Swedish krona which will produce a SKr1.2bn (Dollars 162m) one-off loss. The company declined to estimate its year-end figures, but analysts believe the loss is likely to be around SKr700m. In the first six months of last year, the airline recorded a SKr502m profit, but is believed to have been held to a break-even operating result in the second-half because of recession and intensifying competition, particularly in the Swedish market. SAS said that during 1992 the krona fell by about 27 per cent against the dollar and by 20 per cent against the D-Mark, helping to aggravate the group's debt from SKr18bn to SKr25bn since the krona was floated in November. The currency loss might have been greater but for a strategy of switching a portion of foreign currency debt into Swedish kronor during the last few months of 1992, the airline noted. SAS said the krona's devaluation would have a limited impact on its 1992 operating result.</p>

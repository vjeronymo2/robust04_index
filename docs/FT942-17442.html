			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Post office deal on bills will cut gas showrooms British Gas and Post Office Counters plan to announce that gas bills can be paid at post offices in a move that will lead to the closure of about half Britain's high street gas showrooms. The deal, which will enable gas users to pay their quarterly and budget bills without extra charge at post offices, is expected to be announced this week. Following the announcement of a Pounds 1.6bn structural overhaul of British Gas last year, the company said it would scale down its workforce by 25,000 over the next five years. The change in staff numbers that results from the closure of the showrooms will be included in this figure. Those showrooms remaining out of the original 425 will focus on retail sales of gas equipment. British Gas said that showroom staff had not been able to provide retail services 'in the best way' because they had to accept bill payments as well. It said that facilities for customers to pay bills would eventually be phased out of the showrooms. Previously, customers could pay their bills post offices through the 'transcash' system, but such payments were subject to a charge of 83p. The new arrangement will allow customers to pay cash or cheques to settle bills free of charge. Current post office staff will handle the transactions. Post Office Counters said: 'There are potentially 18m customers coming in to use the post office network. It will increase business.' Norweb, the Manchester-based electricity company, is to supply gas to industrial users. Norweb, which has 4.7m electricity customers in the north-west, wants to take advantage of legislation opening up the gas market for businesses which use more than 2,500 therms a year and typically have annual bills of more than Pounds 1,100.</p>

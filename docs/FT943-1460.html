			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (2): Winning smile reflects Denplan's success - Venturer of the year When Stephen Noar, a 38-year-old dentist, decided to set up a new company in 1986, the prognosis was not entirely promising. Market research found no perceived need for the business. At its marketing launch in the Guildhall, Winchester, only 29 people turned up. But Noar's dogged belief in his idea paid off. From a standing start, he built up Denplan, the dental healthcare company sold for Pounds 42m last November. This achievement, together with qualities such as 'clear vision', 'determination' and 'insight', has just earned Noar the accolade of Venturer of the Year, an award sponsored by the Financial Times, Cartier the jewellers, and the British Venture Capital Association. Much of Denplan's success can be attributed to Noar's prescience about the impending crisis within his profession. This dates back to his work in the mid-1980s at the Medical Defence Union, a provider of professional indemnity, where he saw countless examples of the way in which the National Health Service was failing dentists and their patients. The problems, he reasoned, were exacerbated by the way dentists were paid. As dentists were paid purely for each item of treatment, they had no incentive to do preventative work. The piece-work basis of their pay, together with the pressures of seeing 30 to 50 patients a day, affected the quality of their work. At the same time, dentists' commitment to the health service was eroding as their incomes fell behind those of their peers. With a colleague, Marilyn Orcharton, he saw an opportunity to form a company offering a private dental health care programme. Patients would pay a monthly fee to cover any work they might need, a system which would avoid the problems associated with piece-work pay. Dentists would set their own charges while delegating their administration to Denplan, which would take a fee for every registered patient. Backers' reward By last November, when the business was sold to Private Patients Plan for a total of Pounds 42m, the company had registered 20 per cent of UK dentists and 400,000 patients. Pre-tax profits in the year to end-April 1993 were Pounds 1m. The company's success was shared by its backers. Advent, the venture capitalists, invested Pounds 850,000 in Denplan in early 1988 and achieved an internal rate of return of 52.7 per cent over five and a half years. F&amp;C Ventures, the venture capitalists which bought out Orcharton's stake for Pounds 1m in 1991, made an internal rate of return of 132.1 per cent over 30 months. Both companies hope to benefit from further earn-out considerations. Noar enjoyed a good relationship with his backers, although he reserves his warmest gratitude for the Midland bank manager who supported the business in its early days. However, he notes that the relationship between an entrepreneur and venture capitalists is 'fraught with potential problems.' 'If you are taking on board venture capitalists, you have to do it as an adult,' he says. 'You have to realise it will not be your company.' This process is good for the business, he believes. 'Owner-managers are too possessive. They think they have all the answers.' Noar was not always prepared to admit he did not have the answers, however. One of Advent's nominees left the board after a few months because of a disagreement about whether Denplan should offer dental insurance schemes. Stephen Noar feels strongly that dental insurance schemes are not in the best interests of patients - or their insurance companies - because they are open to abuse and lead to unnecessary treatment. It is clear that Noar believes strongly in the ethics of his business. He rejects charges of opportunism associated with making money by exploiting the failings of the health service. He recognises, nonetheless, the mixed feelings and torn loyalties experienced by both dentists and patients leaving the health service. Noar believes that the exodus from the health service would be likely to continue under a Labour government - 'there is now a general perception across political parties that the whole of the population's primary care aspirations cannot be met out of taxation,' he says. The logical corollary of this argument is that, at some stage, the principles behind Denplan could be extended into general practice medicine. The idea appears to intrigue Noar - 'there is a debate now about the health service which is less emotive,' he says. 'It is not sacrilege, heresy or treason to talk about priorities.' It is not clear what Noar will do when his two-year contract with PPP comes to an end. One ambition is to become involved in backing small companies himself. However, it is evident that his interest in developing Denplan's potential did not evaporate when he sold the company. 'I have no financial reason to work but I have a lot of unfinished business with this company,' he says. 'Everything we have done to date is to put us in a position to do really important things.'</p>

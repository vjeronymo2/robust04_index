			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Automotive side limits Triplex Lloyd's decline PRE-TAX PROFITS at Triplex Lloyd slipped 7 per cent in the 12 months to end-March as the industrial engineering group fought the weakness of the building products market. However, a strong performance by its automotive and engineering and power divisions restricted the decline at the pre-tax line to Pounds 7.07m (Pounds 7.57m). The group incurred an attributable loss of Pounds 2.59m after extraordinary items of Pounds 3.09m to cover the write-off of loss-making Canadian operations and a transfer to reserves of Pounds 4.85m for goodwill related to those operations. There was a profit last time of Pounds 5.3m. The strength of the performance in the automotive and power divisions led to an increase of 18 per cent to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.7m) in operating profits. The rise came largely because of an improvement in margins, from 6.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent in automotive and from 5.8 per cent to 7.4 per cent in power. Earnings per share were 11.4p, down from 12.7p. The recommended final dividend is unchanged at 4.5p, bringing the total, for the third successive year, to 7p. Although the group expects little over the coming year from its building products division, 'automotive and engineering and power divisions are well positioned to sustain and indeed improve their profitability even if UK economic activity should remain depressed,' said Mr Colin Cooke, chairman. COMMENT Triplex Lloyd is now benefiting from both an investment and acquisition programme and a more concentrated focusing of its business. This is enabling it to pick up business in the automotive sector and exploit a power sector where demand is strong anyway. Exposure to the UK market is being reduced. There is no reason why this incipient strength should not be more apparent over the current year. Arguably then, the share price, latterly languishing around its 1992 low, looks cheap compared with some of its peers. In the expectation of higher profits this year - possibly about Pounds 9.5m, to give earnings of 12.5p - the prospective multiple at 137p is under 11, against an actual sector average of over 25.</p>

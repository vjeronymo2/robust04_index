			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (3): Relations with US improve - Diplomacy has been a key factor this year When Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister, addressed the US Council on foreign relations in New York recently, he spoke with more self-assurance about diplomatic achievements than might have been possible earlier in the year. Mr Qian also pursued a theme that is fast becoming a staple of public utterances by Chinese leaders on a range of subjects from Gatt membership to regional security. It is that China, because of its growing economic weight, expects to play a much expanded role in a complex and unstable world. 'People with vision have come to realise that the world needs China for peace, stability and prosperity just as China needs the world,' he said. As 1994 draws to a close, there is no doubt this has been a successful year for Chinese diplomacy with Beijing further distancing itself from the bloody events of 1989 in which the military turned its guns on student pro-democracy protesters. The US agreement in mid-year to sever the link between renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status and human rights issues represented a significant breakthrough. Relations with the US have improved markedly as a consequence, although irritations continue over issues ranging from Washington's decision to upgrade ties with Taiwan to terms for China's re-entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Among tangible signs of improvement was the joint Sino-US statement in October on 'Missile Proliferation' in which the two sides agreed to work together to halt proliferation of missiles. They also resolved to co-operate in efforts to achieve an end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. In return for China's agreement to support a global ban on exports of missiles under the terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the US lifted sanctions on the export of high technology items. Since the disastrous visit to Beijing early this year of Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, marked by an unseemly wrangle over human rights, a steady stream of senior Americans has passed through the Chinese capital; among them, Mr Ron Brown, the Commerce Secretary and Mr William Perry, the Defence Secretary. The latter was the first visit to China of a US Defence Secretary since 1989 and yielded agreement on enhanced military consultations, and co-operation in such fields as defence conversion. The two sides did not address the issue of the continued US embargo on military aid to China imposed after June, 1989. The growing frequency of Sino-US exchanges indicates that the two are bent on building a more constructive relationship in both the commercial and political and security spheres. This is consistent with the Clinton administration's desire to re-focus its China policy in ways that make it less susceptible to human rights pressures. China would also be well satisfied with broader foreign policy developments. The defusing, for the time being, of the North Korean nuclear crisis represented a success for Chinese diplomacy which had striven behind the scenes to avoid a sanctions process and, worse, the crisis spiralling out of control. In a way, the North Korea issue provided a textbook case of Beijing's cautious foreign policy approach. China prefers quiet diplomacy to confrontation on most issues with the notable exception of questions involving Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and human rights. This much reflects the low-key non-ideological personal style of Foreign Minister Qian as it does Beijing's desire to be regarded as a good neighbour in its own region and a constructive player globally. China, for the moment, appears sensitive to regional concerns about its growing economic strength, although Beijing's uncompromising pursuit of its claim to disputed islands and surrounding waters in the South China Sea risks confrontation, principally with Vietnam, see report, this page. The Spratlys issue is one of the irritants most often cited as an argument for the further development of a regional security consensus, but here again Beijing is cautious. While officials see merit in dialogue they are sceptical of grander schemes such as Europe's CSCE framework. This caution extends to Beijing's approach to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (APEC). While China sees merit in APEC, it is not ready, at this stage, to embrace the grouping wholeheartedly as much more than a consultative forum. Among China's concerns is that APEC itself might develop into a trading bloc in competition with other groupings, including the European Community. China, whose trading ambitions are almost boundless, is understandably against the idea of the world being divided into competing economic spheres. Apart from the US, China has also witnessed in the past months an improvement in its relations with key European powers, including Germany and France. The visit to France by President Jiang Zemin in September followed a period of coolness over French arms sales to Taiwan, but the issue was defused earlier this year when France agreed to place a moratorium on new weapons business. China's relations with the Russian Federation have also been improving, culminating with the visit to Moscow in the autumn by Mr Jiang. This resulted in a series of framework economic agreements designed to propel the relationship into the next century. The two sides also agreed to stop targeting each other with nuclear weapons and to further reduce the deployment of troops on their lengthy common boundary. The one really jarring element of China's international relationships, apart from ongoing human rights pressures, remains the row over Hong Kong governor Chris Patten's attempts to broaden democracy, and the effect this is having on Sino-British ties. At this stage, there seems little prospect of an end to the friction and its negative impact on relations between Beijing and London. The 1,000 or so days between now and 1997 promise a bumpy ride.</p>

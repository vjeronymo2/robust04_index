			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN MIDDLE EASTERN EYES, U.S. AND ISRAEL ARE INTIMATELY ONE  </P> <P> Why did Islamic fundamentalists in southern Lebanon kill a U.S. Marine colonel  and threaten to kill other American hostages in retaliation for the kidnaping  of one of their leaders by the Israel army? They have held at least three  Israeli soldiers prisoner for several years, yet their vengeance was turned  against the United States rather than Israel. Do they perceive Israel as the  client of the United States, or is America the client of Israel in their view?  </P> <P> The reaction of the fundamentalists to Israel's strike at their base in Lebanon  underscores a widely held perception in the Middle East -- that Israel and the  United States are intimately linked in an alliance closer than any other two  countries. Few Arabs or Iranians will take seriously statements by the U.S.  government that it does not approve of, or was not involved in, the kidnaping  escapade -- especially after the Iran-Contra affair exposed a deep collusion  between Jerusalem and Washington in that "arms-for-hostages" scheme.  </P> <P> How real or how extensive is this collusion, and which nation, Israel or the  United States, holds the greatest leverage over the other? It has long been  established that American intelligence services operate as closely with their  Israeli counterparts as with any of our Western allies. There is little, if  any, information passed by Washington to British or other European intelligence  agents that Israel does not also receive, either through official or other  channels.  </P> <P> Yet the relationship with Israel is more than special. It is unique. Israel  receives by far the largest amount of American foreign aid, in both absolute  terms and on a per-capita basis. Egypt, the second largest recipient of  American assistance, receives its huge allocation largely as a reward for  signing the 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Relations between the United States  and Israel have been frequently strained since the intifada began in December,  1987. But there has never been the slightest hint by either the Reagan or Bush  administrations that economic or military assistance would be diminished an  iota.  </P> <P> Last year several members of the House and the Senate, all traditional  supporters of Israel, took the unusual step of publicly criticizing Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir for his policies in the West Bank and Gaza and for his  negative response to then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz's peace  proposals. Yet none was willing to cut economic support. A co-chairman of one  congressional subcommittee criticized Israel but opposed cutting aid because,  he reasoned, Israel needed the reassurance that such aid would provide after it  had been shaken by the U.S. decision to open talks with the Palestine  Liberation Organization in December.  </P> <P> Yasser Arafat used to call Israel the "spoiled child" of America. Yet last year  he led the PLO through its greatest policy change toward Israel since the  organization was established 25 years ago. A major reason for Arafat's  turnabout was his belief -- one widely held in the Middle East -- that the  United States and Israel are so intimately linked that the demands of one  become the wishes of the other. Like the Shiite fundamentalists in Lebanon, he  believes that either convincing or hurting the United States can convince or  hurt Israel. If we persuade Washington to alter its policy either through  diplomacy or by threats and force, we can influence Israel, they argue.  </P> <P> Israelis, of course, perceive the situation differently. The Israeli government  has great expectations of the United States and is deeply disappointed, even  chagrined, when Washington publicly castigates it or, in exceptional  circumstances, votes against it in the United Nations. While the Israeli  government expects perfect accord with Washington on Middle East matters, its  leaders often complain that public criticism of its free-lance actions, like  the kidnaping of the Lebanese Shiite leader or the bombing of Iraq's nuclear  reactor in 1982, is interference in their country's internal affairs. Often  these officials explain away U.S. reaction, insisting that what Washington  condemns in public it applauds in private. Nor do they regard their advice to  the powerful Israel lobby on Capitol Hill as interference in American domestic  affairs, but rather as support for what is in the best interests of the United  States.  </P> <P> Which nation, then, does hold the greatest leverage over the other, Israel or  the United States? Is it appropriate for Washington to interfere in, influence  or criticize Israel's "internal affairs" and vice versa? Should Israel keep the  United States "informed" about -- or clear in advance -- operations like the  Lebanon kidnaping? These are all questions about which most American  policy-makers are still undecided. But Middle Easterners believe they have been  answered -- that Israel and American policy dealing with their region of the  world is indistinguishable, that each country knows what the other is about to  do and that Washington's criticism of Israel is merely a smoke screen to cover  actions turned over to Israel because they do not accord with U.S. policy or  with the public image of American mores.  </P></p>

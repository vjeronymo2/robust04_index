			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 576(b)(2), as amended, provides that, instead of the material submitted under Rule 576(b)(1), the member organization may transmit with the soliciting material a signed proxy indicating the number of shares held for the beneficial owner and bearing a symbol identifying the proxy records of such member organization, and a letter informing the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser of the necessity for completing the proxy form and forwarding it to the person soliciting proxies in order that the shares may be represented at the meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange also is modifying Commentaries .10 and .60 to Rule 576. Commentary .10 (``Annual reports to be transmitted'') is being amended to provide that annual reports shall be transmitted to beneficial owners or to beneficial owners' designated investment advisers under the same conditions as those applying to proxy soliciting material under Rule 567 even through it is not proxy soliciting material under the proxy rules of the Commission. Commentary .60 (``Duty to transmit even when requested not to'') currently provides that proxy material must be sent to a beneficial owner even through such owner has instructed the member organization not to do so. The Exchange is qualifying this provision to permit the beneficial owner to instruct the member organization in writing to send such material to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange also is adding provisions for a beneficial owner's designated investment adviser to Rule 577 (``Giving of Proxies by member Organization, Voting Procedure Without Instructions''). As amended, the Rule provides that a member organization which has transmitted proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner and solicited voting instructions in accordance with the provisions of Rule 576, and who has not received instructions from the beneficial owner or from the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material, may give or authorize the giving of a proxy to vote such stock, provided certain enumerated conditions are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange is making two changes to Rule 577, Commentary .10 (``Giving a Proxy to Vote Stock''). As amended, paragraphs (1) and (2) state that a member organization may give a proxy to vote stock provided that: (1) it has transmitted proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser in accordance with Rule 576, and (2) it has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner or from the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material. The remaining condition in paragraph (3) is unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 585_Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material_currently provides that a member organization, upon request by a company, and when furnished with copies of interim reports of earnings or other material sent to stockholders, and satisfactory assurance that it will be reimbursed by such company for out-of-pocket expenses, shall transmit such reports of material to each beneficial owner of stock of such company held by the member organization and registered in a name other than the name of the beneficial owner. The Exchange is qualifying Rule 585 by adding the following to the end of the Rule: ``unless the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to transmit such reports or material to a designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

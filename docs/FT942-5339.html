			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: Intimate, yet spacious - Opera As one regular re-marked, 'Isn't it marvellous? They have increased the audience by 400, but there is still plenty of room to stretch out when you are having your picnic.' The double success of the new opera house at Glyndebourne is to have expanded the scale of operations, while keeping the intimacy that has made the festival special. For an opera such as Yevgeny Onegin the new theatre is ideal. Tchaikovsky's romantic orchestra is able to fill its lungs and breathe with a depth of sound that was not possible before, but the characters on stage still feel close and intimate. Tchaikovsky thought that crucially important in this opera, because he was dealing with ordinary people and wanted them to seem as natural and true to life as possible. As a producer, Graham Vick is the antithesis to that. He sees all his operas in stylised terms and that goes for Yevgeny Onegin as well, even if it means viewing the opera from the wrong end of the telescope. An empty box provides the basic element of Richard Hudson's designs, varied with doors opening on to other areas for some scenes - a visual style that would seem bare, if the blend of colours was not so beautifully subtle and the lighting so effective. Where Tchaikovsky could not help falling in love with his characters, Vick is always the sophisticated observer, watching them with cold detachment. One senses little familial warmth on the Larins' farm; the peasants' harvesting chorus becomes a formal song-and-dance routine. Later, when Onegin and Tatyana meet to discuss her letter, they sit on opposite sides of the stage, unable to spark any reaction off each other, even if it is hurt, anger or shame. Elena Prokina's Tatyana is left to live in an icy emotional vacuum, though perhaps that is Vick's point. This young Russian soprano, who made such a striking impression in the Royal Opera's Katya Kabanova earlier in the year, fits conscientiously into the production's ideas. She keeps her Tatyana outwardly cool and composed, admitting not a flicker of love's flame to show on the surface. Only her tinglingly alive, soft singing (this is a first-rate voice) hints at the intensity inside. Her Onegin makes less impression than he might, although Wojciech Drabowicz effects a properly disdainful manner and has a pleasing lyrical baritone, lacking something in ring and focus in the middle. Martin Thompson's Lensky, who lustily chases his Olga rather than reciting poetry to her, has the soft head-tones the role requires, but does not use them to win much sympathy for the character. At his death one feels sorry for a wasted life, but not more. Louise Winter works hard at being a carefree, playful Olga. It is good to see Yvonne Minton back as Madam Larina and there is a restrained, not very incisively-sung Filippyevna from Ludmilla Filatova. Frode Olsen is a model of aristocratic dignity as Prince Gremin and sings his aria with distinction. By the final act Tatyana has left her rural home to marry him and join St Petersburg society: a world of formal posturing, in which Vick's sense of ironic detachment runs riot. Nevertheless, it is in these final scenes that the production starts to come together, aided by Andrew Davis whose conducting of Tchaikovsky is equally cool-headed and needs time to build up a head of emotional steam. Glyndebourne has a reputation as a company which fuses music and drama as one. Whatever reservations one might have of it, this production is at least all of a piece. Sponsored by Lehman Brothers. Fourteen further performances ending July 24.</p>

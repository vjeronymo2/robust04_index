			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL POSTPONES PROPOSAL FOR ALCOHOL SALES IN PARK  </P> <P> The City Council has postponed indefinitely a proposal to allow alcohol sales  in certain facilities at the city's largest park. The council voted unanimously  without discussion Monday to remove a staff recommendation from the agenda.  </P> <P> The proposal would have raised approximately $60,000 a year by allowing the  sale of alcoholic beverages at South Gate Park. Sales would have been  restricted to the auditorium, Girls' Clubhouse and golf course.  </P> <P> More than 150 people crowded into the council chamber during the meeting. Many  were opposed to the proposal, including pastors and members of local churches.  </P> <P> "We feel alcohol is more of a liability than an assest. We would need more  police protection," said the Rev. George Jameson, president of the South Gate  Ministerial Alliance.  </P> <P> "As an All-America City, we would not be setting a fine example to let  everybody know we are putting alcohol in the park," Jameson said. South Gate  was recently honored as an All-America City by the National Civic League.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert A. Philipp said the crowd did not influence the council. Philipp  said the recommendation originally had been planned for discussion along with  other items for the 1990-91 budget. When it became clear that those items would  not be ready for discussion, he decided to drop the alcohol proposal, Philipp  said.  </P></p>

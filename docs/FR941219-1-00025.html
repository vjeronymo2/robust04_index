			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended section 513 of the Cost Savings Act to expand the scope of the alternative fuels it promotes. The amended section provided incentives for the production of vehicles using, in addition to alcohol and natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal derived liquid fuels, fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials, electricity (including electricity from solar energy), and any fuel NHTSA determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 513 continued to provide incentives for the production of dual fuel vehicles, i.e., vehicles that operate on one of a now expanded list of alternative fuels and on gasoline or diesel fuel. NHTSA notes that some statutory terminology was changed by the 1992 amendments. Among other things, the terms ``dual energy'' and ``natural gas dual energy'' were dropped, and the terms ``alternative fueled automobile,'' ``dedicated automobile,'' and ``dual fueled automobile'' were added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 513 also continued to require dual fueled passenger automobiles to meet specified criteria, including meeting a minimum driving range, in order to qualify for the special treatment in the calculation of their fuel economy for purposes of the CAFE standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One change made by the 1992 amendments concerning driving ranges was that, under section 513(h)(2), the minimum driving range set by NHTSA may not be less than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles. The amendments also provided that the agency may not, in response to petitions from manufacturers, set an alternative range for a particular model or models that is lower than 200 miles, except for electric vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 amendments necessitate amending part 538. First, the existing 100 mile minimum driving range for vehicles previously categorized as ``natural gas dual energy'' vehicles must be raised to at least 200 miles. Also, NHTSA must establish a minimum driving range for the expanded scope of dual fueled vehicles. Part 538's petition procedures also need to be amended to conform to the new statutory provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to necessitating amendments to part 538's driving range provisions, the 1992 amendments also require NHTSA to ``determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels other than natural gas *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Such a measurement is needed to carry out the special fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this document, NHTSA is proposing to amend part 538 to make it consistent with the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act. As discussed below, the agency is proposing to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles. NHTSA is also proposing to remove the petition procedures until it sets a minimum driving range for electric dual fueled passenger automobiles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency notes that, due to the complexity of the issues relating to establishment of a minimum driving range for electric dual fueled passenger automobiles, otherwise known as hybrid electric vehicles, it is addressing that issue in a separate rulemaking. On September 22, 1994, NHTSA published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 48589) a request for comments seeking information that would help it develop a proposal in that area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is also proposing in this document to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Part 538, gallons equivalent measurements for compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, and hythane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that, on July 5, 1994, the Cost Savings Act was revised and codified ``without substantive change.'' The provisions formerly found in section 513 of the Cost Savings Act are now at 49 U.S.C. 32901, 32905, and 32906.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Minimum Driving Range for Dual Fueled Passenger Automobiles Other Than Electric Vehicles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA is proposing to set the minimum driving range for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As before, the agency is required to consider the following factors in prescribing a minimum driving range: The purposes of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, consumer acceptability, economic practicability, technology, environmental impact, safety, driveability, performance, and any other factors considered relevant. Moreover, given the purposes of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act and its legislative history, NHTSA continues to believe that the minimum driving ranges should be low enough to encourage the production of dual fueled passenger automobiles, yet not so low that motorists would be discouraged by a low driving range from actually fueling their vehicles with the alternative fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, NHTSA addressed the appropriate level for minimum driving range in April 1990. The agency believes that the only relevant changed conditions since that time are: (1) the decision by Congress to require the minimum driving range for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles to be at least 200 miles, and (2) the expanded scope of dual fueled passenger automobiles for which a minimum driving range must be established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 538 currently specifies a minimum driving range of 200 miles for alcohol dual fueled passenger automobiles. The agency does not believe that any relevant events have occurred since that range was established that should lead to a different range. NHTSA notes that alcohol dual fueled vehicles are designed so that the same fuel tank is used for either alcohol or gasoline. The available space in a passenger automobile for fuel tanks is limited. In setting a driving range of 200 miles for these vehicles, the agency was concerned that a higher minimum range could require some automobiles to be redesigned to accommodate larger fuel tanks, thereby discouraging the production of such vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

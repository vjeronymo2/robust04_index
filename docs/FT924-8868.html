			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Observer: EC come, EC go What is the Yorkshire Post doing for Europe? Furnishing the community with straight-talking PR men from the ranks of its past employees, it would seem. Following indications that former Downing Street press spokesman and strident Euro-sceptic Sir Bernard Ingham may be off to the European Commission to help improve its image, fellow Yorkshireman John Wright, head of press relations at the Central Statistical Office, reveals that he has decided to jump on to the Euro-bandwagon. Wright, 49, is off to Luxembourg to take charge of press contacts at Eurostat, which co-ordinates statistics for all EC member states. Like Ingham, Wright worked on the Yorkshire Post, and, while his private views on the grand European endeavour are not known, he does share something of his more famous former colleague's well-known irascibility. While Sir Bernard gained notoriety through acting as Lady Thatcher's mouthpiece, Wright too has had to work in recent months for a sometimes unpredictable boss in the shape of Australian Bill McLennan, who took over as head of the CSO in March. McLennan, CSO officials say, actively encouraged Wright to seek glory on a broader plane. What does that mean?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held in  Moscow to commemorate the lapse of 30 years since the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began working at the Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.    Present there were Vladimir Tolstikov, chairman of the  Central Council of the Russian Association for Friendship and  Culture Cooperation with the DPRK; Victor Anpilov, secretary of  the Central Committee of the Communist Workers' Party of Russia  and chairman of the Executive Committee of the "Working Russia"  movement; Valery Sklatov, co-chairman of the Executive Committee  of the National Salvation Front and chairman of the Russian Free  Patriotic Party for "revival"; deputies to the state Duma of  Russia, men of science and the press.    Speeches were made at the meeting.    Noting that Comrade Kim Chong-il is an outstanding and rare  statesman, Vladimir Tolstikov in his speech said it is entirely  a result of the wise guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il that Korea  is confidently advancing along the road chosen by it, not  wavering even in the current complicated situation in which the  U.S.-led imperialists are increasing pressure.    Mikhail Kapitsa, former director of the Institute of  Oriental  Studies of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, said that  everything is going well in Korea under the wise leadership of  Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il.    He further said:    "The question of succeeding the revolutionary cause has been  successfully resolved in Korea.    "Comrade Kim Chong-il is an authoritative leader.    "The imperialists are threatening Korea over the `nuclear  issue'. But threat can never work on the Korean people."    Victor Anpilov in his speech said no force on earth can  match  the Korean People's Army which has been strengthened and  developed to be invincible revolutionary Armed Forces under the  guidance of Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding military  strategist.    General Valentsin Varennikov, vice-minister of defence of  the  former Soviet Union, stressed that the Korean people should have  a great pride in their illustrious leader.    A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the meeting.</p>

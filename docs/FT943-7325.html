			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Potato growers' rebellion defeated Rebel potato growers who wanted to expose the industry to market forces overnight have been overwhelmingly defeated in a poll of the country's 15,000 producers. Growers voted by 81 per cent to 19 per cent to keep the Potato Marketing Board for the next three years while the industry discusses its successor. Mr John Heading, the board's chairman, said: 'This is a victory for common sense, but also a strong mandate for change through the PMB. As a potato grower myself I am well aware of the need for a national organisation to look after our collective interest in highly competitive, unregulated markets.' The board's future had been in question since 420 growers called the poll last month, saying that the 60-year-old board had outlived its usefulness and should be abolished. Mr Graham Solari, chairman of the rebel Potato Producer Poll Campaign, said he would press his supporters to back the board in its three-year transition to the open market. He said: 'The PMB have moved their position considerably . . . in that their expectations of the costs of operating the scheme have been considerably reduced.' The dispute over the board was triggered by last November's government decision to scrap its principal function - supporting prices in a glut  - and to wind it up in 1997. Rebel growers, unhappy about the levies they pay to the board, demanded that it be scrapped so the industry could set up a 'lean and efficient' organisation for potato promotion and research. Mr Heading said the board would be planning the successor body, reducing the levy progressively from Pounds 48 a hectare to no more than Pounds 35, and trimming services and staff.</p>

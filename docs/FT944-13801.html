			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A lone knight among business school deans Sir, I note the reference to my former students, Sir John Egan and Sir Iain Vallance, in your Survey of Business Schools - An A-Z Guide (October 17), together with the observation that 'no business school deans are thought to have been awarded knighthoods'. May I, for the record, point out that I was knighted as principal of the London Business School in 1984 for services to management education. Your report comments on the fact that Sir Graham Day and Sir John Harvey-Jones did not have MBAs. Neither have I. But Graham Day did hold the position of professor of business administration at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, 1977-81. May I put him in my team rather than Sir John's. Jim Ball, professor of economics, London Business School, Sussex Place, Regent's Park, London NW1 4SA</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / The strain and pain in Spain: The path to convergence with leading EC economies is tough If Spaniards thought that their transition to democracy in 1977, their entry into the European Community in 1986 and the growth of the economy ahead of the single market next year entitled them to enjoy the fruits of success, they are now being disabused of the idea. Tomorrow, a half-day general strike will probably shut the country down. Another full-day stoppage is planned for October. The nation's political pulse has suddenly quickened as the government, having dawdled through its third term until now, has launched a raft of policies to lock the country more tightly into Europe - policies that directly threaten the political power of Spain's trade unions. Their focus is convergence with the leading Community economies and the government's determination that Spain becomes a founding member of European economic and monetary union in 1997 or, at the latest, 1999. Spain wants to be a founder member because it fears that otherwise it will be left behind in the second tier of European development, along with Greece and Portugal. To get there, Spaniards are being asked to make another huge social and economic effort and, for the unions at least, the price is too high. For its part the government is certain that it has the country on its side. 'Spain now has an historic opportunity to form part of a process of political integration in the most developed, rich and, maybe, the most socially advanced part of the world,' said Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, to parliament recently. Convergence with strictly defined macroeconomic criteria was the centrepiece of the Maastricht Treaty in December. To join the founders of Emu, Spain has to cut public-sector deficits from 4.4 per cent to 3 per cent of gross domestic product; bring long-term interest rates to within two points of the lowest in the EC; take the peseta into the narrow band of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism by 1994; hold public-sector debt below 60 per cent of GDP; and cut inflation to within 1.5 points of the three best performers in the EC. Spain's public debt as a percentage of GDP is one of the lowest in the Community, but it faces an uphill battle against inflation, which has risen from an annual 5.5 per cent at the end of 1991 to 6.5 per cent now. Worse, last year's public-sector deficit of Dollars 25bn is being fuelled by spending on infrastructure and social provisions such as health and education by both the central government and the country's 17 autonomous regions. The government's need to borrow is, in turn, the chief cause of the country's high real interest rates, now hovering at about 6 per cent. For Mr Solchaga, the prime minister's commitment to Maastricht has been a blessing. The finance minister has for years been keen to cut deficit growth and to discipline the economy. More often than not, he has been prevented from doing so by the left-wingers who dominate the Socialist party administration. Now Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, has been told bluntly by his finance minister that unless Spain radically cuts spending, it will not be able to meet Maastricht's convergence targets. For a man who has dedicated 10 years in government to putting Spain at the EC's top table, not converging is a shocking prospect. He appears to have given Mr Solchaga carte blanche to achieve his goal. By March, Mr Solchaga had his Convergence Plan ready. He had two main targets: the country's employment agency, Inem, and the body that administers the national health system, Insalud. In the past three years Inem, which runs unemployment offices and pays benefits, accumulated a deficit of Dollars 4bn, which was due to rise to Dollars 6bn by the end of this year. As economic activity has slowed, employers are not renewing the short-term job contracts introduced by the government in 1985. The number of people eligible for benefits has increased sharply. Less than a week after publishing his Convergence Plan, Mr Solchaga decreed sharp cuts in the amount of unemployment benefits payable and doubled the time required to qualify for benefits to a year. The measures could save Dollars 4bn this year but the unions have responded with a programme of strikes and increasingly vitriolic verbal assaults on the government. In the words of one union leader: 'It is the biggest attack ever on the workers by a democratic Spanish government.' On the healthcare front, Mr Solchaga also plans to implement sweeping reforms of a system that has overspent its budgets by a total of Dollars 6bn since 1988. Notably, the civil servants who manage the budgets are to become contracted executives who, for the first time, will face dismissal if they do not meet financial targets. Insalud, the central buying monopoly for the hospitals, is to be run as a business and will be phased out as health planning is devolved to regional governments. Unions see the moves to streamline health administration as a first step to privatising it. Together, the Inem and Insalud deficits account for more than 1 per cent of GDP and the attack on them is fundamental to Mr Solchaga's Convergence Plan. But he has also infuriated the left and the unions by establishing goals that go beyond Maastricht's requirements. Where Emu says public deficits should be lower than 3 per cent of GDP, Mr Solchaga has committed Spain to 1 per cent. The finance minister's fervour stems from a fear of two things. First, the possibility that Emu may not happen in the light of German worries over giving up the D-Mark; second, his long experience of his party increasing spending ahead of elections. By the end of 1994 Spaniards will have voted in municipal, regional, general and European elections. For Mr Solchaga, these two factors mean 'the government is doing no more than any responsible government would do, even without Maastricht'. It was inevitable that the unions would oppose the programme. As a result, a united stance by the Socialist party is crucial. To achieve this, Mr Gonzalez has been forced to breathe life back into the political fortunes of the deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra. He resigned as deputy prime minister last year in the wake of a scandal involving political favours to his businessman brother in Seville. Mr Guerra has always had a tight hold on party organisation, and his power has rested in his ability to control the nominations of election candidates. A general election must be held by October next year and Mr Gonzalez seems to have made a simple trade. Mr Guerra will be allowed to manage the election in return for ensuring party solidarity behind convergence. Both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga have publicly hinted that they would rather lose their parliamentary majority than forego the Convergence Plan. Against this, union efforts to mobilise support against the Socialists seem doomed. 'There is a risk,' says Mr Nicolas Sartorius, a leader of the United Left (IU) party, the biggest of the left-wing parties, 'that the strikes may backfire'. Public transport strikes in Madrid and Barcelona in the spring irritated the public, while the decree on unemployment benefits has excluded a much abused scheme that pays benefits to unemployed farm workers in the regions of Andalucia and Extremadura. This scheme virtually captures the large rural vote in these regions for the government. The problem the unions have in trying to generate sympathy is that the context in which the benefit cuts have been made is convergence, and the idea of becoming a leader in Europe is popular in Spain. The unions have thus been forced to try to win support over two tangential threats. The first is a strike law which will restrict union freedom to call and implement strikes; the second has been a decision by the government to freeze all subsidies to public sector companies at current levels. The unions are not alone in the firing line of reform. Mr Solchaga also has the professions and the trades in his sights. Prices in the service sector are rising at roughly double the rate of inflation and he is looking for ways to strip away protective traditions which fix fees and entry into many occupations. If Mr Solchaga's overall strategy sounds bold, the government is confident that it has adequate public backing, particularly from the growing numbers of Spaniards who count themselves as middle class. In 1985, for example, 39 per cent of polled Spaniards said they were middle class. By last summer, that figure had risen to 51 per cent. The government, then, is playing to the economic and European aspirations of a majority of voters, and the only criticism it will listen to now comes from economists sceptical of its ability to put the Convergence Plan into practice. Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief economist at the merchant bank Banco Santander de Negocios, says he believes 1992 and 1993 will be 'low credibility years' for the plan. An election is looming and Mr Solchaga will be under great pressure not to cut spending too much. Also, the plan requires Spain to grow faster than the Community average, while committing it to cutting inflation and deficits in the absence of any real signs of an international economic upturn. Although wage settlements are averaging about 7.5 per cent this year - a full point down on 1991 - several economists wonder whether Mr Solchaga may have bitten off more than he can chew. 'The achievement of these objectives (3 per cent inflation by 1996 and a public deficit of 1 per cent of GDP) seem far from realistic, and carry an important sacrifice in terms of employment and real economic growth,' said a recent report by the Madrid-based Analistas Financieros Internacionales. Mr Solchaga, though, has one and a half tricks up his sleeve to counter the pessimism. Peseta entry into the narrow band of the ERM would require cuts in interest rates, and could encourage exports and stimulate the economy. The half trick is a Spanish invention called cohesion. At Maastricht, Spain managed to persuade its partners to create a 'cohesion' fund to channel extra Community funds to poor member countries seeking to restructure their economies. It was agreed this would be established by 1994. Madrid is now battling to bring the date forward to the end of this year. However, Mr Gonzalez will need all his charm to get this money flowing Spain's way in the face of German and British opposition. 'We need this money,' says Mr Carlos Westendorp, the minister for Europe. Smooth convergence depends on it coming through.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         SPAIN'S CONVERGENCE PLAN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Macroeconomic projections  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage annual variation except where indicated  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1991   1992   1993   1994   1995   1996 GDP and aggregates (percent real growth)   Private consumption           3.0     3.2    3.0    3.0    3.0   2.9   Public consumption            4.4     3.5    2.0    2.0    2.0   2.0   GDP                           2.4     3.0    3.3    3.6    3.6   3.5 Prices and labour costs   Salaries                      8.5     6.5    5.3    4.5    4.0   4.0   Unit labour costs             6.3     4.1    3.6    2.7    2.3   2.3 Employment and unemployment   Active population             0.4     0.6    1.0    1.0    0.9   0.9   Employment                    0.2     0.6    1.6    1.9    1.9   1.8   Unemployment                 16.3    16.3   15.8   15.1   14.3  13.5 Balance of payments   Current account (Pts bn)   -1,598  -1,716 -1,830 -1,752 -1,785 1,811   Percent of GDP               -2.9    -2.9   -2.8   -2.5   -2.4  -2.3 Public administration   Total income                 10.4    11.4    8.8    9.6    8.1   7.8   Total expenditure            11.5    10.0    7.6    7.4    5.9   5.9   Deficit (Percent of GDP)      4.4     4.0    3.5    2.7    1.8   1.0   Public debt (Percent of GDP) 45.6    45.8   45.8   45.3   44.1  42.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Programme de Convergencia.

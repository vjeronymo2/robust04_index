			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Lloyd's Names may be asked for Pounds 8bn more, says survey Lloyd's Names may face demands for up to Pounds 8.65bn from the insurance market over the next 10 to 20 years, according to unofficial estimates released yesterday. Chatset, the research company, warned that Lloyd's could need the money to meet escalating claims from pollution, asbestosis and other court awards in the US. The figure compares with an estimate of Pounds 5bn made by Chatset last year. Mr Charles Sturge, co-editor, said some of the rise was due to the strength of the US dollar during 1992. It also follows an increase last year in notifications of possible claims. Chatset investigated more than 200 Lloyd's syndicates which have been unable to close years of accounts because of uncertainty over future claims. The fresh money would be needed to build up reserves and comes on top of an estimated Pounds 6.5bn of losses suffered by Lloyd's since 1988. Lloyd's reserves for liability business have 'been woefully inadequate', Chatset said in its report. 'Lloyd's does set minimum requirements for reserves but history has proved these to be a joke.' Lloyd's yesterday questioned the basis on which Chatset reached its figures. 'You have to second-guess American juries trying to make forecasts like this,' said a spokesman. The insurance market has begun detailed work on its exposures to US liability policies underwritten in 1985 and earlier which it aims to transfer to NewCo, a new reinsurance company early in 1996. It is also possible some claims could be reduced by 'commutation', which involves case-by-case negotiation with policyholders, said Lloyd's. Nevertheless the figures will cause consternation among Names - whose assets have traditionally supported the market - especially those on syndicates which have specialised in long-tail liability business, in which claims can occur years after policies were underwritten. The accuracy of Chatset's figures has been challenged by Lloyd's in the past. However their forecasts have sometimes proved more accurate than those of the insurance market.</p>

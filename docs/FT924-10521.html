			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Serious surgery needed to staunch flow of red ink Revolution, observed Mao Tse Tung, that great exponent of the art, is not a dinner party. It cannot be advanced softly, gradually, carefully, considerately. Mr Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, learned this to his cost this week as pressure from fellow directors forced him to resign after only 27 months at the helm of the world's largest industrial company. The tall, booming-voiced but kindly Mr Stempel stood accused of failing to move quickly and toughly enough to implement a 10-month-old revolution designed to save the company from financial crisis. He agonised over plant closures. 'The message,' said one analyst, 'is that nice guys don't win.' However, the main message behind the most dramatic US boardroom upheaval in many years is the sheer gravity of the outlook facing GM - a case study in industrial decline stemming from decades of insular, bureaucratic complacency. GM is the world's largest industrial corporation with the biggest turnover, Dollars 123bn in 1991, the biggest workforce, 756,300 last year - and in 1991 the biggest loss ever recorded by a US corporation at Dollars 4.5bn. It still accounts for nearly a sixth of world vehicle production, while its turnover rivals the gross domestic product of a medium-sized industrial country such as Austria. Last year with US losses of Dollars 7bn and a US vehicles sales volume of 4.3m, it lost Dollars 1,631 on every vehicle sold in the US. The group, which has only made a profit in one quarter since Mr Stempel became chairman, is bleeding red ink. It yesterday reported a third quarter net loss of Dollars 753m, bringing its losses for the first nine months of 1992 to Dollars 971m. Nor is there any likelihood of a return to the black in the near future. The outlook is sufficiently bleak for some analysts to be raising the spectre of GM eventually filing under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. That is hardly imminent, but it could become possible two to three years down the road if GM fails to turn round the source of all its problems - its core North American automotive business. For the red ink here is overwhelming the profitability not only of GM's international car operations, but also of its three huge non-automotive subsidiaries - General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), its finance arm, GM Hughes Electronics, the aerospace group, and EDS, the data systems business. Over the past two years the North American car operations have lost a staggering Dollars 12bn, including special restructuring charges, and analysts expect it to lose up to Dollars 4bn this year. Cash has been draining from the business at a disturbing rate and GM has been plugging the gap through additional borrowings and the issuance of some Dollars 4bn of new equity so far this year. The group also has a large unfunded pension liability , which some analysts believe could reach Dollars 12bn, or roughly a quarter of liabilities, by the end of this year. GM's credit ratings remain reasonably good, but Moody's Investors Service is reviewing Dollars 70bn of its debt and Standard &amp; Poor's, the other big rating agency, says it might lower the company's ratings by mid-1993 unless the financial performance improves. The most immediate danger for GM is that the agencies might lower the rating on its commercial paper - low cost short-term money which GMAC relies on heavily. This would raise its borrowing costs significantly. Boardroom concern over the debt ratings may have been a factor in the timing of Mr Stempel's downfall and the more aggressive revamping programme which now seems likely. Yet GM's North American car problems are of such long-standing (and were acquiesced to by many of the non-executive board members now wielding the axe) that a turnround will not come quickly or simply. GM was created in the early years of the century when Mr Willy Durant, an entrepreneur with a passion for motoring, merged together a group of fledgling car businesses. It was then forged into an efficient bureaucracy in the 1930s by Mr Alfred P. Sloan, one of the giants of American industry. But it so came to dominate the US car market, with roughly 50 per cent of all sales in the 1950s and 1960s, that complacency set in. Dominated by finance men (ironically, Mr Stempel was the first chairman with an engineering background since the 1950s), it lost touch with the market place and was ill-prepared for the mushrooming of Japanese manufacturing plants in the US in the 1980s. In the last decade it became mesmerised by futuristic technologies and the drive to build 'the 21st Century corporation'. Its investment of tens of billions of dollars obscured the failure to keep abreast of the basics of successful car-making. GM's share of the car market plunged, from around 46 per cent at the start of the decade to around 35 per cent now, as its dull, poorly designed, look-alike cars, with a dubious quality record, lost ground to the Japanese. However, the company failed to slim down, shielded from the financial implications of its crumbling market by booming US demand and its sheer size. So when recession hit in 1990 it found itself saddled with hugely uneconomic factories and bloated bureaucracies. Mr Stempel, after several early rounds of cutting, finally bit the bullet hard last December when he announced plans for the closure of 21 plants and the loss of 74,000 jobs - 20,000 white collar and 54,000 blue collar - by the mid-1990s. But non-executives on the board, concerned that the revolution was not moving fast enough, staged a mini-coup in April: Mr Stempel was replaced as chairman of the board's executive committee by an outside director, Mr John Smale, while the chairman's right-hand man, Mr Lloyd Reuss, the head of north America, was replaced by Mr John Smith, formerly head of international operations. Under Mr Smith, who won his spurs turning around GM Europe in the 1980s, the pace of change has speeded up, but the management has faced increasing opposition, most notably from the United Auto Workers' union, which staged two strikes at local parts plants in the early autumn. These were ostensibly over local grievances, but the so-called 'Apache raids' were widely seen as warning shots to GM over job cuts. The board evidently felt Mr Stempel did not respond to the union threats sufficiently robustly. The position of chairman is expected to be filled, at least on an interim basis, by Mr Smale, a tough manager who revitalised the bureaucratic Procter &amp; Gamble in the 1980s, while Mr Smith is likely to take on Mr Stempel's chief executive mantle. Their most crucial tasks include to: Close assembly and parts plants and use the remaining ones more efficiently. So far GM has only announced the names of 14 of the 21 plants scheduled for closure. More are expected before the end of the year. Conserve cash. Directors may consider cutting the dividend at next Monday's board meeting. Cut its components costs. One of the most dramatic changes instituted by Mr Smith has been the creation of the post of worldwide parts purchasing chief. The aim is to use GM's scale economies to buy components from whatever suppliers around the world can combine good quality with the cheapest prices. Demands for price cuts of 20 per cent or more from some US suppliers have stirred up strong opposition, while GM's own vast network of parts subsidiaries fears it will lose business and jobs. Sell off non-essential components businesses. Mr Smith is expected to announce GM is willing to dispose of some large slices of its parts operations and reduce the company's vertical integration. Quickly cut the size of the workforce. The company has announced plans to speed up by a year its planned 20,000 white collar job cuts, which should be completed by the end of 1993. It is also believed to be negotiating a deal with the UAW which would offer blue-collar workers special financial incentives to leave the company early. This could mean a considerable charge against earnings but could also reduce the potential conflict with the UAW over job losses. Negotiate a new labour pact with the UAW. The current three-year deal, due to expire a year from now, contains remarkably generous GM concessions: any worker it lays off continues to receive virtual full pay out of a special Dollars 4bn company fund. Given the weakness of the car market, there are doubts whether the fund will last till next autumn (which gives the union a strong incentive to support the early retirement scheme), but the UAW will doubtless want the package renewed in 1993. GM will want to negotiate cuts in its healthcare provisions, which have long given the company the nickname 'Generous Motors'. It recently announced plans to make white-collar workers pick up a larger share of their health costs. Rationalise its engineering and manufacturing organisations. Last week Mr Smith announced plans to cut from six to four the number of GM car engineering and manufacturing divisions in north America, with the loss of some 10,000 white-collar jobs. The idea is to simplify the GM product range, standardise parts not visible to the customer, and eliminate the rivalry between design, engineering and manufacturing operations. The ultimate goal is to cut the number of platforms - the chassis to which different styles of passenger compartment are mated - from nearly 20 to just seven. There is enough ammunition here for any number of UAW 'Apache raid' strikes over the coming months, or a full-blown union-management confrontation next year. However, over the past few weeks union leaders appear to have been adopting a more conciliatory tone and the ousting of Mr Stempel sends a powerful message of management determination. Even if it cuts costs successfully, GM will still face the huge challenge of maintaining its market share, which depends heavily on deeply discounted sales to fleet buyers, such as car rental companies, and conservative, ageing individuals who are gradually dying off. It has some hits, such as the Saturn, a compact car built by a separate company which imitates the best Japanese practices, but is weak in buoyant sectors such as sports utility vehicles, mini-vans and mid-sized saloons. The turnround of its operations in Europe (where the market is weakening) shows what GM can do, yet the US is a far larger and more complicated operation, and time is very short. Mr Smith's Long March could become very gruelling.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN SENTENCED TO 6 YEARS FOR KILLING LOVER  </P> <P> A 31-year-old woman who said she strangled her 60-year-old lover to end four  years of physical abuse was sentenced Wednesday to six years in state prison.  </P> <P> Shawn May, who lived in Lawndale with Walter Billingsley, pleaded guilty to a  single charge of voluntary manslaughter in connection with Billingsley's death  on July 9.  </P> <P> Torrance Superior Court Judge Francis Hourigan could have sentenced May to a  minimum of three years or a maximum of 11.  </P> <P> According to a probation report, May told police that Billingsley beat her  often during their four-year relationship. Billingsley had been beating her in  a drunken rage on the morning of July 9 before he passed out on a bed, she  said.  </P> <P> May, an admitted alcoholic and drug addict who also was drunk that morning,  said that after Billingsley passed out, she realized she "couldn't take it  anymore," wrapped a leather strap around his neck and choked him to death.  </P> <P> Frightened by what she had done, May then ran to the house behind hers to ask  her landlord what she should do, police said. He told her to call 911.  </P> <P> A probation officer urged Hourigan to sentence May to a significant term in  prison, warning that she needs treatment to avoid repeating the same mistakes  again.  </P> <P> "If the defendant is allowed to remain in the community, she will not work on  the alcohol problem, and it is a possibility that she will involve herself in  another co-dependency relationship that may again prove fatal."  </P> <P> May will be eligible for parole in about three years.  </P></p>

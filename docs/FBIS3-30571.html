			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mile Akmadzic, minister of foreign </F> relations and interrepublican cooperation of the Croat republic  of Herceg-Bosna, by an unidentified correspondent; correspondent  in studio and Akmadzic in Siroki Brijeg--live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Our guest this evening is Mile  Akmadzic, minister of foreign relations and interrepublican  cooperation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Mr.  Akmadzic, good evening.    [Akmadzic] Good evening.    [Correspondent] We are pleased to welcome you once again to  our program. It seems that many interesting things have been  happening on the eve of the next round of the Geneva talks that  are scheduled for 8 February. It looks as if Croats are in  vogue once again. Several events have led to the conclusion  that considerable pressure has been exerted on the Croatian  negotiating team and on the Croatian state. Do you have the  same feeling?    [Akmadzic] I have this feeling, naturally. However, I would  like to say that pressure is being put on all the three warring  sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. on all the sides that are  taking part in the Geneva talks, which means the three warring  sides as well as the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  and Croatia, which are also taking part in the Geneva talks.  The pressure has been planned in advance. It has been exerted  for a long time, and I believe that it has now been intensified  to a certain extent.    [Correspondent] Within the context of this pressure, the  most  interesting thing was the recent speculations about sanctions  against Croatia. How would you comment on yesterday's  accusations and claims contained in Butrus-Ghali's report, i.e.  his letter to the UN Security Council about members of the  Croatian Army fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina? As we could see,  the figure in question is 3,000-5,000 Croatian soldiers.    [Akmadzic] This first started with a letter to the UN  Security Council president by Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic  in which Silajdzic accused Croatia of armed intervention in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have -- I personally and many other  structures in Herceg-Bosna and in the Republic of Croatia --  strongly denied these accusations. There are no regular units of  the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is certain; this  is absolutely true. Namely, there are only volunteers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, who reported as individuals or as small  organized groups to defend their homes, their homeland, and  their families in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This is, therefore, not an intervention in  Bosnia-Herzegovina  from the outside. I said before that both Mr. Izetbegovic and  Mr. Silajdzic have known this. They knew about the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina a year ago, and the situation has not changed  since. There is nothing new. The new situation is that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has been suffering defeats in its [word  indistinct] actions against the HVO [Croatian Defense Council].  Because of this, it is looking for excuses and looking to  justify itself by accusing the Republic of Croatia.    [Correspondent] Either way, the fact is that everyone has  taken yesterday's Butrus-Ghali letter seriously. For instance,  the Danish foreign minister has already announced that Denmark  would call for sanctions against the Republic of Croatia at the  next session in Brussels on 7 and 8 February. On the one side,  we have your stand, and on the other is a report from the United  Nations.    [Akmadzic] Of course, what the world is thinking is what is  important and not just what has been happening. I must say that  the present situation -- in this respect -- is very serious. I  believe, however, that the world will see and that we will prove  -- through international observers, UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] -- that there are no regular units in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Likewise, the world cannot consider  individuals from Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina as the Croatian  Army's presence and then threaten Croatia in some way. I would  not say that sanctions will be introduced in Croatia. I think  that this would be too strong. There will be no sanctions. The  international community is aware of the fact that it would be a  very bad and risky move on their part. I do believe, however,  that the Croatian delegation will be cautioned in Geneva, and I  hope it will end on this.    [Correspondent] But could this pressure result in the  Croatian side's concessions at the Geneva talks -- in unwanted  concessions?    [Akmadzic] There is no question of any concessions. As far  as the talks on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned,  we are negotiating about a lasting political solution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are not talking about an isolated case  that happened and that could [word indistinct] such fundamental  decisions as the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There will  be no concessions. The international community -- both the EU  and the United Nations -- gave us their support so that what has  been promised and given as concession [words indistinct] will  remain and that the Croatian side will keep to that. There will  be no fresh concessions or demands for fresh concessions.    [Correspondent] In our program last night, we talked to Mr.  Jelic about the Croatian convention, which is to take place on  Sunday, 6 February in Sarajevo. You are also going to be there.  What information do you have about the convention? What are  its objectives, and what stance will you take there?    [Akmadzic] I have registered to take part at the Croat  convention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would call it a so-called  convention. It is really a gathering of Croats that has no  legitimacy with regard to representing the Croat people.  [passage omitted]    I will travel to Sarajevo on 5 February to take part in the  talks between the Croatian, Muslim, and Serbian people--which  regularly take place at the airport. These talks on  reestablishing mutual trust are held on the level of a working  group. If it is possible for me to stay the night in Sarajevo,  if UNPROFOR gives me permission, I will stay and attend the  convention. As things stand now, however, this is not likely.  It seems that it will not be possible for me to stay.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that there will be nobody  from  Herceg-Bosna in Sarajevo?    [Akmadzic] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna has requested  that UNPROFOR allow some people to attend, the people who were  designated to attend by the coordination committee in Sarajevo  that convened the gathering. We have not received any reply to  confirm that we will be allowed to enter Sarajevo. If we do  receive it, we will go to Sarajevo, of course.    You also mentioned the extraordinary session of the Chamber  of Deputies, our fifth session so far, scheduled to take place  in Livno on 8 February. This will be a session of the extended  Chamber of Deputies. I would, in fact, call it a real  convention, although it is not officially a convention. All  current political and military questions, the current military  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be discussed there. The  Chamber of Deputies is expected to make some very concrete  decisions, outlining the direction for the Croatian people at  this very important historic period, at this very difficult time  for the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Croatian people are facing aggression, first by the  Serbs  and then also by the Muslims, in continuous fighting that has  been going on for a long time. We must make a decision on the  course of our further activities. We must decide which path to  take in the search for peace because our lasting objective is  peace, not peace at any cost, but peace within the limits of  justice and what the Croatian people deserve.    [Correspondent] Let us get back to the gathering in Sarajevo  on 6 February. You said it was a so-called Croatian convention.  The fact is that nobody is entitled to prevent Croats who  remain outside of the borders of Herceg-Bosna from trying to  articulate their interests. They really are in a specific  position, and it is a fact that a number of Croats remain  outside of Herceg-Bosna, outside of the region that will  probably be one of the three parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They  do have the right to articulate their interests. What objections  do you have to their gathering? Why are they [word indistinct]?    [Akmadzic] I said so-called convention because the word  convention usually means a legislative body. [passage omitted]</p>

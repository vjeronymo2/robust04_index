			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard advance fails to match forecasts HEWLETT-PACKARD yesterday reported a 44 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings, but failed to live up to Wall Street's more optimistic projections. The computer and electronics group's stock fell sharply to trade at Dollars 71 1/8 at midday, down from Monday's close of Dollars 75 1/4 . Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 271m, or Dollars 1.06 per share, well below analysts' projections of around Dollars 1.20 per share. In the third quarter last year, net earnings were Dollars 188m, or 75 cents. Expectations for HP's third quarter had been inflated by the strong rate of growth in orders placed during the first half, despite earlier warnings that it expected slower order growth in the third quarter. The rate decline, from 26 per cent in the first half to 19 per cent in the third quarter, was nonetheless 'a bit disappointing', said Mr Lew Platt, HP president and chief executive. Order growth slowed substantially in Europe and slightly in Japan, he said. However it remained 'healthy' in the US. Net revenue for the third quarter grew 23 per cent to Dollars 5bn from Dollars 4bn in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue in the US was Dollars 2.4bn, up 28 per cent, while international revenues totaled Dollars 2.6bn, an increase of 18 per cent from a year ago. International sales growth was dampened by sluggish sales in Europe, the company said. 'Our results are a major improvement over last year's third quarter, with profit margins up and earnings growing faster than revenue,' said Mr Platt. Operating expenses rose only 9 per cent, despite revenue growth of 23 per cent, due to tight expense controls, he added. 'We've been working to create a leaner, more productive company, and this result shows real progress toward that goal.' The company was unhappy, however, with a sharp rise in third-quarter inventory levels, particularly in its personal computer printer group, which stockpiled parts in anticipation of a strong fourth-quarter seasonal surge in sales. For the first nine months, net revenue increased 21 per cent to Dollars 14.6bn. Net earnings rose 8 per cent to Dollars 879m, or Dollars 3.47 per share, from Dollars 813m, or Dollars 3.21, in the same period last year. Comparisons exclude the effect of a Dollars 332m after-tax charge last year for a change in accounting standards for retirement benefits. Mr Platt said improved profitability remained the company's top goal. 'Our new product programs are aimed at pursuing and creating revenue growth opportunities,' he said.</p>

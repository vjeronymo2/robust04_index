			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Books: Delicate relations - How Germany's reunification came about IN EUROPE'S NAME: GERMANY AND THE DIVIDED CONTINENT by Timothy Garton Ash Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 680 pages IN FEBRUARY 1989, during an interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, I asked why he no longer used the word 'Wiedervereinigung' (reunification) to describe West Germany's constitutional goal of unity with East Germany. Kohl said he preferred the phrase 'Einheit der Nation' (unity of the nation). 'Under Wiedervereinigung one understood something else, the attachment of the GDR (East Germany) to the Federal Republic,' he explained. 'Isn't that the idea?' I persisted. 'The idea - the vision - is that we want the political unity of Europe,' the chancellor replied, somewhat lamely. When I rammed home the question again, Kohl burst out: 'The difference is that you are a prophet, and I am only the chancellor.' That dialogue - just nine months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 20 months before Kohl became chancellor of united Germany - certainly shows how unification came as a surprise. It also neatly illustrates a theme at the centre of Timothy Garton Ash's immaculate account of German post-war Ostpolitik. Successive West German chancellors believed that 'reunification' could only take place as part of a gradual move towards ending the overall division of Europe that formed the (apparently) enduring legacy of Hitler's war. In view of their belief that a speedy 'attachment' of the GDR was impossible, West German governments during the 1970s and 1980s concentrated on stabilising East Germany politically and economically. By improving the lot of East Germans, they believed the policy would facilitate democratic reforms - judged the best long-term route to reforging the nation. In fact, West Germany's unjustified confidence in East Germany's solidity prevented rather than furthered reforms east of the Elbe. But, at a time when Michail Gorbachev was trying to remodel Soviet communism, East Germany's out-of-touch leaders' refusal to follow suit dramatically increased their own unpopularity and their state's economic problems. West and East German illusions about East Germany's ability to survive thus reinforced each other. Collapse into the arms of its prosperous, alarmed neighbour-brother became inevitable, precisely because it was unexpected. Garton Ash's teasingly dialectical writing style is well suited to describing a plot of Smileyesque convolutedness. Unique sensitivities surrounded (and surround still) German reunification. The path to it was thus a game of mirrors. From Konrad Adenauer's time onward, no policy, no action, no statement, no objective, no outcome - and certainly no politician's after-the-event account of any of these things - could ever be taken at face value. This was a cautious journey, not only two-track, but also in two directions at once. Efforts first to form and then to develop relationships with the Soviet Union and the GDR would succeed only if Bonn at the same time made maximum efforts to extend its anchor within the European Community and Nato. Two points stand out. The first is that the Soviet Union, with a taste for and understanding of Realpolitik surpassing that of the word's original inventors, had a good idea all along of what was going on. Referring to the reasons behind Chancellor Willy Brandt's overtures to East Berlin, Leonid Brezhnev warned East German leader-to-be Erich Honecker in 1970: 'He expects to penetrate you.' Brezhnev added (half-correctly), 'But with time he will find that ever harder.' The Soviet Union had far more insight than West Germany into East Germany's true weakness, and also probably during the 1980s sensed it would not send in the Red Army should Honecker's power totter. Gorbachev was charmed by Kohl's daringly sentimental talk - during a walk by the Rhine in June 1989 - of how reunification would be in both nations' long term interests. An agonising choice for Gorbachev, to be sure. German unification might well profit Russia. First, however, as part of the dismantling of the Stalinist order, the Soviet empire would have to disappear. The second point relates to West Germany's relations with its eastern and western European neighbours. The Federal Republic's transmutation into a modern, efficient, non-revanchist EC state - both model and magnet - increased its economic power and its reputation as a reliable partner. Because everyone in Europe (Bonn included) believed Wiedervereinigung was no longer feasible, the Federal Republic, almost imperceptibly, gained the leverage and muscle to put it speedily into effect when the chance came. After the Wall fell, Margaret Thatcher's unrealistic (and small-mindeded) assessment that Kohl should try to delay reunification matched the chancellor's equally inaccurate avowal (in 1988) that he would not live to see it. As he applies his spatula to this canvas of paradox and dilemma, Garton Ash paints in the emotions as well as the politics guiding the practitioners of Ostpolitik. The Social Democrats' veteran strategist, Egon Bahr, is rebuked  -despite the brilliance and eventual success of his 1963 concept of Wandel durch Annaherung (change through rapprochement) - for increasing the SPD's disarray in 1980s dealings with East Berlin. For all the book's copiousness, there are some lacunae. More detailed treatment of Bonn's late-1980s dispute with the allies over short-range nuclear missiles - crucial to inspiring solidarity among East and West Germans, since they would be the only people killed if the weapons were ever fired - would have been welcome. Garton Ash glosses over the remarkable lack of curiosity towards East Germany by the West German media - cause and effect of declining belief in Wiedervereinigung. While he offers the exceedingly general precepts that united Germany should redefine its national interests and avoid 'emotional over-reaction', Garton Ash ducks analysis of the effects of unification on the rest of Europe. Kohl sees his new twin-track task as combining German unity with European unity. Successfully steering both processes may, however, prove as daunting as anything faced by the architects of Ostpolitik.</p>

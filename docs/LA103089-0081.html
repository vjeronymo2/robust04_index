			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> REAGAN FILLS IN BUSH ON JAPAN  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan telephoned President Bush on Sunday to report on  his $2-million trip to Japan and his talks with high-ranking leaders, a White  House spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan also discussed his observations on  his weeklong trip with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.  </P> <P> Fitzwater was unable to say whether Bush and Reagan had discussed the  controversial aspects of Reagan's journey to Japan. The former President was  criticized in some quarters for accepting $2 million for two 20-minute speeches  in Japan. But Nancy Reagan earlier defended the commitment, claiming that  Japanese business groups sponsoring the trip were getting "two-fers," which  included appearances by both Reagans.  </P> <P> The former President also was criticized for praising Sony's takeover of  Columbia Pictures, claiming the Japanese firm would make more moral and decent  films than Hollywood. He also apparently will receive $1 million from Sony for  his presidential library.  </P></p>

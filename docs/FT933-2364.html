			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Books: In pursuit of gossip - Anthony Curtis follows a high-level Aga saga THE LETTERS OF NANCY MITFORD: LOVE FROM NANCY edited by Charlotte Mosley Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 20, 538 pages IN THOSE country houses where bedrooms are always kept ready for guests, this collection of Nancy Mitford's letters will make an appropriate addition to the books thoughtfully placed there. One or two of these effervescent epistles should provide an ideal nightcap. But consumed in bulk in the belief that here is a volume comparable in readability to novels like The Pursuit of Love, Love in a Cold Climate, The Blessing, or period-pieces like Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire in Love, The Sun King, the reader is likely to suffer rejection symptoms. Nancy Mitford was a compulsive letter writer. For much of her life she was isolated geographically from the people she loved most and she poured out her thoughts to them in a ceaseless flow. The fact that so much of what she writes seems at this distance of time gushingly trivial is not really her fault. There was no thought of pleasing posterity when these letters were written nor of eventual publication - only of keeping the gossip going. Occasionally letters written for purely private consumption do have the lasting worth to become literature. The classic instance is the correspondence of the Marquise de Sevigne (1626-96). She wrote long chatty letters almost every day to her daughter in another part of France. Nancy's friend Violet Hammersley, 'the Wid' - to whom many of the letters in this book are addressed - made an English translation of Mme de Sevigne. The comparison is not to Nancy's advantage. The Marquise was involved in much of what was going on both at the court and in the country. We owe to her, for instance, an account of the trial of Fouquet; of Vatel's, Louis XIV's chef's, suicide; of a performance of Racine's tragedy Esther. By contrast Nancy seems often tediously absorbed in her own domestic affairs, in buying modish clothes, and in keeping track of who among her wide circle of well-born friends was currently liaising or quarreling with whom. The war forced her to emerge from her shell; a wartime job in a Mayfair bookshop gave her a sense of the workaday world, though many of the customers were her own smart friends. On one occasion, just after the war, her rapidly blossoming reputation as a novelist took her into the hurly-burly of the theatre. She was commissioned in 1949 by HM Tennant to make an English version of Andre Roussin's comedy The Little Hut. Nancy did a fine job, gaining a long run on Shaftesbury Avenue for the piece and providing Robert Morley with a juicy starring role. Nancy was worried about what the author would say to her embellishments of his piece. 'I guess' she concluded, 'so long as it goes well and makes money he won't mind'. He didn't; but disappointingly we get no account of the meeting between them or of the first night. Her friendship with the director  -Peter Brook, aged 25, and already well-known - comes to a sudden unexplained full-stop, and in spite of a handsome share of the gross, she is turned off working for the theatre for the rest of her life. It is almost as if even that degree of exposure to - in her eyes - a common environment was too much for her. What we have, then, is a high-level Aga saga; the Aga in her case being the Aga Khan. Nancy meets him at a party given by Daisy Fellowes at her apartment in Paris in 1948, one of thousands of similar gatherings she attended. 'Mrs Rodd?' he greets her. 'Your grandfather was a great friend of mine . . . I expect you know he just fell between two stools - it doesn't do for brilliant people to be snobs or snobs to be brilliant'. The Aga put his finger on it. For Nancy and her friends, snobbery was their greatest commitment, transcending all other affiliations, professional, political, religious. The extent of the name-dropping in these letters may be gauged by the amount of work the editor Charlotte Mosley has had to do to make them comprehensible to the reader who comes to them un-Debretted. It is nothing short of heroic. There have been two biographies of Nancy Mitford - a personal one by Harold Acton and a comprehensive one by Selena Hastings; and we also have an account of her within the context of the whole family-group in Jonathan Guiness's The House of Mitford (1984). The Letters put more flesh on these biographical bones: they give insights into her draconian childhood, her disastrous marriage to Peter Rodd ('Prod'), whom she did not succeed in divorcing until 1957. She met her great passionate attachment, the Gaullist Free French diplomat, Colonel Gaston Palewski in London during the war, and followed him to Paris afterwards. She never became his wife or his mistress but enjoyed his company often and was in regular communication with him until her death in 1973. Even at her most abject her letters to him have unfailing high-spirits, her redeeming virtue. He is always addressed in English; as 'Dear darling' or sometimes jokingly as 'Dear Colonial'. Many of her friends and relations are likewise known by their in-group nick-names. Those for her own family have become common currency thanks to the books they have published about each other - Farv, Muv (Lord and Lady Redesdale), Debo (Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire) Decca (Jessica), Bobo (Unity, Hitler's admirer who attempted suicide and died in 1948), Bodley (Diana, Lady Mosley) to whom she wrote many of the letters printed here. But who the heck are Keck, Lulu, Honks and Boots? Answer: Cecil Beaton, Louise de Vilmorin, Lady Diana Cooper, Cyril Connolly. All such sobriquets are explicated by Charlotte Mosley in a rash of square brackets within the text. Snobbery breeds deep enmities. Thus the full nickname given to Connolly, perhaps the most brilliant, if not the most snobbish of them all, was Smarty-Boots. When the tables are turned on him and Evelyn Waugh gives The Unquiet Grave a stinking review in The Tablet, Nancy tells Waugh how much she enjoyed his 'Boots-baiting'. Waugh was her great mentor and in her letters to him she is at her most candid. 'You must remember' she tells him almost in tears at his strictures on the manuscript of Love in a Cold Climate, 'That I'm an uneducated woman (her emphasis)'. Nancy also tells Waugh what happened when her mother dined with the Colonel. She picked all the truffles out of her omelette and left them. 'The Col delighted - Most people pick out the truffles and leave the rest, very patrician of her'. Pace Lady Redesdale, I feel that the best way to read this book is the non-patrician way. To pick out the truffles and leave the rest.</p>

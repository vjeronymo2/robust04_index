			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] How good to participate in a union meeting that  dedicated its time to the sector's main problems! That is what  the fourth plenum of the science workers union in the city of  Havana did. The plenum was held recently at the Center for  Medicines Research and Development [Centro de Investigaciones y  Desarrollo de Medicamentos], or CIDEN [acronymn as heard].    The leaders of the science workers union in the capital  agreed to focus their efforts on the union's integrating  influence, on strengthening the base-level organizations, and,  fundamentally, on political-ideological work.    Their analysis concluded that the 146 assemblies of the  Parliaments in the Workplace process held at scientific  institutions, in which more than 28,400 workers participated,  allow us to typify the political situation, the revolutionary  atmosphere, economic management problems, and the monitoring of  sector production and research.    As a first conclusion, they found that the  political-ideological work of the union could be its biggest  contribution to solving problems, based on the workers' high and  militant morale and support for the Revolution. Working from  that premise, the science workers union in the capital laid out  for itself a series of concrete tasks.    The first opportunity will come at the Assemblies for  Economic Efficiency, which are to begin in mid-May. During that  process, each suggestion from the parliaments will be evaluated  and the joint measures to be adopted by the various  administrations, the Communist Party of Cuba, the union, and the  UJC [Union of Young Communists] will start to become concrete  reality. Among these measures are, for example, specific actions  that will establish the obligation to bear in mind cost and  efficiency indicators in connection with each and every task,  decentralized down to the level of every individual researcher,  technician, or support worker.    Another intent is that of taking advantage of the potential  of mechanisms already in force, such as evaluations, to  guarantee the suitability of science workers, in response to a  majority demand expressed during the parliaments.    The union will take precise measures to restore labor  discipline, as much to combat absenteeism as to get every worker  to make the best possible use of the workday and to produce  according to his position. Each center will go into greater  depth regarding the concept and scope of self-financing, based  on the premise that the nation needs for science to continue  increasing its contribution to financing the nation's economy.    Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba  in Havana City Province, expressed his satisfaction at these  vital subjects as the focal point of the attention of the  science workers union. For his part, Alfredo Morales, CTC [Cuban  Workers Federation] secretary general in the capital, used the  occasion to explain that the Assemblies for Economic Efficiency  differ radically from the old Production and Services  Assemblies. He said that it is now the workers -- jointly with  the administration -- who are seeking solutions to difficulties,  and that the discussion now centers not only on production, per  se, but also on efficiency of production. It seems the young  science workers union, and particularly its organizations in the  capital, are setting standards for a union management that has  moved away from mere useless formalities and has set its sights  on the main objectives of contributing to saving our societal  project and attaining development.    The way the science workers union vanguards celebrate their  successes constitutes proof of this. This past Sunday [24  April], they did voluntary work at the Augusto Cesar Sandino  agricultural-livestock cooperative in San Antonio de los Banos.  Meanwhile, the rest of the union members worked at cleaning up  and beautifying their work centers.</p>

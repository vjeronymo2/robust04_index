			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Pressing work in a rural idyll - Nick Garnett meets a couple whose venture allowed them to leave the city IT IS A DREAM many budding entrepreneurs clutch close to their heart. You set up a part-time business venture from your urban home. Then, with a bit of courage and good fortune, you move lock, stock and barrel to a rural idyll and run the company from an office overlooking cow pastures or an orchard. So far, the dream has spawned a financially realistic lifestyle for Alex Hill. Nine years ago, Hill bought two dozen tiny fruit presses from Hungary at Pounds 16 each and sold them from his flat in Brixton, London. After a slow start, the business took root and he and his wife Barbara moved with it in 1987 to a lovely former farmhouse on the Devon side of the Black Down Hills. From a small office at the back of the house, Hill imports and sells those fruit presses, and a range of related equipment such as fruit crushers, hydraulic apple presses and little machines for stripping grape stalks. Vigo Vineyard Supplies sells to Britain's commercial and hobby vineyards, cider and apple juice makers and home wine makers. For the 12 months to April this year, Vigo generated a turnover of Pounds 330,000 on which it returned a pre-tax profit of Pounds 30,000 as well as providing Pounds 20,000 for the family to live on. These figures underplay the profit margin because a lot of gross profit goes into stock. This stood last month at Pounds 50,000 worth. Turnover of more than Pounds 300,000 compares with Pounds 39,000 in 1988-89. 'I guess a lot of people fantasise about doing something like this,' says Hill. 'We love it here and certainly wouldn't go back to London. I couldn't cope with it here though if I was on my own. It's very quiet. You need a family around you.' In 1981, during a cycling holiday in Hungary, Hill spotted small fruit presses for sale; wooden baskets with a metal thread press and cast iron base. Hill, a home wine maker, asked a friend travelling in Hungary the following year to bring one back. 'A lot of my friends saw this and asked whether I could get one for them.' Hill is a former motorbike messenger with a university degree in international relations. He had been working for a relative's import and export firm. 'That taught me that you could buy a shipload of stuff in one place, send it halfway round the world and cream off some money without even seeing the commodity.' Hill visited the trade department of the Hungarian embassy in London and was given the name of the Hungarian trading company that handles exports for the press manufacturer. 'I shipped across two dozen in 1984 using the British freight forwarding company the Hungarian trading outfit used.' Yellow Pages provided the names of home brew shops. 'I borrowed my sister's car and visited 13 or 14 shops in Kent and Sussex. I sold them all straightaway. The ex-works cost was Pounds 16 each and I sold them for Pounds 40.' Hill then plunged in with an order for 400 at Pounds 8,000, the Hungarians providing 180 days' credit. He stored the units under a railway arch. A public library's collection of Yellow Pages provided addresses for 400 shops across the UK selling home brew equipment. With the help of a Pounds 40 a week enterprise allowance, he sent out an A4 advertising sheet. 'We sold all the machines well before the 180 days were up.' Vigo bobbled along, generating between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 40,000 turnover a year and marginal profits and losses until 1989. 'I decided we needed a much bigger range of items. I travelled a lot in Italy, Germany, Austria and France, visiting agricultural machinery and vineyard equipment shows as well as manufacturers. I always came back with briefcases bulging.' The company began selling new items like centrifugal apple mills, hydraulic fruit presses, grape crushers and high-speed de-stalkers. Turnover in 1990 jumped to Pounds 150,000 and to Pounds 232,000 two years later. Vigo's products range from a Pounds 75 crusher to a Pounds 45,000 automatic cider press. Sales are generated by word of mouth and advertising in specialist magazines such as The Grower and The Grape Press. Vigo has taken a warehouse in a nearby village on a 12-year lease and employs a full-time warehouseman and two part-time staff for book-keeping and secretarial work. Transport, advertising, warehousing and staff each cost about Pounds 12,000-Pounds 15,000 a year. The company has financed itself with a little help from a bank overdraft. Vigo presents Hill with some management problems. Tied to the D-mark, the Hungarians are pricing themselves out of the market and eroding Vigo's margins. Hill expects to switch most of his purchasing to Italy, whose 1m registered vineyards support an array of manufacturers. Sales are limited by the size of the UK grape harvest. 'If it's a dismal summer and autumn, and they cannot sell fruit, then we do not sell equipment.' Business is seasonal: 75 per cent of turnover is between August and November. The biggest long-term headache is the indestructible nature of much of the machinery Hill sells. 'It is a worry that when natural growth of the business ceases there is really no replacement market.' So Hill is starting to market products with repeat sales potential, such as corks, bottles and chemicals used in drink-making. The Hills have also been making cider for commercial sales right up to the 7,000 litres a year allowed before the application of excise duty. They have just brought out their own sparkling cider. One thing the business has taught Hill is not to be too confident. One venture failed when he contracted one of the Hungarian companies to make play-pens. They were made badly and fell apart as soon as they arrived, losing him Pounds 5,000. Vigo Vineyard Supplies, Bollhayes Park, Clayhidon, Cullompton, Devon EX15 3PN. 0823-680 230.</p>

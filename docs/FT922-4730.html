			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television If you are fortunate enough to be recovering from some minor ailment you can watch the First Test from Edgbaston all day, starting at 10.55 on BBC1 and switching to BBC2 at 4.00. For those obliged to work in the daytime there is a half-hour programme of highlights at 11.50 (BBC1) and On The Line (8.00 BBC2) provides a profile of Graham Gooch whose leadership has done so much to revive England's cricketing fortunes. The tenth of BBC2's series of short dance programmes commissioned specifically for television, Dance House, is from the Cinderella story. I like the ugly sisters studying ballroom dance diagrams in a book (7.55). Twenty five years after reporting from Israel during the Six Day War, Richard Lindley returns to investigate the continuing gulf in Jerusalem between Arabs and Israelis for This Week (8.30 ITV). True Stories offers a 90-minute documentary, re-edited from a series previously shown only in London, about the woes of living on a high-rise estate in Hackney: cockroaches, squatters, rats, asbestos, alcoholism and so on (9.30).</p>

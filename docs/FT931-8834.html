			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar takes late knock THE DOLLAR fell sharply in late European trading as the US stock market dropped in response to President Clinton's Monday night address, writes Emma Tucker. Strong signals from the US president that he plans an early assault on the budget deficit prompted fears in the market that high tax increases would stymie the economic recovery. Mr Brian Hilliard, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, commented: 'The market is worried that President Clinton's plans to increase taxes will slow down growth and depress company profits.' The US currency sank more than 2 1/2 pfennigs to end in London at DM1.6315, after Monday's close of DM1.6590. The dollar also slid against the yen to Y119.65 from a previous Y120.90. In New York it finished at DM1.6280 and Y119.96. Sterling benefited from the dollar's weakness, ending almost 3 cents better at Dollars 1.4475, and in New York it closed at Dollars 1.4485. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the pound was enjoying a temporary respite from bad news on the economy. He added that today's UK retail sales figures were expected to be quite good and that the market had already priced in a month-on-month rise of about 0.6 per cent. A Confederation of British Industry survey earlier this week suggested that today's official figures could show an even stronger rise. The slightly more optimistic mood was reinforced by figures showing that the government repaid Pounds 3.83bn last month. Although the figure will not alter general gloom about the state of public sector finances in the UK, it was better than forecasts for a Pounds 0.9bn repayment. The pound was also higher against the D-Mark, closing a pfennig up on the day at DM2.3625. In early US trading, however, sterling lost some of its gain against the German currency, with US dealers said to be sceptical about yesterday's relatively better economic data. Trading in other European currencies was quiet, although the Italian lira suffered from rumours of a corruption scandal and reports that last year's budget deficit had overshot earlier estimates by L11,000bn. 'So long as there is a question mark over the government's ability to push through its privatisation programme and bring down its budget deficit, there will be problems for the lira,' said Mr MacKinnon. It ended at L943.3 against the D-Mark, down from the previous close of L935.0. Dealers said the next technical resting point for the lira above a close of L945 would be L990. Pressure is said to be building on current levels, and if political worries intensify, dealers expect the Italian currency to lose ground rapidly. The D-Mark was mostly stronger, climbing against the dollar, lira, pound and yen, but it retreated slightly against the Swiss franc after Monday's firm close.</p>

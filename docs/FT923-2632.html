			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil bauxite venture to cut exports by 600,000 tonnes MINERACAO Rio do Norte (MRN), a joint venture led by the state-owned Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), responsible for 70 per cent of Brazil's bauxite output, will export 600,000 tonnes less this year than it did in 1991. In 1991, MRN sold 8.1m tonnes of bauxite, of which 5.6m tonnes were exported. Mr Fabio Matos, president of Aluvale, CVRD's holding company for the aluminium sector, believes that overall sales will be about 7.5m tonnes this year, with 5m tonnes of exports. Total Brazilian bauxite production last year was 10.3m tonnes. The main reason for the drop in exports is a sharp decline in orders from Venezuela. Sales to that country are expected to fall from 2m tonnes last year to 1.1m tonnes this year. Mr Matos said that the reduction in exports to Venezuela was because of increased domestic output there. MRN has placed some of the bauxite normally destined for Venezuela in other markets, notably the former Soviet Union. He added, however, that 'MRN has never had an aggressive sales policy because it has always had a captive market - the partners themselves'. CVRD controls 40 per cent of MRN. The other 60 per cent is divided among seven companies. Large shares are held by Alcan, the Canadian aluminium producer, and Alcoa, its American competitor. Those multi-nationals are also the two leading aluminium producers in Brazil. The MRN bauxite mine is at Porto de Tombetas, near the northern bank of the Amazon River. Its capacity is about 8.5m tonnes a year, but this year's output will be less. 'We are adjusting production to demand,' said Mr Matos. He added that MRN is also reducing output in order to draw down on high stocks from the beginning of this year, which totalled 700,000 tonnes. 'Judging from the level of stocks at MRN, I don't see much capacity for recuperation in the aluminium market in the short term,' he said. Meanwhile, he denied reports that the Japanese government would delay its plans to invest in an aluminium plant because of the political and economic uncertainty in Brazil. He said that the 31 private partners, who along with the Japanese government make up a consortium called the Nippon Amazon Aluminum Company (NAAC), have agreed to resume investment in the Alunorte project. The plant was 30 per cent finished when construction was halted seven years ago because the Japanese partners balked at further investment. Mr Matos said he expected approval from the Japanese government shortly. He estimated that about Dollars 530m of new investment would be needed. The 1.1m tonne annual capacity plant will produce alumina, the raw material for aluminium manufacturing, primarily to supply Albras, an aluminium ingot producer and another CVRD-NAAC joint venture. Mr Matos said that demand from Albras would be between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes a year. The plant is expected to begin operating in mid-1995, reaching full production by the end of that year.</p>

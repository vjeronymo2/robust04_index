			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fourth modification, new supplemental guidance on generation and use of airport revenue, is being proposed to reflect the statutory mandate of section 112 of the Authorization Act to define certain practices as impermissible revenue diversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While DOT/FAA consider these changes to the guidance on generation and use of airport revenue to be consistent with section 112 of the 1994 Authorization Act, they are not intended to be the sole response to section 112. Additional policy guidance or regulations implementing section 112 will be published. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the mandate of 1994 Authorization Act to adopt procedural regulations is being addressed in separate rulemaking proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, DOT/FAA revise the proposal published at 59 FR 29874 as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Proposed paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 are deleted and the following paragraphs are proposed instead. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``1.2.1 In the case of rates, charges and fees imposed on one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers, DOT will issue a determination on the reasonableness of the rate or charge upon the filing of a written request for a determination by the airport proprietor or the filing of a complaint by one or more air carriers, if DOT determines that a significant dispute exists, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 47129, and implementing regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2.2 In the case of rates, charges or fees imposed on other aeronautical users, DOD/FAA will first offer its good offices to facilitate parties' reaching a successful outcome in a timely manner. Prompt resolution of these disputes is always desirable since extensive delay can lead to uncertainty for the public and a hardening of the parties' positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2.3. In the case of rates, charges or fees imposed on other aeronautical users, where negotiations between the parties are unsuccessful and a complaint is filed alleging that airport rates and charges violate an airport proprietor's federal grant obligations, DOT/FAA will, where warranted, exercise the broad statutory authority to investigate and review the legality of those rates and charges and to issue such determinations and take such actions as are appropriate based on that review. DOT/FAA will remain available to assist in the negotiated resolution of a dispute even after the filing of a complaint.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A new paragraph 4.1.1 as set forth below is added to the proposed policy statement: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``4.1.1 Airport proprietors are encouraged, when entering into new or revised agreements or otherwise establishing rates, charges, and fees, to undertake reasonable efforts to make their particular airports as self-sustaining as possible in the circumstances existing at such airports.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A new paragraph 5.2 as set forth below is added to the proposed policy statement. The current paragraph 5.2 is renumbered as paragraph 5.2.1, and paragraph 5.3 is renumbered as paragraph 5.2.2. Paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5 are renumbered as paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``5.2 In establishing new fees, rates and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under 49 U.S.C. 47107(b)(1), including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A new paragraph 5.6, as set forth below, is added to the proposed policy statement: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``5.6 Subject to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 47107(b)(2), the DOT/FAA consider the following practices to be impermissible uses of airport revenue: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Direct payments or indirect payments, other than payments reflecting the value of services and facilities provided to the airport; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Use of airport revenues for general economic development, marketing, and promotional activities unrelated to airports or airport systems; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Payments in lieu of taxes or other assessments that exceed the value of services provided; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Payments to compensate nonsponsoring governmental bodies for lost tax revenues exceeding stated tax rates.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on October 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Federico Pe&ntilde;a, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary of Transportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David R.

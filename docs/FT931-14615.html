			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney Investors in Euro Disney are hardly paying Mr Robert Fitzpatrick a compliment by marking up its shares some 4 per cent on news of his departure. They could easily be overestimating the significance, though, of what is primarily a symbolic change. Having a French manager at the top, especially one with the business skills of Mr Philippe Bourguignon, may make a difference. The company appears to be signalling a new determination in dealing with the disappointments that have marked its first year of operation. That does not make its problems any less daunting. There are limits to the extent to which Euro Disney can compensate for lower than expected visitor numbers by cutting costs. Now that the pattern of visitor flows has been established, Mr Bourguignon can perhaps adjust some running expenses accordingly, but he can do little about the high fixed costs including the need to service long-term borrowings of FFr 6.2bn. The most promising approach appears to be an attempt to drum up additional business by aggressive marketing, above all in France, where public interest has proved lukewarm. Even if he succeeds, shareholders may not realise much benefit. The company still faces a large burden of deferred payments to Walt Disney in the US which will be a continuing drag on its share price. But Walt Disney has little incentive to change the arrangements as that would only upset its own shareholders.</p>

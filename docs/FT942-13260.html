			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Define the boundaries of quality Sir, The college lecturer who has been drowning in paper work (Letters, April 23/24) is not alone. More and more public sector and charitable organisations are under pressure to introduce quality assurance systems. Paperwork overload reduces the effectiveness of any organisation, and is potentially disastrous for smaller charities. But the truth is that paperwork overload is mostly avoidable. It is the organisation itself which decides the content of its quality system - BS 5750 sets only the framework. Any organisation contemplating introducing a quality assurance system should get advice right at the start from an adviser who thoroughly understands the sort of service the organisation gives. The first discussion should be about what kind of quality assurance system is relevant. If the chosen system is to be BS 5750, then the adviser should ensure that the organisation retains control of its system, and puts in only what helps staff work more effectively for the users of their services, and supports the professional commitment of staff.

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / President's grumbling strikes a chord: Brazilians love it, but the business community and economists are wincing PRESIDENT Itamar Franco has Brazil's business community and economists apoplectic, but his support among the public in general continues at levels that most government leaders can only envy. When Mr Franco visited the historic town of Olinda last week to watch the carnival celebrations he received standing ovations. The latest polls show popularity ratings of 75 per cent. Mr Franco seems to have struck a chord among the Brazilian people, who feel long abused by profit-hungry businessmen and ministers with high-faluting economic theories that have caused a three-year recession, soaring unemployment and public debt, with no visible results in terms of reducing inflation. For many, his down-to-earth honesty and daily gripes have come as a welcome change from the slick talk and glamorous ways of his predecessor Mr Fernando Collor, who was accused of lining his pockets while talking austerity, resulting in his impeachment. Mr Franco, whose thick glasses give him a permanently bemused air, spends his spare time taking his ministers to the circus or watching children's movies like Home Alone 2. He apparently sees no contradiction in wanting low interest rates, low inflation, higher wages and increased public spending and believes that removing three zeroes from the cruzeiro - now 22,800 to the dollar - would weaken it. What traders have called 'the Itamar effect' - off-the-cuff comments on the economy which send the markets plummeting - made its first appearance on the day he took office. Mr Franco said he did not care what the markets in Brazil or the bankers in London and New York thought, and that if foreign bankers wanted to negotiate with Brazil they should learn Portuguese. He woke his first economy minister up early in the morning, furious that an increase in fuel prices had been authorised without his knowledge, and told the press he would take charge of all tariff increases - a situation that drove the head of Petrobras, the state oil company, to resign and pushed the company into red. Discovering that the price of his mouth ulcer cream had gone up, he declared war on the pharmaceutical companies with a series of punitive measures scaring off any potential foreign investment. Criticising the price of cars, he offered incentives to the manufacturers to relaunch the VW Beetle, causing dismay among richer Brazilians eager for the country to start producing up-to-date models. A staunch defender of the state, he suspended the privatisation programme and talked about renaming the currency the cruzeiro forte - 'strong cruzeiro' - as if a simple change in nomenclature could solve all Brazil's problems. Each day a new comment has economists groaning. One trader said: 'Each morning I take a deep breath before I look at the headlines to see the latest from Itamar. He acts as if he is opposition rather than president.' Most damaging of all have been his open attacks on his economy ministers. Mr Gustavo Krause, the first, quit in December after being subject to a series of criticisms from the president. It is not clear how far Mr Franco's strategy is deliberate. Mr Pedro Motta Veiga, director of the Rio-based Foreign Trade Foundation, says: 'I think Itamar is just as much a marketing man as Collor.' The marketing seems to work. Around the news-stands of Brazilian cities can generally be found clusters of ordinary people murmuring in agreement with the president's latest complaints, as if he himself bore no responsibility for the country's problems. But it is not clear how much longer Mr Franco's honeymoon with the public will last. Yesterday the main Brazilian papers were preparing angry editorials over the departure of Mr Paulo Haddad from the Economy Ministry. His replacement, Mr Eliseu Rezende, may not allow himself to be made the scapegoat for inflation in the same way as his two predecessors.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: Realistic small company audit Sir, In the debate about whether a statutory audit should be retained for small companies ('Easing the burden of small company audits', May 28) the CIMA supports a middle way. By allowing a form of certification by a qualified accountant, the full panoply of the audit would not be required while independent assessment would remain as a safeguard. This would not only be more realistic in balancing such factors as protection of interested parties and cost, but would bring the UK more into line with other EC members.

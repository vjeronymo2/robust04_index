			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 22 (XINHUA) -- China's first bonded  textile trading center will be established in the Waigaoqiao  bonded zone in the eastern sector of the Pudong New Area in  Shanghai.    This was stated here today by Wu Wenying, the president of  the China National Textile Council.    The trading center will be located in Huayuan International  Mansion, whose foundation was laid today, and will include an  exhibition hall, a spot-trade market and bonded warehouses for  the display and trading of textile machinery and new textile  products and technologies.    As one of China's largest industrial sectors and the  mainstay  of its exports, the textile industry has seen closer contacts  with international markets and faster steps in restructuring  during recent years, making the establishment of a national free  trade market a necessity, according to Wu Wenying.    The president also explained that Shanghai, as the country's  largest economic center and number one trading port, and blessed  with China's largest free trade zone in Waigaoqiao, has been  chosen to take on the task.</p>

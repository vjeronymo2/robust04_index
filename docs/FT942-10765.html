			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: L&amp;G to reappraise tie with Northern Rock Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest life and general insurance companies, is to seek to devise a new relationship with Northern Rock building society. The need to reappraise Northern Rock's 'tie' with L&amp;G comes from the society's announcement last week that it planned to merge with North of England, to form the UK's 10th largest society. North of England is tied to General Accident, and the merged society could not maintain ties with both insurers. Mr Chris Sharp, Northern Rock managing director, is concerned about whether the society would find it worthwhile continuing a tie against a background of rising compliance costs. Severing the link would represent a further unwinding of relationships between building societies and life insurers, and could also point to a more general reconsideration by insurers of the benefits of having tied agents. Last week, for example, Nationwide, the UK's second largest society, announced plans to end its tie with Guardian Royal Exchange and set up wholly-owned life assurance and unit trust subsidiaries. The Northern Rock board will decide about the future arrangement with an insurer, if any, over the summer - ahead of the effective date of October for the merger. If it ended the relationship altogether, Northern Rock could stand to lose about Pounds 1m a year in premium income. One possibility is that Northern Rock might become, in return for smaller commissions than it receives for being a tied agent, an 'introducer' of business to L&amp;G. On that basis, the society's staff would not give financial advice, but simply pass on 'warm leads' to an L&amp;G sales force. L&amp;G said that losing the tie with Northern Rock would be a 'disappointment rather than a setback': some 40 per cent of new business in 1993 came from its direct sales force, with up to 30 per cent coming from independent financial advisers. However, Northern Rock was its largest tie with a society, since it lost the link with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society. Other recent events may have contributed to making insurers wonder if having tied agents can be more trouble than it is worth: failures to meet regulatory standards relating to tied agents were elements in the record Pounds 300,000 fines imposed on Norwich Union and Premium Life.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin by Olga </F> Bychkova]    [Text] Ivan Rybkin's appearance in the speaker's chair came  as a surprise for many. Needless to say, his name was known  still from his activities in the previous parliament, yet the  image of the State Duma's head seemed to require greater  refinement. Actually Rybkin was elected to the post of chairman  by the skin of his teeth, polling the minimally required number  of votes.    Incidentally, the fact that a representative from the  agrarian-communist bloc was ultimately elected merely  corroborated the expected orientation of the majority in  parliament's lower chamber. But Rybkin, who swopped the  Communist Party for the agrarians after the October events last  year, immediately gave it to understand that he was prepared to  relinquish party partialities for the general weal. And the  beginning of his career as speaker was marked by a categorical  demand made of the government that it should present in five  days a programme for overcoming the crisis in the countryside.  Moreover, the speaker himself was of the opinion that the  beginning of the hard work to observe order in the Duma turned  out to be quite expectable: he had imagined it precisely like  this and considered the first sittings to be perfectly quiet.    MN: But, after all, there were attempts to disturb the  normal flow of the session--when Zhirnovsky yelled whatever he  wanted from the rostrum or when in the middle of the discussion  procedure Nikolai Lysenko decided by all means to speak his mind  from the rostrum about the Russian people being oppressed... No  doubt, all of this will keep repeating. What are you going to  undertake?    I.R.: I believe that no one is insured against this. It is  desirable that sittings should be presided over in such a way  that no such situations should arise in general.    MN: But no matter how it may be presided over, if  Lysenko again decides to battle his way to the rostum at all  costs...    I.R.: I know all the civilized norms of cutting this kind of  acts short. It so happened that I had occasion to thoroughly  study the experience of work at different parliaments existing  in the world. It's a different matter that not everything is  simple with these norms. Whatever is considered elementary in  Britain, Germany or the Netherlands--for instance, the presence  of a bailiff in the hall--may be perceived differently in our  case... But a certain measure of inuring is already in evidence.  If you take the Constitutional Court--its bailiff is a majestic,  important-looking and urbane person. And a sturdy guy at that.  He comes up and says: "Please, Sir let's leave the rostrum." And  leave they do, you know.    There are different variants, too: penalties, fines, denial  of the right to speak in the Duma for a certain time. Let's wait  and see. Evidently, all these norms will have to be introduced  gradually, with account to our mentality, not to provoke  excessive irritation. I pin great hopes on the Duma's Council,  on the leaders of political parties, factions and movements.  Much will depend on the microclimate in the factions. Irritation  and embitterness are neutralized by trust and respectfulness.    MN: And do you believe that Zhirinovsky, for one, will  be receptive to respectfulness?    I.R.: Well, you know, at the beginning of the sittings we  worked for three days on end without days-off. And I must say  that Vladimir Zhirinovsky found a common language with Mikhail  Poltoranin in situations when nobody even expected this.    MN: In what way do you believe does the present  parliament differ from the previous one?    I.R.: The previous Supreme Soviet was smaller in numbers and  therefore more controllable. Our Duma is somewhat more  complicated. Putting it bluntly, this is in general a Congress  held every day. But everyone understands that this must not be  the case. There is a need for an efficient parliament.  Therefore, as you have noticed, we reached a consensus quickly  enough on how to institutionalize the Duma, organize factions  and committees, and hold elections. Thorough work lies ahead,  and only in the course of a mere 20 months if we exclude the  beginning and the end. The role of factions increases as never  before. They must coordinate their interests, and jointly with  them--the political parties, organizations, social strata and  population groups which they represent. The first week of the  work is encouraging.    MN: Where do you believe lies the main danger for this  parliament?    I.R.: There is the danger of repeating the rally-like nature  of previous deputy sittings and "littering" legislative work  with admixtures of various kinds. Therefore, let's say, we have  worked for so long on procedural matters.    MN: And are there no external dangers?    I.R.: I understand what you are driving at. Let us hope that  cooperation between the branches of authority will become  closer, I would not even speak about interaction. It has proved  dangerous to perceive the division of the authorities as their  estrangement from one another. I believe that the October events  have inoculated us against this. I have met with Shumeiko, with  Vitruk and with the President alike. What kind of dangers can  there be? You alone can inflict the greatest harm upon yourself.  And if a person is prudent and receptive to someone else's  opinion, he can avoid dangers. There is but one danger: if we  find no accord, we may lose control over economic processes and  hence over political ones.    There are organizational difficulties. For instance, the  deputies lived during the first week at the Rossiya Hotel. Is it  hard to live there? Yes, it is. It's literally a joint of  natural kind. People of venerable age--the age of statesmanly  maturity--are severed from their families and live in what is in  effect a hostel. Two deputies have already had infarctions. And  the reason lies solely in their conditions of life. These are  people with established habits and with a healthy way of life.  One of them, I can tell you, has in general never smoked or  drunk. Is there a need to decide the question? Yes, there is.  Deputies must be enabled to buy apartments and bring in their  families. I am speaking about strictly prosaic things. Because I  am convinced: the plan of law-drafting activities will not be  implemented unless all these questions have been decided. Is it  possible to find a solution? Of course, it is. Jointly with the  two other branches of authority.    MN: What lessons have you drawn from Ruslan  Khasbulatov's experience on the post of speaker?    I.R.: Substantial lessons. There are several of them. But  since this discussion will be somewhat incorrect, I would not  like to enlarge upon it. If Khasbulatov were next to me or in an  equal capacity...    MN: Have your communist convictions undergone any  changes?    I.R.: Communist persuasions have undergone cardinal changes  all over the world, and especially in our country. Strictly  speaking, besides the five communist-oriented parties which  refused to take part in the elections, all the others, who are  left of the centre, are our Russian left-wing social-democrats.  Gennady Zyuganov is being quite correctly persuaded that he is a  social-democrat, and he need not find excuses to justify himself  in this.    We have accepted the diversity of the forms of ownership and  management, and their equality before the law. If we happened to  do to our country whatever has been done by the social-democrats  of Sweden, the socialists of Austria, the socialists of France,  and so on, what else could we wish our people and the  representatives of our communist-oriented parties? When those  dramatic days happened in October, my friends-agrarians, next to  whom I had spent the whole of my life, were the first to come to  me. After an unhurried, circumstantial conversation we decided  to build an electoral association which would include the  Agrarian Union, the agrarian trade union, the All-Russia Council  of Collective Farms, and the associations of private farmers...  A party plus trade unions--this is actually the agrarian variant  of Britain's Labour Party. Moreover, it has successfully stood  the test of elections. A fully specific, thoroughly political  movement--the prototype of a party in the future.    The gravest consequences of crises have always been heaped  on  the countryside. The countryside pays for everything. It does  this today as well--in chase of the reform's tempo. Is this  justified? They received the crop, delivered it to the state,  and for this grain they have not yet received any money since  July. The debt runs to 1.5 trillion roubles. Nobody bothers to  pay this money. A very formidable phenomenon is emerging in  Moscow--rural peddling: person, coming from the village, takes  with him as much as he can carry--home-made sausage, lard,  butter, honey, and what else, and he begins selling this right  at a Metro station. This is a sign of latent civil war, however  hard it is to pronounce this.    And one more thing. In the 1930s in the family of my  grandfather where there were seven children, my grandmother with  two children alone happened to survive. And my grandfather  himself is lying somewhere near Chita, we still do not know  where his grave is. They died on fertile black earth from  hunger, cold and disease because an effort was made to impose an  idea. It was ruthless, though it was clear that this cut against  life. I would greatly resent it if we revived the same in our  approaches. I had great liking for Yegor Gaidar's team--young,  clever and interesting people. Elegant if you like. But it seems  to me that they have been trying to capture our monopolized  economy with a head-on attack. Yet what is only possible is  dismantling--not destruction. So that, for the same of my  grandfather's memory and to prevent the repetition of whatever  happened to him, I agreed to run on the general federal ticket  of the Agrarian Party of Russia.    MN: What changes have taken place in your personal life  upon your ascent to the post of speaker?    I.R.: None whatsoever besides additional work. My family may  possibly have a sense of greater apprehension for me than  before. But they don't speak about this. My parents feel keenly  for me. I am their firstling, after me there were another  four... My father had a series of insults after the October  events. Although he is not yet too old a person.    MN: In what situations would you consider your stay at  the post of speaker to be impossible for you?    I.R.: For the time being I see no reasons even to speak on  this theme. I am convinced that those who voted against me will  become my allies.</p>

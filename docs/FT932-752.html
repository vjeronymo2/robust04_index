			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: ICI acts over staff options - Restructuring disrupts share schemes SHARE OPTION schemes can be disrupted when companies are restructured - as 18,300 employees belonging to ICI's save-as-you-earn/share-save schemes, and more than 10,000 holders of its personal equity plans, have just discovered. With the former, employees agree to save between Pounds 10 and Pounds 250 a month for at least five years. The idea was for the accumulated money, plus a tax-free bonus, to be used to buy shares in the company at an option price fixed when the savings term began. (Some schemes run on for a further two years, doubling the five-year tax-free bonus). In the 13 years since the schemes were launched, the Treasury and the Inland Revenue have approved various ways of handling the aftermath of mergers and takeovers - including early exercise of options and transfers from one company's scheme to another's - mostly without penalising savers. But the authorities have taken a tougher line with demergers - which were, apparently, not foreseen by legislators early in the 1980s. Demerging firms forfeit the privileged tax treatment of share-save schemes if they adjust the prices of options granted already to reflect the lower value of shares brought about by a demerger, or allow savers to exercise their options ahead of the restructuring. ICI decided to allow holders of options on 3.4m shares priced at Pounds 8.14, Pounds 8.91 and Pounds 9.66 to exercise their options in time to receive a Zeneca demerger share and a Zeneca rights share (nil paid). Holders of options priced at Pounds 11.83, Pounds 12.26 and Pounds 13.81, covering 3.9m company shares, were offered cash instead because exercising the options would have meant paying more than the market value. These amendments to the scheme made the savers liable for income tax on their options or the cash alternative, but ICI paid compensation for the extra tax due. Luckily for the employees, the company was following the example of Racal in the 1991 Vodafone demerger. Employees of BAT in the 1990 split, involving Argos and Wiggins Teape Appleton, lost out on the price reduction resulting from the demergers and faced extra tax without help from the group. Most of the 10,000-plus investors who held ICI shares through the single-company or general Peps run by the Bradford and Bingley building society have chosen to sit out the demerger so far, according to Sean Warters of the society's Pep department. This is partly because of the society's insistence that the terms and conditions of the Peps require investment in ICI, not Zeneca. So, although Pep-holders can keep the Zeneca shares they have received within the ICI plans, the society is selling off the Zeneca rights to re-invest in ICI, and will also use any dividends received from either company to buy more ICI shares. Investors who want to convert an ICI single-company Pep into a Zeneca single-company Pep, or switch a general Pep from ICI to Zeneca, will have to change plan managers, paying an exit fee of 0.5 per cent of the plan value to the society and, probably, setting-up charges to the new manager as well. Switching out of Zeneca is simpler. Pep-holders have until September 30 to make a written request for a sale of Zeneca shares held for re-investment in ICI. The Bradford and Bingley will be charging Pounds 15 plus VAT on top of dealing commission and stamp duty on these switches.</p>

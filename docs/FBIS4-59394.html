			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA)--The Refugee Affairs Committee  under the multilateral talks has concluded its three-day session  here. Delegations from 40 countries, the United Nations, and the  World Bank took part.    Mark Byron, Canadian deputy foreign minister who chaired the  meetings, thanked the Egyptian Government for hosting the  session.    Speaking at a news conference at the conclusion of the  meetings, Byron said that it had discussed the items on its  agenda.    On the issue of the reunification of Palestinian families,  the group welcomed the noticeable increase in the number of  cases since its last meeting in Tunis. He added that a French  working group will follow up on this issue and urged the  involved parties to show more flexibility.    In the sphere of developing human resources and creating new  job opportunities for Palestinian refugees, the Canadian  official said that the United States, Turkey, Germany, China,  the Netherlands, and Israel have declared new initiatives aimed  at increasing job opportunities for refugees and enabling them  to be self-reliant.    The head of the working group on refugees said that  constructive initiatives were proposed in the sphere of public  health that took into account the needs of the refugees in the  West Bank and the neighboring countries.    In the field of child care, Mark Byron said that Sweden  proposed a plan and made an initial contribution of $2 million  for the psychological rehabilitation program.    In the field of social infrastructure, the working group  noted the need to provide for the needs of the refugees within  the framework of what was announced previously. The group also  heard a report by an international investigation committee on  the living conditions of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan's  camps. He added that it was agreed to prepare a data base for  strengthening the Palestinian statistics office, and that  Norway, Canada, the United States, and the EU pledged to prepare  it.    The Canadian official said that improving the refugees'  living standards will promote the peace process, noting that the  Canadian foreign minister announced yesterday that his country  had decided to give $2.7 million to the United Nations Relief  and Works Agency to be used to fund health, educational, and  housing projects for refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. He  added that the overall aid that the international community has  pledged to the Palestinian refugees since the end of October  1993 has reached $50 million.    The working group on refugees started its work on Tuesday;  Egypt's delegation was led by Ambassador Ahmad 'Uthman.</p>

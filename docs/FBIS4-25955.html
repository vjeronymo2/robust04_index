			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Zou Xiangqun (6760 0686 5028): </F> "Nationwide General Inspection of Commodity Prices: Results  Scored, Further Efforts Needed"]    [Text] The excessive price increases since last winter and  spring has caused concern among all social circles. The State  Council made a timely decision on carrying out a nationwide  general price inspection and this won the heartfelt support of  the masses. The people hoped that the general price inspection  would check the momentum of the price increases and urgently  demanded that the relevant government departments take serious  action against the practice of irregularly raising prices and  charges in order to effectively advance reform, promote  development, and maintain stability.    At present, the six price inspection teams which were sent  to  various parts of the country for nearly one month have returned  to Beijing. This article will inform our readers about the  major results of the general price inspection, the problems  discovered by the inspection teams, and their opinions on the  measures for the next step.    The main results: Along with the implementation of  various control measures and the general price inspection, the  rapid price raises throughout the whole country have begun to  abate.    At present, the general price inspection has been going on  in  all parts of the country. Two-thirds of the 30 provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities have achieved good or  comparatively good results, which mainly find expression in the  following:    --Enhancing the understanding of the necessity to exercise  management and control over prices under the conditions of the  market economy.    Since the beginning of this year, the leading comrades of  the  party central body and the State Council have repeatedly  stressed the need to strengthen macrocontrol, curb inflation,  and maintain social stability. They have also criticized the  one-sided and laissez-faire approach toward price management.  This time, with the adoption of various measures for  regularizing and controlling prices, a propaganda campaign was  also organized by the propaganda department according to the  instructions by the State Council leading comrades. Through  giving publicity to the price control measures and  organizationally implementing the measures on a large scale, the  party and the government showed their sincerity and  determination to the masses in effectively bringing the prices  under control; this also caused the responsible people of the  local governments to understand that price control was an  important function of the government in economic management and  made producers and dealers aware that one cannot do whatever one  likes in the market economy. Thus, the general atmosphere for  exercising price control in the market economy has basically  taken shape and the laissez-faire condition prevalent since  prices were decontrolled has been changed.    --Promoting the implementation of various measures  formulated  by the state for price control and management. It is learned  that some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have  set up their own grain risk funds: Shanghai's amounted to 400  million yuan; 350 million yuan in Jiangsu; 250 million yuan in  Guangdong; 303 million in Shaanxi; 100 million yuan in  Heilongjiang; and 70 million yuan in Ningxia. At present,  almost all state-owned and collective retail shops and  institutions which charge service fees have clearly marked the  prices of the goods and services they sell. Practices such as  selling goods and services with clearly marked prices has also  been adopted by increasing numbers of private enterprises and  fixed stalls. In some areas with good results, the practice of  selling goods and services with clearly marked prices accounted  for 75 percent of all retailers. All provinces (autonomous  regions and municipalities) have worked out their own measures  for implementing the regulations laid down by the State Council  for supervising the prices of daily necessities and basic  services. Nine provinces and municipalities have announced such  measures and put them into effect. Some provinces (autonomous  regions and municipalities) included a number of additional  categories in the scope of price supervision, such as  vegetables, medicine, household electric appliances, commodity  housing, haircutting and hairdressing, and public bathroom  operations. Heilongjiang Province laid down rules for managing  the prices of grain, cooking oil, and vegetables. Tianjin  Municipality required that applications first be filed for  increasing the prices of some medicines, vinegar, noodles,  toilet paper, and matches. Guangdong Province's Price Control  Authority formulated 11 sets of regulations for market prices,  fees charged by administrative institutions, education fees,  medical care fees, medicine prices, service fees charged by  hotels and restaurants, the pricing practice in various trades,  the antimonopoly and antifraud operations, and for the price  adjustment fund. At present, the regulations are being  deliberated on or have been submitted to the upper authorities  for approval. While decontrolling the vegetable and pork  wholesale business, Shenzhen City exercises control over the  differences between the buying and selling prices of the  retailers; this not only guarantees the reasonable profits of  those involved in the transactions but also protects the  interests of both producers and consumers. The Shanghai  Municipal Price Control Authority formulated and implemented the  "Interim Regulations on Prohibiting Price Fraud and  Profiteering" and the "Rules for Awarding Penalties to  Profiteers in the Entertainment, Catering, Clothing, and  Mechanical and Electric Appliances Trades." They explicitly  stipulate that those who raise the prices of the goods and  services by 50 percent to 150 percent over the normal price  level fixed by the price control authority will be regarded as  profiteers and will be punished for their profiteering  activities.    In the month after the rules and regulations  came into force on a trial basis, definite results were achieved  in checking profiteering behavior and protecting the interests  of consumers. In order to stabilize prices, Jilin Province,  Tianjin Municipality, and Wuhan City decided that no price  adjustment would be made this year; Dalian City postponed the  planned adjustment of gas fees, water fees, and school fees.  Many cities paid attention to the supply of food and  intensified market construction and management. Practice showed  that general price inspections create favorable conditions for  the implementation of the price control measures and the  implementation of the price control measures provide policy  foundations for the price inspections and promote the in-depth  development of the inspections.    --Handling a number of lawbreaking cases in the aspect of  prices. In the general inspection, the various localities mainly  examined the illegal practice of directly violating the  regulations on prices, the rates of price difference, and the  fee standards of goods and services fixed by the state; the  behavior of some retailers who do not mark the prices clearly;  and the irregular practice of adding the 17- or 13-percent  value-added taxes to the commodity prices or raising prices on a  wide scope and by a big margin. According to statistics in 19  provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities), between 10 March  and 15 April, they discovered and handled 61,384 cases of  violating the price regulations and the total money involved in  these cases amounted to 53.89 million yuan; 47,397 of these  cases were handled and the fines imposed on the people and  institutions involved in these cases amounted to 27.9959 million  yuan. Of the cases discovered in the general price inspection,  20,345 were related to the prices of people's daily necessities;  471 cases were related to the prices of production materials  being dealt with in a monopolistic way; 672 cases were related  to the prices of agricultural production materials; 1,139 cases  were related to the prices of public utilities; and 1,257 cases  were related to fees charged by administrative institutions.  Various localities made great efforts to inspect the prices of  grain, cooking oil, and other consumer goods and basic services  closely related to the people's livelihood. In Heilongjiang  Province, the inspection was personally directed by the vice  governor of the province who took charge plus the participation  of three deputy secretaries general of the provincial government  and the leading cadres of the price control authority.    They inspected the prices of grain in the links of  processing, wholesale, and retail and discovered, and solved in  a timely fashion, the problem of insufficient supply in the main  channel. They also laid down a price ceiling policy and rapidly  stabilized the prices of grain and cooking oil in just a number  of days. Liaoning Province dispatched 756 people to examine the  grain prices and check a new round of price raises. In  particular, Shenyang City imposed fines on more than 10 grain  shops which sold grain at prices higher than those fixed by the  government and seriously criticized some grain shops which tried  to hoard goods to making higher profits. These actions checked  the panic buying phenomena in some areas and stabilized the mass  psychology. Actions were taken to check the irregular practice  of raising the prices of salt in Dandong, Liaoning, of medicine  in Shiyan, Hubei, and of gas in Guangzhou. The price  inspections effectively checked the tendency toward irregular  increases of prices and service charges. Various localities in  particular made public a number of typical and serious cases  which had produced widespread evil impact and the handling of  such cases was reported by the mass media. So far, 1,224 cases  of violating the price control laws and regulations have been  handled publicly throughout the whole country. This played a  role in warning and deterring those involved in the illegal  activities, supporting the grass-roots price inspectors, and  promoting the development of the general price inspection.    --Prompting producers and business dealers to pay attention  to their internal price management. According to the  arrangements by the local authorities, many enterprises carried  out self-examination and self-correction and took the initiative  in correcting their own behavior in fixing prices. On 12 March,  Dianmen Food Market in Beijing and 99 other institutions named  as being the best units in abiding by the state's price and  measurement regulations and policies, jointly published their  proposal on maintaining the market stability in RENMIN RIBAO.  They called on all the state-owned commercial institutions to  play a leading role in restraining price increases in the  market, boycotting inferior and counterfeit commodities, and  effectively guaranteeing the interests of consumers. Shandong  Province required all commercial enterprises to name their own  price inspectors and adopt five management systems (the  bookkeeping system, the decisionmaking system, the system for  marking clearly prices for goods and services, the system of  regular price examinations, and the system of market  investigations), thus perfecting the self-discipline mechanism  with regard to commodity prices. Wuhan City's Zhongnan  Commercial Building carried out across-the-board examination of  clearly marking prices for all the commodities it sold and  imposed fines on those who bore direct responsibility for not  marking prices or marking wrong prices. The fines ranged from  20 to over 1,000 yuan. The People's Market in Shijiazhuang  City, Hebei Province, began to sell goods popular with customers  at lower profit rates in April and played a leading role in  restraining the market prices from increasing.    Because of the gradual implementation of the price control  measures and the general price inspection, the excessive price  increases throughout the whole country have been restrained. In  March, the national retail price index rose by a margin of 0.7  of a percentage point lower than in February; the monthly  increase rate was 0.7 percent, or 2.4 percentage points lower  than that in February.    The prominent problems: The price situation remains  serious and prices in some fields remain out of control. Some  people still do not fully understand the necessity to strengthen  price management. There remain substantial difficulties and  obstructions in the handling of cases of violating price  management regulations. The price control institutions and  personnel are not sufficiently stable.    The state the nationwide general price inspection and the  situation in the macroeconomic operations showed that the  present price situation is not a favorable one and the actual  implementation of various price control measures, and the  conduct of the general price inspection, still require  unremitting efforts. At present, the prominent problems in  price control and inspection are as follows:    1. The price situation remains serious. This is  manifested by the fact that prices are still increasing at a  high rate; retail prices are still increasing; and, in  particular, the prices of basic consumer goods and services in  people's daily lives and the prices of basic production  materials are increasing at a rate higher than the average. In  the first quarter of this year, the price indexes of the 15  categories of commodities (including grain, meat, poultry, eggs,  aquatic products, and vegetables) all showed increases to  differing degrees. A noteworthy fact is that, since March, the  prices of grain and cooking oil in some provinces and autonomous  regions have risen again. The price indexes in both the urban  and rural areas rose at the same time. In some rural areas,  prices rose by a bigger margin than in the urban areas. The  differences between the rates of increase in the urban and rural  areas were only 0.1, 1.4, and 0.4 percentage points. [sentence  and percentages as published]    In short, it is still rather difficult to bring the rate of  price increases within the target scope of the control. The  main reasons are: First, demand remains too strong and  continues to pull up the prices and some departments and  localities are seeking an unrealistically high rate of growth  and are blindly expanding the size of investment and increasing  the consumption fund. This caused the excessive issuance of  currency for the past several consecutive years, caused the  potential inflation pressure, and brought about a strong  demand-led pulling force applied to the commodity prices on the  market. Second, the accumulated costs were released in a larger  quantity and this also pushed up the prices. In the last few  years, the prices of many basic products and basic facilities  were decontrolled and this increased the costs of the downstream  products. The higher degree of the economy's market orientation  also raised the prices of land, capital, and labor by larger  margins and this also directly increased the costs of the  enterprises' investment, production, and trade. Such  accumulated costs are being turned into a force to push up the  commodity prices in the currently brisk market. Third, the  momentum of spontaneous price increases became stronger. After  the prices of most commodities were decontrolled there was no  effective means for controlling and regulating the market  prices. Since the beginning of this year, some enterprises took  advantage of the reform of the tax system and the foreign  exchange system to raise the prices of their products and the  prices of the goods they sold. This increased the impact of the  spontaneous price increases.    2. Some local government leaders do not fully  understand the necessity and urgency of controlling price  increases, do not adopt effective price control measures, and do  not act according to the requirements of the central  authorities. This found expression in the following.  First, they are not fully aware of the seriousness of the  current situation in which prices are continuing to increase at  a high rate. Second, they are setting the task of controlling  the price increases against the task of economic development.  Third, they think that they might suffer losses if they control  the prices and might gain benefits if they allow prices to go  freely. Fourth, they shift the responsibility for price control  to the central authorities. And fifth, they lack confidence in  achieving the goal of keeping the rate of price increase within  10 percent this year. Because there were differences between  their thinking and the requirements of the central authorities,  the localities made slow progress in establishing the grain risk  funds, the food price regulation funds, and the reserves system  for important materials; failed to adopt effective measures to  control prices; and they even continued to adopt new plans and  measures for raising the charges of various public utilities.    3. The circulation order was disrupted and prices  in some fields went out of control. In the course of  transforming their management and operation mechanisms, some  state-owned commercial and trade enterprises neglected the  social effects of their behavior, failing to play the role as  the main channel in the field of circulation. In particular,  after the prices of most commodities were decontrolled, and  because the economic means and the legal means were imperfect to  a serious degree, prices in some fields went out of control and  the phenomena of price regulations violations became very  serious. Some typical actions were as follows: Some grain  shops sold grain and cooking oil at prices higher than the  prices fixed by the state. Some enterprises produced chemical  fertilizer, steel products, and other production materials and  sold their products at high prices. Some enterprises took  advantage of the reform of the tax system to include the  value-added taxes in the prices of the commodities they sold,  thus raising the commodity prices. Some medical, educational,  postal and telecommunications, and rural electric power  institutions charged irregular fees. The price differences in  the intermediary links of the circulation of some farm products  and some daily-use industrial goods were too large and, as a  result, both producers and consumers suffered losses, while  dealers in the intermediary links earned handsome profits. Some  private garment shop owners and food stall owners cheated their  customers by selling their goods at high prices in order to  profiteer. All these things not only harmed the interests of  the consumers but also aggravated the unfairness in the field of  wealth distribution and disrupted the economic order.    4. The general price inspection developed unevenly and  the actions against the cases of violating the price management  regulations encountered great difficulties and  obstructions. Some local government leaders did not attach  importance to the work in this regard. They only relayed the  instructions of the upper authorities but did not take concrete  action to implement such instructions and did not include the  general price inspection in the work schedule of the  governments. Some local governments did not lay down explicit  targets and requirements for the price inspection and did not  make concrete arrangements by the end of March. Some localities  did not take effective price control measures while carrying out  the price inspection and did not work out concrete and feasible  steps for implementing the price control measures laid down by  the State Council. Some localities did not create a public  opinion environment to support the general inspection and to  check the behavior of raising prices and imposing charges  irregularly. Because of the backwardness of the legislative  process and the indistinct policies, plus the weakness of the  inspection means and the lack of mandatory measures, the  handling of the cases of violating the price management  regulations encountered great difficulties and obstructions. In  just over one month after the beginning of the general price  inspection, there were six cases of attacking and beating up  price inspectors who were performing their official duties.    In addition, some local price management institutions were  unstable and there was high personnel turnover in those  institutions. This also weakened the price management and  affected the effectiveness of the price supervision and  inspection.    The task for the next step is to further implement the  price control measures on the basis of unifying the thinking,  lay stress on the key points of inspection, quicken the pace of  legislation concerning price management, and strive to achieve  marked results in the field of price management.    In March this year, when listening to the report about the  price situation, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said: Keeping  prices stable is the key to the proper handling of the  relationship between reform, development, and stability. In the  final analysis, it is now necessary to resolutely and  effectively curb inflation. Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji, and Vice Premier Zou Jiahua also stressed many times  that curbing inflation and strengthening price control is the  key task in the economic work at the present stage. Responsible  people of all localities and departments should enhance their  consciousness and unify their thinking in line with this  requirement, overcome various one-sided viewpoints, and maintain  the same position as the party central leading body. The local  and departmental interests should give way to the overall  national interests. In the economic work, importance must be  attached to curbing inflation and stabilizing market prices. It  is necessary to suppress the upward tendency of inflation by  every possible means and strive to keep the increase rate of the  general retail price index within 10 percent. This was a  decision made by the party central leading body and the State  Council and was approved by the National People's Congress. All  localities must resolutely carry it out and adopt effective  measures to achieve good results in the field of price  management.    Carrying out the nationwide general price inspection was a  major measure adopted by the State Council for stabilizing the  overall situation. The leading comrades of the State Council  set forth five criteria for judging the effectiveness of the  general price inspection. We should meet the five criteria in  the whole process of the general price inspection. In the next  step of the price inspection, the concrete objectives are as  follows: 1. To see whether or not the state's price control  measures have really been implemented, the concrete measures,  such as those for supervising prices and ensuring that the  prices are marked clearly, have been properly carried out, and  whether or not the grain risk funds and the food price  regulation funds have been set up.    2. To see whether or  not the malpractice of irregular price increases and irregular  charges in the localities has been effectively checked, the  action of taking advantage of reforms to raise prices has been  corrected, and whether or not the cases of violating the price  management regulations have been properly handled. 3. To see  whether or not both positive and negative cases have been made  public and whether or not public opinion has further played a  role in supervising prices. 4. To see whether or not producers  and dealers have a stronger sense of abiding by the laws and  regulations with regard to prices and have adopted more  effective self-discipline measures. 5. To see whether or not  the momentum of excessive price increases has abated and the  rate of price increase has declined somewhat. All localities  should adopt effective measures in the light of such  requirements and strive to achieve solid results.    It is necessary to organize special inspections on the key  categories of goods which raised the general price level most  seriously and on the key items about which the masses complained  most strongly. In the whole country, it is first necessary to  guarantee the stability of the prices of grain, cooking oil, and  other daily necessities. All localities should regularly  examine the prices of grain and cooking oil and see whether they  are above the price level fixed by the State Council and the  local governments at all levels. It is necessary see whether or  not such management and supervisory measures as submitting the  plans for adjusting the prices of other basic daily-use goods to  the authorities concerned for approval and record and  controlling the price differences (profit margins) in the  dealings of such goods, are properly carried out, whether or not  the action of taking advantage of the reform of the tax system  and the foreign exchange system to raise commodity prices has  been corrected, and whether or not the grain risk funds and the  food price adjustment funds have been set up. At the same time,  in view of the fact that the price of cotton is rising sharply,  it is necessary to inspect various links in the purchase and  supply of cotton. Second, it is necessary to inspect the prices  of chemical fertilizer, diesel oil for farming purposes,  electricity for farming purposes, steel products, coal, and  petroleum products and to see whether or not the prices of such  materials have been raised in violation of the relevant  regulations. Third, it is necessary to see whether or not the  basic service charges, including the prices of coal, gas, LP  gas, rents, water, electricity, local bus services, and local  public telephone services have been raised in violation of the  relevant regulations. Various provinces (autonomous regions and  municipalities) can increase the items of inspection in the  light of their specific conditions. In the course of inspecting  the key items, a number of cases of violating the price  management regulations should be handled publicly.    It is necessary to quicken the process of legislation with  regard to price management, draft the "Price Law" as soon as  possible, formulate the antimonopoly, antiprofiteering,  antifraud laws and regulations, regularize various pricing  behaviors, and begin to draft the "Price Supervision and  Inspection Regulations." Before the national laws and  regulations for price management are officially promulgated,  various localities should be encouraged to formulate their local  regulations in the light of their specific conditions and their  successful experience should be summed up and introduced to  other parts of the country.    It is necessary to maintain the stability of the price  control institutions and their personnel and to make necessary  manpower and material replenishment to such institutions. The  means of inspection should be strengthened. Propaganda and  public opinion should also be further strengthened and public  opinion should play a more effective role in supervising prices.    In order to further advance the general price inspection, it  is necessary to stress the need to exercise more effective  leadership, to carry out closer cooperation between different  departments, and to remove disturbances and obstructions. The  governments at all levels should attach great importance to the  general price inspection, include it their work schedules,  assign principal leaders to personally take up this matter, and  assign special officials to take charge of the inspection by  making across-the-board arrangements and ensuring the  implementation of the concrete steps. Problems arising in the  work should be resolved in a timely fashion. Various  departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the  relevant documents issued by the State Council and the spirit of  the telephone conference on the nationwide general price  inspection. The financial departments should guarantee the  working funds for dealing with the cases in the price  inspection; the financial and tax departments should improve the  scheme for reforming the tax system and join hands with the  price control department in properly resolving the price  problems caused by the additional tax burdens for a small number  of enterprises. The banks should help the price inspection  organs to execute their decisions by debiting the accounts of  the institutions and individuals who refuse to pay the fines for  their violations of the price management regulations. The  industrial and commercial administrative organs should prompt  private enterprises, individually-run businesses, and stall  owners in the fairs to clearly mark the prices of the goods they  sell and should support the execution of the decisions of the  price control organs on suspending the business licenses of  those shops which are found violating the price regulations.  The technical supervision organs should intensify the  inspection of the measuring tools and the quality of the goods  and resolutely punish those who sell inferior goods at high  prices, give short measure, and raise prices irregularly in  various forms. The public security organs should take measures  to protect the personal safety of the price inspectors when they  are performing their official duties. The supervision department  should take administrative disciplinary action against officials  who shield the misconduct of violating the price regulations.  The grain supply organs should properly handle the purchase,  transportation, and storage of grain in order to guarantee grain  supplies in all localities. The commercial department should  guarantee the supply of the people's daily necessities on the  markets.</p>

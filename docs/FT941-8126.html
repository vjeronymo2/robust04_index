			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kynoch rationalises after Pounds 644,000 loss Kynoch Group, the specialist manufacturer of healthcare equipment, swung from profits of Pounds 958,000 to losses of Pounds 644,000 pre-tax for the year to December 31. Turnover of continuing activities rose to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 13.3m). There was also a Pounds 226,000 contribution from acquisitions. The group warned in September that profits for the year were likely to be well below those for 1992. For the opening six months they fell by 67 per cent to Pounds 126,000. To stem the tide of losses, the group has rationalised its MDH offshoot, to give cost savings of Pounds 423,000 in 1994. It has also sold its large capacity steriliser business which was the main cause of the 1993 deficit. There were exceptional charges for non-recurring items in 1993 amounting to Pounds 249,000 (nil). Losses per share emerged at 1.9p (earnings 3.4p). Looking ahead, Mr John Salkeld, chairman, said trading in recent months had stabilised and the pattern of demand had begun to improve from the low levels experienced in the second half of 1993. Panmure Gordon has agreed to become stockbroker to the group with immediate effect.</p>

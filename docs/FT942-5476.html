			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Tories excluded in hung councils Conservatives have been excluded from power in most of the councils where no party won an overall majority in last month's local elections. In London four hung authorities, previously Tory-controlled, are run by opposition parties. Barnet in north London is run by a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, with a Labour leader. Bexley and Redbridge are both run by Labour minority administrations, while Liberal Democrats are running Harrow as a minority. Labour minority administrations are also in place in Liverpool, Oldham and the West Yorkshire districts of Calderdale and Kirklees, while a Liberal Democrat-Labour administration, with a Liberal Democrat leader, runs the previously Tory-controlled Southend. Epping Forest in Essex, also previously Tory-controlled, has shared committee chairs between Labour, residents' groups and Liberal Democrats. The magazine Local Government Chronicle has also found examples of collusion between Liberal Democrats and Tories. In Lancashire both Rochdale and Pendle are run by Liberal Democrat administrations with Conservative support, while the two parties have split committee chairs between them on Broadlands district council, Norfolk. But Liberal Democrats and Tories have failed to agree in the formerly Labour-controlled London borough of Lambeth.</p>

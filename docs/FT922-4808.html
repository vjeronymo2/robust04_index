			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies Denmark rejection of the Maastricht treaty will come as a shock to European currency and bond markets which have been priming themselves for an opposite result since the middle of last week. The immediate effect will not only be an almost certain slide in the price of Danish bonds. The currency could move closer to its floor within the ERM. But Denmark's problems will be as nothing to the rethinking that must now begin on the prospects for European currency union and convergence of interest rates. The most likely response will be a flow of funds into the D-Mark which will leave high-interest currencies exposed, especially the lira because of Italy's political problems, the Ecu, and the Nordic currencies which are not members of the system. It would be rash, however, for markets to expect an early realignment. This is a taboo subject. As for the UK it is left somewhere in the middle with a high budget deficit and high core inflation rate offsetting the attraction of political stability that followed the election. Doubtless sterling will continue to enjoy the support of that stability to some degree. whether it will be enough to secure inflows sufficient to fund the PSBR at current gilt yields is another matter.</p>

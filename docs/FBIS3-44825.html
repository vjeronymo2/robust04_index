Comrade Xie Shijie said: It is far from enough for Sichuan  to rely on self-accumulation in economic construction; it must  rely on opening up to the world and foreign investments. This  will develop Sichuan's economy rapidly. In this respect, we  should make a faster move and be more dynamic. All kinds of  measures should be taken to encourage foreign investments. He  added: The way out for Sichuan's agriculture is stabilizing  grain production, increasing income, and striving for moderate  prosperity. Grain production and agricultural development  should be carried out by means of science and technology, and  township and town enterprises should be developed. A link must  be formed between enterprises, markets, and peasants to blaze a  track of rural industrialization. In the course of encouraging  development of private economic sectors, there is also a need to  vigorously develop collective economic sectors and strengthen  rural party organizations' coherent force and combat worthiness.    Comrade Xie Shijie said: Key construction projects must be  given full attention. The 10 construction projects arranged by  the provincial government involving Sichuan's long-term  development must be fulfilled as scheduled. Reform of existing  enterprises must be deepened according to the 33 regulations, a  good job must be done in carrying out reform experiments in the  22 enterprises selected, and experience in this respect must be  promptly summed up and then popularized. In the meantime,  particular attention must be paid to resolving the problem of  loss-incurring enterprises. If this problem is not resolved  properly, it will affect stability and unity.    Comrade Xie Shijie stressed: We must do two kinds of work  simultaneously and lay equal stress on them and make a success  of spiritual civilization. Leading cadres should set strict  demands on themselves, curb corruption, improve  grass-roots-level organizations for social order, and help  protect social order so as to spend the New Year and the Spring  Festival happily.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK plans to put brake on single marke: British EC presidency under the Conservatives may put new legislation in jeopardy THE GOVERNMENT plans to put a brake on new single market legislation when it takes over the European Community presidency in July - probably jeopardising a proposed directive on opening up EC securities markets. Ministers have decided that, if the Conservatives win the general election, the government's emphasis will be on reforming and implementing existing measures for the single market. Mr John Redwood, the corporate affairs minister, is risking infuriating the UK's European partners by saying he would rather have no agreement on the proposed Investment Services Directive than a measure with which he disagrees. Mr Redwood represents the UK on the EC's internal market council and meetings of finance ministers when they discuss the directive. The Investment Services Directive is seen within the European Commission as an integral part of the single market, which begins at the close of the UK presidency, January 1 1993. Mr Redwood says he wants to change the 'culture' of the internal market council. 'Too many people have seen the single market as a legislative programme whereas I see it as about getting more cross border trade,' he said. The British presidency will aim to 'celebrate the completion of the single market and to make sure it is working well'. There will be a consultative exercise among EC business leaders about possible revisions to existing directives. Mr Redwood said that may see a relaxation of EC technical standards set for some products which he regards as preventing cross-border trade. Of the 282 measures proposed in 1985 for a single market by Lord Cockfield, the former internal market com-missioner, agreement has been reached on 232, although not all have been implemented. The UK is hoping to reach agreement soon on which of the others, possibly 10, could be dropped as no longer applicable. One is likely to be the fifth company law directive. This directive would harmonise the administration and structure of large EC companies. Up to 30 others might be agreed under the current Portuguese presidency. Failure to reach agreement on investment services directive will disappoint the City because it had been hoped it would significantly extend the potential markets of UK companies. The directive will not be discussed at today's meeting of EC finance ministers but should be on the agenda for the next council, scheduled for March 16. So far the Portuguese have been unable to resolve the fundamental differences between Britain and France over the speed and method by which stock market trades are made public under the directive. The last high-level meeting in December broke up over the issue with Mr Redwood accusing France of intransigence. But other national officials from EC countries and Commission officials believe it is Mr Redwood who is guilty of stubbornness. Some of them think it may be possible to achieve the necessary majority in favour of a compromise despite the British position. Compromise on the draft directive might be helped by movement on the related capital adequacy directive, which would set common capital standards for securities trading operations.

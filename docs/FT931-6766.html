			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Platinum and palladium in retreat THE PLATINUM and palladium markets were the falling stars of the world commodities scene this week as growing concern about the prospects for demand from Japanese car manufacturers turned last week's retreat into a rout. The preceding week had seen the platinum price surge by nearly Dollars 10 to Dollars 370.50 a troy ounce while its sister metal, palladium, rose Dollars 4.10 to a 32-month high of Dollars 119 an ounce as Japanese buyers responded to reports of sharply reduced Russian shipments to the US and Europe. That rise was capped two weeks ago, however, when a Russian official insisted that his country was still meeting all contracts to supply palladium to world markets, and the ensuing downward reaction was fed last week by nervousness about US economic policy. Then came the Japanese car makers' 'body blow', as one analyst described it. They told the Reuter news agency that, because their production was falling, not only did they not need Russian platinum and palladium (for anti-pollution exhaust catalysts), they might even sell some of their present surplus. The manufacture of catalysts is estimated to account for about 40 per cent of world platinum use and about 12 per cent of palladium use. That was enough to turn the enthusiastic Japanese buyers who had fuelled the earlier strong advance into desperate sellers, and by yesterday afternoon the platinum price was down Dollars 14.25 on the week at Dollars 345 an ounce and palladium's down Dollars 8.85 at Dollars 100.15 an ounce. Some dealers suggested that the markets had now become oversold, however, while noting that sellers were also being discouraged by expectations that the yen would not fall further against the US dollar - which would make platinum and palladium prices appear relatively expensive to Japanese investors, traditionally the main operators in these markets. Gold got off relatively lightly until falling Dollars 1.90 yesterday to Dollars 327.75 an ounce, down Dollars 2.50 on the week and near the bottom of its recent narrow trading range. Silver suffered its principal fall at the start of the week when nearby New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) futures fell to life-of-contract lows and the London bullion market price, which had fallen 7.5 cents last week, lost another 4.5 cents at 358.5 cents an ounce. The London price then see-sawed around that level, between 357.5 and 359.5 cents before ending yesterday at 359 cents an ounce. The initial fall resulted from a wave of speculative selling, which traders said was encouraged by news of a 2m-ounce rise in Comex warehouse stocks to 272m ounces. Zinc was the main sufferer at the London Metal Exchange, where all base metal contracts lost ground on the week. The three months delivery price closed yesterday at a four-month low of Dollars 1,036.75 a tonne, down Dollars 44.75 on the week after breaking through successive support areas. In the absence of fresh developments dealers attributed the slide to the long-running oversuply situation, which will be only partly relieved by recently-announced production cuts. Zinc stocks in LME warehouses rose another 8,000 tonnes to 554,600 tonnes. Long-established support levels also gave way in the copper market as the three months price slid Dollars 29.75 to Dollars 1,521.50 a tonne at Thursday's close. Traders said modest Chinese buying had been brushed aside as the price fell. Yesterday, however, three months copper rallied by Dollars 17 to end only Dollars 12.75 down on the week. Nickel pressed against downside support at Dollars 6,200 for three months metal for three days before breaking through decisively on Thursday. After a further fall yesterday the price closed at Dollars 6,085 a tonne, down Dollars 202.50 on the week. Tin prices continued the recent downtrend as the upward movement in LME stocks accelerated - this week's rise amounted to 1,470 tonnes, taking the total to 18,605 tonnes. The cash price closed yesterday at Dollars 5,770 a tonne, down Dollars 30 on the week. At the London Futures and Options Exchange cocoa prices were pushed towards three-month highs early in the week as manufacturer demand absorbed selling from the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer. Overhead resistance at Pounds 745 a tonne was broken down as the May position climbed to Pounds 760 a tonne but it was back to Pounds 749 a tonne at yesterday's close. Dealers blamed yesterdays Pounds 11 fall on speculative selling in New York. 'The market is highly strung and jittery, but there is a good chance we'll see consolidation in the short term,' one told Reuter. 'The bull move is working sideways at the moment.' World sugar prices built on last week's strength as operators continued to react to reductions in analysts' assessments of the likely level of the 1992-93 production surplus. At the New York Cocoa, Sugar and Coffee Exchange the May futures price put on more than half a cent over the week to touch the psychologically-important 10 cents-a-lb level yesterday. But dealers thought the market had become overbought and prices were trimmed in later trading. The market had been watching the International Cocoa Organisation talks in London, aimed at negotiating a price-stabilisation pact to replace the moribund International Cocoas Agreement, which expires in September. But there was little reaction yesterday to news that delegates had failed to reach a compromise on the price range to be defended by a stock withholding operation and had adjourned the meeting till Monday.  ------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------ (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------ Aluminium   +1,150 to 1,655,025 Copper      +1,025 to   328,125 Lead           +25 to   234,325 Nickel         +78 to    83,028 Zinc        +4,075 to   554,600 Tin           +745 to    18,605  ------------------------------</p>

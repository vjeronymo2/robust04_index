			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has been  invited to a summit of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) opening in Budapest this December,  the Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.    Ministry officials said it has yet to be decided whether  President Kim Yong-sam will attend the summit.    A senior CSCE officials' committee in Prague Wednesday  unanimously approved inviting South Korea to attend and make a  contribution, the ministry said.    The summit is scheduled for Dec. 5-6 in Budapest.    South Korea is the second non-member to be invited to a  conference meeting after Japan, which participated in the  Helsinki summit in 1992.    The 52-member CSCE does not hold annual summits, but  officials here predicted that the top-level conference will  eventually be regularized.    Seoul is a strong advocate of creating a regional security  dialogue forum in Northeast Asia, and taking part in the CSCE  meeting will provide know-how on the mechanisms and operation of  such dialogue, ministry officials said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Criminal Silence of the International </F> Community"]    [Text] At present, in two regions of the world--occupied  Kashmir and Bosnia--a lot of atrocities are being committed, and  human rights are being violated. The international community,  however, is sitting like a silent spectator. The United Nations  and major powers worldwide do not feel the need to play their  required role in obtaining the right of self-determination for  the Kashmiris or the protection of Bosnia. When it comes to the  interests of the United States and European nations, the United  Nations and its Security Council suddenly become very active.  The silence of the world over the present situation in occupied  Kashmir and Bosnia is deplorable and unbearable. Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto addressed a meeting of the UN Human Rights  Commission in Geneva and tried to call the attention of the  international community to the problems in occupied Kashmir and  Bosnia. She said, "The present situation in Kashmir is  unacceptable, and so is the silence of the world." The prime  minister made it clear to the meeting's participants that the  people of Kashmir have a very simple desire: independence. "You  cannot suppress the freedom fighters for very long," Bhutto  said. "Atrocities and extremities cannot last very long. This is  a lesson of history, and despite India's atrocities and  suppression, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have made its  efforts futile." Madam Benazir Bhutto has definitely advocated  the interests of the people of Kashmir very effectively. Her  speech was greatly praised and the issue was declared a great  cause of concern. The real problem, however, is to see if the  international community will do something to stop Indian  atrocities against the Kashmiri people and whether they will  help them gain their right to freedom. In the past, the United  Nations and other international forums praised the efforts of  Pakistani representatives and diplomats; however, they did not  take any practical steps to help the Kashmiris get their  independence. The conscience of the international community is  dead, and it is not willing to do anything to stop the savage  acts of the Indian armed forces in Kashmir. In this situation,  relations between India and Pakistan have become extremely  tense. Pakistan tried to resolve this issue by holding talks,  but India's stubbornness prevented it from making any progress.  Pakistan has not proposed any new plans. Instead, it is still  firm on the principle of resolving the Kashmir issue of  independence through the UN resolutions. If India continues to  violate human rights in occupied Kashmir and practices its  stubbornness in declining to recognize the right of Kashmiris to  freedom, then there will be no guarantee of peace in South Asia.  Resolution of the Kashmir problem according to the wishes of the  Kashmiri people is very important for establishing peace in  south Asia.    *</p>

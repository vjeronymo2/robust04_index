			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 26 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel and the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) Deputy Group  representatives agreed that the compromise solution of the  Senate election key worked out by the coalition representatives  on Friday [25 March] might be a good working proposition for  drafting the parliament and senate election bill, ODA Deputy  Group Chairman Oldrich Kuzilek told journalists today after the  meeting with Havel.    Kuzilek said the ODA deputies also told Havel about their  attitude towards the issue of Jewish property restitution. The  ODA-proposed amendments to the out-of-court rehabilitation  settlement and land laws are not seen by the ODA deputies as a  breach of the 1948 restitution deadline. "All it takes is to be  well versed in the 1950s statutes," Kuzilek said. The amendment  only seeks that all which ought to have been restituted under  the law was restituted, he added.    Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) Deputy Group Chairman  Karel Hrdy said that he told Havel about an amendment to local  election law. The CSSD pushes for a proportionate and simple  majority combination election system, he said he told Havel.  CSSD Deputy Petra Buzkova said they also consulted the question  of pensionable age with Havel.    Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party  (KDU-CSL) Deputy Group representative and deputy chairman of  parliament Jan Kasal said that Havel was open to the idea of  "three times and no more," a short for sentencing to life  without the possibility of parole habitual offenders on a third  conviction of a listed violent crime. Havel agreed, adding,  however, that even such convicts should be allowed the chances  of re-socialisation under strict conditions still to be worked  out, Kasal said.    Havel also agreed that alternative punishment for light  crimes, namely community work, become part of the criminal code,  Kasal said.</p>

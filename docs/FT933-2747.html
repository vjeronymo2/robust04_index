			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Taiwan eases monetary stance TAIWAN'S central bank has lowered the reserve to deposit ratio in a move to lower interest rates and spur the economywithout reigniting inflation. The central bank lowered the reserve against deposit ratio for current and savings accounts by a full percentage point and the ratios for deposits by 0.75 percentage points. This effectively lowers the cost of capital for the island's financial institutions, particularly for private sector banks. It is the latest step in an expansionary credit policy and economic revitalisation announced by the government in July. Professor Hua Ming-shu of the banking department of Taipei's National Chengchi University said single-digit growth in money supply since the beginning of 1993 illustrated the lack of vitality in the island's economy. Official growth forecasts have been reduced from 7 per cent to 6.1 per cent this month. High lending rates have been important in discouraging local investors, says Mr Hua. The central bank began efforts to encourage local banks to reduce rates on July 30 by lowering the interest rate for secured finance from 6.625 per cent to 6.125 per cent. The bank also released NTDollars 10bn in savings funds each month to push down lending rates. But local banks followed with only minor cuts. Earlier this month, central bank officials asked the three major state-owned commercial banks - the Hua Nan Commercial Bank, the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank and the First Commercial Bank - to cut lending rates.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher chief could get Pounds 0.6m Mr Stephen Walls, the chairman of Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, will be paid a minimum of Pounds 464,000 this year and could earn up to Pounds 618,000. One of the main components is a lump sum pension payment which will total Pounds 155,000 this year. Under Mr Walls' two-year rolling contract the company must each year pay the equivalent of half his basic salary into his company pension scheme. On September 1 Mr Walls' basic salary was increased from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 309,000. On top of this he is also eligible for an annual bonus which could be as much as half his basic salary. Payment of the bonus is dependent on group performance and on Mr Walls meeting 11 personal objectives during this year. They include: 'Ensure that by the end of the year the group has no operations losing money (unless new start-ups specifically approved by the board)'. 'Continue to raise the general morale and motivation of personnel at all levels'. 'Putting in place planned major head office cost reductions in line with plan'. The details are in documents available for inspection by shareholders ahead of the AGM on December 14. Mr Walls' total pay last year rose by 44 per cent to Pounds 514,000. The annual report for the year to August, published yesterday, said this included a Pounds 150,000 pension payment, without revealing that he has a contractual entitlement to a similar sum each year. It also disclosed that he received a Pounds 48,000 bonus last year 'based on the achievement of stated personal objectives'.</p>

			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Albanians reject constitution Albanian voters have overwhelmingly rejected a constitution drafted by President Sali Berisha which would have further shifted the balance of power from parliament to the already powerful presidency. Preliminary results indicate that more than 60 per cent of voters rejected it in a weekend referendum. The new constitution would have given the president the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, appoint ministers and preside over the supreme court Mr Berisha, whose Democratic party won a landslide victory in the 1992 elections, has faced mounting opposition in parliament and within his own party for his increasingly autocratic style. The outcome of the vote is a striking confirmation of Albania's conversion to democracy after 45 years of communist rule.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nadezhda Yakhotina: "Ernst &amp; Young Company </F> Estimated Airport at $1.2 Billion"]    [Text]    [Begin boxed item]  <H5>  Expenditures on the First Stage of Reconstruction of </H5> Novosibirsk Airport    The total cost of the project is $1.2 billion. The first  stage of reconstruction envisions the building of cargo  terminals (volume of investments--$70 million): Development of  the infrastructure of cargo terminals--$11 million, construction  of the air terminal building--$45 million, and the organization  of the auxiliary complex and technical services (customs,  militia, loading platform, service system, hotels, etc.)--$14  million.    [End boxed item]    A business plan for the reconstruction of the  Novosibirsk international airport developed by a consortium of  U.S. consulting firms headed by the Ernst &amp; Young Company was  approved on 4 April. Thus one of the largest projects in the  reconstruction of Russian airports, in terms of the volume of  capital investment, acquired a technical and financial  basis.    KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already repeatedly talked about the  situation concerning the planned reconstruction of Novosibirsk  airport (see 24 and 27 January issues). At the end of March,  during the visit to the United States of a delegation of the  joint-stock company Transsibavia, studies were approved of a  business plan for the reconstruction of the airport by a group  of American firms headed by the Ernst &amp; Young Company, and on  the evening of 4 April its final variant as well.    The total cost of reconstruction is estimated by specialists  of Ernst &amp; Young at $1.2 billion. Inasmuch as the total  volume  of reconstruction work may continue until the year 2030, its  implementation is envisioned in stages. Reconstruction in the  first stage is planned to use up about $60-80 million (see boxed  item). An important condition for the implementation of the  project, as is noted in the business plan, is the conduct of  structural changes and the resubordination of the Novosibirsk  airport Tolmachevo from federal to oblast property, which will  make it possible to activate work on reconstruction and control  the expenditure of resources.    As was reported by Aleksandr Fokin, deputy director of  foreign relations of the joint-stock company Transsibavia, the  consortium of firms headed by the consulting firm Ernst &amp;  Young  Company conducted a study of the business plan starting in April  1993. During its preparation, consultations were conducted with  16 aviation companies of the world, the U.S. Treasury, the IMF,  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the  International Civil Aviation Organization, and also airports at  Anchorage and Fairbanks.    So reputable a list of consultants indicates the  significance  that is being given abroad to the appearance on the  Transsiberian main line of a large air terminal complex that  meets world standards. The fact is that practically all the  large aviation companies in the world (for example, Lufthansa,  JAL, and a number of others) use the Transsiberian route for  flights to Japan and Alaska, which makes it possible to save  almost 30 percent flight time and fuel in comparison with  flights across the Polar Circle. Naturally the aviation  companies (including Aeroflot) are interested in the development  of the infrastructure of one of the world's most important air  routes. This gives reason to suppose that general contractors  and sources of financing will be established in the near future.</p>

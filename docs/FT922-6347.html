			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: Aida - Opera Imagine a state banquet in colonial Egypt. The tables are lit by candelabra and potted palms cast their shadow. The guests assemble dressed in full ceremonial regalia and then the pre-dinner entertainment begins: a slide-show featuring moments of glory from the recent war. This is the triumph scene in Scottish Opera's production of Aida at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow. One might have thought that such a wholesale updating of the opera would have provoked an outcry when Gilbert Deflo's production was first seen in 1987, but that was not the case. Instead the public has been calling for its return and after five years the request has been granted with this vivid and thoroughly lively revival, which opened on Thursday. As will have become clear by now, the raison d'etre of Deflo's setting is to update the opera to Verdi's own time. This usefully does away with the need for elephants, triumphal marches and the like, while still providing scenes which are visually striking. But the production's success in finding late 19th-century equivalents for the ancient Egyptian settings has to be weighed against the difficulty of creating afresh the social and political pressures which Aida is all about. It works best in and around the court. The princess Amneris is here the daughter of a colonial governor. In the heat of the Egyptian afternoon she takes tea with the other European women in a palatial white-and-gold drawing-room. The snobbishness of this superior young society lady is there to be seen and Sally Burgess plays her with devastating insight, catching the cruelty and contempt as she amuses herself, callously playing with the feelings of her black servant, Aida. This is the individual performance that makes the whole evening work. Although Sally Burgess is a long way from being the contralto that Verdi wanted in the role, she prowls the stage memorably, a feline Amneris whose every line spits with jealousy. Her prey this time is the warm and affecting Aida of Priscilla Baskerville, not a consistent singer at this performance, although at her best she gives some promise of becoming a Verdian in the Arroyo mould. Unfortunately the evening's Radames was ill. Stefano Algieri was reduced to acting the role, while Geoffrey Shovelton sang from a stage box, an arrangement that worked rather better than usual, as our singing Radames came across strong and clear. Donnie Ray Albert was an Amonasro with just enough voice and Frangiskos Voutsinos a not quite imposing Ramfis. John Mauceri led a generally convincing musical performance, based on Verdi's working score for the opera's first Paris production. Where the show falls down is in the crucial relationship between church and state, for Aida no less than Don Carlos has this theme at its heart and Deflo has been unable to find any equivalent for the fearsome priests of Isis, whose intransigence leads to the opera's tragic conclusion. Those ranks of khaki-clad British officers, each man holding a candle and looking a right lemon, are just not convincing as worshippers of the mighty Phtha. The production is on tour until July 4</p>

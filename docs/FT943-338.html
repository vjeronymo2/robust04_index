			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Monarch opens Venezuelan gold mine Monarch Resources, a company registered in Bermuda, has opened the first underground gold mine to be developed in Venezuela for five decades. The company, whose shares are traded on the London and Toronto stock exchanges, invested about USDollars 25m in the new mine, called La Camorra, located in Bolivar state. It expects La Camorra to produce around 220kg (7,070 troy ounces) of gold a month. Reserves of ore at the mine site are estimated at 540,000 tonnes with a gold content averaging 22 grams a tonne, according to company officials. Exploration at the site began in 1988 and construction in 1992. The company has invested a total of Dollars 80m in gold operations in Venezuela since 1987. At the same time, Canada's Placer Dome, which has identified sizeable gold reserves at another site in Bolivar state, Las Cristinas, announced in Vancouver that it was raising its estimate of gold resources at the property from 7.7m troy ounces to 8.6m. The Canadian company is studying the development of an open pit mine at Las Cristinas, which could yield about 6m ounces of gold. International companies have expressed considerable interest in Venezuela's gold mining potential. However, potential investors complain about an outdated law covering the mining sector and about controls on foreign exchange activities established in June of this year. Before exchange controls were imposed, a private Venezuelan gold mining association estimated that investment in gold exploration and mining could reach Dollars 142m this year.</p>

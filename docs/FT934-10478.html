			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / New car registrations up 15.5% in October NEW CAR registrations rose 15.5 per cent in October, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. The figures jumped to 126,305 from the 109,373 reached in the same month a year ago. In the first 10 months of this year registrations have risen by 12.1 per cent to 1.58m. But the retail motor trade, which has repeatedly attacked car manufacturers for distorting the state of the market, yesterday voiced renewed doubts about the strength of the recovery in demand. Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said 45 per cent of registrations in October were made in the last 10 days of the month. 'This amount of late-month registrations, occurring in advance of final sales, and covering most volume franchises, results in diminished values for new, nearly new and used cars, to the disbenefit of customers, dealers and manufacturers,' he said. The association, which is part of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, says the pre-registering of cars by dealers or car manufacturers before the vehicles have actually been sold is 'a major problem forcing unreality into the market'. A month ago the dealers attacked Ford for 'forcing registrations' and 'distorting' the market. The society accepted yesterday that the 'continued buoyancy of the market' was largely the result of 'the most intense marketing effort ever seen in this country'. The UK remains virtually the only European car market achieving growth. New car sales in west Europe fell 16 per cent in the first nine months compared with an increase year-on-year in the UK of 12.1 per cent in the first 10 months.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK CAR REGISTRATIONS - JANUARY-OCTOBER 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               October 1993             Oct' 92                     Volume    Change %    Share %      Share %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market       126,305     +15.5      100.0        100.0 UK produced         56,644     +14.7       44.8         45.1 Imports             69,661     +16.1       55.2         54.9 Japanese makes      15,539     +12.3       12.3         12.7 Ford group          27,441     +15.8       21.7         21.7  -Ford              27,078     +17.0       21.4         21.2  -Jaguar               363     -34.4        0.3          0.5 General Motors      23,663     +10.9       18.7         19.5  -Vauxhall          23,003     +11.2       18.2         18.9  -Saab*                660      +0.8        0.5          0.6 Rover**             16,645     +23.7       13.2         12.3 Peugeot group       15,988     +34.2       12.7         10.9  -Peugeot           10,496     +38.9        8.3          6.9  -Citroen            5,492     +26.0        4.4          4.0 Renault/Volvo***     9,213      +7.1        7.3          7.9  -Renault            6,983      +9.8        5.5          5.8  -Volvo              2,230      -0.5        1.8          2.1 Volkswagen group     6,030     -20.7        4.7          6.9  -Volkswagen         3,486     -32.6        2.8          4.7  -Audi               1,443      -4.7        1.1          1.4  -SEAT                 559     +23.4        0.4          0.4  -Skoda****            542     +15.8        0.4          0.4 Nissan               6,851     +46.9        5.4          4.3 Toyota               2,422     -34.7        1.9          3.4 Fiat group           3,327     +74.4        2.6          1.8  -Fiat               3,126     +83.0        2.5          1.6  -Alfa Romeo           173     +16.9        0.1          0.1  -Lancia                28     -46.2        0.0          0.1 BMW                  3,815     +31.8        3.0          2.7 Honda                2,613     +64.5        2.1          1.5 Mercedes-Benz        2,160     +31.9        1.7          1.5 Mazda                1,339     -10.4        1.1          1.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          January-October 1993        Jan-Oct' 92                     Volume    Change %    Share %      Share %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market     1,577,022     +12.1      100.0        100.0 UK produced        700,622     +11.8       44.4         44.6 Imports            876,400     +12.4       55.6         55.4 Japanese makes     200,341     +18.9       12.7         12.0 Ford group         346,985      +6.8       22.1         23.1  -Ford             341,405      +6.8       21.7         22.7  -Jaguar             5,580      +9.3        0.4          0.4 General Motors     274,540     +11.8       17.4         17.4  -Vauxhall         266,370     +12.4       16.9         16.8  -Saab*              8,170      -5.7        0.5          0.6 Rover**            207,712     +17.4       13.2         12.6 Peugeot group      198,632     +17.4       12.6         12.0  -Peugeot          125,992     +13.1        8.0          7.9  -Citroen           72,640     +25.9        4.6          4.1 Renault/Volvo***   123,060     +16.9        7.8          7.5  -Renault           84,765     +28.1        5.4          4.7  -Volvo             38,295      -2.1        2.4          2.8 Volkswagen group    89,984      +1.4        5.7          6.2  -Volkswagen        56,902      -2.1        3.6          4.1  -Audi              17,746     +11.0        1.1          1.1  -SEAT               7,908     +12.0        0.5          0.5  -Skoda****          7,428      -1.7        0.5          0.5 Nissan              78,075     +27.0        5.0          4.4 Toyota              47,773     +32.3        3.0          2.6 Fiat group          41,276      32.8        2.6          2.2  -Fiat              38,809     +36.5        2.5          2.0  -Alfa Romeo         1,956      -4.3        0.1          0.2  -Lancia               511     -14.7        0.0          0.0 BMW                 36,570      -0.0        2.3          2.6 Honda               26,942     +10.8        1.7          1.7 Mercedes-Benz       18,147      -9.5        1.2          1.4 Mazda               15,586      -8.8        1.0          1.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *GM holds 50% of Saab Automobile and has management control. **Includes Range Rover/Discovery.

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Swedes delay decision on bridge Sweden yesterday put off a decision on whether to approve construction of a 17km bridge between Sweden and Denmark after continued wrangling over the project within the four-party coalition government. The decision threatens the cohesion of the government, headed by Moderate (Conservative) party leader Carl Bildt, nine months before a general election, due on September 18. 'We are quite simply not ready,' Mr Bildt said yesterday after a two-hour cabinet meeting to discuss the bridge, which would be the first permanent link between Sweden and continental western Europe. Hundreds of demonstrators opposed to the bridge protested outside the meeting. 'A decision can probably not be expected before Thursday of next week,' Mr Bildt added. The bridge is opposed on environmental grounds by the coalition Centre party, led by Mr Olof Johansson, minister for the environment. He is under pressure from sections of his party to pull out of the coalition if the government decides the bridge should be built. If this happened the government would have to resign, although Mr Bildt could be asked to form a new coalition between the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats. Sweden and Denmark have signed a treaty which commits the two states to build the road-and-rail bridge by the year 2000 at a cost of about SKr12bn (Pounds 975.6m). It will cross the Oresund (the narrow strait separating Denmark and Sweden) between the Danish capital of Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmo. The Centre party has made it a condition for approving construction that the flow of water through the Oresund is not reduced. In an exchange of letters last week between Mr Bildt and Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, the two governments promised to ensure this condition was fulfilled. Despite Mr Bildt's pledge last week that a decision would be made yesterday, the coalition continued to dither. A meeting of party leaders on Sunday lasted until 3am yesterday morning, followed by the cabinet session. 'We need more information on a number of points,' Mr Bildt told a press conference, denying a government crisis was imminent. He admitted there was a 'certain tension', but that the cabinet was determined to find a solution. 'We are close to each other when it comes to the question of the Oresund bridge.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons based on isoprene subunits. They have good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent properties and could replace MCF in some coating and ink products. Terpenes, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as d-limonene, cost about seven times more than MCF, and are commercially available from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical distributors. Manufacturers can use terpenes in existing equipment with minor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monochlorotoluene and chlorobenzotrifluorides are also of commercial interest as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent substitutes for adhesives, coatings, and inks. These compounds can be used either in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isolation or in various mixtures, depending on desired chemical properties. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently received information on these formulations, and will issue a SNAP determination for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these substitutes in the next set of listing decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Water-based formulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water-based coatings contain water rather than conventional solvents. Primary uses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these coatings include coating of furniture, aluminum siding, hardboard, metal containers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliances, structural steel, and heavy equipment. Water-based coatings are priced roughly 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 30 percent more than methyl chloroform-based coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water-based inks use water and other co-solvents such as alcohols and alkyl acetates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to dissolve resins, binders, and pigments instead of conventional solvents. Water-based inks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounted for 55 percent of the flexographic inks and 15 percent of the gravure inks used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the U.S. in 1987. Water-based inks are priced roughly 10 percent less than methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloroform-based inks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water-based adhesives currently account for about 45 percent of the world adhesive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market. Water-based adhesives will likely dominate the market to replace MCF in general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer uses and in areas where a rigid bond is not needed. Water-based adhesives_especially water-based latexes, which are stable dispersions of solid polymeric material in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essentially aqueous medium_can effectively replace MCF use in the flexible foams sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the flexibility of the bond they provide. Water-based latex adhesives have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential to penetrate 85&hyph;90 percent of the MCF-based adhesive market in flexible foams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications. They still pose some problems, however, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Long set and dry times; newer developments seem to be solving this problem;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Deterioration during storage especially if frozen; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The production of bacteria-contaminated waste water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water-based replacements have not proven effective in binding high density laminates or hardwood flooring principally because moisture enhances the chances of warping. In cases where MCF is used for door assemblies or sealants, water-based urethane adhesives containing polyisocyanates can be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> High-solid formulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> High-solids coatings resemble conventional coatings in appearance and use, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-solids coatings contain less solvent and a greater percentage of resin. High-solids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings are currently used on appliances, metal furniture, and farm and road construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. High-solids coatings are priced 20 to 30 percent higher than methyl chloroform-based coatings, yet the buyer receives more usable paint because the coatings contain less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent, thus reducing the volume of coatings required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> High-solids adhesives can reduce the amount of solvent used in adhesives by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the percentage of solids in the formulation. Adhesives formerly containing 30&hyph;50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent solids contain about 80 percent solids after reformulation. High-solids adhesives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have good performance characteristics, including initial bond strength, and can be applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using existing equipment at normal line speeds with minimal modification. For bonding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rubber assemblies, high solid adhesive films are often too thick, resulting in limited versatility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and generally poor performance. High-solids formulations, however, are already used widely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the flexible foams, hardwood flooring, and high-pressure laminates industries. The solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of choice in these industries remains MCF, but with a decreased portion of solvent in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations, so that less solvent is consumed overall. High-solids formulations are only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transitional replacement until adequate substitutes are found that do not contain MCF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative process substitutes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Powder adhesives, the first category of alternative process substitutes, are composed of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-part epoxies, urethanes, and natural resins. These adhesives are often supplied as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powders that require heat to cure. They are generally applied in one of three ways: (1) By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sifting the powder onto preheated substrates, (2) by dipping a preheated substrate into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powder, and (3) by melting the powder into a paste or liquid and applying it by conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means. Since high temperatures are required to activate and thermoset powder adhesives,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their ability to replace MCF-based formulations will depend on the characteristics of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substrates being bonded: If the materials being bonded are heat sensitive, heat-activated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powder adhesives cannot be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Powder coatings have no solvent, containing only resins and pigments in powder form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typically, the powder is electrostatically applied and the coated object is heated above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powder's melting point, so that the resin fuses into a continuous film. Powder coating is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mature technology and is used on various types of metal products such as appliances, concrete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinforced bars, automobiles, steel shelving, lawn and farm equipment, and some furniture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The elevated temperatures necessary to melt the coatings, however, restrict the use of powder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings on plastic and wood products. Powder coatings are priced comparably to methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloroform-based coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hot melt adhesives are 100 percent solid thermoplastic binders that can be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace MCF formulations in applications that require a rigid bond. Hot melts currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for about 20 percent of the adhesives market, and they, along with water-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adhesives, will likely benefit most from the move away from MCF-based adhesive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulations. Hot melts are now used instead of MCF formulations in laminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications, especially those involving the lamination of flexible foam products. They can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also replace MCF-based adhesive formulations in the original equipment manufacturer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (OEM) production of high-pressure laminates and possibly in the installation of hardwood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooring. The potential ability of hot melt adhesives to replace MCF-based formulations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flexible foams sector is limited to 10&hyph;15 percent penetration because of the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexible bonds in most furniture and bedding applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thermoplastic plasma spray coatings are powder coatings that melt in transit towards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the object to be coated propelled by a pressurized inert gas, such as Argon. An electric arc  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strips electrons from the plastic particles fusing them together as they move through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicator gun. Thermoplastic plasma spray coatings can be used to coat large and small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objects of metal, wood, plastic, or fiberglass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

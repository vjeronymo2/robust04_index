			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council tendering rules to be altered COMPULSORY competitive tendering of county council and district council services will be suspended immediately before reorganisations arising from recommendations of the Local Government Commission, Mr Robin Squire, environment minister, said yesterday. He said the requirement to put services out to tender would be suspended for local authorities after parliament approved legislation to merge or reorganise them. New authorities would be required to start tendering as soon as possible after their setting-up, with new contracts operative no more than 18 months later. However, the government also announced that tendering will be extended to local authority construction-related and corporate services from 1995-96. It also announced new regulations to stop anti-competitive behaviour by local authorities which helps the in-house workforce to win contracts. These include stricter rules to separate the responsibilities of those putting out work to tender from the council workforce. The timetable is also to be altered for contracts worth more than Pounds 100,000 or lasting more than one year to provide extra time for contractors to draw up bids. The new rules come into force on 10 May.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Angolan forces pound Unita base ANGOLAN government forces pounded the Unita rebel headquarters at Huambo with artillery again yesterday as prospects for early peace talks to halt renewed civil war grew slimmer, Reuter reports from Luanda. Diplomats said last-minute conditions presented by Unita threw into question a meeting between the rival military chiefs in Addis Ababa initially planned for the weekend or early next week. Ms Margaret Anstee, UN special representative, was working to ensure government chief of staff General Joao de Matos and Unita General Demostenes Chilingutila met, they said. Government troops yesterday pressed on with their week-long assault on Huambo, Angola's second city and Unita's headquarters in the central highlands, with intense shelling by artillery and tanks. The battle for Huambo is the centrepiece of the struggle for power between the two sides, whose 16-year civil war was supposed to have ended with a peace accord signed in May 1991. The Addis Ababa contact would have been the first high-level meeting since the new spate of warfare.</p>

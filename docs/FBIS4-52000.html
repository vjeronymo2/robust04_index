			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior Foreign Ministry official yesterday urged  officials in Phnom Penh to refrain from making remarks that only  serve to cause ill-feeling between Thailand and Cambodia.    "Are people dressed in black always Thai?" asked  director-general Don Pramutwinai of the Foreign Ministry's East  Asian Affairs Department.    "Thai rangers may wear black but they would not be so stupid  as to wear their uniform while helping the Khmer Rouge," he said.    Mr Don was commenting on remarks by Cambodian Information  Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse who implied that Thais were  among the foreigners dressed in black who had fought for the  Khmer Rouge.    Mr Don questioned the reliability of field reports received  by officials in Phnom Penh and urged them to refrain from making  remarks based on them.    "Are they sure that what they say benefits Cambodia, their  own situation or the attempt to build better relations with  neighboring countries?" he asked.    Unsubstantiated remarks "only cause ill-feeling" and  Thailand  would not pay attention to groundless allegations, he said.  Cambodia might want to draw attention from other countries but  should be more constructive about it.    Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to settle any doubts in a  diplomatic manner, he stressed.    He cited a recent phone call from Cambodian Foreign Minister  Prince Norodom Sirivut to Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri.</p>

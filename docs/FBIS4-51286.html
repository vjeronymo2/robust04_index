			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 26 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President  Clinton, at a news conference at the White House on the  afternoon of 26 May, announced his decision Thursday [26 May]  announced his decision to renew China's most-favored-nation  trading [MFN] status and delink the MFN renewal from human  rights issues.    Extending MFN "will permit us to engage the Chinese with not  only economic contacts but with cultural, educational and other  contacts."    "We have to see our relations with China within the broader  context of our policies within the Asian-Pacific region," he  said.    "Our relationship with China is important to all Americans,"  he stressed, adding that China "is a major factor in Asian and  global security."    "China is also the world's fastest-growing economy. Over  eight billion dollars of United States exports to China last  year supported over 150,000 American jobs," Clinton noted.    "We need to place our relationship into a larger and more  productive framework," he said.    But at the same time, Clinton announced that the United  States would maintain the existing sanctions imposed on China  and ban imports of guns and ammunition from China, citing human  rights reasons.

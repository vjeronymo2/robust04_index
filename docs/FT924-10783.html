			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (2): Prospects still attractive - In spite of the bad news, the economy has underlying strength THE light of a return to steady economic growth is still visible at the end of the Hungarian tunnel. But earlier hopes that 1992 would mark the point where export growth and stronger domestic demand would counteract contraction of the traditional state controlled enterprises have dimmed. Official GDP estimates point to another 5 per cent decline this year, although the under-recording of activity in the dynamic private sector, and higher savings, indicates that real incomes have not fallen as sharply. The sharp rise in personal savings is a reflection both of unemployment fears and wider income differentials. Higher savings mean lower domestic consumption, which is reflected in lower imports, slack domestic demand and concentration on exports, the main success story of the past three years. The question now is whether Hungarian, and other central European exporters, will be able to keep up the good performance on EC and other markets in the face of the slowdown in economic activity in important markets such as Germany. That growth in western markets remains in double digits but appears to be slowing. Deterioration in the international economic climate threatens however to limit the pace of privatisation and foreign investment. Many of the best companies have already been privatised and hard-pressed western multinationals are in a less acquisitive frame of mind, confronting Hungary's privatisers with a dearth of buyers. Adding risk to reluctance is war in the Yugoslav successor states, cited for instance by Kaufring, the German department store group, when it recently withdrew an offer for Centrum Department Stores. The greatest turbulence in Hungary's small and open economy, however, is of the country's own making. Hungary's own reforms have moved into higher gear this year - with some unexpectedly perverse effects. The government unwittingly planted a time-bomb when it passed vital new laws on banking and bankruptcy late last year. Privatisation, the crucial centerpiece which was put into place two years ago, has a downside too. State companies have been delaying investment and other decisions until the uncertainty over ownership is resolved and have been busy shedding assets and activities before new owners move in. Price liberalisation too, though now largely complete, has left a legacy of inflationary expectations requiring firm, monetary policy to control. Assaulted by this battery of hard hitting reforms, the still predominant state sector of the economy has suffered grievously. Mr Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, initially forecast that the economy would regain its 1988 level of output in 1993. But after the latest shocks, the official GDP in 1993 will still be a full 17 per cent below the level at which it stood five years ago - and even that depends on the government's latest forecast of gentle growth of up to 3 per cent next year being borne out. Fortunately official statistics tell only part of the story. They only cover enterprises employing more than 50 people and overstate the depth of the recession by failing to register fully the growth of small businesses and the dynamism of the private sector. Electricity consumption, for example, remains high, despite the closure or scaling back of big energy intensive industries like steel, aluminium and chemicals. Basic structural changes have taken place to raise the underlying productivity and efficiency of the economy. The changing pattern of trade away from the old emphasis on rigid state planning has also meant great gains in efficiency. Imports of machinery for example grew 68 per cent in the first half of 1992 as investment stabilised and industrial output ticked upwards in the summer. These new machines are being installed mainly in the new joint venture or privately owned factories. In the past much of the expensive machinery or components imported from the west for hard currency was then incorporated in exports to the Comecon countries sold for soft roubles. This left Hungary with hard currency debt and useless soft currency surpluses. But business still suffers from a lack of confidence, which extends from economists to most ordinary Hungarians, and is self-fulfilling. Lay-offs which have pushed unemployment past 10 per cent have shattered consumers' fragile confidence. Hungarians have turned to saving against all their spendthrift traditions and economists' expectations. Net household savings - negligible when communism guaranteed everyone a secure if mediocre existence  -have shot up to 10 per cent of GDP. On the positive side this has allowed the government to finance its deficit without reversing the fall in interest rates, at least so far. But low spending has hit Hungarian companies when they were still reeling from the first shock of the recession and the disappearance of east European business. The gloom is almost certainly overstated. The economy - at a much lower level of activity - has achieved a substantial degree of financial stability. The recession, and its attendant unemployment, has borne down hard on inflation. Manufacturers and retailers have to price keenly to attract price-conscious consumers. Employees cannot afford to press pay demands above inflation when there are few jobs on offer, even less so when the trade unions are divided into three squabbling organisations. So shop windows are plastered with discount advertisements, consumer price inflation has halved from its peak to around 20 per cent and producer prices are rising at about half that rate. Externally, the current account shows an improvement of over 6 per cent of GDP over three years. Western investors too, are still bullish about the future. For Hungary has some great competitive advantages. Foreign motor manufacturers and other big employers have found their staff cheap, capable and flexible. Wage levels are a tenth of west Germany's but basic educational standards are superior to Britain's; and the trade unions are in one western executive's words, 'pussycats'. As subcontractors set up locally and the local market finally takes off, Hungary's competitive edge - unblunted by transport costs - could begin to show.</p>

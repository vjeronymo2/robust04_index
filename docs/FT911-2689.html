			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (14): Competition helps cut costs  -Derivatives can be useful tools THE RECENT Pounds 150m loss sustained by Allied-Lyons through its use of derivative products in the foreign exchange market may have detered some companies from investigating the benefits of such instruments. But derivative products can be useful tools for both corporate treasurers and fund managers faced with increasingly daunting levels of foreign exchange risk. Competition among banks for a share of this lucrative market has fuelled innovation and reduced costs. The growth of business in overseas markets over the last decade has forced company treasurers to pay greater attention to foreign exchange risk. Currency risk management is no longer relevant only to exporters and importers, since many companies now have overseas operations, and currency volatility is no longer seen as an adequate excuse for tumbling profits. Derivative products allow companies to fix costs and income flows in advance, which is particularly valuable at a time when recession is biting into margins. European fund managers have generally been slow to get involved in derivative products, often considering such instruments to be speculative. However, as markets become more international they have been forced to take more account of foreign exchange risk, as well as of the potential rewards of picking currencies correctly. While many investors include such considerations when they choose a bond or equity market, more sophisticated investors use derivative products to separate the currency component from the bond or equity market view they are taking. For example, a fund manager who is bullish on the US dollar, but thinks the US Treasury market has run out of steam, can be in overweight in dollars, but underweight in dollar bonds. The overweight currency position can be achieved by buying options. There are two main markets for hedging foreign currency exposure: the forward market, where companies buy or sell currencies forward and the options market, where the holder can buy or sell a currency at a set rate. Unlike futures contracts, options give the purchaser the right, rather than the obligation to buy or sell. This means that a treasurer can use an option as insurance against adverse changes, but leave it to expire if such protection proves unnecessary. The technology surrounding straightforward currency options - to buy or sell a currency at a set rate - has become widely understood, and such options are now considered to be 'commodity' products, for which high premiums can no longer be charged. In addition to these, new and hybrid structures are becoming more widely used. For example, the 'range forward' is a forward contract which allows a company to set an upper and lower limit on an exchange rate. The structure is legally structured as a forward contract, but is the technical equivalent of buying a put and funding that position by selling a call option. The advantage is that it allows a company, which thinks a currency is set to rise but requires some downside protection, to keep some of the benefit if the currency does improve (unlike an ordinary forward contract). At the same time, banks do not charge an upfront premium premium (as they do for options). A 'participating forward' combines features of forward contracts and option, but again there is no upfront premium. There is a set floor, as for an option, but there is also some participation in any gains - perhaps 50 per cent of the benefit is received by the company, which the other 50 per cent is given up to the bank as, effectively, the premium. A number of banks have also been active in issuing currency warrants,which are long-dated currency options. These warrants have often been sold to retail investors, but there has also been some institutional participation too. However, such warrants have mostly been expensively priced. Another type of structure is the 'average-rate' option, which gives holders the right to buy or sell an underlying market not at the average price over the duration of the option. Unlike the fixed-income market, foreign exchange derivatives business is are dominated by the vast over-the-counter market, where volume is impossible to measure. (Options to buy or sell an underlying market which are not listed on an exchange are called over-the-counter, or OTC, options. They are often tailored to suit specific needs and are not actively traded.) In the US, however, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the International Monetary Market in Chicago are both active in currency derivatives. The Philadelphia exchange lists options in eight currencies, relative to the dollar, the most actively traded of which is the D-Mark contract which traded 41,000 contracts daily on average in March. The exchange is currently waiting for Securities and Exchange Commission approval to list D-Mark/yen, sterling/yen and sterling/D-Mark contracts. The IMM lists six foreign currency futures contracts, and also options on futures. The most actively traded contract is the D-Mark future which had an average daily volume of nearly 40,000 during the first quarter of 1991. The IMM will soon set a date to start trading six cross-rate contracts, for which it has already received approval from the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. The London International Financial Futures Exchange suspended all currency contracts a year ago, blaming 'minimal activity, mainly due to the healthy interbank market.'</p>

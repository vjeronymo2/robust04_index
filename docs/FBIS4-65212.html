			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jean-Marie Colombani: "The World Is </F> Changing, Mr. President!"]    [Text] We know that cohabitation can be a valuable arm  serving the country: the fortuitous conclusion of the GATT  talks; the outcome of the monetary crisis at the end of 1993;  and the brief glimpse of firmness that lifted the siege of  Sarajevo at the start of 1994. However, leaving aside those  crises, what have we gained? Surely it is time to question the  status quo in foreign policy caused by this fragile role-sharing  at the top, and France's relative immobility at a time when, on  the contrary, everything is moving and changing around us.  Here, as in other areas, we must be careful not to sweep the  coming months under the carpet as if they were merely an  interlude. Looking beyond cohabitation and the internal  squabbling in the majority, we should above all ask ourselves  whether the "Gaullist-Mitterrandism," that serves as the basis  for our foreign policy, is still pertinent.    France's foreign policy consists of a series of layers, it  is  a doctrine which grew through accumulation (de Gaulle, Giscard,  and then Mitterrand), forming a hybrid whole. The reality on  which it was founded is now being shaken. The global view that  was dear to General de Gaulle, and European policy as defined by  Valery Giscard d'Estaing and further elaborated by Francois  Mitterrand, are now showing signs of exhaustion. The loss of  stability of the African Financial Community [CFA] franc, the  birth of a major African power (South Africa), the progressive  resolving of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the collapse of the  FLN's [National Liberation Front] Algeria, and the collapse of  Arab secularism clearly illustrate the disappearance of the old  reality that governed Gaullist policy.    With NATO playing an increasingly international role and  with  the start of the Partnership for Peace with Russia, our concept  of independence with regard to deterrence must be questioned.  It should also be admitted that the United States is incapable  of organizing large-scale operations for the West all by itself.    Lastly, the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and the  probable shift in its center of gravity, together with the  hitches in Franco-German relations merely throw into doubt  European policy since 1974. These are all reasons to justify  the fact that, just as it is up to the presidential candidates  to redefine a social pact for French society, they will also  have to establish a veritable foreign policy pact.    The elections of 1981 and, even more so, 1988 were ballots  for continuity in foreign policy. The election of 1995 will  have to mark a break, assuming everyone is aware of the need for  modernization.  <H5>  1. What Borders for Europe? </H5>   Given that the EU is, as the president of the Republic likes  to remind us, tracing the frontier of our destiny, it would be  useful to know whether this border will stretch as far as  Vladivostok or if it will stop at Poland. Since shape often  determines content, it would also be useful to know whether we  are resigning ourselves to a "low-profile" Europe of 20 states,  which would constitute a delayed but real triumph of the British  goal of a vast free-trade area, or if a few countries convinced  that future combat will be based on European identity can find a  way of pulling the others along.    In any event, French policy was not to accept enlargement  without deepening, that is without putting the institutions in  order and clarifying the procedures governing the Union. The  result is that we are now rewarded with enlargement without  deepening!  <H5>  2. Fate of the France-Germany Tandem </H5>   This issue is related to the border question: Chancellor  Kohl assures us that his country "will not accept its eastern  borders being the EU's eastern borders." But where is the line  of France's vital interests?    It is true that, officially, the twin motor is doing well.  Both countries are still pulling the European bandwagon along;  they are pushing for a structured and eventually political  Europe, in line with the consensus uniting their elites; and  monetary coordination survived the EMS [European Monetary  System] explosion. However, the traumatism of 1990 has left its  mark: Even if Francois Mitterrand can point to Mrs. Thatcher's  memoirs to prove that France was not put out by German  unification, Germany still formed the idea that the United  States was a more reliable ally.    In any event, Germany has found a alternative policy in  Central Europe, whereas France, denied a southern European  alternative by the increasingly clear shift in Italian politics  and the Spanish crisis, has to rely on the Franco-German  connection working smoothly. At this stage, it would be better  to follow the advice given by Jean-Francois Poncet, a convinced  supporter of the German alliance: Take the initiative, voice  your reserves, and revise the Franco-German treaty, given that  France still has a major contribution to make in terms of  defense.    Here again, the status quo can be prejudicial. The official  logic that united both countries over the Maastricht Treaty is  that of a Union moving forward in step. The implicit logic is  that of a Union being hauled along by a Franco-German tandem,  with a few countries joining in sooner or later. The current  wave of Europessimism is imposing a minimalist view of a union  marking time before splitting up.  <H5>  3. Relations With the United States </H5>   While isolationist pressure is resurgent across the Atlantic  and while we remain convinced that British support is and will  remain (unless the Labor Party wins the next elections)  illusionary, then our problem is indeed how to keep the United  States active in Europe. We must not therefore be afraid of  seeing France strike an inhabitual pose, changing tack and  chasing away the recurrent anti-American demons, even if  "imperialism" remains embodied in trade and especially culture.  Faced with an America which gives the impression of wanting to  discard Europe through an uncertain policy, France must find the  way of reconciling a European identity with a continued American  presence.  <H5>  4. Maintaining Peace in Europe </H5>   Who keeps the peace and with what legal and military means?  The door to peace, as the unfortunate Bosnians will tell you,  is barely ajar. Official sources claim with one voice: "It is  because of a lack of European unity, not the fault of Europe  itself, and France is doing more than anyone!" Maybe, but this  was not and is not enough to stop the Serbs or to make them  understand that they could not go on behaving the same way  indefinitely, i.e. until they have founded a "Greater Serbia."  It is certainly not enough to impose the EU's point of view.    In a context where the defense forces of small countries are  in an impasse, and where a not insignificant share of German  public opinion is attracted by pacifism, attention is focused on  the European nuclear powers. Without doubt, in this area France  has European ambitions (after all, the Charles de Gaulle  [nuclear aircraft carrier] was described by the head of state as  the jewel in the crown of a future European navy), and without  doubt, Edouard Balladur's "Stability Pact" project represents  the first stages of a global political response, but the concept  of a joint defense force remains in limbo. In the meantime,  what good is such an effort if it merely serves an immobile  foreign policy?  <H5>  5. Mediterranean Stakes </H5>   Free of the lyrical portraits painted by the general [de  Gaulle] who, from the speech in Phnom Penh to the "Quebec libre"  speech compensated for the decline in French power with the  birth of an independent policy, the "Gaullist-Mitterrandian"  foreign policy looked toward the north and the west rather than  the south and the east. Now we border directly onto the south,  much more than we do onto the east. Depending on how you view  things, this is a friendly frontier (Spain and Italy) or a  threatening frontier (the Maghreb). The current risk of Italian  instability under the weight of corruption and the same risk in  the future for Spain, emphasizes the absence of a French vision  of Europe which failed to stand on two legs -- the Franco-German  duopoly and Mediterranean solidarity. The political instability  in Algeria means we risk paying dearly for this lack of vision.    If we are to change foreign policy, we have to modify the  consensus that supports it, but this is impossible in a period  of cohabitation. We must therefore hope that through the  presidential debate that is getting under way, France will adopt  a policy in line with its principles, a policy that delivers  what it promises. From this point of view, the Yugoslav  failure, the cowardliness shown over Bosnia, and the trap that  has ensnared our soldiers on the ground, where humanitarian  efforts screen out the reality of war, and the cautious phrases  putting the aggressors on a par with the aggressed, will mark  the end of an era in foreign policy. The Bosnian drama invites  us to move into the future and to drop the  Gaullist-Mitterrandian illusions.</p>

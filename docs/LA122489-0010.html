			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR AND REALITY  </P> <P> The possibilities already unfolding within immigrant groups in our area will  one day make our city the envy of the world. Not because their great industry  will complement the already burgeoning financial success of Southern  California. Not because the sum of their strengths will produce a society  greater than its parts. Not because we will have overcome most of the tensions  and fears we now feel.  </P> <P> No, we shall be envied because we have become a place, where, in Martin Luther  King's magnificent words, "a person is not known for the color of his skin, but  for the content of his character."  </P> <P> In recognizing this truth, we shall be reaching for perhaps the most important  part of the American dream.  </P> <P> GALEN RUSSELL, Arcadia  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> New Jersey investor and horse racing enthusiast John Aglialoro reached an  agreement that could make him the new owner of Canterbury Downs, a race track  in Shakopee, about 40 miles southwest near Minneapolis. For $4 million to $5  million, Aglialoro agreed to purchase the stock owned by Canterbury president  Brooks Fields Jr., Fields' nephew Brooks Hauser and Santa Anita Realty  Enterprises Inc. of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Aglialoro faces purchasing the track's $43-million mortgage and must obtain an  operating license from the Minnesota Racing Commission, his attorney, John  Broeker, said.  </P> <P> Without an infusion of cash, Canterbury won't operate this year, Royce  McKinley, chairman and chief executive officer of Santa Anita Enterprises, and  Hauser said. The track has lost $70 million since it was built in 1985, helping  to drive the real estate firm shared by Hauser and Fields into U.S. Bankruptcy  Court, where it is being reorganized under Chapter 11. McKinley said Santa  Anita Enterprises has lost $17.5 million on the venture and would get 45% of  Aglialoro's purchase price.  </P></p>

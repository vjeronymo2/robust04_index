			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Spanish strikes Spain faces the prospect of a two-week series of strikes in its public transport system. There has already been a strike by railway workers, during the rush hour last Wednesday, and a subway strike in Madrid and Barcelona on Thursday. The rail strikes are in protest at wide-ranging plans to restructure Spanish railway services. Renfe, the national rail company, is due to be split into separate operating companies with the loss of 14,500 jobs.</p>

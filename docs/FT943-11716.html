			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: European recovery benefits 3M 3M, the diversified Minnesota manufacturer of adhesives, magnetic tapes and medical products, reported record second-quarter sales and earnings, boosted by sales growth in Europe and Asia. The company's net income rose to Dollars 343m, or 81 cents a share, in the quarter, up from Dollars 331m, or 76 cents, in the same year-ago period. Operating income jumped to Dollars 570m, from Dollars 516m last year. Sales for the quarter rose to Dollars 3.8bn, from 3.5bn a year ago. Mr Giulio Agostini, 3M's chief financial officer, told analysts that US sales volume rose about 7 per cent in the quarter, and that European turnover had jumped 6 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent increase for all of 1993. Europe comprises more than half of 3M's international sales volume. Given the improving sales, 'we believe this is a sign that Europe is on the path to recovery', Mr Agostini said. 3M sales in the Asia-Pacific region were up 11 per cent over last year's second quarter, while Asian sales, excluding Japan, rose 30 per cent. Although cost-cutting has trimmed 3M's global workforce of 85,000 by about 5,000 over the last four years, Mr Agostini said the company had added nearly 800 employees in Asia over the last 12 months, to sustain the rapid sales growth there. Mr Agostini said cost-reductions, stronger economies in Europe, Asia, and the US, and accelerated sales growth in new products would allow faster profits growth in the second half.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes cheesed off over colouring ban THE DANISH dairy industry has appealed to the prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, to intervene to reverse a ruling by European industry ministers that could seriously damage Danish exports of feta cheese. The Danes export 80 to 100 tonnes of feta a year, mainly to Iran, which buys 50 to 70 tonnes and is the biggest single market for Danish cheese measured by volume. Greece and Egypt are other important markets. The Danish feta is made from cow's milk, unlike the traditional feta cheese of the eastern European and near eastern countries, which is made from goat's or sheep's milk. The community's industry ministers, meeting on Monday, approved a directive concerning the use of colouring agents in foods. One of the additives that will be banned from now on is 'patent-blue', without the use of which Danish feta would be the colour of cheddar cheese. The Danish dairy industry believes that it will be impossible to sell yellow feta in its main markets. The value of the export is between DKr1.2bn (Pounds 125m) and 1.5bn a year, including EC export restitution payments of DKr7.59 a kilogram. This is about a quarter of total Danish cheese export returns, worth some DKr5.6bn in 1992. Mr Peter Kjelstrup, information director at MD Foods, the big dairy group, blamed lobbying by the Greeks for Monday's decision. Greece has tried to prevent exports of Danish feta to Greece on the grounds that it is not made from the right raw materials.</p>

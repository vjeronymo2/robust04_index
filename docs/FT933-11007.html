			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nokia buys Philips cables unit NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, is buying the telecommunication cables business of the Dutch group Philips. The move considerably strengthens the Finnish group's position in the German market. The purchase, which is effective on August 1, is being made through Nokia's 57 per cent-owned Dutch cable group NKF on undisclosed terms. The main operations to change hands are an optical fibre cable factory in Cologne and a copper cable manufacturing plant in Nuremburg, which together have some 850 employees and annual net sales of DM300m (Dollars 176.5m). The transaction does not include Philips' copper cable plant in Cologne, which the Dutch group has decided to close down. Nokia has only a small share of the German telecommunication cables market, through its Monette subsidiary, but the purchase from Philips will give it a market position of more than 20 per cent.</p>

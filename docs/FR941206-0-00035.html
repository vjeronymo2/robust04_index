			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 301.6402&hyph;6 of the IRS's Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6) provides that to be eligible to participate in the tax refund offset program an agency must have promulgated temporary or final administrative offset and federal tax refund offset regulations (under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 3720A, respectively). In addition, unless the agency has certified (relying on the most current information reasonably available) that it will not refer the names of present or former federal employees or other persons whose debts are subject to offset under section 5514(a)(1) of title 5 of the United States Code (5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)), it must have promulgated temporary or final salary offset regulations (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(b)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be referred to the IRS for offset, IRS's regulations require, among other things, that a debt be at least $25 and, except in the case of a judgment debt or any debts specifically exempt from this requirement, be referred within 10 years after the agency's right of action accrues (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c) (1) and (7)). In addition, an agency may not refer a debt unless (1) the debt is ineligible for administrative offset (by reason of the exclusion in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) for claims explicitly provided for in other statutes) or the agency cannot currently collect it by administrative offset against amounts payable to the taxpayer by that agency, and (2) the agency cannot currently collect the debt by salary offset (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c) (2) and (3)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before referring a debt, an agency must notify, or make a reasonable attempt to notify, the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, unless repaid within 60 days, will be referred to the IRS for offset against a tax overpayment; give the taxpayer at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable; consider evidence presented; and determine that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c) (4) and (5)). Under IRS regulations, an agency has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer if it uses the most recent address obtained from the IRS pursuant to section 6103(m) (2), (4), or (5) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6103(m) (2), (4), or (5)), except where agency notices are sent to a different address received in a clear and concise notification from a taxpayer (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(d)(1)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, if a consumer debt exceeds $100, an agency also must disclose it to a consumer reporting agency, as authorized by section 3(d) of the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711(f)), unless the consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt because it is obsolete (see 15 U.S.C. 1681(c)) (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(c)(6)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency referrals of debts must contain the name and identifying number of the taxpayer who is responsible for the debt, the amount of the debt, the date on which the debt became past-due, and the agency's designation (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(e)). The agency must promptly notify the IRS if, after a referral, the agency determines that an error has been made with respect to the information transmitted to the IRS, or if the agency receives a payment from the debtor (&sect;301.6402&hyph;6(f)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Interim Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated in &sect;2609.31 (Purpose and scope), the procedures in subpart C of part 2609 apply to determinations that a debt of at least $25 is past-due and legally enforceable, and to PBGC debt referrals to the IRS. Section 2609.32 reiterates when, under IRS regulations, a debt is eligible for tax refund offset. Among other things, a debt is not to be referred unless the PBGC cannot currently collect it by salary offset (&sect;2609.32(b)). The PBGC intends to promulgate salary offset regulations under section 5514(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code (5 U.S.C. 5514(a)). Until it does so, it will not refer to the IRS the names of any persons whose debts are subject to salary offset. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2609.33 specifies the procedures that the PBGC must complete before referring a debt to the IRS. The PBGC may satisfy these requirements in conjunction with any other procedures that apply to the same debt, such as administrative offset procedures or procedures prescribed in part 2606 (&sect;2609.33(a)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

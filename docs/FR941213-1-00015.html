The new proposed regulation would allow for the free flow of vehicular traffic, while still serving the reasonable needs of navigational interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposed Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Galliano ``Tarpon'' bridge is a vertical lift span structure. Navigational clearances provided by the bridge are 3.0 feet vertical above mean high water in the closed to navigation position and 73 feet above mean high water in the open to navigation position. Horizontal clearance is 80.0 feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of tugs with tows, fishing vessels, occasional small oil field work boats and recreational craft. Data provided by the Greater Lafourche Port Commission show that from August 1993 through August 1994, the number of vessels that passed the bridge totaled 1141 for the year. This breaks down to about 95 vessels per month or 3.1 vessels per 24-hour period. Vehicular traffic that passes over the bridge during the proposed closure period from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. averages about 750 vehicles including 4 school busses. An additional 4 school busses cross the bridge between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. and these busses will be able to adjust their schedule to arrange to cross the bridge during the 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. closure. Vehicular traffic that crosses the bridge during the proposed closure period of 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. averages approximately 780. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cote Blanche bridge is a pontoon bridge. There is no vertical clearance in the closed to navigation position and unlimited clearance in the open to navigation position. The same type of navigation that passes the Galliano ``Tarpon'' bridge, also passes the Cote Blanche bridge. The average vessel passage per 24 hour period is 3.1. Vehicular traffic that passes over the Cote Blanche Bridge during the proposed closure period from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. average about 380, including 3 school busses. An additional 10 school busses cross the bridge between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. and these busses will be able to adjust their schedule to cross during the 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. closure. Vehicular traffic that crosses the bridge during the proposed closure period of 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. averages approximately 485. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

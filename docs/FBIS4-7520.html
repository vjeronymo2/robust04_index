			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Josip Manolic, chairman of the Croatian </F> Parliament's House of Districts, by Andjelko Erceg on 25 March;  place not given: "My Removal Is Encouragement for the  Warmongers"]    [Text] We talked to Josip Manolic, chairman of the  House of Districts [Zupanijski dom] yesterday [25 March],  immediately after he postponed -- according to the rules of  procedure -- the debate on the request for his removal, which  was put forth by 36 Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] deputies  and supported by the HDZ deputy caucus.    [Erceg] How would you interpret your removal from all  functions in the party, and the no-confidence vote of your party  colleagues from the deputy caucus of the House of Districts?    [Manolic] This is in complete accord with the policy  conducted by President Tudjman. My political views do not  coincide with his views, both regarding Croatian policy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and regarding the functioning of the civic  state and the way he leads the party. These three issues are  dominant in my disagreement with Tudjman's policy, and that is  the reason why the party is initiating these disciplinary and  administrative proceedings against me.  <H5>  The Rules of Procedure Must Be Observed </H5>   [Erceg] After rejecting the belated placing on the agenda of  the HDZ deputies' request for your removal from the post of  chairman of the House of Districts, you also mentioned the  significant political implications that could arise as a result  of removing the House of Districts chairman in such a roundabout  way? What implications did you have in mind?    [Manolic] The issue in question is the observance of the  established rules of procedure of the Croatian Parliament, in  accordance with which all sessions need to be conducted. You  cannot allow someone to place something on the agenda by  circumventing the rules of procedure on one occasion, and then  denying this right to someone else on another occasion.  Therefore, the rules of procedure must be conscientiously  observed when establishing the agenda and any changes to it in  the course of the session.    [Erceg] How would you assess the events that took place at  the session of the HDZ's Presidency? Namely, there is rumor  that in addition to pressure on you to resign, the removal of  several other people was also discussed? Among them are  Greguric, Mesic, and Valentic?    [Manolic] I do not know whether they were discussed in some  other of the party's bodies and forums, but at the HDZ's  Presidency session no other names were discussed apart from the  ones whose dismissal is already public.    [Erceg] The differences you mentioned as existing between  yourself and President Tudjman have been evident for some time.  Why is it, however, that it is precisely at this moment and in  such a way that these differences within the party are being  addressed?    [Manolic] You know that I have been condemned for three  interviews -- in GLOBUS of 14 January, in FERAL TRIBUNE, and the  latest interview in DANAS, in which I -- as early as January --  said that Croatian policy in Bosnia was wrong.    Namely, I believe that the beginning of the war between the  Croats and the Muslims was an unreasonable act. The  consequences of this war are terrible, particularly for the  Croatian people because they are the smallest ethnic group in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and they have surely had the greatest number  of victims. I have believed from the very beginning that this  policy was not a good one, that it did not take into account the  interests of the Croatian people as a whole. Ways and opinions  regarding the protection of Croatian interests in the region of  Herzegovina -- where 98 percent of the population is Croatian --  are one thing, but the position of the Croats is entirely  different in places where there are less of them, where they are  just a minor ethnic group.    The Washington Agreement has strengthened precisely this  position, that is, the position that peace with the Muslims  should realize the principle of maintenance of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign federation of  three constituent nations.  <H5>  The International Implications of the Dismissal </H5>   [Erceg] Since President Tudjman has signed the Washington  Agreement which endorses your current policy, this means that  you are on the same side. Where, then, do the conflicts  regarding policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina between you and President  Tudjman come in?    [Manolic] This is precisely the absurdity that precipitates  crucial questions. Is this move of Tudjman's a knife in the  back of the Washington Agreement, executed by only one  signatory? Does this mean that there is no desire to realize  this agreement? The removal from political life of those who  strived for such solutions before the agreement was signed  lessens the chances for its realization and on the other hand  presents a chance for those who initiated the war option to  proceed with it under new conditions after the agreement is  implemented. This means that various reasons will be sought  that will block the agreement and thwart its implementation.  Therefore, this is essentially encouragement for the warmongers.    [Erceg] Do you think that there will be international  implications?    [Manolic] The very fact that we are dealing with such an act  means that it will have repercussions on the international  scene. Namely, questions will be asked about the true intentions  of the signatories if people, who from the very beginning opted  for peace and cooperation with the Muslims in these areas, are  removed from politics.    [Erceg] It can be assumed that pressure on you to withdraw  from all other functions will continue. It is well-known that  you are the head of the State Commission for the Normalization  of Relations with Serbs. How would your possible removal from  this function affect current negotiations with the Serbs?    [Manolic] I think that my removal would not reflect well on  either the party or the policy we are conducting toward the  Serbs.    However, the decision is in the hands of President Tudjman  who established the commission by decree and appointed me  president. Therefore, he can also abolish it by decree. If this  is thought out rationally, then I do not expect such a move,  however, if irrationality and emotions prevail, then my removal  is to be expected.  <H5>  HDZ Is Headed Toward Isolation </H5>   [Erceg] We have come to the third reason for the conflict --  the way in which the party is led. What, in your opinion, is  Tudjman's greatest failing in this respect?    [Manolic] The very preparation of the Congress (the HDZ  Congress) was unilateral, with the aim of disqualifying those  people who had the proper attitude not only regarding Bosnia,  but also regarding issues of denationalization and restructuring  of the economy, as well as people who, in a democratic option,  have embraced the HDZ as their party with all its ideological  and political distinctions.    You are aware that the HDZ is founded on the ideologies of  Starcevic [Croatian politician, founder of the Croatian Party of  Rights], Radic [prominent Croatian politician, founder of the  Croatian Peasants' Party and staunch opponent of Belgrade  centralism, assassinated in the Yugoslav Parliament in 1928],  and antifascism, and that these three components are essential  to the HDZ. Today, however, by stressing that the HDZ is a  party, we are deviating from these components. For my part, I  maintain that the HDZ is still a movement based on its primary  principles, which unites various political currents on the  Croatian political scene.    [Erceg] What does the "dissolution" of these distinctions  mean for the HDZ?    [Manolic] The dissolution of these distinctions means that  the HDZ is actually declining into a narrow party-ideological  realm that will in any case -- considering the entire Croatian  political realm -- limit the influence and activity of the  party, which will then, of course, lead it into isolation.  <H5>  The Chaos of the Civic State </H5>   [Erceg] To what extent is the conflict pertaining to the  (non)functioning of the civic state -- which you mentioned  earlier -- connected to the growing number of scandals that are  becoming public?    [Manolic] You will remember that I said in an interview that  the results of the functioning of the civic state are  catastrophic. Every day we are faced with violence, violation of  rights and liberties, illegal and unlawful eviction from  apartments. We still face the grimmest kind of drug trafficking  and other forms of organized crime.    When you compare these incidents with the number of such  incidents that were prosecuted, you see how the civic state  functions. And it is not by chance that the latest Bishops'  Conference raised its voice against crime, violence, and similar  occurrences that the civic state is supposed to solve.    [Erceg] Can you be plain? Do you perhaps wish to say that  there are currents in the party's leadership that are blocking  the functioning of the civic state?    [Manolic] Such a conclusion is self-evident. The civic  state may not function from time to time, but if this persists,  then chaos is imminent. If this happens, we no longer have a  state, the essence of the state being measured by the degree to  which it secures the rights and liberties of its citizens  insofar as their personal status or resolving their material and  other problems.  <H5>  I Do Not Feel Guilty </H5>   [Erceg] Are you still a member of the HDZ?    [Manolic] Yes, I still belong to the HDZ. You can be  expelled, you can die, or you can resign from the HDZ. I  refused to resign either from the party or the parliament,  although my resignation was demanded. My resignation would mean  that I admit to a certain amount of guilt, and I do not feel  guilty because of two reasons. As far as the party is  concerned, I do not feel at all guilty. As for the House of  Districts, I led it in accordance with the Constitution and the  Rules of Procedure, and I conducted policy in accordance with  the policy of the HDZ. These are, therefore, the reasons why I  will not resign and why I am demanding that the impeachment  procedure be initiated in accordance with the Constitution and  the Rules of Procedure.    [Erceg] How do you see your future position in the party  and the parliament?    [Manolic] There are various possibilities: I may stay in the  party and carry out my deputy duties, I may found my own party,  or I may become an independent deputy.    [Erceg] How realizable is the option of a new party?    [Manolic] Everything, including this, depends on the  development of the situation. If further complications arise  and attempts to block the Washington Agreement continue; if the  democratic institutions of the civic state do not begin  functioning, then I think that we must build a policy --  together with all other democratic forces -- that will secure  this process.    [Erceg] Is the demand for your removal and the no-confidence  vote of the HDZ deputy caucus evidence that you do not have  their trust, or do you believe that this decision was imposed on  your party colleagues "from above"?    [Manolic] Party discipline in the HDZ is pretty strong. The  HDZ holds the majority in both houses of the parliament, and it  can make such decisions regardless of discipline. However, a  great many deputies -- for reasons of pure opportunism --do not  wish to defy this discipline and speak out against such  decisions.  <H5>  Deviation From Tudjman's Line -- Expulsion From the Party </H5>   [Erceg] Your opponents insist that you are completely  isolated within the party. How do you assess your own "actions"?    [Manolic] If this were accurate, then all these  "administrative measures" would not be taken against me.    Such measures are essentially a way of frightening the  entire  membership and creating a psychosis that makes it clear that  unless you adhere to President Tudjman's line you can either  leave the party or you know what awaits you. In that case you  will be expelled.    [Erceg] Who, in your opinion, has the greatest influence on  President Tudjman's line? Who are these people?    [Manolic] I believe that the president himself primarily  creates this line. It is Tudjman and Tudjman again.    [Erceg] Would you interpret the latest events as a definite  rift in the HDZ?    [Manolic] I think that conditions for a definite rift have  been satisfied. It only remains to be seen whether they will be  expressed organizationally or not.    [Erceg] Does this mean early elections could be held?    [Manolic] In order for early elections to take place, we  must first have such a crisis in the parliament that it would  dictate these elections. If the rift in the HDZ becomes  "operational," it will mean a crisis in the parliament that  could lead to early elections. However, I believe that at this  point they would not be to anyone's advantage.    [Erceg] Is this a definite parting of the ways between  Tudjman and yourself?    [Manolic] I believe that all this should not yet be taken as  a definite parting of ways. I wish to reiterate that everything  still depends on developments in the political realm. The  political realm still exists, although it has become  considerably narrower.    [Erceg] If this is not a definite closing of doors in your  relations, where do you see the maneuvering space for a  "reconciliation" with Tudjman?    [Manolic] You see, he too can change his position regarding  certain problems. For example, we are sure to agree on the  issue of denationalization because it is in the party program.  You can block the denationalization process for a certain  period of time, but this problem cannot remain unsolved forever.    [Erceg] Can you agree with Tudjman on the way to lead the  party?    [Manolic] That is much less likely to happen. That would be  possible only if we were to hold an extraordinary Congress that  would not be prepared unilaterally, but according to a  completely democratic procedure.</p>

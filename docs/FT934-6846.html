			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A familiar comment on the welfare state Sir, 'Joe Rogaly is right to call for a new Beveridge Report,' writes Frank Field. 'The overall effect of our present welfare state is unsatisfactory not only because many benefits are paid at a relatively low level but because its provisions trap into poverty an increasing number of people . . .' The date of this letter to the FT was September 20 1976: I found it when clearing a floor for new carpets to be laid. Plus ca change. Mary Campbell, 6 Grange House, Highbury Grange, London N5 2QD</p>

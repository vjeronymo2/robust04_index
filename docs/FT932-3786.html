			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Mondale chosen as Tokyo envoy PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday formally proposed that Mr Walter Mondale be the next US ambassador to Tokyo, thus concluding a week in which some of the heat appears to have been taken out of trans-Pacific frictions. The appointment of the former vice-president and senator from Minnesota, leaked earlier this week, has been warmly received in Japan, according to US media reports from Tokyo. Mr Mondale has been freely compared with the revered former ambassador, ex-senator Mike Mansfield, as a heavyweight politician with connections and influence with the President and with Congress. Mr Clinton said yesterday in a Rose Garden ceremony also attended by Mr Mansfield that Mr Mondale, vice-president from 1977 to 1981 and the losing Democratic candidate in the 1984 election, was renowned for 'building bonds of understanding around the world.' He was, the president said, 'extraordinarily well qualified to be given the task of enhancing our relationship with Japan and projecting American leadership in Asia and the Pacific region.' Mr Mondale also struck a note that will be appreciated in Japan, saying that 'although we are economic competitors, we share a fundamental interdependence,' both in each other's economy and in the growth of the global economy.</p>

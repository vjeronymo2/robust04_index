			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stockbroker queries value of BSkyB The flotation of British Sky Broadcasting greatly overvalues the satellite television venture, according to research by stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite. The firm's media specialist Ms Louise Barton estimates BSkyB is worth Pounds 2.6bn, compared with the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.6bn suggested in the flotation proposals. 'We like the company but not its valuation,' said Ms Barton who has based her pricing on an average of discounted cashflow analysis and a conventional multiple of 1995-96 earnings. Henderson Crosthwaite estimates that BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times holds a 17.5 per cent stake, will make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 479m in the year 2000-01. This compares with some analysts' forecasts of more than Pounds 800m. Ms Barton warned that a large proportion of the British population appeared to be reasonably happy with terrestrial television 'supplemented with the odd video'. She predicts that BSkyB's penetration, through dishes and cable networks, will rise from its present 15 per cent of 21m television homes to 27 per cent of the 24m homes at the turn of the century.</p>

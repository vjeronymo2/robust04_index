			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Education spending set to rise by 4% to Pounds 11bn Education secretary Gillian Shephard announced a Pounds 427m increase in government spending on education. The budgets of the Department for Education and Ofsted will total almost Pounds 11bn with a 4 per cent rise - 1 per cent in real terms - over 1994-95 levels. The 1994-95 figure itself represents a real terms increase of 5 per cent over last year's expenditure. Total central government provision for capital expenditure on county, voluntary and grant-maintained schools is Pounds 621m, Pounds 672m and Pounds 661m in 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 respectively. In the first two years, this is an increase of Pounds 14m and Pounds 27m respectively over the figures announced at the time of the last Budget. The private finance initiative is expected to make an increasing contribution in the schools sector. Mrs Shephard also announced plans for grant-maintained and voluntary aided schools have become technology colleges. Additional money will be provided for the programme: Pounds 15m in 1995-96, rising to Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m in the following years to extend the programme to secondary schools wishing to develop a special strength in foreign languages. The programme, which has up to now been limited to grant-maintained and voluntary aided schools, will be open to all maintained secondary schools. By 1997-98, the Department hopes over 200 schools will be taking part in the programme.</p>

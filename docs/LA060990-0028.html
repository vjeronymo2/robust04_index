			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The federal government has agreed to pay two developers and the city of San  Diego $1.5 million as part of a settlement involving the 1983 deaths of two  boys, killed when a military shell exploded after they found it while playing  in a Tierrasanta canyon.  </P> <P> In settling the case, the federal government has acknowledged at least partial  responsibility for the deaths and any similar incidents that may occur, said  San Diego attorney David Holdway, who represented the developers, Christiana  Community Builders and Ponderosa Homes.  </P> <P> The boys' parents sued the developer and the city, who are expected to turn  over the settlement to them.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael E. Quinton, representing the federal government,  refused to comment.  </P> <P> Holdway said Christiana Community Builders, Ponderosa Homes and the city of San  Diego paid $6.3 million in settlements after Corey Alden Peake and Matthew  Smith were killed by a live artillery shell they found in an area that was the  Marine Corps' Camp Elliott during World War II.  </P> <P> The developers and the city combined suits to seek full restitution, but  settled for $1.5 million May 30 in an arbitration proceeding conducted by  Magistrate Harry R. McCue, Holdway said. The Navy has conducted several  cleanups in the area since 1984, and has scheduled a major $16-million sweep  this summer, the developers' attorney said.  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (6): Haven for tax-free gains - Luxembourg / The Grand Duchy has traditionally appealed to French, Belgian, Dutch and German investors AS AN offshore financial centre, Luxembourg has developed two important lines of business - private banking and Ucits, (Undertaking for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities). Luxembourg's bankers shudder if you refer to Switzerland in the same breath as the Grand Duchy itself. However, though members of Luxembourg's financial community dislike the suggestion that Luxembourg is a 'down-market' alternative to Switzerland, there is no denying the fact that Swiss banks have long appealed to a wealthier class of investor - whether a Middle Eastern sheikh or an Asian dictator. Luxembourg has traditionally appealed to continental investors who wanted to keep their investments offshore and for whom Luxembourg's financial district was only a short train or car ride away. These investors tend to use the centre as a safe home for deposits and bearer bonds where their gains can accrue tax-free. Many are attracted by the fact that Luxembourg does not have a withholding tax on profits, unlike some of the rival offshore centres. Although drug-dealing and fraud are regarded as criminal activities in Luxembourg, tax evasion is not. Like the Swiss banks, those in Luxembourg do not see why they should act as policemen for the tax authorities, and this has undoubtedly contributed to its appeal for many years. Luxembourg originally developed as a centre specialising in currency investment: many of the investors from neighbouring countries are familiar with investing in a range of currencies and want advice on currency diversification: they want to know which particular currencies are offering the highest interest rates while keeping their exchange rate risk to a minimum. However, in recent years, many of the banks in Luxembourg have been expanding in the wider field of asset management. For the wealthy investor this may mean private portfolio management, but for those with less than about Dollars 300,000 it usually means investing in pooled funds which in turn invest in real estate, bonds or equities, whether in Europe, the US or one of the emerging East Asian economies. The fact that Luxembourg is a member of the EC, unlike Switzerland, means that some doubt hangs over its future as a tax-evasion centre. The main fear is that Luxembourg could be forced to share information about investors from other EC countries with the relevant tax authorities. However, even if Luxembourg's attraction in this field is diminished, it has already carved out a position as the centre for Ucits. These are pooled, open-ended investments (similar to unit trusts) which allow small investors to invest in a range of shares or bonds. They can be marketed across the EC - in other words, a German or UK group is free to sell its products to French investors. Many of the large fund management groups, including such names as Fidelity, have set up their administrative offices in Luxembourg with the result that there are now several hundred funds based in the Grand Duchy. Luxembourg took the opportunity early on to attract fund management groups to market their funds in the EC from the Grand Duchy as it provides a centrally located base. Furthermore, with its favourable tax environment - no withholding tax on distributions and no income tax on the fund - it has proved a relatively cheap place from which to set up Ucits, even though in many cases the actual fund management is carried out in more sophisticated financial centres such as London or Tokyo.</p>

At a hearing in  Sandpoint, 1st District Judge Watt Prather sentenced James Pratt, 30, to die  for the fatal shooting of Brent Jacobson. Joe Pratt, 28, was sentenced to life  in prison. Jacobson, 41, was ambushed Jan. 12 while tracking the Pratts after  they had tried to rob and kidnap a Sagle, Ida., resident. Both men were  convicted of first-degree murder. They and a third brother in 1982 tipped off  U.S. marshals to the whereabouts of fugitive spy Christopher Boyce after they  had helped Boyce, who had escaped from prison, rob banks in three states.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by economic reporter Junichi Abe: "Political </F> Responsibility, What To Do About Economic Reform--Choosing  Options That Address an Aging Society"]    [Text] Following the conference of finance ministers and  central bank governors of the seven advanced industrial nations  (G-7) that opened in Washington on 24 April, Secretary of the  Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, in seeking concrete movement by Japan  toward drastic reform of its tax system which is linked to  economic stimulus, said, "Reducing the income tax will increase  the income of consumers and serve to correct the foreign trade  balance."    Realization of tax reform within the year is the biggest  international commitment the new government is being urged to  accept. One could say that because the Hosokawa administration  was the "government of political reform," the new Hata  administration's fate is to be the "government of tax reform."    A policy accord was at last reached early on 22 April by the  coalition parties who had steered a difficult course through tax  reform which put forth a "radical reform of the tax system  focused on raising the direct tax rate, including a  restructuring of the current consumption tax and mechanisms for  reducing the direct income tax." This ought to have advanced tax  reform a step forward, but any sense of victory on the part of  the coalition parties and the Ministry of Finance [MOF] was  scant.    At the coalition party tax reform conference, lower house  member Murai (Shinseito), who serves as chairman of the  subcommittee on the tax system, commented, "This is a case where  we could not conclude without arguing over why the consumption  tax rate was being raised after we had said we had achieved a  policy accord." This resulted in a total stalemate.    The MOF cautioned, "Even though we are in agreement in  outline, when we get into the discussion of specific areas such  as the tax rate and the timing of the increase, opposition  resurfaces" (a senior official in the Tax Bureau).    Standing in the way of prospects for tax reform is not just  the departure of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  from the coalition government. "It's been okay up to now to  think about the need somehow for tax reform, with a national  debt reaching 200 trillion yen and how this is for the public  welfare, but when it comes to each member's discussing it in his  election district, can he do it as simply as that?" (Chairman  Murai). The distress of each party increases with the prospect  of actually adding tax reform to the schedule.    "A hike in the new consumption tax rate to correct a  deficiency in the revenue resources for the public welfare  cannot be avoided." The secretary general of the SDPJ's Research  Commission on the Tax System, Harumichi Hosoya, on 12 April,  explained that having created "the '89 Club" in opposition to  the consumption tax, which gave their candidates in the 1989  upper house election an overwhelming victory, the SDPJ was  prepared to oppose any increase. He also said that many,  contrary to expectations, were inclined toward showing an  appreciation of the issues. Although clearly the disparity among  the coalition parties regarding tax reform is narrow, how to  proceed is still unclear.    In response to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's "Vision  of the Public Welfare in the 21st Century," which says that an  increase in the public burden is unavoidable in order to finance  social guarantees for an aging society, there are members of the  government's Research Commission on the Tax System who say, "As  things go, we do not understand if this concept has taken into  account to what degree welfare services will be obtainable. We  have no means to choose."    At a plenary session of the Research Commission on the Tax  System held on 15 April, one after another, beginning with  delegate Haruo Shimada (a Keio University professor), there was  impassioned pointing out of the fact that while welfare services  are one of the bases for raising the consumption tax, none of  the basic supporting data has been made public.    To obtain the understanding of the public on tax reform it  will be necessary to show them the options and the form to be  taken by future public services. With the MOF saying, "There  aren't enough resources," a prerequisite for tax reform is  openly grappling with fiscal reform and revising the unfair tax  system.    It can be said that the process of "responsible reform" is  to  obtain public understanding of the radical reform needed for the  tax system and the accompanying pain through exhaustive  explanation. One more obligation we can seek of the government  is that it not prepare the way for tax reform using honeyed  words on the electorate, but that it address the resources  available to and burdens facing an aging society and then make  "responsible choices."    There are many issues in addition to tax reform which the  government should be pressed to take responsibility for and  decide. The question is being asked how the coalition government  will discharge its responsibilities following the defection of  the Socialist Party to achieve a radical review of fiscal  reform, deregulation, and the food management system in the face  of bureaucratic resistance.</p>

Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. proposed Aug. 21 to buy all the  shares of Lyphomed it does not already own at $31 a share. The sweetened  proposal values Lyphomed at $956.1 million, up from $930 million previously.  Fujisawa already owns 30% of the Melrose, Ill.-based drug company. Earlier this  year, the government allowed the company to sell pentamadine in an aerosol can  to treat pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  </P></p>

Qabbaj added that the evacuation operation began in  mid-November under the supervision of UN officials. He further  said that the Kuwaiti authorities were handed the Kuwaiti side  of Um Qasr yesterday Saturday and that it was now under their  control.    UNIKOM commander (Krishna Thaba) inspected the area after  the  evacuation to make sure that all the Iraqis had left. Thaba  said he hoped that the Iraqis would also be evacuated from the  demilitarized zone of al-Abdali as scheduled.    The head of the international organizations department at  the  Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry, Abd al-Hamid al-'Awadhi, had  previously declared that 63 Iraqis were still in al-Abdali zone.  Al-Awadhi added that these Iraqis would be evacuated after a UN  mission assessed the amount of money they should be offered as  compensation.</p>

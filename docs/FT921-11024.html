			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Breeze of change for accountants: The candidates standing in the first election for a vice-president of the ICAEW VOTING opens today for the post of vice-president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales as a gentle breeze of democracy wafts through the dusty corridors of the 97,000-member organisation. Three candidates are standing for the position, which has always previously been awarded to a successor chosen by the president's advisory committee of about eight senior council members. The election presents the possibility that a non-practising accountant may become president. That is believed to have happened only three times in more than 100 years. It also shows an institute deeply concerned about attacks on accountancy from outside the profession, prompted by recent corporate collapses. Mr Patrick Brenan, a director of Minories Finance, formerly Johnson Matthey Bank, is widely regarded in the City as a safe pair of hands. His many activities include positions with the Investors Compensation Scheme, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and numerous institute committees. Mr Chris Swinson, national managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the seventh-largest accountancy firm by fee income last year, is respected for his technical and intellectual skills. He has stirred controversy, however, with outspoken views on the future of the profession - including possible conflicts of interest in business conducted by large accountancy firms. Mr Roger Lawson, director for Asia, the Pacific and the US at 3i, the venture capital group, is chairman of the accountancy business group in the institute, representing those outside the accountancy firms. He is one of the few non-practising accountants to have been active for long in the institute. Voting will remain open for two weeks. The candidates are not allowed to canvass but short manifestos from all three will be circulated to council members. The three are concerned about attacks on the profession and talk about the need to maintain the integrity of the chartered accountancy qualification. Opinion is split on who is likely to win. Some say there will be a showdown between the divisions in the institute's membership, such as practising and non-practising members, or large versus small firms. One senior insider at the institute said, however, that all the candidates were well known and the election was likely to be decided more on personal respect and affection than on the section of members a candidate was seen to represent most strongly. Whoever wins, it will be some time before his full influence is felt. Under present procedures the vice-president takes up office in the summer, becomes deputy president a year later and president a year after that. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive, said: 'I hope members will recognise the election for the advance that it is. It represents a move towards a more open system in touch with our members' needs.' The election nevertheless remains only partly democratic. Only the 78 elected members of the institute's council will be allowed to vote. The reformers do not want too much change too soon.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Strikes loom over Nigerian election A FUEL shortage caused by strikes and breakdowns in Nigeria's oil refineries threatens to bring chaos to the main cities and to disrupt presidential elections due on Saturday. Long queues have been forming outside the few fuel stations in Lagos which have stocks. Refineries are shut, as are all state-owned fuel depots. Private sector depots have a few days' supply at most. The unions have picked a dangerous week to go on strike. The military government of President Ibrahim Babangida has widespread powers to cancel the election, the first for a decade in Nigeria, if law and order breaks down. Fuel shortages in Lagos a year ago sparked off serious riots. Even before the strike at the weekend by the two main unions in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its marketing subsidiary , output at the country's three refineries had been far below capacity for months due to lack of maintenance. Shortages have affected most of the north and east of the country for several months but spread to Lagos only at the end of last month, when a tanker drivers' strike cut off the supply of fuel and pushed up prices of public transport and foodstuffs by more than 300 per cent. Inflation is already outstripping earnings and the disintegration of public services is testing the patience of Nigerians anxious not to disrupt the transition to democracy which President Babangida has promised to complete by August 27. Some 38m Nigerians are registered to vote on Saturday, many of them in their town of origin far from where they live. Demand for public transport will be exceptional and many people are trying to stockpile fuel for the weekend. A fuel shortage could also affect supplies of ballot papers and staff to run the 106,000 polling booths. Even at full capacity of about 300,000 barrels a day, Nigeria's refineries are unable to meet domestic demand, as about a third of output is smuggled to neighbouring states where subsidies are much much lower.</p>

Gordeyev: "Energy Resources: At the End of </F> Their Service Life"]    [Text] The fuel and energy complex denotes not only  the "bread of industry" but also the heat in our homes, motor  fuel for our cars, and finally the state's main exportable  commodity. What are the prospects of the sector in the year to  come?    According to projections of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy,  the production and extraction of fuel resources in  1994 will be 5 percent below the level of last year. In the  process, the proportion of natural gas in the structure of  primary fuel and energy resources will increase to 49.5 percent,  compared to 47 percent last year.    The output of oil and gas condensate is expected  to come to 327 million tonnes in 1994, compared to 354 million  tonnes last year, of which 83.6 million tonnes will be in the  first quarter of 1994, compared to 91 million tonnes in the  first quarter of 1993. In the process, the rate of decline in  the output of oil will come to 8 percent in 1994, compared to  11.3 percent in 1993 and 14 percent in 1992.    Considerable depletion of oil reserves at the already  developed pools is the main problem of the sector. This is the  reason for the high rate of decline in the output of oil. By  now, 48 percent of the initial oil reserves has been withdrawn  from these pools.    It is only possible to prevent a drop in the output of oil  on  the condition that new pools with total reserves of about 6.5  billion tonnes are put into production in an accelerated manner.  With a view to providing incentives for such work, the  government exempted enterprises of the oil industry from the  payment of export and import duties in 1993, as well as from the  compulsory sale of foreign exchange proceeds from the delivery  of oil for export. The above preferences yielded about 1.8  trillion rubles [R] to the oil-producing enterprises. Foreign  companies were used to repair wells.    As a result of the measures taken, industrial production was  started at 27 oil pools in the first 10 months of 1993 alone,  compared to 10 pools in 1992.    In order to build on this trend, a government decision  envisions leaving up to 60 percent of oil produced by new wells  at the disposal of the sector so that proceeds from its sale  will be earmarked for upgrading, new construction projects, and  the development of new pools.    The process of forming new market structures (joint-stock  companies, oil companies, joint ventures with foreign  investment) will continue in the oil industry. In 1993 the  production of oil by these enterprises increased by a factor of  more than two compared to 1992 and reached about 12 million  tonnes. According to a projected estimate, in 1994 they will  produce on the order of 14 million tonnes.    The delivery of crude oil to oil-refining  enterprises is projected for 1994 in the amount of 226  million tonnes, of which 59 million tonnes will be in the first  quarter, that is, at a level approximating that of last year.  The output of light refinery products will increase somewhat due  to the deeper processing of the raw material, and will come to  32.2 million tonnes of gasoline, 58.1 million tonnes of diesel  fuel, and 12.5 million tonnes of jet fuel.    Low capacity utilization of the oil refineries of Russia in  primary oil processing poses a problem in the development of the  industry. Capacity utilization (excluding the enterprises of the  city of Groznyy) is expected to amount to 72 percent this year.  Some enterprises are at the critical level of capacity  utilization. These are the Saratov Oil Refinery (55 percent),  the Orsknefteorgsintez Production Association (61 percent), the  Kuybyshevnefteorgsintez Production Association (62 percent) and  the Bashneftekhimzavody Production Association (57 percent). A  further decline in the processing of products will bring about a  sharp drop in effectiveness, a growth in the costs of  production, and a deterioration in the quality of manufactured  products, which will cause additional difficulties in selling  them.    With a view to improving the effectiveness of crude oil  processing, the government has resolved to upgrade 17 out of 28  Russian oil refineries. Long-term quotas for the export of  refinery products have been allocated to these enterprises by  way of state support measures. In 1993 oil-refining enterprises  were also exempted from the compulsory sale of 50 percent of  foreign exchange proceeds and from the payment of export customs  duties.    The gas industry, which has a more reliable raw  material base, has a realistic opportunity to increase the  production of fuel and energy resources. In 1994 the output of  gas is expected to amount to 620 billion cubic meters, 165.2  billion cubic meters of which in the first quarter.    However, the failure of consumers to pay for gas consumed,  which has been continuous in recent years, has brought about a  virtual halt of construction work in the sector because of lack  of funds. By the end of 1993 the amount of arrears in payments  for gas reached 2.124 trillion rubles.    In conjunction with this, the volume of work on surface  facilities at Urengoy, Yamburg, and other fields in the  Nadym-Pur-Tazovskiy region in Tyumen Oblast has been reduced, as  well as that of the work on developing fields on the Yamal  Peninsula and the construction of main gas pipelines and their  lateral pipelines (in the first 10 months of 1993, 441  kilometers out of 6,758 kilometers planned by the enterprises  were commissioned, as were four compressor stations out of 27).    The volume of coal production in 1994 is projected  to reach 275 million tonnes, compared to 300 million tonnes in  1993.    The growth of transportation rates for freight carriage has  perceptibly promoted the shrinkage of markets for the sale of  coal both within Russia and for export. Thus, the carriage of  steam coal from the Kuznetsk area over 3,000-4,000 kilometers  within the country actually doubles its final price due to the  cost of delivery. The price of coal exceeds world prices if it  is exported over 4,000-5,000 kilometers to the port of shipment.  With a view to rectifying this situation with regard to the  Kuzbass, a decision has now been made which envisions reducing  railway tariffs by a factor of two for the export shipment of  coal, with financial assistance provided to railway  transportation enterprises and organizations.    A continuous deterioration of the pool of mines and the  growth of production costs and the danger level in mining  operations are some of the main problems of the sector. Of 270  mines, 60 percent have been in service for more than 20 years  and have not been upgraded throughout the entire period of  operation.    A shortage of financial funds exacerbated by delays in the  receipt of subsidies from the budget and consumer arrears is the  restricting factor in coal production. Work on the construction  and upgrading of 48 underground mines and strip mines has  already been suspended for this reason.    A decision to establish a fund of financial support for  coal-producing enterprises through the introduction of a special  tax has been made in order to financially stabilize the  operation of the coal industry. The monies of this fund will be  earmarked for reorganizing unpromising underground and strip  mines, implementing restructuring and development of the sector,  maintaining social facilities, and making payments under the  pay-scale agreement.    A list of unpromising underground and strip mines, with a  total coal-producing capacity of 11.2 million tonnes a year and  number of industrial and production personnel exceeding 48,000,  has been drawn up. At the first stage it is planned to close  down 11 mines with a total capacity of 2 million tonnes of coal  a year, with the number of industrial and production personnel  coming to 9,600.    In conjunction with this, a program for restructuring the  coal industry will have to be developed in 1994 and its  implementation will have to begin. The program should envision  an improvement in the competitiveness of coal production and  reorganization of unpromising underground mines and strip mines,  including a subprogram for ensuring the employment of released  miners.    The generation of electricity in 1994 is projected  in the amount of 910 billion kw-hours (in the first quarter--167  billion kw-hours), compared to 945 billion kw-hours in 1993 (in  the first quarter--277 billion kw-hours). A strained power  supply situation continues in a number of regions of Russia. An  electricity deficit in North Caucasus has been caused mainly by  a power capacity shortage in conjunction with the suspension of  the construction of the Rostov AES [nuclear power station], in  the Transbaykal area--by the failure to commission capacity at  the Kharanor Power Station, and in the Far East--by a shortage  of fossil fuels.    Consumer insolvency is the main problem of the power  industry, as in all sectors of the fuel and energy complex.    State regulation of electricity and heat rates at two  levels,  federal and regional, by the relevant energy commissions is  expected to be maintained in 1994, and the system of electricity  rates for consumers is expected to be streamlined. In the  process, the procedure in effect for settlements for electricity  with agricultural consumers should change, with the latter being  transferred to the regulated group. Rates for the  energy-intensive enterprises of the metallurgical and chemical  industries should be set by applying the 0.8 coefficient to the  level of average transfer rates for electricity for industrial  consumers in a region, and rates for research institutes and  centers of national significance which have energy-intensive  production facilities--at the average producer cost of  electricity in a region.    The commissioning of more than 1.6 million kw of new power  capacity is planned for 1994, including the Kharanor State  Regional Electric Power Station, the Komsomolsk and Tomsk Heat  and Electric Power Stations, the Kolyma Hydroelectric Power  Station, and other installations.</p>

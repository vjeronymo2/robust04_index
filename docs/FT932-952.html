			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Canada clears airline alliance CANADIAN Airlines International has cleared the last political hurdle to its proposed alliance with American Airlines of Dallas, but still faces at least three court challenges which could derail the deal. The federal cabinet has dismissed an appeal by Air Canada, Canadian's main rival, against a National Transportation Agency decision to approve the deal. Mr Jean Corbeil, transport minister, said the government favours a 'strong, viable and competitive airline industry.' Canadian has warned it will collapse if it cannot finalise the alliance with American, which includes an equity injection of CDollars 246m (USDollars 192m) in return for a 25 per cent voting interest. The deal remains clouded, however, by the condition that Canadian must join American's Sabre computerised reservation system. Canadian has so far been unable to extricate itself from the rival Gemini system, which it jointly owns with Air Canada and Covia, a subsidiary of United Airlines. Canadian yesterday called on the other Gemini partners to 'put their differences aside and negotiate a commercial solution to Canadian's early release' from the Gemini contract. Air Canada, however, favours a merger of the two airlines and has strenuously opposed Canadian's efforts to terminate the Gemini partnership. Mr Robert Fay, analyst at Deacon BZW in Toronto, said yesterday that 'the two sides are about as far apart as Toronto and Tokyo'. He noted that, even if the Gemini-related lawsuits go in Canadian's favour, the level of compensation might be unacceptably high for American. Mr Fay said the chances of the alliance going ahead remain about '50-50'. Shares of both Air Canada and PWA, Canadian's parent, rose slightly on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning.</p>

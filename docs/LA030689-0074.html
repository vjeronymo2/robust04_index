			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Winter hung on in much of the nation, with a blanket of frigid air stretching  from the Great Lakes into parts of Texas, where more than a foot of snow fell.  Lows of 20 degrees in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area and 5 below zero in Denver  shattered records for the date, the National Weather Service said. At the  Dallas-Ft. Worth airport, many flights were delayed because of icy conditions,  airline officials said. Baird, Tex., west of Abilene, received 10 to 14 inches  of snow, the Callahan County sheriff's dispatcher said, and Nocona got 11  inches.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> STREET-SWEEPING SCHEDULE IS CHANGED  </P> <P> The city will have a new street-sweeping schedule beginning Monday, officials  have announced.  </P> <P> Streets will continue to be swept every two weeks, but sweeping will now occur  the day after scheduled trash pickups.  </P> <P> Streets where trash is collected on Friday will be swept on Monday.  </P> <P> Previously, there was no connection between street sweeping and garbage  collections.  </P> <P> "It made no sense to have a street swept, then have the trash picked up the  next day or two because if there was a spill, it would sit in the street for  two weeks," said Danian Hopp, assistant to the city manager.  </P> <P> Street sweeping will continue between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m., except on streets in  front of high schools. Those streets are swept at 6:30 a.m.  </P></p>

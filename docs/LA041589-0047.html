			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED TO POLISH BOBBIES' IMAGE  </P> <P> Britain's biggest police force launched a campaign Friday to polish up the  image of the London bobby, pledging a more courteous, friendly approach in  fighting crime.  </P> <P> Peter Imbert, commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, acknowledged  criticism that some police officers in the 27,000-member force were rude and  unhelpful. But he said they were a small minority.  </P> <P> "What we're doing now is making a public statement -- for all levels of the  police service -- of our principles that courtesy is in and abrasiveness is  out," he told a news conference.  </P> <P> The move was in response to a survey by a public relations firm, which said a  minority of officers were aggressive and "too free with their language" in  dealing with the public.  </P></p>

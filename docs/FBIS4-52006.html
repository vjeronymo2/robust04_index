			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 5 (YONHAP) -- A senior South Korean  Foreign Ministry official expressed regrets Thursday over  controversial comments by a top Japanese justice official that  Japan was not an aggressor in World War II and the war was aimed  at liberation of colonies.    Saying that the Seoul government is looking into a real  intention behind the remarks by Japan's Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano, the official said he felt sorry for a cabinet minister  of the Japanese Government intent on a reformist politics and  contribution to the international community to have such a  consciousness of history.    "The remarks might taint efforts by the Japanese people to  redress the past," the official maintained.    Nagano stirred the controversy in an interview with the  national daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN Tuesday by contending that the  Pacific war was not a war of aggression and was instead designed  for liberation of colonies and a greater East Asia coprosperity  sphere.    Nagano also argued that the "rape of Nanjing" in China was a  hoax.</p>

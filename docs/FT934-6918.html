			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Korean Air defiant over helicopters Korean Air yesterday said it would not act on a government order to transfer equipment and technology for assembling engines for the American UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter to Samsung Aerospace. The Korean Defence Ministry announced yesterday that Samsung Aerospace would become the sole engine manufacturer for a second order of 57 Black Hawk helicopters. Korean Air was appointed by Seoul in 1990 to assemble the first 81 UH-60 helicopters and engines bought by the country's armed forces. South Korea's main airline, which has ambitions of developing aerospace manufacturing, argued the transfer of the licensed technology cannot be done without the approval of General Electric of the US, the engine's original manufacturer. Korean defence officials said, however, they foresaw no problem from GE in transferring the license to Samsung. The ministry said the measure would save Won10bn (Pounds 8m) by bringing both engine parts manufacture and engine assembly to Samsung.</p>

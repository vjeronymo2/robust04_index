			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Bonn claims support for halting Eurofighter project GERMANY has persuaded Italy and Spain to support a halt to development spending on the European Fighter Aircraft, according to government officials in Bonn. An official, who acknowledged that approval was still needed from Britain to stop the project, said: 'We are aiming at a switch in the remaining development funds, which are committed but not yet spent, from the present EFA to a new, cheaper and lighter aircraft.' He was speaking after talks between Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, and Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, his Spanish counterpart, at which, he said, Spain had agreed to back the German line. The German official said that Italy had also agreed to support the German line, after talks in Italy last week between Mr Ruhe and his Italian opposite number. The position of the British government, which is still strongly committed to the EFA, looks increasingly isolated, with Spain and Italy, under budgetary pressures, siding with Germany. No action can be taken unless Britain, the fourth partner in the project, agrees, because all are contractually committed to the entire Pounds 8bn development phase of the fighter aircraft. It is estimated that some Pounds 5bn of the total has been spent so far. According to the Munich-based Eurofighter consortium, 270 of the 280 main equipment contracts for EFA development have been awarded, and contractors for most of the remainder have already been chosen. Bonn decided in June not to go ahead with production of the current EFA aircraft, arguing that it was too expensive and designed for an outdated cold war threat. Defence chiefs from the four countries are reviewing the operational requirements on which the EFA project was originally based. The four governments have agreed to investigate the possibility of using the development work done for EFA to design a cheaper fighter aircraft. A decision on that should be reached by the end of the year.</p>

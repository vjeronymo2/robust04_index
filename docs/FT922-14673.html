			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tories pin hopes on public profile SENIOR Conservatives believe the increasing public profile of MPs since the televising of parliament is one factor that gives them confidence in gaining an overall majority, in spite of the trend of opinion polls showing a Labour lead. One Tory strategist said yesterday this 'incumbency effect' - increased by the expansion of regional television, radio and newspapers  - gave a better platform than before to effective local MPs. The incumbency effect is estimated to give sitting MPs an extra 1,000 or so votes, based on a high local profile and the gratitude of constituents who have been helped. Some Tories are suggesting the growth in local media means that the effect in this election may be critically higher than in previous contests. The party's canvass returns are said to show that there has been only some slight slippage in the party's support since 1987, when it polled 42 per cent of the vote. In individual constituencies however, that slippage is said to vary markedly. Tories are playing down their expectations from the remaining opinion polls saying they think people will 'keep the pollsters guessing'. The party believes that ultimately voters will decide on the basis of which party is best placed to take the country out of recession. In what is almost an admission of the Tories' failure to set the agenda during the campaign, however, Mr John Major has expressed privately some frustration and regret that issues he regards as serious - such as devolution and Britain's role in Europe - have failed to rise to the top of the political agenda. In particular, he is said to believe that there has still not been a full debate on the full implications of a series of linked constitutional issues. Senior Tories do believe, however, that the Tory campaign has succeeded in making stark the difference between the two main parties, although they entered the campaign with many people apparently believing there was little to choose between them.</p>

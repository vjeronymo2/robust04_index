			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Odessa oil terminal in doubt A top adviser to Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said yesterday that an ambitious project to build an oil terminal near the Black Sea port of Odessa should be re-examined and at the very least scaled down. The terminal is aimed at reducing Ukraine's dependence on Russian oil imports, possibly by importing oil from the Middle East. Plans call for an annual capacity of 40m tonnes, equivalent to Ukraine's needs. 'The question of building an oil terminal must be re-examined. It is a shame this was approached not from an economic standpoint but rather under the pressure of political considerations,' Mr Kuznetsov said. Construction of the terminal was ordered by Ukraine's former president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. Work began in May, but was halted last month by a court order after claims the land for the project had been acquired illegally.</p>

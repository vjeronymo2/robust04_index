			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 IN VENTURA COUNTY;  </P> <P> YEAR IN REVIEW;  </P> <P> STUN GUNS;  </P> <P> SUITS TARGET POLICE  </P> <P> On Feb. 13, cardiac patient Duane Johnson began throwing himself against the  walls of his room at Ventura County Medical Center to protest plans to transfer  him back to a mental health facility.  </P> <P> Hospital officials summoned Ventura police officers, triggering an ongoing  controversy about the use of stun guns by police.  </P> <P> Stun guns jar the nervous system with 50,000 volts of electricity. Defenders  say they are often the best way -- short of gunfire -- to deter misbehavior.  </P> <P> But as the Johnson case illustrates, they can be lethal.  </P> <P> The two officers jolted Johnson seven to 11 times, according to a coroner's  report, even after he was tethered to a hospital gurney.  </P> <P> He died within minutes of the final application.  </P> <P> The autopsy attributed death to the stun gun applications, as well as to  Johnson's exertions and heart disease.  </P> <P> A district attorney's investigator found that the officers had used  "inappropriate and unjustified" force, but the agency declined to prosecute.  </P> <P> Four months later, a Ventura officer used a stun gun nine times on a driver who  refused to get out of his truck for questioning.  </P> <P> It turned out that the 26-year-old man, Donn Christensen Jr., was coming out of  an epileptic seizure and did not comprehend the officer's commands.  </P> <P> Although the officer's immediate superiors recommended dismissal, Chief Richard  F. Thomas decided instead to suspend the officer for a month.  </P> <P> Thomas also revised the department's policy on stun guns, saying they should be  used defensively, not to force suspects to comply with orders.  </P> <P> Christensen sued the city and ended up accepting a $150,000 settlement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking Ahead  </P> <P> Johnson's parents filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city and county in  September.  </P> <P> It did not specify an amount, but the family had filed claims of $2.5 million  each against the city and county, which rejected them.  </P> <P> It may be years before the case reaches trial.  </P></p>

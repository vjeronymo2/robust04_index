			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Testing Mr Assad Syria, under President Hafez al-Assad, has long prided itself on representing the true, beating heart of Arab nationalism. While the late President Sadat of Egypt, and most recently Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, broke Arab ranks to secure or seek a separate deal with Israel, the Syrians remained constant in their determination to force Israel into a just and comprehensive peace that satisfied all Arab aspirations. That, at least, is how the regime in Damascus has sought to portray itself. So, when President Assad says in public, and in the presence of US President Bill Clinton, that Syria has made a strategic choice for peace and is prepared to establish normal relations with all its neighbours, the international community and Israel should pay attention. Not surprisingly, Mr Clinton and his advisers sought to place the most positive, even generous, interpretation on Mr Assad's statements in Geneva on Sunday. Mr Assad has not survived in the Middle East for so long without measuring his actions and words with consummate care. But he has now said in public what had been demanded from him by both Israel and the US, and has thus gone some way towards answering the accusation that he was doing nothing to prepare the Syrian people for the possibility of peace. The price demanded by Mr Assad is, in large part, well known and formed the basis on which Syria attended the opening of the peace process in Madrid more than two years ago. Mr Assad will accept nothing less that the full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 which, for him, means a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights seized in the 1967 war. But Mr Assad also demands an independent state for the Palestinians and wants the Israelis to withdraw from south Lebanon. He believes that the only durable solution is one which equally resolves all those issues, a view echoed in Geneva by Mr Clinton. There is but one way for Israel to test Mr Assad's statements and the depth of his commitment to his Arab negotiating partners. And that is by announcing a willingness to acknowledge Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in return for a far more specific commitment from Mr Assad on the normalisation of relations with Israel. Such a move would require a politically courageous step from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister. But until he takes it, Israel's leaders cannot be sure whether another, and perhaps the best, opportunity for Middle East peace is being allowed to go begging.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 (KNS-KCNA) -- A forum on human rights  of Koreans in Japan sent a message on May 12 to the prime  minister, the chairman of the state security committee, the  director of the police agency and the chief of the Osaka  prefectural police headquarters of Japan protesting the  unprecedented outrages of the Japanese police authorities  against the Osaka prefectural headquarters of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and its  branches.    The forum in the message denounced the forcible search by  the  Osaka prefectural police on the Osaka prefectural headquarters  of Chongnyon and its branches as a wanton encroachment on the  freedom and human rights of Koreans in Japan.    The message strongly demanded an immediate stop to the  political suppression, watch and violation of human rights of  the Chongnyon organisations and Koreans in Japan.</p>

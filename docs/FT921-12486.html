			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Steetley's share price declines on fears of MMC investigation THE SHARE price of Steetley, the British building materials group, yesterday fell 37p to 332p on fears that a hostile Pounds 600m takeover offer from Redland might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The fall occurred after Mr Peter Lilley, Britain's trade and industry secretary, sought permission from the European Commission to allow UK authorities to consider the monopoly implications of a rival plan to merge Steetley's brick, clay roof-tile and concrete products businesses with those of Tarmac, another large British building materials group. It is the first time the UK government has made such a request under EC merger regulations which came into force in September 1990. Mr Lilley told the EC the Steetley/Tarmac joint venture raised competition issues in the UK brick and clay roof-tile markets. Mr Andrew Melrose, London construction analyst for Nomura, the Japanese securities house, said last night: 'Clearly Mr Lilley is concerned about monopoly considerations in these markets and it seems unlikely that he would not regard the Redland bid in a similar light.' The share price of Redland, which also has UK brick and clay tiles interests, yesterday fell 5p to 465p, and Tarmac fell 5p to 118p. It was the announcement in December of the Steetley/Tarmac joint venture which prompted Redland to announce its bid. The EC's merger control task force is already looking at the Tarmac joint venture, which fell automatically under its jurisdiction because of the size of the two companies. Redland's bid for Steetley, because the combined turnover of the two companies is smaller, is not being examined. Under EC merger regulations, a national takeover authority can ask Brussels for the right to examine a deal itself if it believes the merger affects a 'distinct market' within the member state. The Commission can override that request, as has already happened in the case of a merger between two German battery manufacturers. The UK Office of Fair Trading is currently considering whether to refer the Redland bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A reference would mean that the bid would lapse while an inquiry was carried out. This could take several months. Steetley told its shareholders this week that the joint venture with Tarmac, to be called Allied Building Materials, would control 17 per cent of the British brick market and 13 per cent of the clay tile market. Redland has said that its takeover of Steetley would leave it with 16 per cent of the brick market and 60 per cent of the clay roof tile market. It has indicated to the Office of Fair Trading that it would be prepared to reduce its market share in the clay tile market.</p>

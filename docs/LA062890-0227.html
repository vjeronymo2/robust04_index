			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> CLIPPERS HAD KIMBLE ALL THE WAY  </P> <P> The Clippers were ready to draft Bo Kimble Wednesday, in more ways than one.  </P> <P> Members of the marketing staff had a season-ticket advertisement featuring the  former Loyola Marymount star ready for publication in today's Times, just in  case.  </P> <P> When the Clippers used the eighth pick to take him, the go-ahead was given for  publication. A more generic ad was standing by if the choice wasn't Kimble.  </P> <P> "Bo was the only advertisement we had prepared," said Mitch Huberman, the  Clippers' vice president of marketing and broadcasting. "With the impact Bo  could have on this team in this city, that was an opportunity we had to take  advantage of."  </P> <P> Wednesday afternoon, with the ad finished and delivered, the marketing staff  had no indication from General Manager Elgin Baylor that the Clippers would  take Kimble if he was still around. Like many fans, they just hoped.  </P> <P> The Cleveland Cavaliers will have the right to match any free-agent offers for  forward John (Hot Rod) Williams, an arbitrator ruled.  </P> <P> Daniel G. Collins, who presided at the arbitration hearing, ruled that Williams  will not be credited with a year of NBA experience for the season he sat out  before being cleared of point-shaving charges lodged against him at Tulane.  </P> <P> The ruling means Williams has four years of NBA experience, making him eligible  to become a restricted free agent July 1. Under NBA rules, the Cavaliers have  the right of first refusal on any offer he gets from another team.  </P> <P> Had he been credited with the extra season, Williams would have become an  unrestricted free agent, permitting him to go to the highest bidder.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers are continuing negotiations with Williams, who reportedly turned  down a $10 million, five-year offer.  </P></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Inflation rise blamed on Budget tax measures BRITAIN'S rate of inflation rose last month, ending a downward trend which began in January. Between March and April the retail prices index (RPI) rose by 1.5 per cent, pushing the annual rate of inflation in the 12 months to April to 4.3 per cent, up from 4 per cent in the year to March. Although it was disappointing for the government, economists shrugged off the increase, attributing it to the distorting tax effects of the March Budget. Sterling closed unchanged in London at DM2.9375. A measure often taken as the underlying rate of retail price inflation - the RPI without mortgage costs - showed a year-on-year rise in April of 5.7 per cent, unchanged on March. The Treasury said the rise was due to 'special factors', adding that the underlying inflation rate would fall in the coming months. According to the Central Statistical Office, part of the increase was the result of last year's cut in poll tax bills dropping out of the index. The RPI was further boosted by excise duties which rose by more than the rate of inflation in the Budget, it said. Most economists expect inflation to continue its downward trend but some are concerned at the high core rate. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, Japanese bank, said: 'The message is coming through that there is still some underlying stubbornness in inflation.' Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said: 'Today's inflation figures show no improvement. But yesterday's worrying increase in unemployment shows the heavy price being paid. The government is suppressing inflation rather than curing it.' City reaction, Page 4 Editorial comment, Page 8 Currencies, Page 13</p>

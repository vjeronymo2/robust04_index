			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Perrier vows to fight Nestle bid SOURCE Perrier, the French mineral water and cheese company, yesterday vowed to fight against the FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.38bn) bid launched by Nestle, the Swiss food group, and Indosuez, the French bank. At the same time, BSN, another force in the French food industry, threw down the gauntlet to the Agnellis, the Italian industrialists who have mounted a FFr5.6bn bid for Exor, Perrier's biggest single shareholder. BSN declared that it would not allow the Agnellis to further increase their investment in BSN. Perrier and BSN are embroiled in the battle that is brewing between Nestle, a traditional ally of BSN, and the Agnellis in the European food industry, a sector long considered ripe for consolidation. Mr Jacques Vincent, president of both Perrier and Exor, issued a statement condemning the bid by Nestle and Indosuez saying that it threatened to 'dismantle Perrier' by dispersing its brands between Nestle and BSN. He affirmed his support for the Agnelli bid for Exor and for the investment in Perrier by Saint Louis, the French paper and packaging company associated with the Agnellis. Both the Exor bid and the Saint Louis investment are being investigated by the French stock market authorities. Nestle yesterday said it had obtained court orders to freeze Exor's voting stock in Perrier and to freeze Saint Louis' voting rights on its 13.8 per cent stake. The Agnellis have made no secret of their hopes of raising their indirectly-held 5.8 per cent stake in BSN. Mr Antoine Riboud, president of BSN, was yesterday quoted in Liberation, the French newspaper, as saying that he would block any attempt to increase the Agnelli's investment. Under the terms of an agreement, the Agnellis are unable to directly or indirectly buy BSN shares without Mr Riboud's consent. In Paris, BSN's shares slipped by FFr43 to FFr1,111 yesterday after Mr Riboud's rebuff. Shares in companies linked to the Agnelli family fell sharply in Milan, depressing prices on the market as a whole.</p>

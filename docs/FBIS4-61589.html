			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Hong-sik] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 May (YONHAP) -- Russia and North Korea are  discussing problems related to South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam's planned visit to Moscow in June and other issues of  mutual concern, informed diplomatic sources here said Monday [9  May].    Additional topics of discussion include extension of the  Pyongyang-Moscow friendship and Mutual Assistance (military  alliance) Treaty and the crisis on the Korean peninsula over  Pyongyang's nuclear program, the sources said.    The talks involve a North Korean delegation headed by Vice  Foreign Minister Yi In-kyu and Russian Foreign Ministry  officials. The North Korean delegation arrived here last  Thursday.    The meeting, held for the first time in two years at the  request of the Russian Foreign Ministry, is attracting intense  interest as it comes when Moscow is showing "unmistakable" moves  to restore its relations with North Korea, the sources said.    Moscow and Pyongyang had been drifting apart since former  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev introduced perestroyka and  then following the collapse of communism.    Diplomatic observers here said Moscow apparently called the  meeting to discuss the two sides' positions on the North Korean  nuclear row that is causing tension worldwide and to seek a  resolution of the issue through dialogue.    Moscow will resurrect its earlier proposal for an  eight-party  conference to reach "an overall settlement" of the nuclear  problem among South and North Korea, the United States, Japan,  China and Russia, as well as the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations.    North Korea, for its part, is expected to again demand the  suspension of the U.S.-South Korean joint military exercise  "Team Spirit" and inspection of U.S. "nuclear facilities" in  South Korea, the sources said.    Pyongyang has yet to show any official reaction to Moscow's  proposal for the eight-party conference.    Russia, which wants to play the role of "peace protector,"  is  not in a position to support North Korea in the nuclear dispute.  It will nevertheless stress its opposition to United Nations  sanctions against North Korea.    Another problem drawing keen interest is what the two  countries will do with regard to the Pyongyang-Moscow accord,  especially the Military Mutual Assistance Treaty.    In February 1993, Russia sent then-Vice Foreign Minister  Georgiy Kunadze to Pyongyang and explained to North Korea that  "the automatic intervention clause" of the Military Assistance  Treaty would have to be interpreted in accordance with the  changed situation in the post-Cold War era. The clause had  stipulated that the former Soviet Union would automatically  intervene militarily if North Korea was attacked by outside  forces.    At that time, North Korea reportedly replied that it would  send Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu to Moscow for further  discussion of the problem.    But the visit has not been realized and the question remains  one of the major issues pending between Moscow and Pyongyang.    The Moscow-Pyongyang Military Alliance Treaty expires at the  end of 1995 and unless either one renounces it unilaterally, it  will automatically be extended for another five years.    Another issue bothering Pyongyang concerns North Korean  loggers at Siberian camps. North Korea is reportedly trying to  block any escaped loggers from settling in South Korea.    Insisting that all North Korean loggers who fled their camps  in Siberia are "criminals," North Korea is demanding their  detention under judicial and forestry agreements signed by the  two countries.    Against this North Korean claim, the Moscow government  maintains that any foreigners in Russia can leave for third  countries if they take the proper legal steps.    In this regard, Russia and South Korea are currently  discussing resettlement of fleeing North Korean loggers in the  South and, sources believe, they will eventually be able to do  so although it may take some time.    The Russian-North Korean forestry agreement expired at the  end of last year and the two are renegotiating the pact.    With regard to President Kim Yong-sam's visit, which is some  20 days away, North Korea is worried that it might "pour cold  water" on Moscow-Pyongyang relations, which have been warming up  of late.</p>

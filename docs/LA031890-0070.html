			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / GEORGE L. PERRY: MANAGING ECONOMIC REUNIFICATION  </P> <P> In the 1960s, the world marveled at the German "economic miracle" as the West  German economy came back from the rubble of World War II to become the economic  superpower of Europe. Now, with the end of the Cold War and the promise of  German reunification, the world looks for an encore as East Germany is pulled  up to parity with its brother to the west.  </P> <P> East German workers are virtually as skilled, trained and educated as their  West German brethren, yet they earn lower rel wages as corresponding to their  lower productivity working in the centrally planned and state-run East German  economy. West German firms have everything needed to improve that productivity:  capital, technical skills and business experience. For them, East Germany  represents the opportunity for highly profitable new investments, both in new  plants and equipment in the private sector and in the national infrastructure.  </P> <P> Given these conditions, interest rates in Germany will need to rise to attract  investment funds. Similarly, the West German mark will need to appreciate  against other currencies so as to reduce the German current account surplus and  shift the export of West German capital from Western Europe, where it now goes,  to East Germany.  </P> <P> Because new investment promises to be so profitable, the stock prices of German  firms that figure to be involved in the modernization of East Germany shuld  rise. The effect on the overall stock market will be tempered by the fact that  some of Germany's traditional export industries, such as chemicals, will suffer  from the expected appreciation of the West German mark. But because the return  to investment in East Germany promises to be so great, the German stock market  ought to rise, on balance, even as its bond market falls and the West German  mark appreciates. As investment and the efficiencies induced by market  incentives act on the East German economy, productivity will rise and, with it,  real wages and living standards of East German workers.  </P> <P> Is it inevitable that all this will work out neatly? If not, what are the  likely complications? For starters, there is the range of micro-management  problems associated with converting to a market economy. This conversion will  lead to largely uncharted territory for all the formerly state-run economies.  They will surely have problems with both the economic transitions and the  political and social issues that are part of the change. One would expect East  Germany to manage these problems comparatively well, thanks to the guidance and  material aid that will be available from West Germany.  </P> <P> Ironically, the ethnic ties between the Germanys also create a problem that is  distinctly their own -- the massive migration of workers from East to West.  Rather than wait for new capital to come to him and raise his living standard  tomorrow, the East German worker with freedom to relocate has been coming to  the West where the existing capital and market system raises his living  standard today.  </P> <P> Motivated largely by the desire to stem this tide of migration, the West  Germans have proposed imminent full economic union. The idea seems to be that  if Germany were all one big economy, there would be little incentive to leave  the East. In this spirit, what exchange rate to use in forging the monetary  union has been a central issue. Although some of what is being discussed  publicly may be motivated by today's East German elections, the desire to set  an exchange rate generous to the East Germans is clear. The black market rate  has been near one West German mark to 10 East German marks. Estimates based on  comparative manufacturing productivity have been near one to three. But  proposals for conversion with unification have gravitated to one to one, which  is the rate that West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported last week.  </P> <P> Such a generous exchange rate would provide a substantial transfer from West to  East. It is estimated that 180 billion East German marks are waiting to be  converted, roughly 150 billion in savings and 30 billion in circulation. At an  even conversion, 180 billion West German marks (about $105 billion) would  amount to nearly 15% of annual consumption in West Germany.  </P> <P> Because much of this liquid wealth represents retirement savings of East  Germans, it would not all be suddenly spent. Nonetheless, if a generous  exchange rate is provided, it would have to be accompanied by some combination  of a plan for partially freezing the converted East German assets so that they  would be spent only gradually over a period of years, and higher taxes to  suppress West German purchasing power.  </P> <P> Whatever else it does, a generous exchange rate will not stop emigration,  because the movement of labor mainly depends on the opportunity to increase  real earnings -- to buy more with a week's pay. Providing parity in exchange  rates, so that one East German mark trades for one West German mark, cannot  produce parity in earnings.  </P> <P> Whatever the exchange rate -- or when eventually there is a common currency --  in a market economy, wages in East Germany will have to adjust to reflect the  lower productivity of its workers. Thus, the migration incentive will be as  great as ever, diminishing only gradually as productivity and living standards  improve in the East.  </P> <P> The dilemma is that encouraging employment and investment in the East requires  a realistic low wage, while suppressing migration from the East requires an  unrealistic high wage. To achieve both goals, the West would have to subsidize  employment in East Germany. Only then could firms in the East have net costs  low enough to maintain employment at the same time their employees received net  wages high enough to keep them from leaving.  </P> <P> Although, in principle, they can resolve the dilemma, introducing subsidies is  risky. Finding the right level of subsidy would not be simple, and the right  level would not be the same for all industries. Furthermore, subsidies should  be phased out as new investment and the incentives of a free market raise the  productivity of East German workers. But even if they could be well designed  and temporary, introducing a system of subsidies could undermine the broad aim  of moving East Germany to a market economy.  </P> <P> Excessive migration could be stopped more directly, perhaps by requiring that  workers have a place to stay and a job to which to go before they relocate.  Such a direct approach would minimize the economic hazards that would go with  trying to dampen migration by manipulating wages. But that might not do  politically.  </P> <P> The fall of the Wall was such a powerful symbol of freedom that to impose even  sensible restraints on relocation may now be difficult. If so, and if  policy-makers do not face up to the need to temporarily subsidize employment in  the East, Germany could face difficult transitional problems, however promising  the medium run prospects for its economy may be.  </P></p>

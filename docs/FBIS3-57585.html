			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baltic News Service has reported that Lithuanian and  Kaliningrad negotiators failed to achieve any specific agreement  on the transit of Russian passengers and cargo through the  territory of Lithuania.    Yuriy Khlebnikov, an official from the international  department at the Kaliningrad region administration office, told  journalists at a news conference today that the talks failed to  bring results.    The talks were headed by Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the  group for the talks with the CIS and ambassador at large, and  Harry Shmykhov, first deputy head of the Kaliningrad region.    A joint protocol has been prepared by the group experts from  both sides, which confirms Lithuania's intention to open a  Russian transit corridor on her territory. Although no dates  have been mentioned, it is expected however that the corridor  could start functioning at the end of the current year. Places  in Lithuania will have to be earmarked and the procedure on how  this transit will be controlled will have to be defined.    Lithuania is going to get acquainted with the experience of  the West Berlin transit corridor, which was in operation until  the Berlin Wall had been demolished.    It was announced that Lithuania proposed to simplify the  procedure of granting transit visas at the border crossing  points to cargo vehicles carrying so-called national economy  goods. It was announced at the news conference in Kaliningrad  that all the Russian passenger trains except two would travel  through Lithuania non-stop and without border checks.</p>

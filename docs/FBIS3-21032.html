On 18 January at the Champigny command post (Val-de-Marne),  Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and Mr. Michel Giraud,  president of the Ile-de-France Regional Council, formally  inaugurated the link-up of the experimental fleet with the  traffic monitoring information system for eastern Paris (Sirius).    Equipped with high-powered electronic terminals, drivers  will  be guided in real time, intersection after intersection. The  equipment includes a GPS (Global Positioning System)  position-location module and a mechanism for obtaining "finer"  location fixes using sensors attached to the vehicle wheels. The  computed path to destination can also be corrected "in real  time" to adjust for traffic congestion as the terminal receiveds  and decodes traffic monitoring data.    Information and computed paths are displayed on a  liquid-crystal screen built into the dashboard. The driver sets  the vehicle's destination: A green arrow appears showing the  general direction, and on the left is a simplified schematic of  the next intersection showing route to be followed, junctions,  "Do Not Enters" (in red), and distance in meters to the next  turn.    By pressing a key, the driver can see the name of the street  along which the vehicle is currently proceeding. A soft voice  gives a timely alert message: "Turn right in 200 meters." If the  driver makes a mistake, the itinerary is corrected.    The geographic data is located on digital optical disks  prepared with the help of the National Geographic Institute  (IGN). The most costly part of the program is compilation of the  maps to be entered into the laser disks.    The system operator is an economic interest group (GIE) made  up by Renault, TDF, and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez. The  enterprises concerned believe it will take another two years  before the system is totally operational and ready to be  marketed at a price between 12,000 and 15,000 French francs. By  that time, digital disks will have "mapped" the entire country,  including all towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants.    When it was introduced in Paris, the on-board computer  performed quite satisfactorily, handling geometrically complex  intersections such as Place Denfert-Rochereau, indicating  highway junction points and displaying side-roads as they  approached one by one, along with pedestrian walkways and  outlets of private roads.    The utility of the system for road transport professionals  seems obvious (deliveries, express parcel service, taxis). With  profitability assured from these sources, it could then be made  available to the general public at a reasonable cost, which  Renault believes would be comparable to an option such as air  conditioning. Europe-wide standards should make it possible to  prepare compatible digital maps for the most important European  Community countries.</p>

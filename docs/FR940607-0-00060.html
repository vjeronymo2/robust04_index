			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The $250,000 threshold was also supported by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), the professional association for state officials who supervise and regulate state-chartered commercial and savings banks. The CSBS concluded that the increased threshold would reduce unnecessary costs and would not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous bank and thrift commenters also reported that their experience with the $100,000 threshold had been good. Moreover, commenters opposed to the increased threshold did not identify institutions that had failed or suffered significant losses because of the existence of the $100,000 threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies believe that low loss experience with a $100,000 threshold provides justification for an increase in the threshold to $250,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data Indicate Similarities Between the $100,000 Threshold and $250,000 Threshold. A substantial body of evidence provides strong reasons to believe that exempting loans between $100,000 and $250,000 from the Title XI appraisal requirement will not present materially greater risk than the prior exemption for loans under $100,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data from the commercial bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) for year-end 1992 show that approximately 53 percent of the dollar volume of all real estate-secured loans of all sizes in the commercial banking industry are loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data from the Thrift Financial Reports (TFR) for year-end 1992 show that the number is 77 percent in the thrift industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data on loan size are not reported for residential loans on the Call Report or TFR. However, information from the National Association of Realtors, the Census Bureau, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) indicate that approximately 29 percent of the dollar volume of 1-to-4 family real estate loans to purchase new homes, and 33 percent of the dollar volume of loans to finance the purchase of existing homes, fell below the prior $100,000 threshold. Approximately 56 percent of the dollar volume for new 1-to-4 family homes and 49 percent of the dollar volume for existing homes fell between $100,000 and $250,000. In sum, 85 percent of the dollar volume of mortgages financing new homes and 82 percent of the volume of mortgages financing purchases of existing homes will fall below the $250,000 threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, increasing the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000 is likely to more than double the amount of lending for 1-to-4 family residential real estate loans exempt from the Title XI appraisal requirement. Inasmuch as a solid majority of total real estate lending is composed of 1-to-4 family loans, the agencies believe that 1-to-4 family loans will be the largest block of loans exempted by the increase in the threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The increase in 1-to-4 family residential real estate loans exempted by the $250,000 threshold will not affect safety and soundness, as these loans are traditionally the safest in a lending institution's portfolio. In 1992, the net loan charge-off rate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for all commercial bank loans secured by 1-to-4 family real estate was 0.23 percent; for thrifts, the net charge-off rate for loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential real estate was 0.22 percent. Low loss rates for 1-to-4 family residential real estate loans predate enactment of Title XI; for example, in 1991, when the great majority of 1-to-4 family loans had been originated prior to implementation of Title XI in August 1990, the charge-off rate for 1-to-4 family loans was 0.20 percent for commercial banks and 0.11 percent for thrifts. See FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile (4th Quarter 1991) and Thrift Financial Reports (1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The net loan charge-off rate is determined by taking the dollar amount of gross losses, subtracting the amount recovered, and dividing the result by the average of outstanding loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning June 30, 1993, commercial banks and thrifts are required to report annually the number and dollar amount of non-farm non-residential real estate loans, which basically constitute business loans secured by real estate. They are also required to report the number and dollar amount of all agricultural loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data from the June 1993 Call Reports show that 12 percent of the dollar volume of real estate-secured business loans was below the $100,000 threshold. Also by dollar volume, only 11 percent of outstanding real estate-secured business loans fell between $100,000 and $250,000. For thrifts, the TFRs show that 10 percent of the dollar volume of all real-estate secured business loans was below $100,000, and 9 percent between $100,000 and $250,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These findings are consistent with data compiled in the 1989 National Survey of Small Business Finances, which surveyed firms with fewer than 500 employees. See National Survey of Small Business Finances (1989) (cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and Small Business Administration). According to that survey, of the commercial mortgages to small businesses by depository institutions, 6 percent of the dollar volume of these loans was in loans of less than $100,000, and 12 percent was in loans between $100,000 and $250,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the regional examiner surveys, the $100,000 threshold has not resulted in significant losses, even though that threshold captures 12 percent of the dollar volume of small business loans. The agencies do not believe that an increase in the threshold that exempts another 11 percent of business loans will significantly increase such losses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

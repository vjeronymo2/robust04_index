			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sun Yingzhuo (1327 2019 3820): "Shandong Use of </F> World Bank Loans Inspected"]    [Text] It was the second day of the conference convened to  inspect Shandong's utilization of World Bank loans. During the  morning session, Vice Governor Song Fatang of Shandong, Director  Nicholas Hope of the World Bank's China and Mongolia bureau, and  an official from the World Bank office of the Ministry of  Finance addressed the gathering on behalf of the provincial  government, the World Bank, and the ministry, respectively.    Song Fatang began his remarks by expressing his warm welcome  to World Bank officials who had come to Shandong for inspection  and guidance purposes. He said, "There has consistently been  good and effective cooperation between the province of Shandong  and the World Bank since 1982. As of late 1993, Shandong had  utilized a total of $824 million in World Bank loans distributed  among 26 projects with a combined investment of 11.74 billion  yuan. Of the total loan amount, almost 40 percent went to  energy; 30 percent, agriculture; and the rest, communications,  industry, and social development. Utilizing World Bank loans,  Shandong has expanded projects in agricultural irrigation,  highway construction, education, and public health; accelerated  agricultural and economic development in impoverished areas;  furthered the development of basic industries; and raised  technical and managerial standards, all of which has had  positive effects on economic and social development in Shandong.    Song Fatang noted in his speech that the signing of a loan  agreement is but the first step in bilateral cooperation.  Reviewing a project promptly and investigating and solving in  time the problems that arise in the course of implementing a  project are important ways to ensure that a project is completed  successfully and meets expectations. The latest conference, he  said, would do much to help Shandong utilize World Bank loans  even better. He expressed the hope that the World Bank and the  various ministries in the central government would continue to  show interest in and support Shandong.    Mr. Hope expressed his heartfelt thanks for the warm  reception given him and others by the Shandong provincial  government and the meticulous way the conference was put  together. He said, "China's outstanding performance in executing  World Bank loan projects is known to all. Currently 90 projects  are under way with a total loan amount of $16 billion. Shandong,  in particular, has accumulated a wealth of experience in  implementing a variety of projects and for the most part  compares very favorably with other provinces and nations. As  China undertakes more and more World Bank-financed projects,  inevitably a host of problems will occur. This conference is  profoundly significant in that it gives us an opportunity to  obtain a detailed understanding of the implementation of  provincial-level projects."    Director Huang Kehua of the Shandong Finance Office  presented  a report on the inspection of Shandong's utilization of World  Bank loans. He expressed the hope that cooperation between  Shandong and the World Bank would cover an even broader area,  including environmental protection, infrastructural development,  social development, economic development in impoverished areas,  and housing reform. Dawude, director of operations in the World  Bank's representative office in China, devoted his report to a  detailed description of the implementation of World  Bank-financed projects in Shandong and had high praise for the  specific way in which Shandong utilizes World Bank loans.    In the afternoon the conference broke up into small groups  to  discuss the financial issues of loan projects, cost and risk  analysis, and other topics.</p>

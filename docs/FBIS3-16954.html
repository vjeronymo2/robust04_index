			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Saeima Committee Supports </F> Foreign Policy Doctrine"]    [Text] Riga, 8 Mar -- The Saeima [parliament] Committee for  Foreign Policy has expressed its support for Latvian foreign  policy, as outlined by the government, as well as its agreement  to debate the policy doctrine during a plenary session of  parliament. It is possible that discussions on this proposal  will begin almost immediately.    As Aleksandrs Kirsteins, head of the Committee for Foreign  Policy, told journalists after the committee's meeting, the  foreign policy doctrine is based on Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs' speech at the international conference "Latvian  Security at the Turn of the Century." It has been submitted to  the Saeima in a somewhat different form. V. Birkavs will  present the doctrine at the plenary session, before formal  debate begins. At present, Latvia does not have a foreign  policy doctrine, per se, approved by parliament.    The main points of this doctrine are: Latvia's orientation  towards the West, membership and cooperation with international  institutions -- NATO, the European Union [EU], the Western  European Union, CSCE, the Balladur plan -- as well as  concluding a free-trade agreement with the EU that will permit  Latvia to obtain EU associate member status. Latvia's relations  with Russia, according to the foreign policy doctrine, should be  equable in economic as well as political terms, though not at  any price, especially not for the price of losing Latvia's  general orientation, emphasized A. Kirsteins.    A. Kirsteins also said that Latvia has to accept, in the  immediate future, the law on citizenship, and the document  regulating the status of foreigners and stateless people in  Latvia. The suggestion of Russian President Boris Yeltsin [not  further specified] could be interpreted as a good idea, A.  Kirsteins stated.</p>

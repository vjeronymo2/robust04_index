			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Risky step into the rug trade - A man who sold his travel agency to take an Oriental carpet ride THE ORIENTAL rug trade has earned for itself a rather tacky image. Allegations of pitifully-paid weavers labouring in near-slave conditions making carpets sold for bloated margins in Western department stores. Small shops in London's West End permanently displaying 'closing down sale' stickers and offering bogus reductions on artificially-inflated prices. Spurious Sunday warehouse sales advertise low-cost wholesale deals that are nothing of the sort. A minefield waits the ordinary buyer. The saving grace is that many types of Oriental carpets are gorgeous and can be good value. In many supplier countries the weavers work in conditions embedded in tribal and village culture. In the perhaps surprising setting of Norwich, the very English couple, John and Kate Wright, entered this unusual market six years ago. With virtually no background knowledge of the rug trade, they opened a shop in the Norfolk city and now earn their living buying and selling Oriental carpets. Last year, the business sold Pounds 170,000 of rugs on which it made a net pre-tax return of about 10 per cent. This rather modest return is calculated after the couple extracted a salary of well over Pounds 20,000. Not surprisingly, Oriental Rugs of Norwich is feeling the uncomfortable heat of recession which has left the industry's warehouses piled high with unsold carpet. Wright was the managing director and a shareholder in a local travel agency when the couple bought a large Victorian house in the mid-1980s. 'We started looking for Oriental rugs but there was really nowhere in Norwich. I thought specialist organisations were going to be the thing of the future. I thought we could make a business out of carpets.' While still retaining his holding in the travel agency, Wright found a two-floor shop in the centre of Norwich at the end of 1986 and began renting it at Pounds 8,000 a year (the rent is now Pounds 12,000). Persistent questioning of people in the trade unearthed some names of carpet importers and the remarkably modest sum of Pounds 15,000 bought enough carpets to stock one floor. The customer base and rationale of the business is the same now as it was then. Almost all the Wrights' customers are 'local' with about one-fifth of them tourists. Wright claims to offer carpets at prices lower than those at most outlets. 'We don't add anything on to the price to take off in bargaining. The price we show is what you have to pay.' The gross margin - the difference between what Wright pays and what he sells to the customer for - is about 30 per cent. Wright's average retail price is Pounds 350, relatively low mainly because more than one-quarter of sales are of generally cheaper Chinese rugs. Prices range from Pounds 70 for a small open-back Chinese rug to Pounds 6,000 for a 15-feet Persian Kashan. Pakistan-made Bokharas start at around Pounds 200, a geometric-patterned Melas from Turkey at Pounds 1,200 and a silk Qum from Iran at Pounds 1,500. Though Wright has visited a large number of weaving centres in Asia, he buys virtually all his stock from Asian importers in the UK. 'You cannot compete on price unless you do. An importer might be buying Pounds 1m or maybe 100,000 square metres of carpet at a time. He gets the benefits of quantity. A big importer might be able to get carpets at 25 per cent less than we would.' Wright believes the importer is making a similar 30 per cent margin. How does Wright know he is getting a reasonable price from the four or five main importers that he uses in London? 'It is a matter of trust. I haggle down to the last half per cent. It's part of the job I enjoy. You can establish the lowest point. I know we get the same price as other buyers.' The Wrights choose each carpet they purchase. 'Kate does most of this because I think she has a particularly good eye for it.' Much of the shop's stock is hauled up from London in the Wrights' estate car. The company employs two shop assistants. One, Claire Carrington, has a fine arts degree and commands the kind of knowledge a lot of customers like: knot counts (an extremely fine carpet will have between 300 and 800 knots per square inch); the desirability of Persian carpets from Qum, Isfahan and Kashan; the horizontal looms used by nomadic tribal groups and the vertical looms of the village; the differences between an Indian Kaimuri, a Persian Sarouk and a Turkish Melas; the tribal designs from Afghanistan; the use of extensive flat-weave Kilim on the edge of Belouch rugs. The recession hit the company late but when it did - at the end of last year  -the impact was immediate. It has cut the company's shop sales by close to one-third. 'It is the more expensive carpets, above Pounds 1,500, where sales have been hit,' says Wright. A significant drop in the cost of purchasing carpets from Iran has not helped much, even though Wright says he is passing on these reductions to the customer. The retail price of Chinese carpets has fallen 40 per cent over the past five years, partly because of a glut. Some importers in London have also begun to offer substantial reductions on Persian carpets in the wake of the twin impact of enormously-distorted black market currency and Iran's need to earn more foreign currency. To try and build new trade, Wright has begun showing carpets in potential customers' homes. 'The other day, I went to five houses and sold at three.' He is also keen to take contracts on commissioning the making of carpets for private organisations. He has just completed one for a huge carpet for Sidney Sussex college, Cambridge, and is talking with one or two of the university's other colleges. Wright is also looking at the possibility of opening a shop in Cambridge, though the recession has worried him and he remains anxious about its length and depth. He knows that his business could be seriously harmed if another specialist carpet shop opened in Norwich. Having sold his stake in the travel agency, Wright is glad to have made the switch. 'No matter how many times you go through the pile of rugs with a customer you never get tired of talking about them. It is an enjoyable way of earning your living.'

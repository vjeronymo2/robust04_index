			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO DEDUCT CASUALTY LOSSES;  </P> <P> TAXES: THE IRS ALLOWS DEDUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. BUT TO QUALIFY, THE  CIRCUMSTANCES MUST BE 'SUDDEN, UNEXPECTED OR UNUSUAL.'  </P> <P> Nineteen eighty-nine was an especially bad year for casualty losses. Major  events such as Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake caused  multibillion-dollar losses. But millions of taxpayers with less spectacular  "sudden, unexpected or unusual" casualty losses can also claim deductions on  their income tax returns.  </P> <P> Fire. Tornado. Theft. Vandalism. Broken water pipes. Earthquake. Windstorm.  Hail damage. Accident. Hurricane. Flood. These are some of the major causes of  deductible casualty losses.  </P> <P> Business casualty losses are fully deductible. However, only net uninsured  personal casualty losses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income qualify  for this deduction. If you are insured, but don't want to file a claim for fear  of insurance cancellation or any other reason, then you cannot claim a casualty  loss deduction.  </P> <P> To illustrate how the personal casualty-loss deduction works, suppose your  adjusted gross income is $50,000, and you had a $20,000 fire loss, but  insurance only paid $12,000 of your repair costs.  </P> <P> Of your $8,000 uninsured loss, $5,000, or 10%, of your $50,000 adjusted gross  income is not deductible, leaving a $3,000-casualty loss deduction. However,  the first $100 of each casualty loss event is non-deductible, so your net  deduction would be $2,900.  </P> <P> The cause of the loss must be "sudden, unexpected or unusual." For example,  termite damage to your home is usually not deductible because it occurs very  slowly, often over many years. However, if you can prove that your termites  worked very fast within just a few months, several Tax Court decisions have  allowed the losses.  </P> <P> Other non-qualifying slow-damage examples include Dutch elm tree disease,  erosion, well contamination, carpet beetles, dry rot, normal wear and tear and  old age. However, if a qualifying event causes the loss, then a casualty loss  may result. For example, if a flash flood causes your rotted front porch to  collapse, then you have a deductible casualty loss.  </P> <P> Because casualty losses are often large, IRS auditors love to audit these  deductions. Taxpayers should be prepared with solid proof of loss, such as  police reports, photos, appraisals, repair bills, receipts, insurance  settlements and other evidence. Your personal estimate of the before and after  valuation or replacement cost is usually insufficient.  </P> <P> In addition to the 10% of adjusted gross income limit for personal,  non-business casualty losses, any insurance settlement and the $100 per event  floor must be subtracted when calculating the deduction. Use IRS form 4684 and  itemize the loss on Schedule A of your federal tax returns.  </P> <P> The direct casualty loss, however, cannot exceed your adjusted cost basis in  the property. But indirect costs, such as temporary housing, moving costs,  legal expenses, crop damage and property protection fees also are deductible.  </P> <P> If your loss deduction eliminates your 1989 income tax, you can carry any  excess loss back to 1986, 1987 and 1988 for a tax refund, then forward up to 15  years until the loss is completely offset by your taxable income.  </P></p>

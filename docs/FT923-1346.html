			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palm oil refiner in receivership NALIN Industries, one of the biggest refiners of crude palm oil in Malaysia, has been placed in receivership. Nalin, whose majority shareholder is the Indian Birla merchant family, has been hit by tighter operating margins as Malaysia's crude palm oil refining capacity has rapidly expanded in recent years. Malaysia's refineries now have a processing capacity of more than 10m tonnes a year, though supply is only 6m tonnes. Nalin's total debt is estimated at MDollars 100m (Dollars 40m).  --------------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS       (As at Monday's close)  -------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium   +8,850  to 1,369,350 Copper      +1,775  to   286,850 Lead          +475  to   160,375 Nickel        +360  to    45,234 Zinc          +700  to   355,450 Tin           +120  to    14,990  --------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): The South Bank The Deep South comes to London this week when the South Bank Centre on the Thames is enlivened both inside and out by the Festival of the American South. Music takes pride of place with banjo greats like Ralph Stanley bringing mountain style Bluegrass and guitarist Robert Ward the sounds of New Orleans. David Rousseve and the Reality Company provide dance backed with gospel singing, and there are plays from both black and Appalachian drama groups. All this and an Elvis Presley exhibition in the Festival Hall foyer, too.</p>

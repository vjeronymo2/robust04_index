			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's trade surplus posted  a fifth consecutive year-on-year monthly increase in April as  the politically sensitive surplus with the United States rose  for the second month in a row, the Finance Ministry said Friday  [20 May].    The increase came as informal U.S.-Japan trade talks resumed  in Washington, and a ministry official stressed "the unchanged  recent trend of declining exports and rising imports and  declining overall yen-based surplus."    The overall customs-cleared merchandise trade surplus rose  an  unadjusted 8.1 percent to 11.12 billion dollars as the surplus  with the U.S. rose 8.9 percent to 4.38 billion dollars, the  ministry said.    In yen terms, however, the overall figure fell 1.6 percent  to  mark the third straight decline with the surplus with the U.S.  dipping 0.9 percent after rising the previous month.    The official, briefing reporters, said the yen's rise is  contributing to boosting imports and curbing export volume but  has yet to be sufficiently passed along to prices due to the  so-called J-curve effects of swelling dollar-term figures.    The dollar averaged 104.43 yen in April, down 10.0 percent  from a year before.    April exports rose 7.1 percent from a year before to 32.89  billion dollars, and imports climbed 6.6 percent to 21.77  billion dollars -- both gaining for 14 months in a row.    In yen terms, exports fell 2.7 percent for the 13th straight  monthly decline, and imports dropped 3.2 percent for the 24th.    Referring to the index of trade growth, the official said  export volume decreased for three consecutive months, and  imports for 12 months.    Looking ahead, he expressed hopes for a dollar-based  shrinkage from summer as the dollar had fallen to the 105-yen  level in the period from June through August.    Many private economists agreed that the dollar-term surplus  would move lower.    Nobuyuki Saji, senior economist at the Nikko Research  Center,  said, "the trend for lower surpluses in terms of volume and the  yen is certainly fixed."    Some kind of an effect from the yen's rise last summer can  be  expected ahead, he said.    "But a sharp shrinkage is unlikely," Saji said, noting  strong  exports to recovering overseas markets, particularly of  electronics products to the U.S.    In April, major export gainers were semiconductor and other  electronics parts, up 31.8 percent, automobile parts, up 28.3  percent, and ships, up 62.4 percent.    For imports, semiconductor and other electronics parts rose  33.1 percent, clothing gained 19.3 percent and aircraft surged  140.0 percent.    The ministry official said that many special factors were  seen in April to judge the overall trend, citing increased  exports of huge tankers, higher imports of aircraft, and lower  crude oil prices.    With crude prices falling 21.2 percent to 14.57 dollars per  barrel, imports fell 20.4 percent in value while volume remained  almost unchanged.    Among other countries, Japan's trade surplus with the  European Union fell 11.6 percent to 2.32 billion dollars for the  fourth straight decline, and the gap with other Asian nations  rose 12.4 percent to 5.31 billion dollars for the 24th  consecutive increase.</p>

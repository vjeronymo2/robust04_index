			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Asian miracle that wasn't: America People who believe in a 'third way' - an economic philosophy that offers a surer path to equitable growth than either market capitalism or socialism - often find themselves looking east. Led by Japan a group of dynamic East Asian economies appears to have flouted the rules of market economics yet achieved unparalleled economic success. If these countries have found a new elixir of growth, the rest of the world needs the formula. If they have not, the world also needs to know because Asian success is increasingly seen as proof of the obsolescence of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Many people in formerly communist countries believe the 'East Asian model' offers a better prospect than orthodox free-market prescriptions. To assess these claims, the World Bank undertook a mammoth research project involving comparative studies of eight leading Asian economies over several decades. Economists of all ideological persuasions will find its report, published today, of considerable interest. The sceptics who argue that East Asia 'did things differently' will be gratified that the bank now concedes that most of the countries deviated substantially from free-market doctrines. At least three types of intervention were ubiquitous: industrial policies designed to promote particular sectors or companies; government controls on financial markets to lower the cost of capital and direct credit to favoured sectors; and policies to promote exports that included extensive protection of domestic industries. But do not leap to conclusions. As the bank argues, the principal reason for the region's success is its adherence to economic fundamentals. Macroeconomic policies have been consistently prudent: the hallmarks are low inflation, low or negative budget deficits and modest foreign debts. Workers have studied longer, worked harder and saved more than their counterparts elsewhere. And although the Asian 'stars' certainly deviated from market norms, they did so less on average than other developing countries. The price of factors of production such as capital and labour was kept much closer to market-clearing levels than in less buoyant regions such as Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa. Since the countries that intervened least grew most rapidly, it is hard to conclude that the interventions were hugely important. In any case, East Asian policies have evolved over the decades. The heavy-handed interventions occurred in Japan, Korea and, to a lesser extent, Singapore, from the 1950s to the 1970s when the world was a very different place. In those days, the rich western democracies also heavily regulated their financial markets and indulged in all kinds of domestic interventions. East Asia has tended to keep up with the times. The Asian stars that emerged during the 1980s - Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand - have followed more market-oriented policies than their predecessors. Meanwhile, countries like Korea have also seen the merits of more liberal policies. The bank concludes that Asian experiments with industrial policies were mostly a failure because unaided market forces would have brought about the desired changes in industrial structure. It concedes that directed credit and other forms of 'financial repression' did sometimes increase savings and investment. But it reserves praise for the area's 'export push' strategy which imposed a powerful competitive discipline on local companies and accelerated the transfer of technology from more advanced economies. This leaves would-be imitators of East Asia in a bind. If the bank is to be believed, industrial policies do not work. Financial repression may work but is much harder to implement in today's globally integrated capital markets than decades ago when Japanese and Korean bureaucrats parcelled out credit like children's presents. Crude attempts to promote exports are equally problematic because industrial countries (especially the US) are determined to create a level global playing field in trade. Developing countries can and should lift artificial barriers to exports but they cannot any longer combine export promotion with overt protection of home markets. Should we shed tears because many of the apparent deviations from market principles pioneered by Japan and Korea no longer seem credible? The answer is no, for a reason not brought out sufficiently clearly in the bank's report. These countries never had a long-term alternative to western market capitalism. It is true that they glorified their producers and suppressed their consumers. But they only became efficient producers because they sought instead to serve the interests of a richer, more numerous and sophisticated group of consumers: the citizens of western democracies who bought their exports. Had western consumers (especially Americans) not existed, the East Asian miracle simply could not have occurred. Without the guiding star of western consumer preferences their leading companies would have had no more idea of what to produce, or how, than former Soviet or east European state enterprises. As they mature the Asian high-fliers will be forced to treat their own consumers with more respect, in the process completing the transition to western market capitalism. There is no third way.</p>

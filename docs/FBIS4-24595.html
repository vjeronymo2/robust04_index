			<p>BFN     [Text] Melbourne, June 1 (XINHUA) -- China Trade and  Investment Forum '94, the largest ever held in Australia, opened  in Melbourne, the second largest city in Australia, today.    The Chinese delegation, consisting of more than 100  businessmen from China's 20 provinces and cities, was led by Gu  Yongjiang, vice-minister of China's Ministry for Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation.    The Chinese businessmen have brought with them over 500  projects, valued at 7 billion U.S. dollars.    The projects cover the fields of communications, energy,  Perth- chemical industry, electronic industry, textile industry,  building materials, agriculture, and service industry.    The aim of the forum is to brief the Australian counterpart  on China's investment environment, its investment policy and  laws with a view to increasing their understanding of China and  furthering the development of bilateral economic and trade links.    The two-way trade between the two countries stood at 3  billion U.S. dollars last year, representing an increase of 29  percent over the previous year, according to China's official  figures.    The forum will last for two days in Melbourne and will then  be moved to Australia's largest city of Sydney next week.</p>

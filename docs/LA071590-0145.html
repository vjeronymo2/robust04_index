			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIVING SOS A CHANCE TO OPEN ITS DOORS  </P> <P> Costa Mesa's response to Share Our Selves' relocation is pathetically  small-minded and unfair.  </P> <P> Rather than hire a private investigator and set up a hot line to uncover  possible grievances, why don't the neighbors volunteer their time at the center  and get to know the people it serves?  </P> <P> Then, perhaps, they might understand the difficult circumstances under which  others live and appreciate them for who they are: men, women and children who  are trying to make ends meet in an expensive county that is unequivocally the  most tightfisted in terms of charitable contributions and compassion.  </P> <P> Instead of assuming the worst, why don't the neighbors and business owners work  with SOS in developing a productive relationship that resolves conflicts before  they arise and meets everyone's needs in the process?  </P> <P> This seems to be a much more humane and cost-effective solution than the  adversarial one proposed before SOS even opens its doors.  </P> <P> SUSAN PERLSON  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Government backs Welsh food drive THE UK government is putting its weight behind a drive to get food produced in Wales accepted more widely. Wales has always been an important producer of milk and lamb and the intention is to build on this base to enlarge the food industry. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said in Cardiff yesterday that there was no reason why products closely identified with particular countries, such as New Zealand butter, French cheese, Dutch potatoes, Scottish salmon, Greek yoghurt and Swiss chocolate, could not all be produced in Wales. He has doubled the funding for the Welsh Food Promotions to Pounds 1.2m this year and given his support to a drive by the Welsh Development Agency, the Development Board for Rural Wales and the Wales Tourist Board to get Welsh produce better known and acceptable in a wider market. Welsh Food Promotions 'is moving vigorously with its key objectives to develop, co-ordinate and market Welsh foods,' Mr Hunt said. 'Wales produces food of all types and of the highest quality. The message of quality is all important in winning acceptance for Welsh-produced food.' The greatest success has been achieved by the cheese producers, who are winning national acceptance for their products, especially the soft, French-type cheeses. They have also had considerable success with 'Italian' mozarella. Much of the mozarella sold in Britain now comes from south west Wales. Welsh lamb is also gaining more acceptance outside the principality. The marketing drive will use the traditional Welsh dragon on a red and green background to identify Welsh products. 'Welsh Food Promotions now has the resources and commitment to develop the industry and become a recognisable force,' Mr Hunt said.</p>

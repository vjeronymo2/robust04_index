			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Japan's economy contracts in second quarter as demand falls JAPAN'S economy contracted in the second quarter this year, with gross national product shrinking by 2 per cent on an annualised basis and by 0.5 per cent from the previous quarter. The decline in GNP, which if repeated in the quarter that ends this month would mean the country was officially in recession, will put pressure on the month-old coalition government to increase its plans for a further pump-priming economic package, due to be announced tomorrow. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday he saw no evidence of imminent recovery. However, he expected further benefits of previous economic stimulus packages to emerge. The Economic Planning Agency, traditionally more optimistic than the central bank, said it still thought there would be recovery in the second half of the current tax year to March. Private sector analysts' forecasts for the full year range widely, from an economic decline to something below last year's 1.5 per cent growth, itself the lowest for 18 years. 'The trade surplus is going up and there is no growth in the short term. Now let's get some policy response,' said Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. The stimulatory measures due tomorrow will be the third such package in the past 16 months, during which the government has allotted nearly Y24,000bn (Pounds 146bn) of public spending. Growth reached 2.3 per cent in the first quarter, holding out the short-lived prospect of recovery. The previous two spending packages have begun to flow through, as seen in a 5.2 per cent rise in public investment over the previous quarter. Yet this was not enough to offset the continued slide in external demand - down 0.5 per cent, reflecting a fall in exports - and the decline in private consumption, down 0.6 per cent. Japan's trade surplus widened to Dollars 7.54bn last month, up 7.5 per cent from Dollars 7.02bn in the same month last year. Sluggish domestic demand and the impact of the rising yen on the dollar value of Japan's exports were the main factors. In yen terms, the surplus fell 11.3 per cent. Japan's surplus with the US, its main trading partner, rose from Dollars 3.13bn to Dollars 3.45bn. This adds to strains with Washington just weeks before Mr Morihiro Hosokawa meets US president Bill Clinton. A 3.3 per cent annualised rise in August in bankruptcies with liabilities of more than Y10m was also reported by private credit agency, Teikoku Data Bank.

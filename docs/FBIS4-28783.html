			<p>BFN     [Text] Justice Minister Sawai Phatthano has informed  PRACHACHAT THURAKIT of the progress of the draft bill on the  establishment of an intellectual property and international  trade court. He said his ministry forwarded the bill to the  secretary general to the prime minister two weeks ago. He  believes the bill will be considered by the cabinet soon.    Sawai said his ministry had already reviewed the bill two or  three times. He believes the bill is now in the office of  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, who will make the  final scrutiny before placing it on the agenda of a cabinet  meeting.    Sawai said: "The establishment of the intellectual property  and international trade court is just as important as the  administrative court because it concerns national interest. It  is also the prime minister's wish to bring it to Parliament  promptly. Regarding the charge that the establishment of the  court is the result of a U.S. threat of retaliation under  Article 301, the Justice Ministry has given an assurance that  the issues are unrelated. Thailand is a proud country; why must  it succumb to U.S. demands? The ministry is considering  national interests in setting up the intellectual property and  international trade court. The court's structure will follow  international lines. On this point, the United States may enjoy  some benefits and may be pleased by the action which Thailand  has taken."    The Cabinet decided in May 1993 to order an establishment of  the intellectual property and international trade court under  the Justice Ministry. A committee was formed to study the  court's structure. The committee then formed a subcommittee to  draft relevant laws. The subcommittee drafted a bill containing  43 articles and presented its opinions on the advantages and  weaknesses of an intellectual property and international law  court.    The advantages include the following: 1. The judges are  required to have a background in intellectual property and  international trade. The qualifications of associate judges are  also set. 2. The chief judge has the power to set regulations.  3. Appeals are filed directly with the Supreme Court. The  weaknesses are: 1. The accused will have only two courts to hear  their cases. 2. Sentencing will be done by the provincial  courts.</p>

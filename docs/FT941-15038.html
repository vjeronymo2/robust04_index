			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Sabah chief minister fined The political future of the East Malaysian state of Sabah has been thrown into confusion with the conviction of Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the state's chief minister, on corruption charges, writes Kieran Cooke in Singapore. After a trial lasting more than a year Mr Kitingan was found guilty of awarding contracts worth MDollars 1.48m (Pounds 360,000) to a company owned by relatives. Mr Kitingan is leader of the state's ruling Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), which, shortly before general elections in 1990, left Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister. Mr Kitingan was arrested soon after the elections and his supporters have accused leaders of the government in Kuala Lumpur of victimisation. High Court judge Mr Denis Ong said he was satisfied that Mr Kitingan had abused his official position as chief minister. However he received a fine so small as to allow him to lead his tribal-based party at elections next month. Mr Ong fined him MDollars 1,800, just MDollars 200 short of the amount that would have barred him from holding public office.</p>

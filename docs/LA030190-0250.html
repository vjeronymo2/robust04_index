			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MICHIGAN'S HOARD GOING FOR NFL  </P> <P> Michigan tailback Leroy Hoard, whose Rose Bowl heroics two years ago helped  make him a big name to Wolverine football fans, will forgo his final year of  college eligibility and enter the NFL draft.  </P> <P> "A lot of my decision had nothing to do with money.  </P> <P> I'd always wanted the chance to play in the NFL," Hoard said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Michigan Coach Gary Moeller said he disagreed with Hoard's decision. "However,  this is his option year, and he must make the decision. We wish him the very  best."  </P> <P> As a sophomore, Hoard was the most valuable player in the Rose Bowl as Michican  rolled over USC, 22-14. He rushed for 752 yards that season. Last season, he  rushed for 832 yards. He scored 19 touchdowns and averaged 5.4 yards per carry  during his career.  </P> <P> Hoard said he feared a knee injury similar to that suffered last November by  teammate Tony Boles, who may be unable to play football again unless he  switches from running back to another position.  </P></p>

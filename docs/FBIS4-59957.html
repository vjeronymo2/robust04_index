			<p>BFN     [Text] Top U.S. business executives have offered to make  big investments in India. The rich Indian-American community  has also indicated plans to provide their expertise and money  for giving a push to the market friendly reform process. At  their separate meetings with the prime minister, now on an  official tour of the United States, both American companies and  the NRIs [nonresident Indians] appreciated the economic  liberalization policy and said it has transformed India into a  prospective market for greater inflow of funds. Mr. Narasimha  Rao assured them that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board  will look into any irritants in materializing their projects.    Our correspondent Rama Rao covering the prime minister's  visit reports that the NRI plans include investments in highway  construction and communications, as also mobilization of at  least $2 billion every year. Mr. Narasimha Rao told the NRIs  that they can play their legitimate role in the  industrialization of the country and their investments have to  increase as they go along.    Addressing a large section of the Indian-American community  in New York, the prime minister said India means business and  the future course is clear. His current visit is to project the  giant leap the country is poised to take in industrial  development and to give a personal undertaking over the  irreversibility of the changed course. Mr. Rao asked the NRIs  to participate in the present efforts based on their sound  economic judgment. Commending the NRIs for the good work done  in the country where they are living, he said they should keep  it up. About Indo-U.S. ties, the prime minister said these need  to be strong and friendly, not only for mutual benefit but for  the future of mankind as a whole. The importance of his visit,  he said, goes beyond the scope of normal bilateral relations.    The prime minister has since arrived in Houston on the  second  leg of his American tour. Mr. Narasimha Rao is scheduled to  meet the chief executives and presidents of major companies  under the auspices of the Greater Houston Partnership. The  partnership brings together over 2,000 companies based in the  city. Later, the mayor of Houston will be presenting the keys  of the city to Mr. Narasimha Rao. He will also attend a  reception by the Indian community before leaving for Boston  tomorrow.</p>

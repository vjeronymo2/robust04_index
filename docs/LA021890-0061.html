			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO SORORITIES -- NO ALTERNATIVE  </P> <P> I'm a sorority member at UC Santa Barbara, and I think Middlebury College's  plan to force fraternities to become co-ed is off-target. I have seen the  benefits of a single-sex organization.  </P> <P> The pressure of the opposite sex, as we all know, can be distracting; thus I  feel that making fraternities co-ed would pose a threat to their goal of  brotherhood.  </P> <P> If they have to accept women, that is forced friendship. Sexism is a universal  problem -- it's not going to be changed by changing the structure of the Greek  system.  </P> <P> At UCSB, the Greek system has addressed the issue of discrimination head-on.  Each house has educational programs, and the system as a whole has committees  such as Greeks against rape. We also work closely with Status of Women, a  committee of our associated students.  </P> <P> In addition, sororities and fraternities have many avenues in which to work  together. And to top it off, fraternities are aware that sexist behavior will  lead to the revoking of their national charter. Thus, our system goes to show  that there are positive ways to address sexism without having to change the  traditional structure. I suggest Middlebury think twice before it makes the  mistake of forcing fraternities to go co-ed. It won't solve a thing; in fact,  it will probably make men resent women more.  </P> <P> LESLEY KEAGLE, Goleta  </P></p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Arts: No soap on 'The Bill' - Television The question came in April at a party to celebrate the 80th birthday of BA ('Freddie') Young, former arts editor of this newspaper, former theatre critic, and still our radio columnist: 'Why', asked this survivor of a thousand first nights, expert on Ibsen and Moliere, lover of Shakespeare and Chekhov, 'don't you ever write about The Bill?' The answer was that there seemed no more reason why the FT's television critic should devote space to a twice-weekly, half-hour, ratings-building ITV series than that our book critics should write about Barbara Cartland or the art critic review pictures of green-faced ladies from Boots. If The Bill why not EastEnders and Home And Away? Because, said the doyen of drama critics, The Bill was not a soap opera, it sustained a remarkably high standard of drama, and would repay regular attention; don't just watch a couple of episodes, try it for a month. He was, of course, right. Six weeks of The Bill has proved that this is not a soap opera: it is not concerned with family life nor even, to any great extent, with the emotional turmoil of its characters. The fictional Sun Hill police station, somewhere in central London, is at the centre of the series, which is concerned solely with the work of the men and women stationed there. Soap operas are particularly good at attracting female viewers, whereas current affairs programmes tend to be watched by more men than women. It would be no great surprise if The Bill attracted an audience which, for half-hour serial drama, contained an unusually large proportion of men. There is an authenticity about this programme which makes you more inclined, sometimes, to compare it to World In Action or This Week than to other drama series. Of course previous police dramas have aimed for authenticity. Z Cars came to the screen 30 years ago last January after writer Troy Kennedy Martin had spent his time in bed with mumps eavesdropping on police radio messages and been struck by the contrast between that reality and the cosiness of the hugely popular Dixon Of Dock Green. But while Z Cars was concerned to de-mythologise the police, and to bring to television a more honest picture of the criminal world, there was a tendency for the stories to dwell upon the social tensions in a policeman's life. Partly that is a sign of the times, but the effect was a distinct soapiness around the edges - domestic difficulties, or the effect of an illicit affair upon a policeman's conduct  -which you rarely if ever find in The Bill. That is not to imply, for anyone who has never seen it, that The Bill is some dry-as-dust police procedure series which ignores the human element. On the contrary, one of the chief interests is in seeing how characters that you grow to know react to new situations. In one of last week's episodes Detective Inspector Frank Burnside, Sun Hill's top plain-clothes man (I think) had to arrest and interview a prostitute dealing in drugs. With all the economy that the writers on this series always have to employ, since each 25-minute episode contains a whole story, it was made clear that Burnside had met Maria before. Asked by her to get out of the police car for a private word, Burnside does so and the Woman Detective Constable Viv Martella, left in the car, promptly assumes, with fury but also a lack of surprise which speaks volumes, that a deal is being done. That is precisely what is attempted by the attractive Maria who offers both money and sex. Burnside hints that he may be open to negotiation, but commits himself to nothing. In the interview room at Sun Hill there is a frisson between them which Burnside makes no attempt to suppress. It is clear that, even though he dislikes the way she has tempted girls into carrying drugs back from Spain, he has a high regard for her intelligence and may well be sexually attracted. They speak the same language, share much expertise, and inhabit the same milieu. In the end Burnside does no deals and Maria, presumably, has to face the music. That one little constituent of just one episode vividly illustrates the greatest strength and the greatest achievement of The Bill. This series does not often have the exciting action sequences of programmes such as The Sweeney, though when you do get a night time chase through wet city streets it is well filmed. It does not go in for the same complex interleaving of themes that we saw in Hill Street Blues, though there is always something other than the main plot going on. What it understands and conveys more clearly than any other police series is the fact that police and criminals share a world upon which the rest of us only occasionally impinge. Comprehensively and dramatically The Bill illustrates something that becomes clear to anyone who ever does any crime reporting: that there is a peculiar affinity between police and crooks. Willy nilly they inhabit the same subculture, use the same slang, share certain assumptions, experience, and expertise. Quite often police and criminals drink in the same pubs, eat in the same cafes, and find themselves thrown together much of the time. This is not to say that there is nothing to choose between them, nor that most policemen are a bit bent. It is to say that, as with sheep and sheepdogs, the two groups, however dramatic the differences between them, share the most important parts of their lives with each other and not with the rest of us. It is not a solemn series. In the last few weeks life has been lightened by boring Reg Hollis, Sun Hill's nerdish shop steward, or whatever they call it in the Police Federation, who is beaten 58 to 2 when someone finally challenges him for the post. One young officer goes on a course with the Area Burglary Squad and then bores everyone to tears with his new expertise. When a progressive boss tries to abolish us-and-them canteens not only does his deputy complain 'But I like remote elitism, I don't want to share a gunged-up sauce bowl with the likes of Laxton and Hollis', but the 'plods and plonks' declare that they don't want to be spied on in their own canteen, thank you very much. What makes The Bill so strong is the feeling that it is very nearly a documentary. To a lifetime resident of London the actors and actresses seem remarkably like actual members of 'The Met': their London accents sound like the real thing; they do not have that actorish - or actressy - glamour which even a series as good as Hill Street Blues failed to avoid (though female crooks in The Bill tend to be amazingly good looking and, as with Maria, more spotlessly chic than their real counterparts in London's streets and pubs). Above all, it is very rare in the plots of The Bill to find anything in black and white: everything comes in shades of grey. Remarkably, despite, or perhaps because of, all this grimy authenticity, it is a heartening series. Showing the alcoholism and shoplifting, the Fagin-like exploitation of the young, drug taking, racism, mugging, prostitution, even two murders of young runaways in the past week (though gratifyingly no shots of the corpses) you might think it must be depressing. Not so. What it shows is that the people who work at Sun Hill, convincingly lifelike precisely because they are so obviously imperfect, can deal with all the horrors of life in a modern metropolis and still retain their humanity. If they can do so that close to the coal face, surely the rest of us can manage too. Mr Young's eye for good drama is as accurate as ever.</p>

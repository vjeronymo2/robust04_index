			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / BIS appeal over exposure of banks to derivatives BANKING and accountancy regulators were yesterday urged to draw up common international standards on banks' disclosure of their exposure to derivatives and other complex financial products. Speaking on the first day of the International Monetary Conference, an annual gathering of bank chairmen and central bankers, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, said that banks' participation in derivative markets has 'reduced the transparency of (their) balance sheets.' He said effects on the banking system of any 'disturbances' had therefore become harder to predict. He was concerned about possible build-up of 'systemic problems'. The BIS, based in Basle, Switzerland, is owned by central banks and serves their needs. It has been the forum for the establishment of common international standards of banks' capital requirments. He urged accounting and bank supervisory authorities across the world to agree common standards for measuring the risk of banks' exposures to derivatives and common standards for disclosing these risks in their balance sheets. He also believes that worldwide statistics on banks' exposure to these products should be collected and published, modelled on the BIS's publication of cross-border bank lending. The two main themes of discussions on the first day of the IMC meeting were how to measure risk and how to reduce staff numbers without damaging a bank's culture and prospects.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA disagrees with the concern raised by this comment. Any party who combines blendstocks to produce conventional gasoline, or who combines blendstocks (other than oxygenate) with conventional gasoline, is considered to be a ``refiner'' under the anti-dumping regulations, and is required to meet all anti-dumping standards and requirements. Moreover, such a blender-refiner is required to meet anti-dumping standards only on the basis of the volume and properties of the blendstock used, and may not include in compliance calculations the volume and properties of any gasoline used in blending. Any blender-refiner must, therefore, offset any ``dirty'' blendstocks used with sufficient ``clean'' blendstocks to meet the anti-dumping standards on average. Most downstream blender-refiners will be subject to the anti-dumping statutory baseline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes these requirements on blender-refiners will limit the opportunities for refiners to produce and sell ``dirty'' blendstocks. In addition, because any ``dirty'' blendstocks must be offset with ``clean'' blendstocks the gasoline produced will cause no environmental degradation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not agree with the comment that all refiners could gain an advantage from shifting blendstocks regardless of their baseline. Only refiners with a baseline more-stringent-than-statutory could shift blendstocks to another refiner with the average baseline and thereby circumvent the anti-dumping requirements. For a refiner with a less-stringent-than-statutory baseline, the statutory baseline is more stringent. As a result, blendstock shifted by such a refiner to another refiner with the statutory baseline would have to meet standards as measured against a more stringent baseline. A refiner with a less-stringent-than-statutory baseline similarly would not be able to circumvent the baseline provisions merely by shifting blendstock to another refiner with an even less stringent individual refinery 1990 baseline, because the volume of gasoline that may be produced against the individual refinery 1990 baseline is limited to the second refiner's 1990 equivalent gasoline volume. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 83 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Compliance for any gasoline produced in excess of the 1990 equivalent gasoline volume is measured against the Clean Air Act statutory baseline. In consequence, if blendstocks are shifted by one refiner to another with a more lenient baseline, in effect the shifted blendstock must meet standards measured against the statutory baseline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 83 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 equivalent gasoline volume is a calculated volume that subtracts from the refiner's 1990 total gasoline volume the volume of reformulated gasoline produced by the refiner during the compliance period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result, EPA has not included in the final rule any provisions that would limit the volumes of blendstocks that are produced and sold, except for the provisions intended to address the baseline-shifting strategy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Inclusion of Oxygenate in Anti-Dumping Compliance Calculations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Oxygenates are included in the set of products that may be included in anti-dumping compliance calculations under certain conditions, because the oxygenate used in the production of conventional gasoline alters the results of the anti-dumping compliance calculations. As a result, where a refiner or importer is able to establish that oxygenate is in fact added to gasoline or blendstock produced or imported by that party, it is appropriate to allow the refiner or importer to include the oxygenate in compliance calculations. This approach to oxygenate use under anti-dumping is consistent with the proposals, but the final rule clarifies the manner in which parties must demonstrate that oxygenate is in fact used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the SNPRM 92 and SNPRM 93, EPA proposed that the inclusion of oxygenate volume in compliance calculations by refiners and importers would be optional, except as required in the calculation of other exhaust emission products under the applicable model. These proposals did not, however, specify the manner in which the oxygenate use showing must be made. EPA believes the provisions included in the final rule dealing with the oxygenate use showing during compliance periods is necessary in order to ensure conventional gasoline emissions are accurately reported. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed that any refiner or importer who elects to include oxygenate in its compliance calculations would be required to include oxygenates in its 1990 baseline as well. Under the final rule, however, refiners and importers are required to include oxygenate in anti-dumping baselines whether or not oxygenate is included in compliance calcuations. The baseline-setting process, including the treatment of oxygenate, is discussed in preamble section VIII. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

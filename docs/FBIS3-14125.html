This visit by his highness and the accompanying delegation  embodies the firm brotherly relations between the Syrian Arab  Republic and Bahrain. These relations are reinforced and  strengthened by fraternal ties, Arab affiliation, unity of  objectives, and common fate.    President Hafiz al-Asad and His Highness Shaykh 'Isa  Bin-Salman Al Khalifah held cordial talks that focused on  relations between the two fraternal countries and on  strengthening bilateral coordination and cooperation. Talks  also focused on the most important regional and international  issues of common interest. The views of both sides were  identical and in agreement on these issues.    To reiterate this approach, ministers of both sides held  several rounds of talks that focused on invigorating fields of  cooperation and exchange to serve the good and interests of the  fraternal peoples of both countries.    This visit acquires special importance since it takes place  in critical Arab circumstances that stress the importance and  inevitability of such Arab visits and meetings in order to  revive solidarity and coordination among the brothers, to  confront what the world faces in terms of regional and  international developments and changes, and to achieve common  objectives. These objectives relate to the full restoration of  occupied Arab territories, including occupied Syrian Golan and  Arab Jerusalem, in implementation of Security Council  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 in order to realize a just,  comprehensive, and durable peace in the region.    In this regard, the two sides condemned the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre and held the Israeli policy of settlements and  intransigence fully responsible.    At the conclusion of his visit and during the tours he and  the accompanying delegation conducted, His Highness Shaykh 'Isa  Bin-Salman Al Khalifah expressed his appreciation and admiration  of what he sensed and saw as far as manifestations of  development and awakening the Syrian Arab Republic has achieved  under President Hafiz al-Asad, the leader of its march.    His highness wished the people of the Syrian Arab Republic  progress and prosperity and wished President Hafiz al-Asad  continued good health.    Moreover, His Highness Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Khalifah Al Khalifah  extended an invitation to President Hafiz al-Asad of the Syrian  Arab Republic to officially visit Bahrain, which he thankfully  accepted. The date of this visit will be fixed in the near  future.    [Dated] Damascus, 22 March 1994</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kumar Anand: "Digvijay Singh is in the Spiral of </F> Trying to Escape Arjun Singh's Shadow"]    [Text] Chhindwara, 17 January--Madhya Pradesh Chief  Minister Digvijay Singh and Central Environment State Minister  Kamal Nath may not be as strong supporter of Central Human  Resources Development Minister Arjun Singh as they were in the  past, however, they are not in the mood for a direct  confrontation with him, either. Both have set up their official  lines. They hope that Arjun Singh will not dissect those. Arjun  Singh had told a legislator who is angry at the Digvijay Singh  cabinet that Digvijay Singh was not obeying him. Still, if he  has to choose between this legislator and the chief minister, he  will have to pick the chief minister. This legislator is the  same as that had helped Arjun Singh openly in his anti-Rao  campaign. Digvijay Singh is concerned with freeing his image  from Arjun Singh's shadow. However, this freedom cannot fit in  Arjun Singh's politics. Therefore, we can assume there are many  possibilities and concerns embedded in this separate stand.    On the other end, Madhav Rao Scindia's close associates  maintain that all this a staged drama and deep down in his heart  Digvijay Singh is still with Arjun Singh. Not only the  nominations of his cabinet members but also their appointments  to different departments were decided by Arjun Singh. They give  the example of Scindia-supporter Mahender Singh in support of  this argument. It is said that Digvijay Singh had promised him  the position of minister of industries, however, later gave him  the education portfolio. The industries department went to Arjun  Singh's brother-in-law Rajender Singh. The chief minister  reportedly told Mahender Singh that Arjun Singh wanted an able  minister in education department so that this department works  according to his wishes. The directors of the new equation in  the cabinet say that Rajender Singh has access to Arjun Singh.  They should have further asked why did Arjun Singh make such a  close relative a minister. Those who are legislators now can  become ministers. They have to keep in mind who supported whom  in the past. Both Digvijay Singh and Kamal Nath were also with  Arjun Singh. Digvijay Singh's appointment as chief minister had  affected Madhav Rao Scindia most. Digvijay Singh and Mr. Scindia  are from the same region--Gwalior-Chambal. Close associates of  Kamal Nath say that Mr. Scindia had told Kamal Nath that either  he should become the chief minister or endorse him (Scindia).  Later Kamal Nath was told that only Digvijay Singh would be  appointed as the chief minister. Mr. Scindia had the Punjab  government airplane waiting for him. However, the opportunity  for him to go to Bhopal never came. The supporters of this  mother-son due say that while they both--Vijyaraje Scindia and  Madhav Rao Scindia--may appear to oppose each other, they care  for each other's political interests. Mrs. Scindia, while she  was living in Gwalior, did not address even one public meeting  during the vidhan sabha elections. However, she visited Digvijay  Singh's constituency several times. Anyhow, Madhav Rao Scindia,  instead of becoming uneasy by this development, is considering  it an act of fate at this time.    The supporters of Arjun Singh's "theory about backward  groups" see Madhav Rao Scindia clearly covered under it. They  say that Mr. Scindia would be considered belonging to a backward  group according to Madhya Pradesh criteria. Arjun Singh had  floated Mr. Scindia's name before he used Subhas Yadav's name  for chief minister's position. Mr. Digvijay Singh himself does  not hesitate expressing his disagreement over this backward  theory' with Arjun Singh. In an answer to a JANSATTA  correspondent's question while returning from Chandamota to  Bhopal, he had said that a lot had been written about his  relationship with Arjun Singh. "Arjun Singh and I think alike.  We both have the same ideas about the problems in Madhya  Pradesh. We have worked in politics together for 16 years  because of the similarity of our ideas, and not because of our  personal relations. However, I do not agree with his comment  that only a member of scheduled castes, aborigines, backward  classes, and minorities can serve those groups. Mahatma Gandhi  did not belong to any of these groups, however, he served these  groups more than anyone else."    Mr. Digvijay Singh says that these groups need social  justice. It is important to win their trust to take strict  action if they are subjected to unfair treatment. He is also  keeping in mind why the legislators belonging to scheduled  castes, aborigines, and the backward groups elected him the  chief minister even though they all were consulted individually.  He was asked why had he mentioned Kamal Nath's name in the  context of his being elected chief minister, but had never  mentioned Arjun Singh's name. Digvijay Singh asked, "What is the  purpose of mentioning Arjun Singh's name in Chhindwara?" When  asked if it was true that Scindia was upset with the cabinet, he  replied, "He has been very cooperative." We asked him, "Before  becoming the chief minister, you had said that the prime  minister should apologize to the Muslims." Digvijay Singh's  reply after becoming the chief minister was, "That is in the  past. It is not necessary to repeat it now. The prime minister  has already expressed his regret." Digvijay Singh does  understand the difference between regret' and apology.'    Digvijay Singh explained his policy over the communalism  issue. "I have told the police and administrative officials not  to hire any person who has any connection with a communal group  or is involved in communal activities to any government  committee. The social positions of such persons is enhanced if  they are allowed to associate with high-level government  officials. Additionally, we ignore secular persons this way."  When asked if the government officers would not cause problems  by labeling a person of being communalist, he replied,  "Sometime, little rocks are also ground with the wheat. We just  cannot avoid it."    Madhya Pradesh' chief minister, Digvijay Singh, has already  established his priorities. He wants to hold elections of local  governments and panchayats before June. After that, he will  appoint a 90-member legislative commission. He says about it  that all orders will be issued through the cabinet members. At  present, he wants to expand or revise his cabinet appointments.  One of his priority is to supply kerosene oil in villages at  controlled rates. When he had asked the villagers in his  meetings about the price of kerosene oil, he was told they  bought it at 7 to 9 rupees per liter. He also said that patwaris  and gardawars [civil servants] will go to villages to process  land sale and transfer documents. The villagers have told him in  one of his meetings that they have to pay as much as 1,000  rupees in bribes for preparing transfer documents. He had called  Ashok Awasthi, then-tehsildar of Machagora, to the stage and  asked him to explain himself. He sent him back and told him to  straighten out the situation within three months or he will have  to straighten him out himself.    The chief minister said about these announcements that these  will not burden the state treasury; just have to make the system  more effective. He has announced opening a 30-bed hospital in  each development district and providing free electricity for an  engine of up to five horsepower to every farmer before 1  February. Both these promises are included in the Congress (I)  election brochure. Mr. Suresh Pichauri, the state Congress (I)  general secretary, replied to a JANSATTA question, "We had  discussed the financial aspects of this plan after meeting three  times before we included it in our state brochure." He made an  important announcement in Pandhurna about appointing public  commissions at district levels. He has made the announcement to  make a survey of unemployed educated young people and offer  either a job or unemployment benefits to those with family  income of less than 6,000 rupees.    The people have become more hopeful with these attractive  announcements. He understands also the political results if  these hopes are not fulfilled. Since he was appointed the chief  minister only five weeks ago, only the future will tell how  these promises are kept. The chief minister announced in  Machagiri, "Kamal Nath and I will make surprise visits to one or  the other village without telling the officials and take action  against those who are making problems." This shows his desire to  continue his association with Kamal Nath. His cabinet members  know the meanings of these announcements. When the chief  minister himself recognizes him as the king-maker, why should  the minister hesitate in praising them falsely and opening up  the government coffers for them? That was apparent during their  two-day trip. However, behind political friendships, there are  fears about political enmity also.</p>

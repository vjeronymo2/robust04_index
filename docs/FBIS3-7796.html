			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who is on a  two-day official visit to Albania, after the talks with his host  Albanian President Sali Berisha expressed support for the NATO  air force action today against the Serb planes, which had been  violating the UN resolution on the no-fly zone over  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He described it is a sign of resoluteness by the  international community to oppose Serb aggression and Russian  interference in the Balkans. We completely agree with  international factors, the United States, the EU, and NATO  showing greater resolve in suppressing aggression. We interpret  this as a signal that the international community will continue  to take resolute steps to end the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and create preconditions for peace, the Croatian president said.    In reply to Albanian journalists' questions, the Croatian  president said NATO's latest move also demonstrated the  resoluteness of the world's greatest super-power, the United  States, to oppose Russian interference in the Balkans. As I  have already said, I see this as a display of the resolve of the  main European countries and the biggest world super-power, the  United States, to oppose the Serb aggression, and, I would also  say, Russian interference in the Balkans, Tudjman replied.</p>

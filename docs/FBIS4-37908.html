			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, June 25 (AFP) -- Thirty-three lawyers have  gone on a hunger strike in solidarity with one of their senior  colleagues, who is demanding publication of a report into the  death of a lawyer in police custody, one of the strikers said  Saturday [25 June].    'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, head of the Bar Association, began  his hunger strike to demand publication of the document a week  ago. He has been in hospital since Monday [20 June] after his  condition deteriorated.    Hunger striker Halah 'Abd-al-'Aziz told AFP: "Eighteen  lawyers, including three women, have been on hunger strike since  Wednesday [22 June] or Thursday [23 June], in the Bar  Association headquarters in Cairo, and 15 others joined the  movement Friday [24 June] at Ismailiya and Port Said," on the  Suez Canal. She said the lawyers, from diverse political  groups, will continue their hunger strike "until death, or until  the satisfaction of the demands" put by Muhammad.    Muhammad has called on the government to release an official  report into the death in April of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, an  Islamic lawyer. Madani died in police custody. Authorities say  an asthma attack was to blame, but the Bar Association charged  that he died under torture.    Muhammad is also demanding the release of 24 lawyers  arrested  in May during a rally to protest Madani's death.    Egyptian newspapers have reported that the Bar Association  head had recently discovered the contents of an official report  into Madani's death, which noted "injury marks on Madani's body."    "That casts doubt on the causes of death of the lawyer,  which  could have a criminal origin," 'Aziz said.    The 40,000-member Bar Association, controlled by the Muslim  Brotherhood, has come under fire recently from the Egyptian  authorities.</p>

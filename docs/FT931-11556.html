			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banque Indosuez in move to new HQ BANQUE INDOSUEZ, one of France's leading investment banks, is moving out of central Paris into the suburbs to a new corporate headquarters in the old BP Tower, the office block at the centre of a recent property scandal. The move comes as Indosuez, part of the Suez industrial group, is trying to raise capital and cut costs to offset the steep provisions it has been forced to make on the losses on its property and business loans portfolios. Late last year, Indosuez, which saw its net profits fall to FFr82m in the first half of 1992 from FFr517m in the same period a year earlier, raised FFr400m from the sale and leaseback of its prestige headquarters in the heart of the Paris banking district. It plans in 1996 to move all its operations, currently spread between five different buildings, into the BP Tower, now renamed the Paul Doumer Tower. The BP Tower has been clouded by controversy since the discovery of irregularities in its sale to Lucia, a French property company then headed by Mr Christian Pellerin. Indosuez last month participated in a recapitalisation of Lucia, in which Suez, its parent company, is a minority shareholder with other French financial institutions. The move for Indoseuz forms part of the trend for large companies to move out of central Paris. Societe Generale, another leading French bank, is leaving its Boulevard Haussman headquarters in 1995 to move to the La Defense business district. Ironically, the drift to the suburbs is intensifying the financial pressure on companies which have large property holdings in the French capital. The Paris property market is in a precarious state with average rentals down by 20 per cent in the past three years. The move out of the city centre is aggravating this problem by increasing the number of properties available for sale or rental.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Spanish cabinet agrees tough budget to curb public spending SPAIN'S Socialist administration is preparing to mount its most determined effort in 10 years in government to curb public spending after approving a draconian 1993 budget at the weekend. Caught in a fierce currency market attack on the peseta and waning popular support at home, and facing an election in, at most, 12 months, the cabinet has been forced to agree to demands by Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, that central government spending will increase only 3.7 per cent next year, a fall in real terms. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has never before sanctioned such tough spending plans and has probably been persuaded to do so by the need to demonstrate to foreign exchange markets that Spain is serious about tackling its runaway deficits - so far this year the government has spent just short of double its 1992 budget - and to keep credible Spain's insistence that it will be among the first countries to join a European Monetary Union. The draft budget slashes defence spending by 9 per cent and forecasts growth next year of about 1 per cent. Civil service pay is to increase by less than the forecast inflation rate of 4.7 per cent. Inflation this year, Mr Solchaga said in announcing the measures, would end at about 6.4 per cent. The minister's budget will test the unity of the Socialist party, whose polls show it is losing its parliamentary majority. Election campaigning has already begun, with both the Socialists and the leading regional parties in the Basque country and Catalonia - the government's most likely partners in any coalition - trying to distance themselves from one another. A Catalan demand in particular - that Madrid hand over to the regional government nearly 20 per cent of tax revenues collected in the state - is threatening to poison the political atmosphere further. In the meantime, the government is trying desperately to head off any possibility that France and Germany try to form a group of core EC countries to proceed with political and economic union without Spain. Mr Solchaga will ask fellow EC finance ministers meeting in Brussels today to stick together and to agree on ways to end turbulence in the currency markets. Spain has already devalued the peseta by 5 per cent in the past two weeks and is thought to be willing to participate in a further realignment of Exchange Rate Mechanism parities in order to avoid having to leave the ERM. Capital controls imposed by the Bank of Spain last week, to try to freeze speculation in the peseta, failed to lift the currency far off its ERM floor. An agreement in Brussels this week, said Mr Solchaga at the weekend, 'may or may not imply a realignment but we cannot go on like this and time is running out'.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JOHN BREUNER STORES TO BE SOLD  </P> <P> BAT Industries PLC said today it will sell its 18 John Breuner Co. furniture  stores to Prism Capital Corp., a merchant bank in New York, for $92.5 million  in cash.  </P> <P> The deal is to be completed in about two months through BATUS Inc., the U.S.  subsidiary of BAT, the conglomerate said.  </P> <P> Breuners, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., was bought by BAT in 1982.  </P> <P> The sale is one step in BAT's strategy of focusing on its tobacco and financial  services businesses to fight off a 13.4-billion, or $22-billion, hostile  takeover offer from Hoylake Investments Ltd., an investor group led by  Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.  </P> <P> Part of this restructuring includes the sale of all BAT's retail operations in  the United States.  </P> <P> The others to be sold include Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's, Ivey's and  Breuners' furniture rental business. The conglomerate said it hopes to have all  the sales completed by the middle of this year.  </P> <P> Prism also owns a controlling interest in Barker Bros. Co., a chain of 11  high-quality furniture stores in Southern California.  </P></p>

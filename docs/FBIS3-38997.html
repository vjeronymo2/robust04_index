			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Rolf Falter: "A Late Gesture"] </F>   [Text] Is the position taken yesterday by the bureau of the  PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] on King Albert's call for  national reconciliation, fifty years after World War II, a new  feature? Undoubtedly, even though its effect will be minimal.    The core of the amnesty issue concerns the question of  whether, in Belgium's name, injustice occurred when  collaboration was punished. And if yes, how should that  injustice be made up for? Luc Huyse's pathbreaking work three  years ago showed that in the first months repression was far  stronger than afterwards, far more severe on political compared  with economic collaboration, and partisan in its attempt to  remove Flemish nationalism as a political factor.    Anyone with doubts after this report should then read the  memoirs of Eyskens senior: He thought that it was normal for  any self-respecting state to punish collaboration severely, but  at the same time described the many occasions he had to  intervene to prevent excesses and help those condemned, even 20  years after the war.    In Flanders in the decades after the war, immediate amnesty  was presented as a means to compensate for these injustices;  this would entail the pardon of all those condemned. But in  recent decades this demand became excessively associated with  extreme right-wing groups in Flanders. At the same time every  French-speaking politician was all too eager to translate  amnesty as unacceptable moral forgiveness of collaboration.  Therefore first Hugo Schiltz, then Luc Huyse sought compromise  formulas: The famous "measures which can contribute to the  reconciliation of the citizens" mentioned in the governmental  agreement of the Martens VIII government (1988) and the King's  speeches of 21 July 1990 and 1 February 1994.    Fifty years after the war, the number of people and amount  of  suffering involved are no longer unduly large. A report by the  Flemish Council in 1985 talked about several thousand pensions  and 1,800 other cases. Such cases range from descendants who  are still required to pay back debts from 1944 to the Belgian  state through to civil servants who were refused medals.  Between 1980 and the end of 1990 the Belgian state gradually  allowed 96 people who were still making payments because of a  postwar condemnation to have their punishments reduced. Between  1975 and 1990, 71 people appealed on the grounds of the law of  30 June 1961, which allowed the restoration of civil rights.  Ten applications were actually rejected because those involved  had been condemned to more than 10 years in prison during the  repression.    It is a new feature that the PS's bureau, which in the past  received any change in this question with an unswerving no, is  now ready to "investigate" the social consequences of the  condemnations after the war. It shows in that in the south of  this country as well, people are beginning to realize that it is  necessary to remove the main difficulties presented by this  question, which always gave tens of thousands of people in  Flanders a good argument to hate Belgium. It must be hoped that  this new position will still give something to the last few  hundred victims of the injustice which took place in 1944 and  1945. But it is probably a little too late to restore the  political damage to this unsteady country.</p>

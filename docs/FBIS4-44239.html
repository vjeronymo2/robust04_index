			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 7 June Athens daily TA NEA published  the results of a poll conducted by the MRB firm between 14 and  24 May among a nationwide representative sampling of individuals  over 18 with regard to the embargo imposed by Greece on The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and other issues.    Respondents were asked the following questions:    "Taking into account the three conditions posed by Greece  [renouncing the name of `Macedonia' and the star of Veryina on  the flag and changing the Preamble of the FYROM Constitution],  do you believe that the embargo hurt or benefited our country?"    A majority of 51.5 percent answered that it benefited  Greece,  29.5 percent said it hurt the country, and 19 percent did not  answer. It should be noted that the largest percentage of  approval came from Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] voters  (69.5 percent), with 56.3 percent of Political Spring supporters  expressing a positive view. Among New Democracy [ND] voters, the  rate of approval was 34.5 percent, reaching 35.1 percent among  Communist Party [KKE] supporters and 39.7 percent among  Coalition of the Left for Progress followers.    "What are Greece's most important problems?"    Some 85.1 percent pointed to inflation, 84.4 percent  mentioned unemployment, 79.4 percent foreign policy, 77 percent  narcotics, 74.2 percent chose health and social security, and  69.8 percent opted for education. Again, 60 percent mentioned  economic development, 55.5 percent pointed to foreign  immigrants, 55.2 percent said criminality, 47.2 percent  mentioned pollution and the environment, 46.8 percent opted for  the functioning of public services, 46.2 percent chose the tax  system, 38.5 percent mentioned terrorism, and 27.5 percent opted  for transportation difficulties.    When asked to rate the stance of Greece's European Union  [EU]  partners regarding Greek foreign policy, 33.1 percent said it is  "completely wrong," and only 0.9 percent said that it is "quite  right," with the rest of the respondents falling inbetween. The  percentage of disapproval was greater among PASOK voters (40  percent) than in the ND electorate (23 percent).    "Did Greece's integration into the EU hurt or benefit the  country?"    Among PASOK supporters, 52.3 percent sait it benefited  Greece, 12.8 percent said it hurt it, 29.3 percent said it did  neither, and 5.6 percent did not answer. Among ND voters, 79.8  percent answered positively, 3.7 percent negatively, 11.7  percent said it made no difference, and 4.8 percent did not  answer.</p>

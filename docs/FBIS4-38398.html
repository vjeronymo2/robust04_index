			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Captain 1st Rank Pasyakin report in the "News from the </F> Regions" column: "Hryvna Advancing; Coupon in Rapid Retreat"]    [Text] Sevastopol -- Following the deterioration in the  situation in Crimea, a meeting took place in Sevastopol of  representatives of various parties and movements which created  the National Front "Sevastopol-Fleet-Russia." Crimean Supreme  Soviet deputy Aleksandr Kruglov has been elected its chairman.    Political instability is leading to economic instability.  The U.S. dollar, the West German mark, and the Russian ruble  have surged in value. Dollar bills are being bought at the rate  of $1 per 50,000 karbovanets. Large-denomination Russian bank  notes (they are especially valued) go at 1:25. The people,  repeatedly cheated by the state and "fed" by rumors about the  introduction of the Ukrainian hryvna, are actively dumping  coupons and sweeping everything off the shelves.</p>

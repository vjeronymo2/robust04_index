			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (3): Emerging technologies  -The Alternatives National Power, along with other generators of power from coal-fired stations, has had two broad technology options when deciding how to respond to the increasing pressure to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions. The first is to use one of at least four methods to retrofit flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to an existing coal-fired plant. These methods essentially aim to improve the traditional pulverised coal firing process through various emission controls after combustion. The second is to start afresh with a new power station and a new method of combustion. Typically, that would mean switching to combined cycle gas turbine power generation, a significantly cleaner method than traditional coal-fired generation. The extreme, no-emission, option is nuclear power. In between are emerging technologies which use coal. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), for example, involves turning coal into a gas which is then used to fire gas turbines. Relatively new types of boilers using fluidised bed combustion, which has a number of variants, involve burning powdered coal in a bed of pulverised limestone. In the years up to the placing of the Drax contracts in 1988, the former Central Electricity Generating Board weighed the various options for cleaning up the station. Given the size of Drax - six 660MW units - it is perhaps hardly surprising that the options it considered were the FGD routes. This was the prevailing philosophy in the early- to mid-1980s. European and Japanese utilities were making use of the wide range of FGD choices available, says Mr Granville Camsey, a National Power executive director and managing director (group technology). All the choices, he says, involve GCE 'O-Level' chemistry. The decision on which technology to use will be based on cost-benefit grounds, and could be influenced by anything from the chemical content of the coal to the availability of seawater. The choice at Drax has emerged as comfortably the most popular of the four main FGD routes. This is the limestone-gypsum process, used on about half of the 180 gigawatts of power plant fitted with FGD equipment worldwide. The process uses the alkaline calcium carbonate in naturally occurring limestone to capture the sulphur dioxide by contact with the flue gas in a wet scrubbing vessel. The byproduct, apart from water, is gypsum (calcium sulphate), the raw material for plasterboard and other products used in the construction industry. This consequently gives the process a commercial aspect that is often lacking in environmental clean-up technology. The second most popular FGD route is the regenerative process, which also involves wet scrubbing and has a commercial spin-off. This uses a sodium-based alkaline scrubbing liquor to capture the SO. The spent liquor can be treated so that it can be used again, and the separate stream of SO-rich gas can be sold or turned into sulphur or sulphuric acid, for use by the chemical industry. The two other main FGD processes are seawater washing, which uses the natural alkalinity of seawater to remove the SO from the flue gas in a wet scrubbing vessel. Air and fresh seawater are added to the scrubbing liquor to neutralise pH levels before it is returned to the sea. There are snags, however. There are no commercial byproducts; huge amounts of seawater are required; and the flue gas has to be reheated for the process to work, which is costly, leaving large quantities of warm seawater to be returned whence it came. In the fourth process, spray drying, powdered lime is injected into a dry scrubbing vessel and the SO is removed by contact with humidified flue gas. A solid by-product, a mixture of calcium sulphite-sulphate-carbonate and flyash, can be partly re-used in the process but has no commercial use. Spray-drying is not really an option for a large baseload plant such as Drax because it it only captures about 50 per cent of the flue gas, compared with as much as 90 per cent for the limestone-gypsum process, says Mr Camsey. It would be more suitable for a power station used only for peak loads. As it happens, there is a similar reason for preferring the limestone-gypsum process than taking an entirely different tack, which is to use low-sulphur coals instead of FGD. These coals, available on the international market, typically have a sulphur content of about 0.8 per cent, about half that of UK coals, so their use would only halve SO emissions. Low-sulphur coals can be used with FGD, although that would reduce the amount of gypsum by-product. Since the old CEGB decided on its FGD route for Drax, priorities have changed for utilities such as National Power, all of which have a responsibility to reduce emissions. The question now is less likely to be 'Which FGD route should we use?' than 'Is it commercially more viable to use FGD or start afresh?' The 'dash for gas' - in the UK and elsewhere - is evidence of how this question is being answered. Widespread acceptance of gas as a fuel for power generation is relatively recent, but its use in combined cycle power generation produces electricity more efficiently and more cleanly than large-scale coal-burning. As for clean coal technologies, the focus has switched from FGD with its high installation costs to processes which are promising for greenfield sites but cannot economically be retrofitted. The big power equipment suppliers are spending heavily on two main methods of fluidised bed combustion: pressurised FBC and circulating FBC. The latter has so far won greater commercial acceptance but PFBC is coming up from behind with strong backing from Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish group. Mr Camsey's preferred clean coal choice, however, is IGCC. National Power is participating in a European Union-backed project to build a 350MW IGCC plant in Spain, due to be commissioned in 1997. Another IGCC demonstration plant, designed by Shell and located at Buggenum in the Netherlands, is now being commissioned. Unlike the modern boiler technologies, which are dependent on coal, IGCC could offer flexibility of fuel use between coal and gas, says Mr Camsey. As the costs of IGCC equipment come down and if gas prices rise relative to coal, it could be retrofitted onto a combined cycle plant.</p>

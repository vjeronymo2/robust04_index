			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of national unity is facing its first  major test in trying to get the intricate system of national,  provincial, and local government, agreed to by multiparty  negotiators, off the ground.    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said at a  news conference in Pretoria that no powers had yet been assigned  to provinces. This had been underlined by President Nelson  Mandela's issuing a Government Gazette that temporarily assigned  all government functions to central government ministries.    Another obstacle was that elections for local governments  would take place only in a year's time.    Mr. Meyer said that the process of assigning powers to the  provinces would take place within a matter of days and that he  would meet provincial executive committee members on Monday. He  would meet provincial premiers on Thursday. However, he said  the question of financial transfers to provincial government  still had to be ironed out.</p>

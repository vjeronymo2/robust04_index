			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pipeline project to push Algeria up European gas league - Work on a 1,845km supply link to the Iberian peninsular has begun on time The building of the Maghreb Europe Pipeline (GME) has started on time. In spite of the violence that affects much of Algeria and the uncertainty surrounding the country's political future, work has started on the three main sections of the GME, which by mid-1996 will deliver Algerian gas to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The 1,845km pipeline is being built in three main sections. The 530km Algeria section is being laid by Bechtel, a US company. The delivery of several hundred kilometres of pipes and pipe-laying activity are due to start later this autumn. The 540km Moroccan section, which is being laid by EMPL, a subsidiary of the leading Spanish gas utility, Enagas, has had over half its materials delivered and construction is to commence before Christmas. Italy's Saipem has begun work on the submarine section and is due to complete the work by the middle of next year. Saipem was responsible for laying, between 1980 and 1983, the TransMed pipeline, which runs between Tunisia and Italy, the deepest submarine pipeline in the world. The overall cost of the project is estimated at Dollars 2.8bn and it is backed by major western export credit organisations such as the US Eximbank, Germany's Hermes, France's Coface and the European Investment Bank. When completed in mid-1996, the GME will add some 7.2bn cubic metres to the annual pipeline export capacity of Sonatrach, Algeria's state oil and gas company, taking it to 31.2bcm. This will be quickly expanded. Annual sales of 8.5bcm will be made to Spain and Portugal. Morocco is also a customer and will take its gas as a transit fee, as Tunisia has been doing for the past 11 years with gas passing through the TransMed pipeline. Algeria has already contracted to sell a total of 32.5bcm of gas annually, by the year 2000, to customers through the TransMed and GME lines. Sonatrach's current liquefied natural gas commitments are for 25.1bcm. For the first time in Algeria's history, sales of piped exports are set to overtake exports of LNG. Ironically, the build up of the Spanish market to take the projected pipeline volume will probably require use of Algeria's refurbished LNG plants, but only for a short period. Algeria's LNG export capacity will reach a peak of about 30bcm just as the GME takes away the bulk of its Spanish market. By the time the GME volumes to Spain reach their contractual plateau in the year 2000, Algeria will face its first LNG competition in the Spanish market as Enagas begins to take delivery of Nigerian supplies in 1999. The steady expansion expected in the Spanish market will continue to require the same level of Algerian LNG exports but Algeria will have to look elsewhere for extra sales. Sonatrach has, to date, restricted itself to 60bcm of exports. This means that any increase above this level, using the capacity that will clearly be there, must come from gas discoveries by Sonatrach's new international oil company partners. British Petroleum is close to an agreement to develop large reserves in the hitherto unexploited south-west of the country. If finalised, the Dollars 2.5bn project to develop fields around In Salah will involve BP constructing over 500km of pipeline and marketing the gas in Europe in partnership with Sonatrach. Other companies, notably Agip of Italy, are confident that they will quickly follow once the pattern is set by the first deal. But the 'GME's biggest achievement', according to Mr James Ball, director of the Gas Matters consultancy, is '. . . not so much the co-operation it has brought about between countries on the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, but the co-operation it has brought between Spain and Portugal'. Indeed as recently as 1989, Portugal considered gas transit across Spain politically unacceptable. But by 2000 Portugal will be importing 2.5bcm of piped gas through the GME, a little over one-quarter of the total throughput. Spanish demand, meanwhile, is projected to rise to 12bcm a year by the turn of the century, a 71 per cent increase from the present consumption level, the largest demand coming from power generation and industrial co-generation. Despite this massive increase in Spanish offtake of Algerian gas, Italy will remain by far Sonatrach's most important customer. Italy's power generator, Enel, is scheduled to begin taking delivery of its 4bcm annual contract in 1996, augmenting the 19.5bcm the gas utility SNAM already takes through the TransMed pipeline. In addition, SNAM recently concluded a long-term purchase agreement for 1.8bcm of Algerian LNG, its first ever such contract from Algeria, which will be delivered to the recently refurbished Panagaglia terminal at La Spezia. In August, Sonatrach delivered the first cargo of Algerian gas to the world's newest LNG customer nation, Turkey. Algeria has become the dominant supplier of gas to those countries in southern Europe where its use is growing fastest. Today, Algeria's share of the European gas market ranks third, with 19 per cent of the total, after the CIS with 36 per cent and the Netherlands with 26 per cent. As Dutch production declines from the turn of the century, Algeria could well become Europe's second largest outside supplier of gas.</p>

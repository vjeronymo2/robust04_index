			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: As You Like It - Ludlow Festival As always, the heart of the Ludlow Festival is the open-air Shakespeare in the ruins of the Castle. This year, Alan Cohen's direction gives As You Like It a notably contemporary look. Designer Claire Lyth, with Adrian Gwillym, has provided costumes of our own day, with a touch of the military in the Duke's Court. Orlando's odes and elegies, duly spiked all over the plenteous greenery, are written on A4 sheets. Orlando himself (John Gordon-Sinclair) is a pleasant young man, faintly Scottish, whom you might see any day in a high-class soap. It feels as if the audience has spilt on to the stage and carries on there as it does elsewhere in town. Maybe Shropshire's country copulatives would end up with fewer marriages, but they might be as well satisfied with Hymen in charge as the local Sir Oliver Martext. The emotions are, deliberately, I would say, not explored deeply. The talk between Celia and Rosalind prior to their leaving for Arden is kept mainly to their usual jokey attitudes. Victoria Wicks, an enchanting Rosalind, need only put a cap on to turn herself into a boy, for (since the days when she could only be a boy) no one, not even Orlando, has seriously had to believe that she is one. Celia (Wendy Morgan) should have told Touchstone not to bring his golf-clubs with him, but Sylvester McCoy makes him whole-heartedly comic - most unlikely to give a speech about quarrelling by the book, so he didn't. Bald, reserved Jaques (Ken Drury) would never learn real clowning from him, and chose better to join the converted Duke, who at least was never trivial. Alex Hardy's Duke is in fact very positive; he might almost have been commanding UN troops in mid-Europe. His exiled brother (Robert Arnold) also likes to get things done, but more patiently. He was specially patient with Amiens, who sang Michael Gregory's awful settings of the well-known songs with appropriate lack of sympathy. Such small matters never lowered the general feeling of comic do-as-you-please for long, and Victoria Wicks's delivery of the epilogue aroused proper enthusiasm. There is more than Shakespeare in the Festival. There is a evening with Seamus Heaney, one with Simon Brett, one with Brian D. Barnes (as Pepys). There are organ, piano and violin recitals, concerts. Bach's Mass in B minor will be sung in the parish church, and so will Madam Butterfly. There are fringe theatre and jazz. There is, above all, the lovely little town on the Teme, in the heart of the Housman country. The Festival runs from June 27 to July 12, sponsored by national and local businesses and individuals.

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Bradford businesses report first-quarter deterioration THE FIRST of this year's chamber of commerce quarterly surveys shows a worsening of the recession in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Orders and deliveries have fallen in both domestic and export markets in the first quarter. Balance figures - the difference between the percentage of companies reporting rises and those reporting declines - showed sharp changes of trend. The balance for home deliveries fell to 5 percentage points from 13 points in the last quarter of last year, while the balance for home orders went into reverse - minus 2 points, compared with plus 9 points. Export deliveries were just positive at 1 percentage point, but this compared with 19 points in the last survey. Export orders were affected even more, the balance falling to zero from 19. The survey covered 202 members of Bradford Chamber of Commerce, spread mainly in textiles, engineering, chemicals, printing, packaging, construction and freight forwarding. They employ more 16,000 people between them. Although 59 per cent managed to keep all their workforce employed, 20 per cent shed labour and 21 per cent took more people on. Fourteen per cent plan to shed staff in the second quarter and only 10 per cent to recruit. However, 41 per cent tried to recruit, which suggests that about half could not find the right people. The biggest shortage was in professional and managerial staff, where 43 per cent of prospective recruiters had problems, followed by skilled manual workers, where 28 per cent were affected. There was little difficulty in filling clerical, unskilled and part-time jobs. A national drive to widen the membership of Britain's chambers of commerce is being launched today in a direct mail campaign aimed at 80,000 businesses. About 90,000 businesses are already affiliated members of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. The association hopes to increase that to 150,000 by 1994. The campaign is sponsored by National Westminster Bank. We Mean Business To You. British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3YY. Free.</p>

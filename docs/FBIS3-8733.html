			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miroljub Zaric] </F>   [Excerpts] Skopje, March 14 (TANJUG) -- Failure of the last  week's efforts by U.N. official Cyrus Vance to mediate in a  dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia (FYRM) [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] has confirmed that, for the time being, neither Athens  nor Skopje have any intentions of changing their stands. Greece  strongly opposes that FYRM, which seceded from the former  Yugoslav Federation in 1991, should be recognized under the name  of Macedonia, arguing that the name is related to the Greek  history and that it shows Skopje's territorial claims on the  Greek province of the same name. When some member-countries of  the European Union (E.U.), despite Greek resistance (Greece is  also a E.U. member) in late 1993 recognized FYRM and established  diplomatic relations with it, Athens imposed a trade embargo on  FYRM.    Regardless of the damage caused by the Greek blockade, which  adds to almost three billion dollars of FYRM's loss caused by  its abiding by U.N. anti-Yugoslav sanctions, FYRM's leadership  is not prepared to make concessions and compromises, primarily  because of the parliamentary and presidential elections  scheduled for November. Three of the four members of the ruling  coalition -- Macedonia's Social-Democrats, Liberals and  Socialists -- fear that their yielding in this dispute would  make the opposition call them "traitors of national interests."  The fourth coalition partner (the Party for Democratic  Prosperity) which rallies ethnic Albanians, fears that FYRM  might take a name which would point at the Slav features of the  nation living in it, thus undermining the party's assertion that  "the Albanians represent an autochthonous nation in the  territory."    Ethnic Albanian parties in FYRM urge the authorities in  Skopje to recognize the status of the Albanian national minority  in FYRM as that of a nation. They want to proclaim territorial  and political autonomy in western Macedonia, where the Albanian  population represents the majority. Political analysts in Skopje  assess that the Greek-Macedonian dialogue will yield no results  before the elections are completed and the new government  established in FYRM, meaning, according to their predictions,  that the current state of affairs would be frozen for at least  one year's time. [passage omitted]    Such moves, according to observers, aggravate the already  bad  Greek-Macedonian relations and justify the claims of the circles  in Athens that authorities in Skopje have "territorial claims on  Greece."</p>

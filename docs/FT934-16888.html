			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Hospital group to buy rival for Dollars 5.8bn COLUMBIA Healthcare, a fast-growing US hospital company, has agreed to buy HCA-Hospital Corporation of America in a Dollars 5.8bn all-share deal which creates the country's largest hospital group. The merger, agreed by both boards on Saturday, is the most significant sign so far of consolidation in the US healthcare industry prompted by the Clinton reform plans and by market pressures for lower medical costs. The new group, to be known as Columbia HCA Healthcare, will have 190 hospitals and 42,000 beds, mainly in the south and west of the US. It also has hospitals in London and Geneva. The deal marks the latest step in the rapid rise of Columbia and its chairman and chief executive, Mr Richard Scott. Starting the year as a 26-hospital company, Columbia has already completed one merger - with the Galen hospital group - taking the total to 90 hospitals. By merging their hospital operations, Columbia and HCA hope to be able to compete better for business from the regional 'health alliances', through which most healthcare will be bought under the Clinton plan. The two predict that the merger will lead to cost savings of Dollars 75m next year and Dollars 130m in 1995. Commenting on the quickening pace of mergers in the industry, Mr Scott said yesterday: 'In the US there are 30 per cent too many hospital beds. Clearly people cannot afford to pay for it, so we will have to consolidate.' None of the 190 hospitals in the new group would be closed, he said, though he added that the company would attempt to buy rivals in areas where there were too many hospital beds and close them down. He singled out Chicago, Miami, Houston and Kansas City as cities in need of a reduction in capacity. Columbia, whose shares closed at Dollars 30 1/4 on Friday, will exchange 1.05 shares for each of the 182m HCA shares outstanding - a significant premium over the HCA share price, which stood at Dollars 22 7/8 on Friday. Mr Scott said that based on market estimates for Columbia's earnings, the deal would not be dilutive, but would increase earnings per share by around 10 cents. He will be president and chief executive of the new group, with Mr Thomas Frist, chairman of HCA, as chairman.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Pop singer Jonathon (Chico) DeBarge has been sentenced to five years and eight  months in federal prison for conspiring to take 2.2 pounds of cocaine into  Michigan from California. Hoping to convince U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen  (in Michigan) of his good character, DeBarge, 22, sent Enslen press clippings,  including one about his anti-drug campaign at a junior high school less than a  month before his arrest. But the judge countered, "Who have you harmed by your  hypocrisy?" ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

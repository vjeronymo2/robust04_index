			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / 4,000 coal managers' jobs at risk UP TO two thirds of the 6,000 core management and clerical jobs at British Coal could go under proposals put forward by a consultancy. The number of regional headquarters may be cut from five to two or three, and their power reduced. The proposals, prepared by Resource Decision Systems and circulated to senior corporation management, suggest more integration between the deep mine and opencast operations. The report explores the possibilities for contracting out some operations to the private sector before privatisation. Information technology is thought to be a likely target. British Coal ordered the report after its announcement last October to close 31 of its 50 pits. Although 12 have since been reprieved, few are thought to have a long future. British Coal wants to cut about half of its 'above ground' administration costs. This suggests a more radical programme than that envisaged by Ernst &amp; Young, the consultancy which earlier this year prepared a similar report on instructions from the government during the energy review. This said that at least Pounds 74m could be cut from British Coal's Pounds 268m administrative expenditure. British Coal yesterday refused to comment in detail on the report beyond saying that it was not complete and was still subject to discussion. One topic under consideration is the degree to which management responsibility should be devolved from the national headquarters to the pits. The report suggests the role of the middle tier of management, the regional headquarters, could be redefined to give pit managers more authority and accountability. This may be more practical in an organisation of about 30 pits than it was in one with 950, as the National Coal Board was in 1948. John T Boyd, the US consultancy, said in a report for the government last year that colliery managers were not given enough freedom to manage. The report by RDS, part of the LEK partnership, suggests regional headquarters in Yorkshire and in Nottinghamshire.</p>

In addition to national defense, it will in the  future participate in the NATO reaction forces and in UN  missions.    "Not very big, but topnotch." This motto, which has been  taking quite a battering in the course of the cutbacks taking  place all over, could also serve as a campaign slogan of the  Royal Danish Air Force. Unlike other countries, however, it  appears that Denmark may also be able to turn this idea into  reality. Here, too, of course, there is a need to economize and  to reduce in size, but the objective of keeping the combat  effectiveness of the Kongelige Danske Flyvevabnet at a high  level is not being overlooked in the process. Organizational  belt-tightening and cutbacks in personnel, together with alert  unit reductions in surface-to-air missile units, are to help  keep the impact on the quality of the flying component as small  as possible.    Nevertheless, this component, too, must accept a  quantitative  decrease. Following the deactivation already in 1992 of the Saab  F-35 Draken-equipped 725th Squadron, the second of the two  Draken squadrons formerly stationed in Karup ceased its flying  operations at the end of 1993, thus making the Flyvevabnet a  purely F-16 Air Force. Until 31 December, the 729th Squadron  still had the dual role of reconnaissance and fighter-bomber  unit, which it carried out with a mix of F-35 fighter-bombers,  RF-35 reconnaissance aircraft, and TF-35 trainers. As of 1  January 1994, the reconnaissance role will go to the 726th  Squadron in Aalborg; a reconnaissance pod developed by Danish  industry will provide the F-16 with the necessary capabilities.    Aalborg is home to two F-16 squadrons. In addition to the  726th Squadron, the 723d Squadron is also stationed here in the  northern part of Jutland. The other two Fighting Falcon units of  the Flyvevabnet, the 727th Squadron and the 730th Squadron, fly  their missions out of Skrydstrup. All four squadrons utilize  their F-16A both as fighters and as fighter-bombers, and  additionally assigned to each squadron are a number of F-16B as  combat trainers. Officially, an F-16 training unit as such does  not exist: In Skrydstrup, however, there is a training component  for the retraining of new F-16 pilots, in which flight  instructors from all the Fighting Falcon squadrons have been  drawn together.    Of the originally assigned 54 F-16A and 16 F-16B, 63 still  exist. Five single-seaters and two twin-seaters were lost during  accidents. Three used Fighting Falcons are to be newly procured  as replacements for the aircraft that were lost; the purchase of  seven more is being considered. To this end, Denmark is  currently negotiating with the Netherlands, Belgium, and the  United States. From 1994 on, all Danish F-16 aircraft will  undergo the multinational midlife-update program which is being  carried out by the original F-16-operating countries Norway,  Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States, since  the Fighting Falcon are, after all, to remain in service with  the Flyvevabnet for another 20 years or so.    Only of limited size is the transport and SAR  [search-and-rescue] component of the Flyvevabnet, which is based  in Vaerloese near Copenhagen. The 721st Squadron has three  Lockheed C-130H Hercules and three Grumman Gulfstream III  assigned for transport missions, as well as a number of Saab  T-17 Supporters as liaison aircraft; eight Sikorsky S-61A Sea  King helicopters fly search-and-rescue missions for the 722d  Squadron. Search-and-rescue field detachments are located at  Aalborg and Skrydstrup, each with one Sea King permanently  assigned. In addition, one S-61 is stationed at Roenne on the  island of Bornholm in the winter. The air transport fleet is  tailored to the special geographic situation of the territories  belonging to Denmark; aside from tactical air transport  operations, it also monitors fishing operations in the area of  Greenland.    The flying school of the Royal Danish Air Force, in which  classification training of future pilots is carried out with  T-17 aircraft, was reassigned on 1 February 1993 from Avnoe to  Karup. Following their screening at the flying school, students  qualified for jet aircraft go to Sheppard in Texas to undergo  the Euro-NATO joint jet pilot training program. For Denmark as  well as most of the other NATO countries of Europe,  participation in this program continues to be the most  economical and most effective means to train their jet pilots.  There are no female jet pilots in the Flyvevabnet as yet; there  are, however, female helicopter pilots for the Westland Sea King.    Organizationally, the Danish Air Force consists of two main  components. Responsible for flight operations is the  Flyvertaktisk Command, known in NATO parlance as the Tactical  Air Command Denmark (TACDEN); responsible for support is the  Flyvemateriel Command. Since 1 September 1993, the tactical  component has undergone a belt-tightening process and has been  patterned after this structure: TACDEN now likewise consists of  an operational and a logistic component. Aside from the  operational bases at Aalborg, Karup, Skrydstrup, and Vaerloese,  the two airfields at Tirstrup and Vandel that are earmarked for  use by allied reinforcement units--the latter occupied in  peacetime by Army aviation units--and the flying squadrons,  eight surface-to-air missile batteries equipped with the  improved Hawk, all units responsible for airspace surveillance,  as well as the schools of the Flyvevabnet, are also subordinate  to the TACDEN.    In the operational area, the reduction of the Danish Air  Force from the original 9,500 to the current 8,000 was achieved  primarily through the deactivation of the two Draken squadrons  and reductions in the number of active surface-to-air missile  personnel. As a result, the Air Force depends more than ever  today on mobilization. The 8,000 personnel on active duty are  joined by 11,000 reservists plus 10,000 members of the Danish  home defense force and the airspace observer corps, thus giving  the Flyvevabnet a total of 29,000 members in a national  emergency. The reorganization of the NATO structure also brought  about a change in the organizational assignment of Denmark and  its armed forces: Since 1 October 1993, the Flyvevabnet has been  subordinate to the allied Central Europe command sector.    The mission of the Air Force was not changed in the process,  it was simply expanded through its participation in the crisis  reaction forces of the alliance. In peacetime, the surveillance  of Danish airspace is assured by two F-16 aircraft which,  alternating between Aalborg and Skrydstrup, are kept for a week  at a time on five-minute alert status around the clock for  air-policing missions. In addition, two reconnaissance aircraft  are kept on four-hour alert to photograph foreign vessels  spotted off the coasts of Denmark. These alerts were not changed  in any way following the end of the East-West conflict.</p>

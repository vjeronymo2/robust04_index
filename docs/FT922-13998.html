			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Bayernverein loan for Skoda BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank said it had issued a loan worth Kcs1bn (Dollars 34m) to Skoda Automobilova, Reuter reports from Munich. The bank said it was the first German bank to issue such a loan denominated in koruna. The loan had been issued through its Prague branch. Bayernverein said the branch concentrated on institutional customers but was planning to extend its activities to mortgage business once the legal framework for this was in place. RIETER Holding, the Swiss machinery manufacturer, said an upturn in demand for spinning machines and cost cutting measures already under way would considerably improve its 1992 operating result, Reuter reports from Zurich. 'The slight pick up in demand for spinning machines since September leads to the conclusion the turning-point has been reached in this market,' the company said in a statement on its 1991 results. Rieter said earlier 1991 group net profit fell to SFr4.9m (Dollars 3.24m) from SFr34.9m in 1990, and cut its dividend. Sales fell to SFr1.51bn from SFr1.65bn. KONINKLIJKE Pakhoed said it was unlikely its main business of oil storage would this year maintain the strong results achieved in 1991, Reuter reports from Rotterdam. 'For Paktank (the storage unit) it will be difficult in the coming year to match the good results of oil storage in 1991,' the company said in a statement accompanying its 1991 results. Tank storage, of both oil and chemicals, made 4 per cent higher operating profits of Fl 160.8m (Dollars 86.4m) in 1991, while group total operating profits fell 1 per cent to Fl 196m. Group net profits were down 6 per cent to Fl 125.2m. GEBRUEDER Maerz, the German brewer, said acquisitions will boost earnings and sales this year, allowing the group to expand within Europe, Reuter reports from Munich. Maerz made a net profit of DM35m (Dollars 21.2m) on sales of DM1.94bn in 1990/1991, after net profit of DM45.7m on sales of DM1.34bn a year earlier. Mr Andreas Maerz, chairman, said group sales could rise to DM2.4bn in the year ending September 30 1992. Earnings would also rise. He gave no details on net results, but said earnings per share would rise to DM14.50 from DM10.35 last year.</p>

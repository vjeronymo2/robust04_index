			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (10): Very dirty laundry EVIL MONEY: ENCOUNTERS ALONG THE MONEY TRAIL by Rachel Ehrenfeld Harper Collins, Dollars 22, 298 pages THERE IS an old saying among investigative journalists who are trying to undercover a political or corporate intrigue: 'follow the money'. The saying has become something of a cliche, but it remains as true as ever. In the presently unfolding Iraqgate scandal - where officials of the US and Britain appear to have broken their own export laws in an attempt to sweeten Saddam Hussein with arms and money - the need to understand and to follow the money trail is of primary importance. Two of the banks caught up in the Iraqgate affair are discussed in Evil Money, a new look at money laundering by Dr Rachel Ehrenfeld. Dr Ehrenfeld is a woman of many talents - investigator, academic, journalist and author. Her gifts were made apparent in an earlier book about narco-terrorism and the Medellin cartel. This new book is a smorgasbord of financial and political adventure. It includes new perspectives on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair as well as a fascinating inside look at the estimated one trillion US dollars of annual drug revenues that are laundered through the international banking systems. The book's great strength lies in its specificity. Dr Ehrenfeld takes us on a voyage from the legacy of Meyer Lansky's offshore banking connections in the Bahamas to the money laundering mechanisms utilised by the cocaine traffickers of South America, detailing a demi-monde of front companies, international bank wire transfers, bribe-taking politicians and crooked accountants and lawyers. Its only weakness is that it does not draw this vast subject together and make recommendations in a grand finale of a concluding chapter. But this can be excused: Evil Money remains must reading for anyone interested in the frightening interstices among drug traders, terrorists, bankers and government officials.</p>

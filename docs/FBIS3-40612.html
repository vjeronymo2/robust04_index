Under it he made  plans to have the 8th Amendment approved by the newly elected  assembly members, who were actually the political version of the  counselors. When the amendment reached the House, there was a  check for 500,000 rupees in the files given to the members for  developmental plans. In other words, the martial law regime had  used national resources mercilessly just to get some political  support. This practice did not stop here. It spread to allotment  of land plots, the issuing of loans and then writing them off,  and the distribution of land for the armed forces personnel.  This way the bureaucracy becomes more powerful in nondemocratic  governments and such governments depend on it. Their expenses  include unnecessary luxuries. Now the situation is so bad that  13 percent of the total budget is spent on administrative  expenses while less than 2.5 percent of the budget is allocated  for health and education.    After General Zia's death, his followers followed the same  method to strengthen their nondemocratic governments. The fact  that they could not save their governments and that our country  could not escape from their abuses is a separate issue. Now the  situation is that investors have 60 billion rupees in loans from  the banks and it will require a major operation to make them pay  those loans back. Anyhow, this system which the martial law  regime had started was strengthened by the governments that  followed it. The control of bureaucracy over the government  continued to increase in a royal manner and the assembly members  continued to receive funds for developmental plans in addition  to loans and land plots. Government's unproductive expenses also  continued to increase, inflation spiraled, currency notes were  printed, the people sank deeper in the quicksand of rising  prices, rulers become rich overnight, and the budget deficit  went up to 120 billion rupees. The country, thus, is facing a  serious crisis.    Keeping this situation in mind, Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto's government has issued instructions to reduce the budget  deficit and has made plans to reduce unnecessary expenses to  bring down the deficit of 120 billion rupees to 42 billion  rupees during the next two years. The prime minister has ordered  V.A. Jaffery, minister for finance and trade affairs, to issue a  report soon. According to the finance minister and the Planning  Commission, a huge amount was taken from the State Bank, and  unproductive expenses were increased during Nawaz Sharif's  government. This has increased the budget deficit. Many agencies  were given additional assistance which emptied the treasury. The  government has instructed all ministries and departments to live  within their budgets and not to request additional funds. At the  same time, plans are made to make tax administration more  effective and to get the loans back. During the former  administration, businessmen were given various forms of support  to get help from them. Finance Minister Jaffery will meet with  the business community to inform them of government's problems  and request their cooperation.    The PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government has always made  progress in starting developmental projects for the people and  providing stability to nation's economy. That is why whenever  the government was under the PPP, not only did the standard of  life improve, but the country's economy was also put on firm  ground, and inflation and the budget deficit were reduced. Madam  Bhutto's present steps are part of these efforts. However, the  recovery will not be easy in the present situation, especially  because of the innumerable problems in getting international  assistance, and the actions of the previous administration which  resulted in unproductive activities. The money received in aid  was left with some favorite people to spend at their discretion  instead of using it for the purpose it was given to us. This led  to looting of these funds, affecting Pakistan's prestige at the  international level, and the aid was stopped. The political  changes also changed preference for livelihood. Pakistan was  effected just like other countries.    In this situation, the prime minister's decision can  definitely be called a significant step in establishing economic  stability. However, it is important that we make sure that these  plans are implemented. It should have a "check" system to  rectify problems and pave the way for achieving this goal.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / PM says 'no plans' for VAT extension Mr John Major yesterday all but ruled out extending value added tax to zero-rated goods such as food and children's clothes. The move will restrict chancellor Kenneth Clarke's room for manoeuvre in this year's Budget. By going as close as he could to dismissing such a step, the prime minister sent a strong signal that Mr Clarke should exclude a further expansion of the VAT base from his revenue-raising plans for November. His remarks followed Labour accusations late last week that the Tories were preparing to extend VAT to more zero-rated goods. Labour's attack was triggered by radio interviews in which both Mr Major and Mr Clarke refused to rule out imposing the tax on food, public transport, children's clothes, newspapers, books and period-icals. Mr Clarke said then that such issues were a matter for the November Budget. Mr Major said the government had 'no plans' to extend VAT, but 'these are matters the chancellor has to consider'. On BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme yesterday, Mr Major said he saw 'no likelihood' that the government would have to extend VAT before the next general election. 'I see no likelihood of it, I see no need for it. We have an improving economic situation, not a deteriorating economic situation, and we are a government that cuts taxes by instinct and doesn't increase taxes by instinct,' he said. The prime minister was particularly robust in dismissing speculation that VAT might be extended to food. Food was 'the last thing one would put value added tax on'. But, accusing his political opponents of 'politics by scare', he was careful to leave some leeway for a possible change of tack, saying: 'We have no plans to do it . . . but one learns in government it is better never to say never.' Labour last night pounced on this to accuse Mr Major of 'slipping, sliding, ducking, weaving and diving' over the issue. Major hangs Euro campaign on integration fears, Page 9</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Strong demand boosts Victaulic VICTAULIC, the pipe and fittings maker, continued to benefit from strong demand from its main markets, the gas and water industries, which helped lift pre-tax profits by 24 per cent from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 14.3m in 1991. The water and gas industries accounted for 78 per cent of sales, ahead to Pounds 114.8m (Pounds 99.6m). The shares yesterday rose by 41p to 786p. Capital spending by the water service companies benefited Stewarts &amp; Lloyds Plastics, which produces polyethylene pipes for water distribution, and, to a lesser extent, Viking Johnson, which is involved in the refurbishment of water mains. Mr David Stewart, managing director, said the market for gas pipe and fittings had held up well despite the recession, although the low level of new house construction inevitably affected demand for small diameter service pipe and fittings. Construction declined because of reduced demand from the fire protection industry and the completion of the main contracts for the Channel tunnel project. A net cash balance at the year-end of Pounds 9.7m compared with net borrowings of Pounds 500,000 the year before. Working capital fell from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 3.4m. Earnings per share increased from 34.9p to 42.5p. A final dividend of 10p makes a total of 14.7p (12p). A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: New York feels the Fed's icy breath - Wall Street Like New York city, which is struggling to clear up the mess left by last week's heavy snowstorms, the stock market is still coping with the aftermath of the wintry blast of cold air the Federal Reserve sent Wall Street's way on February 4, when it raised interest rates for the first time in five years. The two weeks that have passed since the Fed's move have been dominated by a mood of nervous optimism. Share prices have been rising, but not in a straight line. The stock market is walking forward, but constantly glancing over its shoulder, fearful that the Fed will creep up on it again with another sneakily timed policy tightening. Take this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33 points in the first three trading days, a solid enough performance. The upward momentum was maintained early on Thursday when prices rose following the release of a positive set of consumer prices data, data that appeared to suggest inflation remains dormant in spite of the rapidly expanding economy. Then suddenly, prices turned tail after lunch. The retreat was prompted by a big sell-off in the bond market, which had decided to ignore the bullish news in the morning's January consumer prices numbers and react instead - somewhat improbably - to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's report on the monthly outlook for local business. I say improbably because normally, the Philly Fed's monthly forecast does not move markets. This time it did, because hidden in the data was a worrying sign that prices in the Philadelphia region are rising on the back of a strong manufacturing sector. Because this is seen as a leading indicator of consumer prices, as opposed to the CPI data, which was a lagging inflation indicator, the bond market sat up and took notice. Fearing that the rise in prices in Philadelphia presaged a similar movement nationwide - and that the Fed in Washington would reach a similar conclusion  -bond market investors headed for the hills, turning what had been a handsome morning rally into a frightening afternoon rout. By mid-afternoon, the benchmark 30-year bond had fallen so far that its yield had risen above 6.5 per cent for the first time since August 1993. Nervy stock market investors rapidly followed the bond market's lead, and the Dow slid from a 19-point gain to a 30-point loss within less than an hour (although it recovered some ground before the close). Like the bond market, the stock market plunged because investors were afraid the Fed would raise rates again in a second pre-emptive move against inflation. Everyone has good reason to be nervous about another rate increase. The first, two weeks ago, was unpleasant but was eventually digested without too much trouble because it was only a small upward move - a quarter of a percentage point on the bank overnight borrowing rate. Investors were also, ultimately, able to shrug it off because one policy tightening in itself is not that disturbing. Two policy tightenings, especially if they were to happen within a few weeks of each other, is another matter. A trend would be established. Investors are understandably nervous at the prospect of another interest rate increase. Stock and bond markets have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity over the past three years because interest rates were falling to - and staying at - the lowest levels seen in 30 years. Several consecutive policy tightenings by the Fed in early 1994, however, would clearly signal the end of the low interest rate cycle. Yet, as many analysts pointed out on February 4 when rates first went up, it was always unlikely that the Fed would stop at just one policy tightening. The newspapers lately have been full of pundits saying that the February 4 rate rise was the first step in a two- or even three-stage process. So why all the fuss about the prospect of another rate increase? One possible answer is that market sentiment may have been more badly damaged by the Fed's first tightening than was realised at the time. A second is that people are alarmed by the rapid rise in bond market yields, which have jumped above 6.5 per cent faster than anyone expected. Analysts warn that the break above 6.5 per cent will have a big psychological effect on the bond market, making it more likely that yields will keep on rising toward the next landmark - 6.75 per cent. The 30-year bond was yielding 5.7 per cent only as recently as October. Another 20 basis points higher, and bond yields will have jumped a full percentage point in little more than five months. No wonder the stock market is nervous.  ------------------------------------ Monday     3904.06  +  09.28 Tuesday    3928.27  +  24.21 Wednesday  3937.27  +  09.00 Thursday   3922.64  -  14.63 Friday     3887.46  -  35.18  ------------------------------------</p>

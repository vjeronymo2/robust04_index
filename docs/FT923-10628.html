			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / PM backs Lamont on Community VAT deal MR JOHN MAJOR entered the row about the UK's agreement to an EC minimum rate of value added tax with a vigorous defence yesterday of the deal struck by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Ministers sought to brush aside Tory Euro-sceptic charges that the move diminished UK sovereignty, insisting the agreement was vital to ensure completion of the single market. Mr Major said VAT had been a Community matter since the Treaty of Rome, and emphasised that Monday's deal did not affect zero-rated goods and services. He also highlighted the benefits for the Scotch whisky industry. Mr Major's remarks came against a background of Tory wrangling on the deal. While Mr Lamont called suggestions that the UK had ceded sovereignty 'a complete scare, and a very silly, silly season story', Mr Nick Budgen, a Euro-sceptic, said the chancellor was 'justifying his betrayal of the British constitution on the basis that he has served a commercial interest'. The agreement received a mixed reception from business leaders. The Institute of Directors warned that it should not be taken as a precedent for EC intervention in corporation tax and was a compromise 'which should not be presented as a victory'. But the Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce welcomed it as an important step towards completing the single market. The provisional agreement could still founder on Spanish and French objections. Spain wants Britain to change the name of British-made sherry, or grant equal tax treatment to Spanish sherry. France wants a French-style 'control duty' on all EC-produced wine, a higher harmonised excise duty on mineral oils, and a standard VAT rate on 'agricultural products' such as flowers.

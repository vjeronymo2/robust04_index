			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.21(g)(1) of the proposed rule carries forward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall reimburse members of its Advisory Council for transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and subsistence expenses they incur for each day devoted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attending quarterly meetings with representatives of the board of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directors of the Bank. See 12 CFR 960.14(e). Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.21(g)(2) of the proposed rule adds a new requirement that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank shall pay members of its Advisory Council a fee for each day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devoted to attending quarterly meetings with representatives of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the board of directors of the Bank. The Board is proposing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in light of the additional responsibility given to Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council members under the proposed rule to advise the Banks on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of the AHP implementation plans. The Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically requests comments as to whether the Banks should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to pay fees, and whether the amount to be paid should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth in the final AHP rule so that a uniform fee is paid to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all Advisory Council members, or whether the fees should be set by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the board of directors of each Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Q. Effective Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.22 of the proposed rule provides that, if published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a final rule, this part shall become effective 30 days from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of this part, or portion thereof, may be applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects approved for AHP funding prior to the effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule to the extent all relevant parties agree thereto in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing. The Finance Board would not need to approve any such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactive application of the final rule. This proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is intended to allow the retroactive application to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing AHP projects of provisions of the revised AHP rule that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are less restrictive than existing AHP requirements, to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all relevant parties (the Bank, the applicant, the sponsor, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner, and if applicable, the loan fund or loan consortium) agree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to such application of the new provisions. The Board specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on this proposed provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule applies only to the Banks, which do not come  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the meaning of ``small entities,'' as defined in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). See 5 U.S.C. 601(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with section 605(b) of the RFA, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 605(b), the Finance Board hereby certifies that this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, if promulgated as a final rule, will not have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35. The title, description of need and use, and the respondent description for the information collection requirements are discussed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments on the proposed information collections should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sent to Gary Waxman, Paperwork Reduction Project, OMB, room 3208,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 5 CFR 1320.12 and 1320.15, the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> table discloses the estimated annual reporting burden for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection of information in the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

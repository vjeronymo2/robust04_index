			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Strong European demand for Canadian dollar deals STRONG investor demand for Canadian dollar-denominated Eurobonds enticed New Zealand and Banque Nationale de Paris into the international capital market to raise a total of CDollars 325m yesterday. New Zealand's three-year, CDollars 200m bond issue was priced to yield 45 basis points over the 6.5 per cent Canadian government bond due August 1996, at an annual 7.53 per cent. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate US dollars. The bonds were sold mainly to retail investors in continental Europe. Hambros Bank, the lead manager, said: 'We've seen a lot of demand for Canadian dollars recently, partly because there are some redemptions coming up, and partly because investors like the yield pick-up over US Treasury bonds.' Three-year Canadian government bonds have a yield spread of about 170 basis points over US Treasuries. The bonds were re-offered at 99.225 and traded at 99.23-99.27 by late afternoon, according to the lead manager. BNP's four-year CDollars 125m deal was also targeted at retail investors in continental Europe and was priced to yield 45 basis points over the 6.5 per cent government bond due 1996. Among the day's other offerings, the Kingdom of Denmark's Eurolira deal  - a two-year, L150bn issue with an 8.45 per cent coupon - attracted considerable adverse comment from Eurolira specialists. BCI, the lead manager, said it decided to bring a short-dated Eurolira deal because of the lack of paper in this part of the yield curve. The deal was priced to give an annual yield of 8.53 per cent, whereas one-year Italian Treasury bills pay about 8.9 per cent gross. Other houses pointed out that existing Eurolira paper maturing in two years' time trades at yields of just over 9 per cent, making Denmark's deal look stingy by comparison. Rival banks described the deal as a flop, pointing out that it traded outside fees (BCI quoted a spread of 99.85 - 99.90, while the issue price less fees was 99.855). Some market participants expressed surprise that Denmark should launch a short-dated issue at all. 'There is good demand for Eurolira paper but it is at the long end, given that that is where you see the most gain when interest rates fall,' said one syndicate official. 'You get so little capital appreciation on two-year bonds it's hardly worth it.' Essar Gujarat, the Indian iron company, is planning to launch the first Indian Eurodollar convertible bond. The company hopes to raise Dollars 60m with a five-year convertible issue, although the size of the issue can be increased by 15 per cent if there is strong demand. It had originally considered doing an international equity offering of GDRs, following the example of Reliance and Grasim of India. With a convertible bond, the company hopes to provide investors with some downside protection. The indicated coupon is 5.5 - 6 per cent and there is a three-year put at par, so that if the share price does not pick up, investors get their money back. The bonds are callable after two years if the share price rises 30 per cent above the conversion price.</p>

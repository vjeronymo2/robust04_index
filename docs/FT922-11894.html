			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Caterpillar hit by 21% drop in sales CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, said that a 21 per cent decline in sales during the first quarter had led to a net loss of Dollars 132m, or Dollars 1.31 a share. This was the company's fifth consecutive quarterly net loss, but the first in which non-recurring charges, such a plant closures, did not account for the biggest part of the decline. The result compares with losses of Dollars 32m, or 32 cents, in the first quarter of 1991. The company denied that the five-month strike by the United Auto Workers union had a significant impact on the results. Mr Ken Kuchan, director of investor relations, said that the company had not lost sales to customers because of the strike. A majority of UAW strikers returned to work this week, though many workers are bitter after the long work stoppage. Contract talks with the union are expected to resume in the next week or so. Sales were Dollars 2.09bn, down from Dollars 2.58bn a year ago. The biggest drop came abroad, which accounted during the first quarter for 55 per cent of company's total sales, down from 58 per cent last year. Sales outside the US fell 24 per cent to Dollars 1.14bn, while domestic sales decreased just 12 per cent to Dollars 953m. Mr Kuchan said the company continued to meet the demand of customers by supplying machines from plants overseas or from facilities in the US which continued to operate at low levels during the strike with staffing by management and salaried workers. He said that dealers, in an effort to keep customers satisfied, had persuaded them to postpone their purchases or provided them with used machines on a temporary basis. While Mr Kuchan admitted that some sales had been delayed by the strike, he asserted: 'We have not lost any share of market.' The company expects that results will improve significantly during the second quarter and that it will return to profitability during the second half of the year. Dealer inventories were lower than normal during the first quarter because of weak demand, but sales were picking up in March. Dealers are expected to begin restocking their inventories, particularly in the North America, where economic conditions have begun to show signs of improvement. It also said that its previously announced lift truck joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would provide 'a significant gain' for the company this year. The outlook for the company was still unclear because of 'the uncertain economic environment and the ongoing labour negotiations'. Soured relations with its workforce are not expected to help Caterpillar in its efforts to improve productivity.</p>

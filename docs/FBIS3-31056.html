			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Synchrony must exist between the parliamentary  group of the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] and the  government, as well as in the vertical link between the DPS  Central Council and its parliamentary group -- this was what the  participants in today's DPS conference decided.    An official proposal will be made to the deputies who left  the DPS parliamentary group that they should leave the National  Assembly as well. The DPS assesses the work of the government  to date as unsatisfactory, but considers that it should wait  until the budget is adopted before deciding the issue of what  personnel changes in the cabinet should be proposed.    Here is a brief interview with DPS leader Ahmed Dogan by our  reporter Mariya Tsankova:    [Begin recording] [Dogan] We support the government, we  support it, so to speak, as its godparent, although we have a  number of very serious critical remarks to make. However, these  critical comments do not relate to the status of the government,  but rather concern the possibility for more radical actions. We  have some hopes regarding a cabinet shuffle, but Prime Minister  Prof. Lyuben Berov is the man who has to decide this matter.    [Tsankova] Did you discuss a code of regulations for the DPS  parliamentary group and the relations within it?    [Dogan] Yes, the subject did come up, a number of principles  for a code were suggested. I personally proposed that the  leadership should be rotated, the post of leader, and so on.    [Tsankova] Did you discuss the allegations of corruption  that prompted Mehmet Hodja to leave the DPS parliamentary group?    [Dogan] I would very much like to know the facts about at  least one case of corruption from the person who posed this  issue. I would very much like to know one such fact, and would  be very glad if someone could provide me with such information.  However, if we talk about corruption in the broad sense,  perhaps this is a matter for parliament. [end recording]    Discussions will no doubt be provoked by the decision  adopted  at today's DPS meeting to propose to the government that  representatives of the tobacco producers appointed by local DPS  leaderships should serve on the managements of the 22 companies  controlled by Bulgartabak Holdings.</p>

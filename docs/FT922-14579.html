			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: Claim that minimum wage would add 30% to labour costs With reference to the letter from Stephen Machin and others of the London School of Economics (April 2) we write to tell you that the results of our recent survey of the hotel and catering industry give a completely different picture. The survey carried out for us by London Economics covered large and small establishments throughout the country and clearly showed that the introduction of a statutory minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 per hour in the manner suggested by the Labour party would have the following effects: an increase in labour costs of at least 30 per cent, partly because of the need to maintain differentials; an increase in prices; a reduction in job opportunities and career development openings for young people; fewer opportunities for part-timers, especially women. In these times of recession, surely voters will not want to pay more for food and related services, particularly those with families. Also, they would rather have a job, or even a part-time or casual job, rather than no job at all.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Russia opposes the  extension of the Sarajevo cease-fire model to other besieged  areas in Bosnia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin  said here today.    Russia "firmly rules out" the possibility of extending the  Sarajevo cease-fire model and rejects "any repetition of the  NATO ultimatum in other parts of Bosnia," Churkin said after a  meeting with diplomats from other nations on peace in Bosnia.    In a joint statement, ranking officials from the U.S.,  Canada, the UN and European Union member states, said the latest  developments in Sarajevo represent a "major step toward an end  to the whole Bosnian war."    The participants expressed grave concerns about the serious  situation in other parts of Bosnia and their readiness to  cooperate closely, by taking advantage of the current positive  factors, to bring about a settlement to the conflict through  negotiations.    The participants also said in the statement that they would  seek to improve the humanitarian situation in Serb-encircled  enclaves and pressure Muslims and Croats for a cease-fire in  central Bosnia and the southern city of Mostar.    Meanwhile, they warned the serbs not to move to other war  fronts any of the artillery they had pulled back from around  Sarajevo before the deadline of the NATO ultimatum which expired  peacefully on February 20.    Churkin, who is also Russia's special envoy for former  Yugoslavia, said the participants discussed measures for peace  that can all be achieved without the use of force.    "There was no attempt to resort to strong language at this  meeting because we're acting together," he said.    The final step of the Serb withdrawal over the weekend in  accordance with NATO's demands was negotiated by Russia, which  has traditionally maintained close ties with the Serbs.    Russia has sent 400 troops as UN peacekeepers to Sarajevo to  help monitor the cease-fire.    Therefore, Churkin said, Russia's message to Europe and the  United States was, "when you get in trouble with the Serbs,  before raising hell please turn to us. Maybe we can resolve it  without any difficulties."    He agreed to use Russian influence with the Serbs to get  Tuzla airport re-opened, a long-time demand of Western  governments.    Tuzla is the eastern Bosnian base for aid agencies to send  emergency relief supplies to the local people. Its airport lies  within the range of Serb artillery.    The Russian envoy also urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to  send American soldiers to Sarajevo. But Clinton has offered to  send troops only after a peace agreement.    During the meeting, the participants agreed with Russia's  proposal to use the momentum from the Sarajevo cease-fire to  push for political progress in the war-torn republic as a whole.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: News Corp, Telstra in joint venture Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Telstra, Australia's large government-owned telecommunications group, have formed a ADollars 1bn (USDollars 752m) joint venture to provide pay-TV services via the Telstra cable network. They will have equal shares in the venture, although Telstra will own 100 per cent of the cable infrastructure. Confirmation of the tie-up, which has been rumoured for many weeks, comes two months after Optus, the rival national telecommunications carrier, announced plans to link with Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, Seven Network, and Continental Cablevision of the US, to develop a similar cable network. Nine is Australia's biggest commercial TV operation, while Seven is a smaller network. However, the Optus joint venture, known as Optus Vision, aims to deliver local telephone calls, as well as pay-TV and other interactive services, and will involve considerable aerial (rather than underground) cabling. The Telstra/News joint venture will focus on 'broadband home entertainment services, and pay-TV in particular'. Optus Vision plans to spend ADollars 3bn over the next four years. News/Telstra put the initial outlay at ADollars 300m - split equally - although the total investment over the next five to seven years could rise to around ADollars 1bn. In addition, Telstra's expenditure on the cable infrastructure is put at around ADollars 3.5bn. Telstra said its new cabling had now 'passed' more than 50,000 homes - although final connections to individual homes would still have to be installed - and it hoped to reach 100,000 homes by the end of 1994. The aim is to be able to serve 4m homes by 1999. The partners hope to start providing pay-TV services 'early in 1995'. There have been numerous promises about pay-TV facilities in Australia, but as yet consumers have yet to see a package go on sale. There are now the two cable-based consortia, plus the three satellite licence holders - Australis Media, Continental Century, and the publicly-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>

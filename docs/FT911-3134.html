			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Decision needed on Anglo-Irish talks venue BRITISH and Irish ministers meet in London today for the last time before historic round-table talks on Northern Ireland's future, Ralph Atkins writes. Agreement still has to be reached on where later stages of the negotiations will be held. Talks bringing Northern Ireland's constitutional parties together for the first time for 15 years start next Tuesday with a series of meetings in Belfast. They will include bilateral 'agenda-setting' meetings followed about a week later with plenary sessions on internal government in the province. Agreement, however, has still to be reached on where talks will be held on relations between north and south Ireland and between the UK and Irish governments. Unionists are believe to favour London but the Irish government is thought to prefer somewhere within the island of Ireland. A compromise might be a Northern Ireland town outside Belfast - possibly Armagh, Ireland's ecclesiastical capital. The prospect of political progress in the province will dominate today's meeting between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister. Mr Brooke will also raise the recent controversy over alleged leaks by the Irish police to IRA terrorists. The meeting will be the last conference under 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement before the start of the wide-ranging talks engineered by Mr Brooke, and which could see the agreement being replaced.</p>

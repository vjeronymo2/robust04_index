			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TRAIN DERAILS IN MT. WASHINGTON  </P> <P> A freight train derailed today and one of the cars plowed into an apartment  building, but no injuries were reported in the third Southern California train  derailment in a month.  </P> <P> Twelve cars of the freight train derailed just after 10 a.m. in the Mt.  </P> <P> Washington neighborhood near the Pasadena Freeway, city Fire Department  spokesman Pat Marek said.  </P> <P> The cause of the derailment was unknown.  </P> <P> "One of those freight cars did hit an apartment building," he said. "There were  no injuries reported from that apartment building being hit."  </P> <P> One of the cars also carried an unidentified hazardous material, but no leaks  were found, Marek said.  </P> <P> The derailment was the third in Southern California in the last month. Fourteen  runaway railroad cars collided with a locomotive in Pico Rivera on Sept. 9, and  about two weeks later, a boxcar loaded with Navy munitions jumped the tracks in  Westminster. No one was injured in either derailment.  </P></p>

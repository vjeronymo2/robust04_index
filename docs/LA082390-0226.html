			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STANDOFF OVER EMBASSY;  </P> <P> U.S., IRAQ WAGE A WAR OF WORDS  </P> <P> The United States and Iraq were on a collision course today over Baghdad's bid  to close embassies in occupied Kuwait. Iraq said that defying the order would  be an "act of aggression" but Washington warned that enforcing it would be a  mistake.  </P> <P> One report quoted Iraqi sources as saying embassies that failed to close by  Friday as ordered would be surrounded by troops. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  said that would be a "mistake" on the Iraqis' part.  </P> <P> A senior administration official said today that Marines assigned to the U.S.  Embassy in Kuwait have pulled out, leaving behind the ambassador and a small  staff.  </P> <P> "We don't want to put American lives at unnecessary danger," he told a  reporter.  </P> <P> As to why the Marines did not stay to protect the consulate, he said, "A few  Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi army."  </P> <P> Asked what the ambassador and the remaining staff of about a dozen would do if  the Iraqi military tried to close down the facility by force, the official said  he would not speculate.  </P> <P> "By law, they have a right to be there," this official said.  </P> <P> Thousands of foreigners, including about 3,000 Americans, are trapped in Iraq  and Kuwait, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said they will serve as  human shields against attack.  </P> <P> It appeared that strategy was being carried out. Polish workers arriving home  from Iraq told the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza today that last week, as  they left the Iraqi chemical factory where they had been working, about three  dozen Americans arrived under guard.  </P> <P> Hussein, in what Iraqi media billed as an open letter to President Hosni  Mubarak of Egypt, today denounced Egypt for sending troops to join U.S. and  other forces in the defense of Saudi Arabia and said Arab leaders who failed to  support Arab causes did not deserve to rule. His statement was read by an  announcer on Iraqi television.  </P> <P> Iraq's information minister warned foreign governments not to try to keep their  missions open.  </P> <P> ABC News, citing Iraqi sources in Baghdad, said troops would surround each  diplomatic mission in Kuwait that remained open after the deadline. The  unidentified sources said the troops may prevent food from going into the  buildings, which would be "put under virtual siege."  </P> <P> Cheney said today the United States and others have made it clear they would  deem a shutdown of the embassies "an illegal act."  </P> <P> "We don't recognize the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait, and I think most of us are  determined to keep our embassies open," he said on ABC. "I think it would be a  mistake for Saddam Hussein to try to close down all those embassies in Kuwait."  But, Cheney added, "He's done foolish things before."  </P> <P> The Pentagon said today that the armed services will call about 46,700 reserves  to active duty over the next five weeks to strengthen the military forces  opposing Iraq.  </P> <P> The first calls to members of the National Guard and armed forces reserves will  be placed as early as Friday, and about 9,800 part-time soldiers will have been  called to leave their civilian jobs by the end of August, said Pete Williams,  the Pentagon press secretary.  </P></p>

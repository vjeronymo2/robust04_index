			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said on Friday that unless there is a significant  change in the attitude of North Korea, sanctions would certainly  be adopted by the U.N. Security Council.    Testifying at the Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification  Committee, Han said a draft resolution is being worked out and  would take shape around next week.    "We don't feel the need to promote sanctions against North  Korea outside the frame of the United Nations at the moment,"  the foreign minister said.    With regard to China's posture, Han said China's emphasis on  dialogue does not necessarily mean that they are against a  Security Council resolution. "Their efforts to resolve the  matter through dialogue do not run counter to ours either," he  said.    He said Russian President Boris Yeltsin clearly said in his  recent talks with President Kim Yong-sam that his country would  cooperate with South Korea in the nuclear question.    On the reported plan of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter  to  visit Pyongyang, Minister Han said he believes that given the  time, his visit would be of not much help. "Now that the visit  has already been planned, however, we intend to make his visit  helpful," he said. "We will let him know about our position and  will make him tell the North Koreans about the consequences they  would face once the nuclear issue goes unsettled."    Han said that the United States' policy is not to tolerate  any possession of nuclear arms by North Korea.    "If North Korea had nuclear weapons, the United States, U.N.  Security Council and other countries will not tolerate it under  all circumstances," he said.    The minister said there are no unusual military movements in  North Korea presently. "But, it will be a necessary and  responsible act for us to secure full military deterrence  especially at this time when North Korea threatens to regard any  sanctions as a war declaration against them," Minister Han said.    Saying the door to dialogue remains open, the minister said  the situation is such that various dialogues including  South-North talks can take place depending on the attitude of  North Korea.</p>

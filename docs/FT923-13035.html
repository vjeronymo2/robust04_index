			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Polish miners stage stoppages POLISH MINERS at five coal pits yesterday staged work stoppages amid a coal glut which is forcing management to introduce temporary lay offs and cut miners' incomes. The stoppages at the Zabrze Bielszowice mine and four others in the Katowice area come in the wake of a continuing two-week-old sit-in by radical unionists from the Solidarity 80 movement at the State Coal Agency headquarters in the city. The protesters are demanding wage increases for miners, as well as cuts in taxes levied on pits and forgiveness of mounting mine debts. Leaders of the other mining unions met yesterday to decide whether to call an industry-wide token stoppage, while Mr Waclaw Niewiarowski, the new industry minister, is to see the unions today in Warsaw. The government ended subsidies to coal mining at the end of March and the industry has gone into debt as coal prices have failed to rise in the face of low demand, following a mild winter and the continuing industrial recession. Pit-head stocks have now reached some 6m tonnes - equivalent to two weeks output by the country's 71 pits. Poland produced 59.4m tonnes of coal in the first five months of the year, matching output in the same period last year. Sales outside Poland by Weglokoks, the state-owned coal trader which continues to dominate the export market, reached 6.6m tonnes in the first five months.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Domestic Marketing Assessment and Required Purchases of Tobacco (&sect;&sect;723.503 and 723.504)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 320C(c) of the Act provides that if the quantity of imported tobacco used by a domestic manufacturer for making cigarettes for the year exceeds 25 percent, such manufacturer must pay a domestic marketing assessment on each pound of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent. In addition, as provided in section 320C(d) and (e), such manufacturer must purchase tobacco from the existing burley and flue-cured tobacco inventories of producer owned cooperative marketing associations in an amount equal to the weight of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per pound domestic marketing assessment rate set by section 320C(c) is the difference between one-half the sum of the average market prices received by domestic producers of burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively, and the average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco. Domestically produced burley and flue-cured tobaccos are marketed on a marketing year basis. The average price per pound paid to domestic producers for a kind of tobacco is determined for the marketing year. The marketing years are: for burley tobacco, October 1 through September 30; and for flue-cured tobacco, July 1 through June 30. Under the proposed rule, the average prices for domestically produced burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco would be calculated using data published by the Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). For the other side of the comparison, a weighted average price of all unmanufactured tobacco imported for consumption in the United States, with no allowance for tobacco reexported, would be calculated from Bureau of Census data. For example, if the calculated average market prices were $1.83 per pound for burley tobacco and $1.73 per pound for flue-cured tobacco, the average price would be $1.78 per pound. If the weighted average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco for the relevant period was $1.28 per pound, a domestic marketing assessment rate of $0.50 per pound would apply. That rate would be multiplied by the pounds of imported tobacco used in excess of the 25 percent limit (unless a higher limit had been set under the Secretary's discretionary authority to adjust the limit as provided for in section 320C(f)). If noncompliance is indicated, the cigarette manufacturer will have an opportunity for an administrative hearing before any domestic marketing assessments or other sanctions are imposed. Under the proposed rule payment of the assessment would be required to be made within 30 days after the manufacturer is notified of the amount due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where a domestic content violation has occurred, the compensatory purchases of tobacco by a manufacturer, as required by section 320C(d) and (e), must be in equal quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco and must be from the inventories of producer owned cooperative marketing associations that handle price support loans for tobacco. However, the statute provides that if the total required compensatory purchases by all noncomplying manufacturers would reduce the associations inventories of loan stocks of burley or flue-cured tobacco below the reserve stock level for the respective kind of tobacco, the required purchase of such kind of tobacco, for each manufacturer, may be reduced proportionately. These provisions of section 320C would be implemented by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;723.504 of the proposed rule. The required purchases of burley tobacco could be made from either of the two producer owned marketing associations for burley tobacco: the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association and the Burley Stabilization Corporation. There is only one applicable producer association for flue-cured tobacco, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation. Under the proposed rule, required purchases of tobacco must be at the applicable list price published by the association without discounts of any kind. The manufacturer would be allowed to make such purchases from any grade or grades of uncommitted tobacco in the association's inventories. Compensatory purchases of tobacco would be required to be made within 30 days after the manufacturer is notified of the quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco that must be purchased. However, the time could be extended if the manufacturer requests reconsideration of the compensatory purchase determination. As provided in sections 320C (d) and (e) of the statute, if a manufacturer fails to make the required compensatory purchases in a timely manner, the manufacturer, under the proposed rule, would be subject to a penalty of 75 percent of the average market price for the applicable kind of tobacco for the most recent marketing year multiplied by the quantity of tobacco involved. Further, as provided in sections 320C(d)(5) and (e)(5), these compensatory purchases could not be counted by the manufacturer for purchases in the application of section 320B of the 1938 Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

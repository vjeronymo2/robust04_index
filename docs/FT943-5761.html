			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Fleet car buyers see discount cut The discounts businesses have been able to obtain on most company car purchases have fallen sharply. This is mainly because of vehicle makers cutting dealers' profit margins and other marketing changes prompted partly by a taxation regime introduced in April. The mean average discount reported by a broad sample of businesses questioned in this year's annual Company Secretary's Review of company car schemes fell to 9.6 per cent from 12.2 per cent last year and more than 14 per cent in 1992. Even the 9.6 per cent figure overstates the discount most companies are obtaining, because it includes deals made by some companies at much higher discounts. The survey says: 'The vast majority of cars are now being purchased with a reduction of 9 per cent or less.' The survey, covering 400 companies operating a total of 38,000 cars, identifies a small number of deals in which discounts of up to 41.3 per cent were reportedly received. Most companies - none of which is identified - reported achieving discounts of 9 per cent or less on the same models. The survey acknowledges that some figures reflect deals agreed before manufacturers cut their dealers' formal profit margins to 10 per cent or less from a traditional 15 per cent to 16.5 per cent. 'However, it is apparent that certain car manufacturers, keen to expand their presence in the fleet market, often with new models, have been offering fleet buyers very attractive deals,' it says. The average discount figure appears to suggest that dealers are giving away all their profit on a sale, or even making a loss. In virtually all cases, however, manufacturers are providing them with other forms of compensation, such as sales volume-related bonuses. The reduced discounts also do not necessarily mean that companies are having to pay more for their cars. In many cases official 'list' prices of cars have been cut. Low list prices are welcomed by the motor trade because of the new company car tax regime, which links tax payable by employees directly to the list price of cars, irrespective of any discounts obtained. This year's survey also dispels the impression that 'prestige' carmakers like to give that their products are above the general car market's discount wars. It shows most companies achieving discounts of between 6 per cent and 9 per cent on some Mercedes and BMW models, for example. Company Secretary's Review of Company Car Schemes.

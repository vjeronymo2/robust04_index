			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton welcomed today what he called Russia's "far-sighted  choice" of joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program.    In a ceremony celebrating the 50th anniversary of the  signing  of a bill aiding World War Two veterans, Clinton said the  Russian move was "another step on our long road in man's  everlasting quest for peace."    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the documents  in Brussels today. Moscow was 21st nation to join the program  that covers joint planning and exercises and other consultations.    At the Brussels ceremony, Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of  State  Warren Christopher announced that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin will visit Washington in September.    Before the September trip, Yeltsin will meet Clinton in  Naples, Italy, during the July summit of the seven  industrialized nations.    In a separate development, U.S. Vice President Al Gore  opened  two days of talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin on space, trade, energy and environment cooperation.    Both Gore and Chernomyrdin are leading several joint  U.S.-Russian committees working on the related areas.    The committees, established 14 months ago during Clinton's  meeting with Yeltsin in Vancouver, Canada, are having their  third meeting here.    They are expected to sign a number of agreements on  cooperation in space exploration, oil and gas production and  environmental protection.</p>

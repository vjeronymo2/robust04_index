			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Shares set to tumble if Fed tightens - New York Is the Federal Reserve poised to lift short-term interest rates for a second time in two months? Most Wall Street analysts are convinced it will do so today or soon after the Fed's policy-making session tomorrow. But rate increase or not, the perceived threat is sure to bear heavily on investor sentiment this week. If the Fed strikes, stocks are expected to tumble, just as on February 4, when the central bank lifted its Federal Funds target by 25 basis points to 3.25 per cent. That day, the Dow Jones Industrial index plummeted 96 points and has regained scant ground since then. Opinions vary over just how far equities would fall this time, and how soon they would begin to rebound. Mr Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York, believes the market's rate concerns are already sufficiently priced into stock values. If the Fed decides to nudge up the Fed Funds target another 25 basis points, he expects a 'knee-jerk reaction' by stocks, followed by a quick recovery. But Mr David Shulman, equity strategist at Salomon Brothers in New York, takes a more pessimistic view of the market's intermediate prospects. He finds no compelling reason to revise his investment house's forecast of a 4 per cent Fed Funds rate by June, accompanied by a 10 per cent 'correction' in share prices. Since reaching its apex of 3,978.36 five days before the Fed's first strike, the Dow is down a net 82 points, or about 2 per cent, at 3,895.65. If Mr Shulman is correct, the index has a long way to go before hitting bottom. Several other factors are likely to influence stocks this week. Unfortunately, their effect is likely to be negative, and that could exaggerate any sell-off that may follow a move to more restrictive rates. At Kemper Securities in Chicago, Mr Gregory Nie says technical factors suggest the market is 'over-bought' and expects it to begin working off some of the excess during the week, regardless of whether a policy change is forthcoming from Washington. Institutional investors are also starting to look ahead to the end of the first three months of the year, with an eye to putting 'window-dressing' on their quarterly reports to clients. With a net decline in the S&amp;P 500 in prospect this quarter and the unfavourable trend in interest rates, Kemper's technical analyst fears portfolio managers may make a 'dash for cash' as March 31 draws near. A heavy outflow of funds from the market could badly damage stock values. But what if the Fed chooses to remain on the sidelines? Mr James Solloway, director of research at Argus in New York, is one of the minority who takes such a view. Given the economic fundamentals and the sharp reaction to last month's rate boost, he argues the Fed will hold its fire. If so, he says, 'pessimism has reached such an extreme, we are likely to be on the verge of a decent rally this week'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Trushkov report: "Assent to...Dictatorship? </F> Russian Federation Former General Prosecutor A. Kazannik Warns  That Russia Is Threatened by a Regime of Personal Power"]    [Text] Sergey Filatov has played a deadly trump card  against any ill-wishers. The head of the presidential  administration bombastically pronounced: "No power which seeks  dictatorship will bother about accord in society." It turned  out a ringing phrase, but.... The ideal option for a dictator  is one whereby he secures assent to dictatorship.    But why did the president's trusty henchman suddenly start  speaking about dictatorship just before the signing of the  "Social Accord Contract"? Because the closer the "fateful" date  comes, the more acutely the question arises: Who is to agree  with whom? PRAVDA has already advanced the assumption that it is  a pact between mice and the cat which is chasing them. But  Aleksey Kazannik, Russian Federation former general prosecutor,  has made a still more definite assessment of the situation:  Overt dictatorship is approaching in Russia. He declared this  at the height of the talk of civil peace and social accord.  Here is a dictaphone recording of his reply to the  "Novosti-plyus" television program:    "I believe that you do not have to have the wisdom of  Solomon  but simply analyze the state of the president's team and the  dynamics of its development in order to arrive at definite  conclusions. The first such reason is that the president's  whole team, so I have become convinced, has been formed not  according to professional and personal qualities but only on  principles of personal devotion. Therefore these people are  essentially privy to a compact or, if you like, even a  conspiracy.    "Second reason: Since these people have been selected on  such principles, it goes without saying that a certain stable  grouping has taken shape. They were closely welded together --  I would even say fused together -- by the blood of the events of  October 1993. These people really are as thick as thieves.    "Third: I have become convinced that the bulk of these  people are professionally incompetent. They cannot work with  their head and evidently consider it shameful to work with their  hands. Therefore they hold on to the president, as bus  passengers hold on to the handrails to stop themselves falling.    "Fourth, the president has already subordinated to himself  all the power structures -- the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Security  Administration, the Ministry of Defense, a number of other  services....    "The president and his entourage frequently violate the  Constitution, laws, and State Duma and Federation Council  decrees. All these factors taken together have enabled me to  conclude that overt dictatorship is approaching."    The warning is so serious that it must make any politician  think before he ventures to sign a document which openly  curtails citizens' democratic rights and restricts the operation  of the Constitution. But Russians had already guessed that  which Professor A. Kazannik has proved in a logical and well  reasoned manner. As public opinion poll data attest, only  one-fifth of our fellow citizens believe that Russia is governed  by democrats, while more than half of those polled are sure that  there is now undemocratic administration of the country.    Incidentally, in an attempt to refute the ex-prosecutor's  statement the head of the Russian Federation president's  administration has virtually...confirmed it. First, S. Filatov  admitted that "the presidential team is selected by the  president, who proceeds, inter alia, from personal likes."  Second, he confirmed that "the power structures were under the  president before the events, and they are under the president  now."    So what is the presidential team imposing on the country --  social accord or assent to...dictatorship?</p>

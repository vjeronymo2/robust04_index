			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Bristol R-R workers set to ballot on strike action ENGINEERS AND technicians at Rolls-Royce's Bristol plant are set to ballot on strike action today over threatened compulsory redundancies, Diane Summers writes. MSF, the general technical union, said about 300 employees had volunteered for redundancy. But the company needed to shed a further 700by March 26, after which redundancies would be compulsory. Rolls-Royce has cut 12,000 jobs in the past two years and plans a further cut of 5,000 jobs by the end of 1994. It has said the decline in military orders and turmoil in the world airline industry have forced a restructuring.</p>

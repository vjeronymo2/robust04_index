			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Pressure on franc TENSION within the European exchange rate mechanism is set to continue this week with several currencies coming under pressure in spite of the agreements reached at the Edinburgh summit, writes Peter John. The three ERM currencies causing concern at the moment are the Irish punt, the Danish krone and the French franc. Of the three, the punt is seen as most vulnerable and selling on Friday prompted Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, to stress his commitment to its present value. However, a number of London economists argue that there is no way that it can escape devaluation. The krone, which was said to have been hit by corporate selling at the end of last week, is strongly expected to tread the devaluation path of its its Scandinavian colleagues. There is more debate about the fate of the French franc. Belief is growing that if it is not devalued, floated or temporarily suspended from the ERM this week, it will have maintained its position by only the slimmest of margins and will probably go within the next few weeks. Francophiles argue on the other hand that the economic fundamentals in France are sound and the currency benefits from a strong political and economic commitment to the status quo by the French government and arguably by the Bundesbank. They add that it is the key currency to stand against the D-Mark and if there is any realignment the whole nature of the mechanism comes under question. In the money markets, short term rates are expected to be squeezed higher as the clearing banks find it preferable to borrow money overnight rather than take the Bank of England offers which can entail carrying money over into the New Year and upsetting the year end balance sheets.</p>

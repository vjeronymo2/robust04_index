			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on Democratic Party Chairman Eduard </F> Selami's speech at a meeting in Gjirokaster; date not given:  "Albanian-Greek Relations Should Not Influence Our Stand Toward  the Greek Minority in Albania"]    [Text] At a large meeting in the Gjirokaster city cinema  and theater hall, PD [Democratic Party] Chairman Eduard Selami  spoke to PD members and sympathizers and the people of  Gjirokaster constituency. Among other things, he dealt with  Albanian-Greek relations. Also attending the meeting were DP  General Secretary Tritan Shehu; Rexhep Uka, minister without  portfolio for local government problems; Minister of Education  Xhezair Teliti; Genc Ruli, deputy for the Gjirokaster  constituency; and Sokrat Kalidhopuli, chairman of the district  council.    "We came to this open meeting," Mr. Selami said, "as  representatives of the party in power -- the Democratic Party --  and of the local state organs, to listen to your concerns and  exchange opinions on how to solve all the problems that are  soluble.    "The DP has been governing the country for the last two  years. Over this period, there have been both achievements and  shortcomings, but we have never concealed the latter. It has  been a difficult period, but one that has also been full of many  hopes. It has been and still is characterized by successes on  the road toward democracy and a market economy, toward Europe  and Western civilization. It is the beginning of a long haul  toward our future, in which much remains to be done, because  democracy is a thing that always strives for perfection. Aside  from problems of the economic reform and its implementation, and  problems regarding Gjirokaster itself, it would be of great  interest to broach here the relations with our southern  neighbor, Greece, to discuss the grave incident of April 10, and  to have your opinions on these issues. This is another reason  why we came to Gjirokaster.    "We are living at a time of great change," Mr. Selami  continued, "a time when the period of destruction and overcoming  communism unfortunately, in our region, very soon gave way to a  period of war fraught with extreme nationalism that today is  reflected in its most acute form in the former Yugoslavia, and  Bosnia in particular. This crisis, the greatest one since World  War II -- not only on a regional scale, but also on a European  one -- is also one of the world's greatest crises. In this  respect, our policy has always been one of finding a peaceful  solution and negotiation, ruling out any change of frontiers by  force. However, at the same time it has been a policy of  defending Albanian interests. In this regard, we think that  these sorts of problems will remain in the region. Peaceful  solutions, not only in Bosnia, but also other parts of  Yugoslavia, look extremely remote. In Kosova and elsewhere,  there are big problems. We are therefore of the opinion that a  host of difficulties relating to the international situation are  becoming added to the natural difficulties that our reform --  one of the deepest and most radical ones -- has brought in  Albania...."    Dealing with Albania's relations with our southern neighbor,  which is also a member of the European Community, PD Chairman  Eduard Selami stated: "We have been and continue to be in favor  of good relations, but things have not gone as they should.  Certain things have become tense and aggravated. As for the  incident, you have already heard our stern condemnation and  denunciation of the perpetrators. We have complained about this  to the relevant international bodies, urging them to find the  culprits and put the responsibility for what happened on those  who really deserve it. In the context of our state-to-state  dealings, this event has impaired our relationship, but there  has been no lack of determination on our part, and it must be  mentioned that Greece, too, has responded positively to our  resolve. We therefore think that, through good will and  dialogue, these issues can be resolved. However, it remains our  precondition that the culprits must be identified. They must  accept their responsibility, and Greece should also admit its  responsibility here, because it is involved in an incident that  requires a just solution. The matter has been put before all  the international bodies and the various groups set up to  investigate the case. They will clarify many things, but it is  natural that Albania, as the injured party, has reacted strongly  in its own right. Such incidents tend to strain the relations  between our two countries. The incident we are speaking about  is not an isolated one. There are certain circles in Greece  that are interested in destabilizing relations with Albania.  This can be seen in the inhumane Greek conduct towards the  Albanian refugees as well as other provocations stemming from a  certain concept -- the concept of Vorio-Epirus.    "As the party in power, we always follow a straight line. We  have respected and continue to respect the Greek minority  because we appreciate its contribution; it sees its future in  Albania and does not play any destabilizing role, but on the  contrary makes its own contribution to democracy in Albania. As  we continuously perfect democracy in Albania, the demands of the  Greek minority will certainly increase. Our relations with the  Greek minority, which in Gjirokaster have a long and positive  tradition of humane cooperation, must not serve as the cause of  a breakup in our relations with Greece. It is a pity that time  and again there emerge extremist attitudes, irresponsible  declarations, and certain stands that aggravate the situation.  We, as the Democratic Party, have welcomed members of the Greek  minority into our ranks, placing them in government posts, in  parliamentary positions, in the education system, and so on. As  far as we are concerned, the Greek minority is a factor of  stability. We will continue marching along the same road of  good understanding with Greece, because it is not only to the  benefit of Albania and Greece, but also to that of our region as  a whole. We really do want cooperation, but we also want mutual  obligations to be honored. Our two neighboring countries, being  the most ancient countries in the Balkans, must render their  services to stability and peace. The PD is of the opinion that  the time has already come for Greek-Albanian relations not to be  dominated by ancient instincts and nationalistic spirits founded  on extremist religious attitudes."    The meeting was also addressed by Messrs. Shehu, Uka,  Teliti,  and Kalidhopulli, who answered questions put by the audience.    After the meeting, Mr. Selami and other dignitaries went to  pay condolences to the family of the martyr Fatmir Shehu, the  army officer killed in the 10 April massacre.</p>

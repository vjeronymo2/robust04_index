			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim units carried  out a military operation today, capturing the summit of Mount  Bjelasnica and the TV relay facility on the summit, the  information service of the Srpska republic army's main  headquarters said this evening.    ``As we have already informed the public, UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] units which were deployed on Mount Igman and  Mount Bjelasnica have been withdrawing to Hrasnica and Sarajevo  airport over the last few days, thus violating the cease-fire  agreement and leaving the area they controlled to Muslim forces,  the statement says. It adds that some UNPROFOR troops stayed on  to control certain positions, including the summit of Mount  Bjelasnica and its TV relay facility.    "However, the Muslim forces today carried out a military  operation and captured the summit of Mount Bjelasnica and the TV  relay," the statement of the main headquarters of the Srpska  republic army says. Thus, the area handed over by the Srpska  republic army to UNPROFOR under the terms of the cease-fire  agreement has been seized by members of the so-called  Bosnia-Herzegovina army. This creates conditions for offensive  operations toward Trnovo and Rogoj, as well as major offensive  operations to split and capture the Serb-held parts of Sarajevo.  It is certain that the Muslims and UNPROFOR have used deceit to  violate the terms of the peace agreement.    "Nothing can be said with certainty about the fate of  UNPROFOR members who stayed on at the summit of Mount Bjelasnica  until the violent act committed by the Muslims," the statement  issued by the information service of the main headquarters of  the Srpska republic army says in conclusion.</p>

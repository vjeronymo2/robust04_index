			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Japan will seek support  for a stable yen and its economic measures at a Group of Seven  (G-7) meeting in Germany this weekend, an international  financial source said Thursday [24 February].    Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 nations  will  gather on Saturday in Kronberg, the outskirts of Frankfurt, to  reaffirm cooperation in macroeconomic measures for global  growth, stable currency rates and aid to Russia, the source  said. The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan and the United States.    On the exchange rates, Japan will explain that the yen's  sharp rise since early last year has "poured water" on signs of  economic recovery, he said. Since then, Japan has launched a  spate of pump-priming measures, including the latest record  15.25 trillion yen package, despite the tough financial  situation, the source noted.    Japan will stress the plan's inclusion of tax cuts worth 6  trillion yen to stimulate consumption and deregulatory actions  primarily to facilitate land-market liquidity, the source said.  He said such steps were taken while continuing to boost public  works and housing-related loans, sectors that remain strong.    Japan will brief other nations particularly on the tax issue  to win support, the source said, citing U.S. criticism over the  effects of a single-year tax cut.    U.S. officials have said such cuts are not enough to prop up  the economy and reduce trade imbalance. They were disappointed  with the scrapping of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  original plan.    It called for a permanent 6 trillion yen tax cut and an  offsetting 7 percent "welfare tax" in three years to replace the  3 percent consumption tax. The U.S. side had pictured tax cuts  worth 18 trillion yen in three years.    The source emphasized that Japan's ruling coalition leaders  agreed to conduct a full-fledged tax reform by year's end, an  accord that won confirmation at a cabinet meeting.    He noted that the G-7 ministers and central bankers are  unlikely to issue a joint statement on macroeconomic policies  and currency rates, but there are chances for the aid to Russia.  Discussions on macroeconomic policies and exchange rates will  be limited to the morning session of the one-day meeting that  kicks off at around 11 A.M., he said.    With each nation presenting its economic measures, there  will  not be much to discuss, he said, indicating pressure on a single  nation is unlikely.    The ministers and central bankers will focus on Russian aid  in the afternoon session and Russian counterparts will join for  about an hour before the meeting ends at around 5 P.M., the  source said. The G-7 nations want to directly confirm economic  reforms since Russian President Boris Yeltsin formed a new  cabinet in the wake of elections last December, he said.    According to latest information, the source said the new  cabinet intends to inherit and continue reforms led by  inflation-curbing economic policies that are the key condition  for multilateral aid from G-7 nations.    Large chunks of aid through the International Monetary Fund  and the World Bank have not been implemented due to Russia's  political and economic uncertainties.    The source said the aid package decided at a G-7 meeting of  finance and foreign ministers last April in Tokyo and upgraded  in a Tokyo summit last July is unlikely to be increased or  changed.    Confirming that Russian policies are in line with the aid  conditions will be the major issue, he noted.    Despite his indication that the aid will be the major topic,  global attention is apparently fixed on currency and trade  issues between Japan and the U.S.    Bilateral trade disputes have escalated since Japan flatly  rejected a U.S. demand for "numerical targets" at a meeting  between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill  Clinton in Washington on February 11. After trade talks failed,  the yen surged more than 6 yen against the dollar on speculation  over the U.S. tolerating a stronger yen.    Japan and the U.S. are now in a "cooling off" period and the  G-7 meeting will be the first top-level one since the summit.  Japanese officials said a possible meeting between Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen has not been scheduled.</p>

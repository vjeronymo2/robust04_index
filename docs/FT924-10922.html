			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's rice may be over-egged - Why donor agencies are urging a policy re-think THE RAINS have fallen early in Indonesia this year, calming fears that the country might slip from its target of self-sufficiency in rice. Once, in the 1970s, the world's biggest importer of rice, in good years Indonesia now has the capacity to export. Despite this success, donor agencies are urging the government to re-think its rice policy. The system of price stabilisation and subsidies should be restructured, they say, with the private sector adopting a greater role in storage and distribution. Estimates for the 1992 crop have been revised upwards as the threat of drought has diminished. The latest forecast from the US Embassy in Jakarta puts the 1992 crop at 29.8m tonnes milled production. Imports for the year are estimated at 650,000 tonnes and exports at 100,000 tonnes. Stocks held by Bulog - the state agency responsible for setting prices, controlling imports and exports and market intervention - are expected to rise by 25 per cent to 1.25m tonnes by the end of the year. Indonesia recently changed its policy of 'lending' rice during surplus seasons to other rice-producing countries, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, on the understanding that the loans can be recalled during periods of deficit. This year the government has switched to exporting on a commercial basis and Bulog recently agreed to sell 200,000 tonnes over this year and next. The US report suggests that competitive FOB prices 'would have to be at least Dollars 50 to Dollars 55 per tonne below production costs when compared with cif Jakarta prices for rice of a similar quality'. This implies a loss on exports and has given ammunition to Bulog's critics, who say that its officials do not always act in Indonesia's national interest. A recent report by the World Bank suggested that the role of Bulog should be modified as part of a gradual reform of agricultural policy. It called for the phasing out of subsidised rice for the military and civil servants, amounting to 1.6m tonnes a year, 'which is often resold on the domestic market at prices well below the government's cost of delivery'. The bank suggests Bulog's marketing functions should be performed by the private sector up to where intervention is required to keep prices in line with the world market. The report paints a bright picture of Indonesia's long-term prospects for maintaining self-sufficiency in rice. Compared to annual growth in demand of 3.7 per cent during the 1980s, it projects an increase in the 1990s of about 2.2 per cent a year. This reflects an expected decline in per capita consumption of rice as average income rises, with consumers buying higher-value commodities such as vegetables and meat. Demand is forecast at between 33m and 34m tonnes in the year 2000, and between 34m and 39m tonnes in 2010. The biggest obstacle to self-sufficiency is the conversion of land away from agricultural use on the island of Java, which accounts for more than half Indonesia's 183m population and is the nation's industrial hub. Java produces 59 per cent of Indonesia's rice but is losing up to 50,000 hectares (125,000 acres), or 1 per cent of its rice paddy, each year. The use of higher yielding varieties and irrigation in areas outside Java should more than offset the loss of land to industry and urbanisation, however. The World Bank is confidently forecasting production surpluses in the next decade (see table). Much will depend, however, on agricultural reform outside the rice sector. For instance, land that could be used for rice production is designated by the government for sugar cane, despite Indonesia lacking a competitive advantage in sugar production. Donors argue that, while sugar refiners benefit from protected prices, farmers are losing out. The same land could grow two crops of high yielding rice for every crop of sugar, boosting the farmer's income and maintaining national self-sufficiency in rice. Vietnam expects to produce a record 23.2m tonnes of rice this year, compared with 22m in 1991, according to an agriculture ministry official, reports Reuter from Hanoi. The country has exported 1.25m tonnes so far this year and is likely to export 2m for the whole year, compared with 1.1m tonnes in 1991, deputy prime minister Phan Van Khai told the National Assembly earlier this month. Agricultural reforms launched in 1987 freed farmers to grow and sell their own produce, transforming Vietnam by 1989 from a rice importer into the world's third biggest rice exporter.  ---------------------------------------------------            INDONESIAN MILLED RICE MARKET                   (million tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------                 1988     1995    2000    2010 Production      27.5     30.3    35.0    41.7 Demand          26.1     30.8    33.7    37.2  --------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

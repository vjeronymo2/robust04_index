			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENSCH BEFORE MOGUL  </P> <P> Perhaps Steven Zipperstein and I did not read the same book (Neal Gabler's "An  Empire of Their Own," Book Review, Nov. 5), but when he singles out Jack Warner  as a humanitarian and leaves out Carl Laemmle, not only does he misread Gabler,  but the facts as well.  </P> <P> Yes, Warner was a movie mogul, but "Uncle Carl" was a warm Jewish mensch first.  </P> <P> Leaving Carl Laemmle out of any discussion of Hollywood, "Where were you while  the Holocaust was going on" is a travesty of omission.  </P> <P> FRED BENDLER  </P> <P> (One of Laemmle's "nephews")  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD  </P></p>

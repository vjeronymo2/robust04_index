			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: 'Rigoletto' in Los Angeles Even two Domingos failed to raise the Los Angeles Music Center Opera's Rigoletto - originally to have been a new production by film director Peter Medak - above routine. Marta Domingo, the famous tenor's (and in this case conductor's) wife, made her American debut as the producer of a beautiful if traditional staging (originally by Zack Brown) borrowed from Washington Opera. At the third performance, neither Domingo seemed to have determined where the accents fall. The distracting business of the page's entrance in Act 2 caused more of a fuss than the jester's 'Cortigiani' moments later. Mrs Domingo confined her innovations to the serving up of Monterone's daughter - on a silver platter born by four courtiers - in the opening scene; conjured the nicest Sparafucile you would ever care to meet; and otherwise monitored safety. Conducting a frequently sluggish Rigoletto, Placido Domingo similarly showed little interest in shaping the score or even regulating instrumental balances, allowing the music's most obvious features to prevail over its subtleties. Unsettling mid-aria tempo shifts kept the singers' eyes glued to the pit. The drama and atmospherics of the final act brought out his best work (as it did Verdi's); and in the conductor's old role, that of the Duke of Mantua, Richard Leech made increasingly ample and attractive sounds, although his arias lacked finish. Justino Diaz's debut in the title role found him lacking the requisite vocal resources. Looking out of place in a jester's costume and trying to appear as disagreeable as possible, he alternately talked and barked the part - until Ann Panagulias's melting 'Tutte le feste' coaxed him into song and involvement. Her exquisite Gilda brought conviction at every appearance and her performance had a galvanising effect on her colleagues. As she approached the tavern, one wanted to call out to her not to go in. By the last act Verdi was back in control and the opera reasserted its power.</p>

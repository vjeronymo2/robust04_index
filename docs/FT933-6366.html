			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Conflicting reactions to Buba decision THE Bundesbank's decision not to cut interest rates gave bourses one reason to backtrack yesterday, although Paris and Madrid managed to ignore it, writes Our Markets Staff. In parallel, there was a note from Kleinwort Benson which, this year, has heavily overweighted continental Europe at the expense of the US. Yesterday KB's chief strategist, Mr Albert Edwards, raised his US weighting from 23 to 30 per cent, and dropped continental Europe by seven percentage points to 16 per cent. Since the beginning of the year, noted Mr Edwards, shares on the continent have risen by 25 per cent, against 5 per cent for the US. However, he said, US earnings are already some 25 per cent off their lows; earnings surprises so far in 1993 have been on the upside; and, on KB's valuation ratios, US equities now look cheap to fair value. FRANKFURT weakened both during market hours, losing hope about interest rates as the DAX index closed 16.63 lower at 1,901.15, and in the post-bourse where the Ibis indicated DAX dropped another 10.50 to 1,890.65. Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM6.8bn. Prominent losers in share price terms included the bourse's top three stocks, Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens, and the three blue chips which put out interim reports yesterday, BASF, Bayer and Volkswagen. Five of those six, noted Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, were major exporters, and vulnerable to weakness in the dollar promoted by German interest rate policy. The interim reports, although grim, were much as expected; Volkswagen, down DM3.70 to DM367.30 on the session and accelerating with a DM6.80 drop to DM360.50 in the post-bourse, seemed to suffer more from cynicism about its recovery prospects. Siemens fell DM9.60 to DM666.40 on the session and by DM6.90 to DM659.50 in London after hours. It had been relatively strong recently, and seemed to attract forward selling from the DTB. ZURICH ended lower as profit-taking evident earlier in the session increased slightly after the Buba decision. UBS bearers, SFr9 lower at SFr1,184, topped the active list and Nestle fell SFr16 to SFr1,101 as the blue-chip, SMI index dropped 27.2 to 2,475.2. PARIS shrugged off the news from Germany, only falling slightly in an immediate reaction, before climbing steadily during afternoon trading. The CAC-40 index closed up 14.30 at 2,173.61, a new high for the year, after a high of 2,180.98 and a low of 2,144.17. Turnover remained good at FFr4.1bn. Brokers at the Paris office of James Capel reported a growing belief that the French authorities would now act quickly to bring domestic interest rates down, particularly as the franc again came under pressure in the currency exchanges. A decision could come as soon as the weekend, they added, noting that the 5-10 day rate was another candidate for trimming from its present 10 per cent level to about 7.75 per cent. Among individual issues Peugeot was one of the few losers on the day, down lost FFr8 to FFr680 in reaction to disappointing results from Renault. AMSTERDAM fell back by over 1 per cent but dealers were not excessively worried that interest rates had been left unchanged. A weaker dollar also contributed to declines in those stocks with a heavy US exposure. The CBS Tendency index slipped 1.5 to 127.5, but off the day's low of 127.3. Unilever dropped Fl 3.30 to Fl 195.90 in reaction, some brokers said, to news that Philip Morris of the US had failed to increase its dividend. Among the day's half year results, Internatio-Muller, the trading and transport group, added Fl 5.50 to Fl 68.50 following good figures, while Hagemeyer, the trading group, gained Fl 2.30 to Fl 98.80 after it saw a 20 per cent rise over the period. KNP BT, the paper group, put on 40 cents to Fl 36.80 as its first half results also exceeded expectations. MADRID tried to apply the brakes, the general index losing nearly three points early in the day; but its momentum reasserted itself and the index actually closed 1.71 higher at its third consecutive 1993 high of 299.52. STOCKHOLM lost ground in spite of better-than-expected interim results from Volvo and Skanska. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 14.3 to 1,251.0 in turnover of SKr2.0bn. Volvo B shares rose SKr8 to SKr454 and Skanska SKr4 to SKr152.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 26                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1308.74     1306.48     1305.45     1302.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1386.27     1383.28     1383.23     1379.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1300.34     1299.34     1298.22     1298.46 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1379.44     1379.45     1380.49     1384.05  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 25    Aug 24    Aug 23    Aug 20    Aug 19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1310.93   1296.82   1291.83   1297.31   1304.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1385.62   1375.46   1374.00   1380.12   1385.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1308.74; 200 - 1386.27 Low/day: 100 - 1296.85  200 - 1377.56.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: New peaks in confident stock market FALLING bond yields, reports of improving business confidence, and expectations of a base rate cut in next week's Budget, touched off a burst of optimism on the London stock market yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index broke through an important testing level to reach another closing high. A final boost to UK shares came when Wall Street opened with a gain of 30 Dow points in early trading. London had earlier responded strongly to the announcement that January had brought the largest rise in domestic consumer credit since July 1991. Equity traders were cheered by indications from a firmer UK government bond market that the credit figures had signalled economic recovery without rekindling inflation fears. However, the stock market was slow to make progress at first and the upswing, when it came, owed much to a powerful squeeze in the stock index futures sector which quickly translated into heavy basket trading between futures and underlying equities. Sellers of the March future on the FT-SE 100 rushed to buy stock in an equity market where marketmakers could find no shares on offer. Until Wall Street opened, London was content to challenge the Footsie testing area of around 2,950. But when New York, also after some hesitation, advanced strongly, UK equities burst through to show a rise of more than 36 points on the FT-SE 100 Index, before settling at 2,957.3 for a gain on the day of 35.2. Also at yet another all-time high was the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 11.8 stronger at 3,119.7. While expressing some caution over the quality of yesterday's advance, equity strategists believed that the stock market is now likely to clear the Footsie 3,000 mark in the near term. However, most expect to see profit-takers appear above that level. Some modest fiscal tightening, perhaps in the form of VAT taxes on food or books, is expected when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his Budget a week today. But the City of London is also confident that the Budget season will also bring a further cut in UK interest rates. Sterling's success in holding above DM2.40 yesterday buttressed confidence that UK interest rates can be reduced, especially if the Bundesbank eases rates further. Optimism on economic recovery was encouraged by reports from the Institute of Directors of increasing confidence in Britain's boardrooms, and inflation worries checked by a prediction from the Confederation of British Industry that manufacturing wage settlements are now running at below 2.5 per cent. Trading volume was good but not outstandingly so, with the day's Seaq total of 653.4m shares, of which about 64 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks, comparing with 860.9m in the previous trading session; Friday's Seaq turnover was worth Pounds 1.42bn at retail level. Some strategists, urging caution, pointed to the potential shocks lurking for the stock market on a company news front still smarting from last week's decision by Barclays to cut the dividend. Rights issue fears also continue to unsettle the stock market, with the signs of renewed takeover interest increasing the chances that predators may come to the equity sector for funding.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TCU FINALLY RUNS OUT OF MIRACLES, 27-21  </P> <P> Texas Christian fell one miracle, two interceptions and six points short, and  it cost the 24th-ranked Horned Frogs the Southwest Conference lead.  </P> <P> "We needed a miracle, but we just couldn't pull one off this time," Coach Jim  Wacker said after the Frogs were upset by Baylor, 27-21, Saturday at Ft.  </P> <P> Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> Baylor used a first-quarter, 78-yard touchdown pass play from J.J. Joe to  Melvin Bonner and two fourth-quarter interceptions to beat TCU, which slipped  into the Top 25 last week after five consecutive victories, three of them of  the come-from-behind variety.  </P> <P> The loss dropped the Horned Frogs to 5-2 overall and 3-1 in the SWC. The Bears  are 4-3-1 and 3-1-1.  </P> <P> The Horned Frogs, trailing by 11 points in the final quarter, pulled within  three with 8:13 left, but their comeback was cut short by a pair of  interceptions.  </P> <P> No. 13 Texas 52, SMU 3 -- The Longhorns (5-1, 3-0) thoroughly dominated  Southern Methodist (1-6, 0-4) at Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> The defense put pressure on SMU's run-and-shoot offense, hard-running freshman  Butch Hadnot scored two touchdowns and Alex Waits had three punts that pinned  the Mustangs at their own six, three and seven in the first half.  </P></p>

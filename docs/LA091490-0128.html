			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOP COLLEGE TEAMS WILL COMPETE IN WATER POLO MEET  </P> <P> Many of the nation's top collegiate water polo teams will join NCAA champion UC  Irvine in an early season tournament today through Sunday at the Marian  Bergeson Pool at Corona del Mar High School.  </P> <P> Top-ranked California, which lost to Irvine in the NCAA finals last year, was  scheduled to compete but withdrew after three students died Saturday in a fire  at a fraternity house where many of the players were members.  </P> <P> Joining fifth-ranked Irvine are No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Stanford, No. 4 Cal State  Long Beach, No. 6 USC, No. 7 Pepperdine, No. 8 UC Santa Barbara, No. 10 Fresno  State, No. 14 UC San Diego and No. 16 Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Irvine, which lost five starters from last year's team, is not expected to  repeat as NCAA champion.  </P> <P> "There is very little chance," said Ted Newland, Irvine coach. "We would have  to be so damn lucky it would be unbelievable. I'm going to be frank -- we  should finish somewhere between fourth and seventh (at the NCAA championships,  later this year)."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Representatives of the current government coalition  have been scaring recipients of compensation that a different  coalition government would not implement the compensation laws  and would not complete the compensation process. It is not  inconceivable that this, too, contributed to the plunge in the  prices of compensation vouchers.    The opposition parties in parliament--the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz],  and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]--explained repeatedly  that they would by all means complete the compensation process;  moreover, they would do so as soon as possible. In reply to  our question, Attila Karoly Soos [SZDSZ] said that recipients of  compensation cannot be robbed of their property yet again. Legal  security also demands that the next government accept, even if  not too happily, the "bequest" of the previous government. Thus,  the Free Democrat representative considers it obvious that a  government coalition which includes the SZDSZ will offer an  appropriate supply of stocks for compensation vouchers.    Should it become part of the government, FIDESZ would also  like to continue the compensation process and complete its  implementation as soon as possible. However, the Young Democrats  do not envision passing a new compensation law either.  Incidentally, in their opinion, after an assessment of  obligations against the state's property, a certain amount of  property should be offered against the compensation vouchers,  which would include stocks not only of the good companies. Then  the price of compensation vouchers would be decided by market  forces.    The MSZP also considers Hungary to be a constitutional  state,  i.e., the Socialists also undertake to implement laws which were  passed earlier. Thus, the MSZP did not vow to repeal the laws on  compensation either.    Thus, the current government coalition would perhaps do  better not to scare recipients of compensation with the prospect  that if the current government falls, recipients of compensation  will not have much going for them, either. Rather they should  perhaps take care to offer more valuable state property for  compensation vouchers. They could also see to it that one does  not have to stand in line for days for one or two stocks, or  they could even enable the recipients of compensation to choose  from the stocks of 10-12 companies at the same time.    This way, the current government coalition might gain more  votes in the election. Because as things stand now, no one is  happy, except for speculators; those who received no  compensation are unhappy because they did not receive any, and  those who did are unhappy because they did. The price of  compensation vouchers is decreasing because of the scarce supply  of stocks and the scare tactics. That is to say, the coalition  parties cannot take advantage of any of their virtues in the  middle of the election campaign. To be sure, it is indisputable  that due to the current government, more than 1 million people  are recipients of compensation. It is also indisputable that up  to now, the government made an effort to maintain the price of  compensation vouchers, which the next government is not likely  to do wholeheartedly even if it completes the compensation  process. In other words, instead of scaremongering, they ought  to act, and then the recipients of compensation would really  trust in the current coalition, and would prove their trust on 8  May.</p>

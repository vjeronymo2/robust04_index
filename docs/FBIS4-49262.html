			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhuhai, May 4 (CNS) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li  Lanqing made a two-day inspection tour of Zhuhai on April 30 and  May 1 accompanied by the Vice Governor of Guangdong Province,  Mr. Liu Weiming, and the Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, Ms. Wu Yi, as well as directors of other  departments under the State Council. During the inspection, Mr.  Li said that the special economic zones (SEZ) should maintain  their special characteristics and get rid of old ideas and seek  more ways for economic development so as to set an example for  China's inland areas.    Mr. Li said that the SEZs should be clear about the distance  between them and conventional international practice. The State  Council planned to set up certain enterprises on a trial basis  in the SEZs to spread their experience in the mainland and see  how they can be run in line with conventional international  practice.    He also said that some reform experiments may proceed first  in such zones as Zhuhai. For example 24-hour customs service  with Macao and large-scale bonded zones set up in Zhuhai should  be considered.    Following his inspection of key projects in Zhuhai such as  harbours, the airport and railways, Mr. Li said that Zhuhai had  shown a fast speed of construction and he hoped for a better  investment environment there to attract a high level of foreign  capital.</p>

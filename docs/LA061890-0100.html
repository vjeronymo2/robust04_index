			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BIAS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH PERILS WOMEN, HOUSE TOLD  </P> <P> Government medical research is so sexually biased that even male laboratory  rats are the preferred animal for studies, according to congressional testimony  today.  </P> <P> "What it's really saying is, it's OK to put women's health at risk," Rep.  Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on  Health and the Environment.  </P> <P> She was among critics who say clinical trials and the resulting data are skewed  in favor of men.  </P> <P> The lack of gender-specific data "communicates to doctors that women really  aren't that much at risk," she said. As a result, women's problems often aren't  taken seriously until they reach a critical stage.  </P> <P> The National Institutes of Health has a $7.6-billion research budget this year.  An NIH advisory committee reported in 1987 that less than 14% of the  institute's budget went to women's health issues even though women make up more  than half the population, Schroeder said.  </P> <P> Only $17 million is spent on basic breast cancer research annually, and less  than 2% of NIH grants for research went to obstetric and gynecological programs  in 1986 and 1987, she said.  </P> <P> Heart disease and cancers of the lung and breast are the top killers of women.  </P></p>

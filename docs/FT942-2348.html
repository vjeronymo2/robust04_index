			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Wyndham's Theatre David Storey's 1970 play 'Home', a Royal Court classic, returns to London tomorrow when it opens at Wyndham's. The parts originally played by Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud are now taken by Richard Briers and Paul Eddington. This is the third time Eddington has stepped into a Gielgud-created role. Having appeared beside Gielgud in the original staging of Alan Bennett's 'Forty Years On', he later took the Gielgud role at Chichester; and two years ago, he and Harold Pinter took the Gielgud and Richardson roles in Pinter's 'No Man's Land'.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Swiss investment group in cash call BK Vision, a Swiss financial investment company, is raising SFr480m (Dollars 327.42) in its third rights issue in less than two years. The company also revealed in its 1993 annual report that it had reduced its stake in CS Holding, the financial group built around Credit Suisse, and that Rolex, the Geneva watchmaking group, was one of its leading shareholders. Mr Martin Ebner, chairman, said the rights issue, which follows a SFr220m call last July and a SFr200m one in August, 1992, was a response to market demand. BK shares are trading at a 13.5 per cent premium to their net asset value. The company said proceeds of the one-for-four issue at SFr1,600 per bearer share, SFr320 per registered share, would be used for investment. Thanks to the strong performance of thebank and its insurance company shares, BK had a spectacular year. Net asset value jumped 74.5 per cent to SFr1.3bn, or SFr1,696 per share, at year-end, while the bearer shares nearly doubled to SFr2,000. Gross income soared to SFr366.3m from SFr62.8m, mainly as a result of disposals of Leu Holding and Banca del Gottardo shares. Administration expenses, mainly performance-related commission fees paid to BZ Trust, the company's manager, soared to SFr250.1m from SFr6.5m. BK continued to build its stake in Union Bank of Switzerland, where it isnow by far the largest single shareholder with 9.6 per cent of the total equity, worth SFr1.8bn at the end of last year. UBS shares account for 69.3 per cent of BK's portfolio. It reduced its stake in CS Holding, which it acquired inan exchange for its Leu Holding shares in November. Mr Ebner said he did not believe it was right for BK to become a substantial shareholder in two large Swissbanks. In line with last year's amendments to Swiss company law, the annual report revealed that Rolex Holding was the main partner of BZ Group in controlling BK Vision. The two each hold 27.8 per cent of the registered shares (10 per cent of the total capital). Rolex, owned by the Wilsdorf Foundation, would saynothing about its investment.</p>

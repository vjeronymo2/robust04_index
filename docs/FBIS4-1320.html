			<p>BFN     [Text] It's been reported from Pietersburg, Gazankulu,  Venda, and Lebowa that voting has been hampered by a lack of  ballot papers and equipment. Reports say that people have  traveled far and are waiting to vote. The commissioner of the  QwaQwa police, Major General Jaap Venter, has made an urgent  appeal for ordinary voters not to travel to polling stations for  special votes today. Gen. Venter said that thousands of people  had arrived at the seven polling stations in the area, thinking  that they could vote today.</p>

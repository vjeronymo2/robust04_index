			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Pergau funds repaid early Almost half the controversial subsidised loan provided by the UK government for the Malaysian Pergau Dam project has been repaid early. Tenaga Nasional, the Malaysian electricity authority, yesterday repaid Pounds 140m of the Pounds 305m loan around 10 years ahead of schedule. As a result the UK government will recoup Pounds 9.3m of the Pounds 255.3m cash costs of subsidising the loan. This represents savings for the government of the 'margin' it pays to the commercial banks which administer the loan, according to officials. However, Tenaga is continuing to enjoy the full benefit of the UK government subsidy. The UK government has been criticised by MPs for giving too much of its aid budget to the Pergau project and for using the promise of aid to win a substantial defence contract.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Sayyid Husayn Fadlallah has said that  President Hafiz al-Asad has a clear strategy and is not one of  those who take their cue from the U.S. President. Fadlallah  said Clinton is doing 90 percent of Israel's bidding in the  region; the United States has no Middle East policy, but merely  follows Israel's. So, we do not believe Clinton would do much  for the oppressed Arabs and Palestinians.</p>

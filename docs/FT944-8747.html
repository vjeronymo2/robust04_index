			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: Peter Sellars's 'Merchant of Venice' - Theatre It was to be predicted that Sellars's staging of The Merchant of Venice would prove slow, post-modern, agenda-ridden, Americanophobe, heavy-handed, poorly performed, insensitive, untheatrical, unspontaneous, unShakespearean, and unoriginal; and so it proved. (About one-fifth of the audience left at the interval.) But - unlike, say, the Dusseldorf Romeo and Juliet - this is not merely another terrible staging. Watching the Sellars Merchant is like staring into a nightmare of the future. You may not be surprised to hear that his Venice is Californian, and his Shylock black. Or that, in the trial-scene speech on 'purchas'd slaves', Shylock intones the single phrase 'Let them be free]' three times (Shylock as Martin Luther King - natch) - while videos show us President Bush apparently urging on the cops to smash Black Power demonstrations. As usual, Sellars is bending works of art to suit his own unyielding agenda: ie to broadcast his own PC guilt at white supremacism, and to express his own convictions that the Americanisation of world culture is destructive. The problem, it must be stressed, is not Sellars's agenda but the dull crudity with which he bashes it home. He works not as an artist but as a demagogue. (The notion that Shylock is more sinned against than sinning - scarcely new - was central to David Thacker's recent RSC production.) It is interesting that - as in Jude Kelly's haunting West Yorkshire Playhouse staging in March - Sellars maximises the homosexuality of the Antonio-Bassanio relationship, and underlines the angst that afflicts Portia when she realises what she has married into. And he takes some of them further. But, whereas Kelly's emotional drama was as taut as a thriller, Sellars makes it monolithic. As always, his conception of character is one-dimensional. As always, he seems to dislike virtually every character onstage. Antonio is the worst villain, of course, being chief capitalist manipulator. But Portia is lachrymose from start to end. (When she and Nerissa snap into a bit of rap as they prepare to don men's clothes, it is a mere shtick, true to nothing in her character elsewhere.) Shylock is a solemn, orthodox bore, and at his dullest when (twice) he breaks down about Jessica's defection. 'Hath not a Jew eyes?' is delivered straight to a video-camera, and relayed on the 15 screens dotted around the stage and auditorium; very measured, it sounds like something Shylock had said a million times before. Nothing here is spontaneous. Sellars keeps making speeches sound deliberately phoney. Antonio's friends and Portia's suitors are image-conscious, forever addressing video monitors. Salerio, Solanio and others keep turning into TV reporters. Sellars is, presumably, making points here about the terrible way in which modern living is indeed being geared for perpetual broadcast. (A few of them are funny, as when Salerio-Solanio do one duet scene like a creepy pair of breakfast TV hosts.) But, since he has all his actors speak with microphones heavily amplifying almost everything, so that they sound broadcast-oriented and pre-recorded, he commits the sin he satirises. Meanwhile, the immediacy of poor Shakespeare's lines is wholly ignored. Live theatre has never felt less live than in Sellars's hands. Yet the fact that Sellars has zero sense of Shakespeare is, in this context, a minor felony. He is, after all, only treating the Bard the same way that he has been treating Aeschylus, Handel, Mozart, et al. No, Sellars's main crimes are not against artistic text but against human spirit. The dreary inflexibility of each stage character, the deliberate lack of spontaneity in his world, the relentless wise-guy irony of his every production, the appalling need to twist ambiguous texts to make monotonously white-guilt and Americanophobe points: these factors are symptomatic of the worst tendencies of our increasingly politically-correct and post-modern era. They express a kind of modern cultural Stalinism that - though it intends merely to oppose the worst of Eurocentric traditions - is actually hostile to civilised values. I do not exaggerate when I say the following: to watch Sellars's work, like that of the choreographer William Forsythe, is to feel that the next dark age is already upon us. Barbican Theatre until Saturday.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / People: Midland board shuffle Now that MIDLAND BANK is a subsidiary of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Group, its board is beginning to contract to fit along familiar lines in wholly-owned companies. Three non-executives - Sir Peter Leslie, deputy chairman, Jefferson Cunningham, and Sir Eric Pountain - left the Midland board last week. Sir Peter is to be replaced as deputy chairman by Geoffrey Maitland Smith (left), chairman of Sears, and a Midland director since 1986. Charles McKay (right), chief executive of Inchcape, joins the board as a non-execu tive director on November 12. The most significant appointment, however, is that of John Strickland, executive director of HSBC Holdings and the head of information technology in the group, as a Midland director from next January. Strickland is the architect of Hongkong Bank's world famous computer system which is reckoned to be among the most effective to be found anywhere. His place on the board will presumably help him to carry out his pledge to integrate Midland's systems with those of its new parent group over the next five years, cutting costs and staff while making a drastic improvement in operating efficiency.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Danish minister angers Greek MEPs MR Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, outgoing Danish foreign minister, yesterday provoked uproar in the European parliament when he called on Greece to stop blocking EC efforts to reach agreement on recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Greek MEPs denounced Mr Ellemann-Jensen's statement as a 'moral and ethical disgrace' and said he had cast a slur on the Greek nation. The stormy reaction threatened to bring to a head the simmering dispute within the Community on how to resolve the Macedonia question. In Athens, the Greek government called an emergency cabinet meeting and asked the next EC Council of Ministers to consider censuring Mr Ellemann-Jensen for 'unacceptable' conduct before the parliament. But Mr Ellemann-Jensen, who will stand down after 10 years as Denmark's foreign minister when a new government forms in Copenhagen, remained unrepentant. It was time to 'wash out the wound' of Macedonia by supporting moves in the UN Security Council to give Macedonia a seat in the UN General Assembly, he said. The Community was 'growing weary' of the Greek government's obstructions. 'Greece feels threatened by Macedonia despite being in the EC and Nato. I feel this is unacceptable because it shows a lack of trust in these organisations,' he said. The EC has tried for more than a year to reach a common position on recognition, but Greece has resisted on the grounds that it could provoke territorial claims on its northern province of Macedonia. Denmark, which took over the rotating presidency of the European Community in the New Year, has pressed for recognition so that much-needed humanitarian and financial aid can reach the republic which is caught between hostile neighbours, Serbia and Greece. The fracas over Macedonia overshadowed the parliament's debate on Yugoslavia and news of the Bosnian-Serbs agreement to the Vance-Owen peace plan. Mr Ellemann-Jensen and Mr Hans van den Broek, the new EC commissioner for external affairs, both warned that the next step must be to enforce the peace plan's provisions. If the parties in former Yugoslavia failed to abide, further pressure would be forthcoming, including the total diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and possible military action.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- In an interview with CTK  today, Chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss  avoided answering directly the question concerning the screening  of SDL ministers. "The screening requires a certain procedure.  We suppose that President (Michal Kovac) had checked the  question before appointing new government members," Weiss said.    The screening law, passed by the Czechoslovak Parliament in  1991, bars people linked to the former communist-run StB secret  police, high Communist Party officials and members of the  People's Militia from high government and economic posts until  1996. The screening procedure is carried out by the Interior  Ministry which issues certificates on whether or not a person  was among those listed by the law.    According to the legislative department of the Presidential  Office, the president is legally bound to have all govenrment  nominees screened. This was also done in the case of the  government of Jozef Moravcik, but it is not president's duty to  announce the result, department officials told CTK. In  connection with emerging speculations about "possible problems  of one of the cabinet members with the screening law," Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed in today's issue of the daily  NARODNA OBRODA that in line with the law he had asked for the  screening of all members of his government.    A representative of Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia  (DEUS) assured CTK today that none of the ministers who are DEUS  members had problems with the screening law. "Not a single DEUS  candidate for a ministerial post was screened positively," DEUS  spokeswoman Gabriela Nemkyova said.    Weiss also told CTK that "there was no connection between  the  SDL's unwillingness to support the original proposal to appoint  Roman Kovac Slovak Prime Minister and the proposal for his  dismissal sumbitted to the parliament last week by Deputy Dusan  Masiar from the (opposition) Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS)."    (Considering the suitable candidate for the post of prime  minister in mid-March), "we thought that the prime minister  should be an internationally known and accepted politician. We  reached the conclusion that Jozef Moravcik would be capable of  better integrating the heterogenous coalition," Weiss said. At  a press conference today, Weiss announced that at the next  meeting of the coalition council he wanted to take up again the  question of breaching the coalition agreement by DEUS.    In April, Moravcik was elected DEUS chairman. Under the  agreement he cannot be simultaneously party chairman and prime  minister. "In view of the forthcoming election campaign, DEUS  has been put into advantage," Weiss stressed, adding he had  twice discussed the issue with Moravcik by phone.    The elections are to be held on September 30-October 1.</p>

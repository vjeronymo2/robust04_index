			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 19 November, Toshiba Corporation announced that  by successfully making a product out of a freezer unit with  cooling capability down to the temperature of liquid helium  (absolute temperature 4.2K, or -269C), it had developed a  small-scale superconducting magnet (see photo [omitted]) that  does not use liquid helium. Until now, a niobium-titanium  (Nb-Ti) superconducting magnet could not be used because direct  cooling type freezers could not freeze below 10K. However,  cooling down to 4.2K has become possible with the new freezer,  and the size of the container also has been reduced to about  one-third of existing units, so that a high magnetic field of 6  tesla can be created in a large-diameter (internal diameter 18  centimeters), normal temperature space. Toshiba claims that this  will broaden substantially the sectors of commercial application  of superconducting magnets.    The superconducting magnet system developed by Toshiba  incorporates a small-scale freezer unit, which is a modification  of the Gifford McMahon (GM) freezer that is used most widely  today. Existing freezers could not cool below 10K, so it was  necessary to use Nb[.sup]3[/], tin, etc., but on this  occasion, cooling down to the 4K level was realized by such  steps as finding magnetic material with high specific heat at  temperatures below 10K for use as heat storing material.    In addition, an oxide superconductor, which has little heat  conduction and feeds current even in strong magnetic fields, was  used for the power lead through which current is fed to the  superconducting coil, and this led to reduction of cooling  temperature.    Because of this, it has become possible to realize a  small-scale, high magnetic field with a Nb-Ti superconducting  magnet, the most popular type that used to require liquid helium  cooling, even by using a direct cooling type freezer.    The container that houses the magnet is 65 centimeters (cm)  wide, 50 cm deep and 49 cm high, as small as a 25 cm television,  and use has been simplified to just switching on the freezer.    Toshiba maintains that almost all superconducting magnets  for  both industrial and research use can be used with this freezer,  and that the process can be freed from the complicated liquid  helium cooling method.</p>

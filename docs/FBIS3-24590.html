			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. I. Furman, Aerokos Asoication, Ukraine; UDC </F> 551.507.352:504.064.36]    [Abstract] An L-410 UVP-E aircraft has been refitted to be  a flying laboratory for ecological monitoring. This aircraft  differs from an L-410 in its increased payload capacity,  increased flight duration, and increased altitude ceiling.  Five-blade propellers make it more efficient and quieter. It can  fly at low altitudes (70-300 m) and up to 5000 m at a relatively  low flight speed (210-350 km/hr). Additional fuel tanks enable  five hours of flight without refueling. This aircraft costs a  factor of 4-5 less to operate than an An-30. It is equipped with  instruments for gamma ray studies (using scintillation  detectors), thermal sensing, and spectral analysis (to study  chemical pollution). In-flight processing is possible with the  use of personal computers. The aircraft has been used to compile  computer maps of the gamma ray background of a 30 km zone around  the Chernobyl and Zaporozh atomic energy plants. Thermal  radiation studies have been done using real-time infrared  surveying. Figures 2</p>

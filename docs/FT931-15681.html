			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Nicaragua devalues to lift economy NICARAGUA has devalued its currency in an attempt to boost the economy and raise exports. The US dollar will now fetch 6 rather than 5 cordobas, ending almost two years of a fixed exchange rate. This represents a devaluation of 16.66 per cent for external purposes, using the International Monetary Fund's method of calculation. The cordoba will slide to a year-end target of 6.30 to the dollar. The devaluation was provoked by last year's anaemic growth of 0.5 per cent, lower-than-expected coffee prices, and delays in promised US aid. It was accompanied by measures to stimulate foreign and domestic investment, and higher tariffs on imports of luxury goods. President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro heralded a shift in economic policy when she told the National Assembly that social issues would be a priority of the government this year and partly blamed her austere economic policies for rising poverty and unemploy-ment. Economic policy would, in future, be aimed at 'reactivation in solidarity with the poor, unemployed and the population affected by Nicaragua's drought,' she said. The fixed exchange rate, coupled with a balanced budget, had helped Nicaragua reduce inflation from 7,000 per cent in 1990 to 3.8 per cent last year. But per capita income has declined for the past nine years, and some 60 per cent of the adult population is underemployed or jobless. The shift in economic policy may be intended to appease the left-wing Sandinista party, on whose support Mrs Chamorro depends and which has been critical of the government's orthodox economic policy. Over the weekend Mrs Chamorro appointed three Sandinistas to her cabinet. The conservative coalition that helped Mrs Chamorro to office, and which has since been bitterly critical of her reconciliation with the Sandinistas, formally abandoned her over the weekend and boycotted the opening of the National Assembly. On Saturday, Vice-President Virgilio Godoy led a march through Managua demanding Mrs Chamorro's resignation.</p>

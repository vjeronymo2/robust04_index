			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Mercury records 34% improvement to Pounds 155m A STRONG performance from Mercury Communications boosted the year-end results of Cable and Wireless. The subsidiary increased trading profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 155m (Pounds 116m) in the 12 months to March 31, on increased sales of Pounds 915m (Pounds 702m). Group pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 644m (Pounds 609m). Lord Young, chairman, said Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, had done a 'smashing job' in proposing that BT cut the average level of its prices by 7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation, against 6.25 points at present. 'This is as good as we could have hoped for,' he said. 'It will prevent BT from putting up their domestic prices where they have no real competition.' Mercury is committed to increasing the number of residential customers from 200,000 to 2m by the year 2000. In total it has 781,000 lines. It is also restructuring its sales and network management to work closely with cable TV operators. Margins in 1991 rose in spite of a 10 per cent cut in international prices. The company's share of the UK international market increased from 14 to 18 per cent. Mercury has now captured 31 per cent of international calls to Japan and 32 per cent to Switzerland. From next January a BT-style pricing regime will affect group operations in Hong Kong. Its 58.4 per cent-owned HongKong Telecom has agreed to a one-off 8 per cent reduction in international charges in the first year, followed by a 2 per cent cut in each of the next two years. The rules allow the subsidiary to increase domestic charges by inflation minus 4 per cent. With inflation running at 10 per cent prices are likely to continue to rise. Lord Young dismissed the threat of competition - due in the 2006. Its local services are free and the group charges residential customers monthly rental of just Pounds 5. HongKong Telecom increased trading profit by 28 per cent to Pounds 475m (Pounds 370m) on sales of Pounds 1.37bn (Pounds 1.1bn). Its international traffic rose by 15 per cent, while traffic between Hong Kong and South China increased by 35 per cent. Group trading profit increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 727m (Pounds 572m). Lord Young said growth in the current half would prove even better.</p>

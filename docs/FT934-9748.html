			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: VW sets up financial services subsidiary VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest automobile manufacturer, is setting up a new financial services subsidiary with the aim of obtaining better financing conditions for the group's leasing and other financial services activities. Volkswagen Financial Services, as the company is to be known, will bring together the number of individual financial services companies that Volkswagen operates and will have direct access to international capital markets. 'The new company will make it much easier to access the most favourable financing rates available on world markets,' Volkswagen said yesterday. 'The result will be a significant reduction of refinancing costs and an improvement in the return on the capital committed to the financial services business.' The group said yesterday the new company would be used to finance the high liquidity requirements of the group's financial services activities. Since the group established a separate financial services division in 1989, the balance sheet size of these activities has grown from DM14bn (Dollars 8.6bn) to DM22bn. Unlike VW's mainstream automobile manufacturing activities, the division is profitable, making DM270m pre-tax profits last year, up from DM120m in 1989. Volkswagen said yesterday profits are set to increase again this year. The new company is to be formed from the merger of financing companies in France, the UK, Italy, Spain and the former Czechoslovakia as well as Germany. Outside Germany the existing companies operate in tandem with the national VW importer.</p>

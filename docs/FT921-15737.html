			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Data group merger values rise THE VALUE of mergers and acquisitions among UK information-services companies rose by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 669m from Pounds 645m in 1990, compared with a peak of Pounds 1.1bn in 1988. The number of transactions, 102, was down on both 1988 (120) and 1990 (138), according to the figures compiled by Broadview Associates, a firm of financial advisers. Broadview argues that the rise in total value when the economy and the information-services industry are in difficulties underlines the importance of mergers and acquisitions as a vehicle for growth in the sector. The proportion of deals financed through shares rose from 8 per cent in 1990 to 18 per cent, but cash continued to be the main instru-ment. The four largest transactions accounted for 56 per cent of the total value of deals: Electronic Data Systems bought SD-Scicon for Pounds 162m; First Data Resources, an American Express subsidiary, bought Signet for Pounds 100m; a management buy-out at Thorn EMI Software created Data Sciences, valued at Pounds 82m; ACT Group purchased Quotient for Pounds 27.4m.</p>

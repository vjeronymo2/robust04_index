			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 750m ticket tipped for MFI THE BUILD-UP to the planned July flotation of MFI, the furniture group with heavy debts going back to a 1987 management buy-out, has gathered momentum with the issuing of new forecasts for profits and potential market value. County NatWest, which is advising the company on the flotation, estimated that trading profit for the 12 months to the end of April was Pounds 70m, up from Pounds 48.6m, and forecast Pounds 100m for this year. CNW said that if the group were given a rating in line with the stores sector, its market value would be Pounds 750m. An important assumption is that the flotation proceeds will reduce the group's debts of about Pounds 500m to Pounds 100m, giving annualised interest costs of little more than Pounds 10m. In 1990-91 interest payments totalled nearly Pounds 80m, sending the group to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 24m. It took on debt of Pounds 491m in 1987 during the buy-out from Asda which valued the group at Pounds 718m. Asda retains a 25 per cent stake. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said Pounds 20m was paid off before a refinancing in August 1989. Borrowings went back up to Pounds 503m, which is the figure expected in the April 1992 accounts. Since then a further Pounds 15m has been paid off. Mr Hunt and other directors, who own 3 per cent of the company, and 350 managers, could gain several million pounds from the flotation, depending on the value. MFI, with about 13 per cent of the UK furniture market, has benefited from the collapse of such rivals as Lowndes Queensway and ELS, while Magnet, another highly geared buy-out, has run into severe difficulties. Mr Hunt said MFI had improved its operating margins without raising prices by increasing efficiency and through turnover growth in the second half of the year. CNW estimates sales of Pounds 640m compared with Pounds 620.7m. Mr Hunt hoped that after the flotation the number of banks involved in lending money to the group could be reduced from 39 to three. The pathfinder prospectus and full-year results are expected to be announced on June 11.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXERCISE THE MIND  </P> <P> Question: People who have exercised all of their lives and who continue to  exercise into their 60s and later are in much better physical condition than  the kinds of people who fall into the couch-potato category. This is so obvious  that no one should be surprised by it. But what about the mind? Does using the  brain help a person stay sharp as he gets older? If so, what kind of mental  exercise would be helpful?  </P> <P> Answer: The admonition "use it or lose it" applies to the mind as well as to  the body. A person who wants to remain mentally sharp requires mental  stimulation, and if the person no longer works, the stimulation, obviously,  must come from somewhere other than a job.  </P> <P> Finding sources of mental stimulation is not a difficult task. Libraries  contain interesting and challenging material, and so do newspapers and  periodicals. An individual seeking food for the mind does not have to look very  far.  </P> <P> Being with people can also be mentally stimulating. Many communities offer  lectures and other programs that meet both a social and intellectual need. The  theater, concerts, even athletic events serve the same purpose. And just  because you may never have been interested in such programs is no reason not to  participate in them now. It's never too late to develop new interests.  </P></p>

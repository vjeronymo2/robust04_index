Dr. Hamid  al-Ghabid, now in Pakistan, renewed the offer of the OIC to  assist and facilitate a political process in Afghanistan. He  said the OIC is prepared to play a meaningful role in promoting  an intra-Afghan peace process without precondition. However, he  said effective cessation of hostilities and observance of  cease-fire are essential to enable the organization, and friends  of Afghanistan, to help Afghan brothers overcome this tragic  phase.    The OIC Secretary General Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid had a meeting  with the president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, in  Islamabad today. They discussed the major issues of concern to  the OIC including Kashmir and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dr. Hamid  al-Ghabid also had a meeting with the NWFP [North West Frontier  Province] Governor Major General Retired Khurshid Ali Khan in  Peshawar, and discussed with him matters relating to the affairs  of Muslim ummah [community] as well as of bilateral interests.</p>

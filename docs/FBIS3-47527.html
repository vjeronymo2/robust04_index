Arevalo] </F>   [Excerpt] Zamboanga City -- A cease fire agreement between  the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)  will be signed in Cotabato City today or tomorrow, depending on  the availability of Nur Misuari, MNLF chairman who is reportedly  still in Jolo, Sulu.    The joint cease fire committee, led by Marine Brig. Gen.  Guillermo Ruiz and Maj. Gen. Abdul Sarim of the MNLF, drew up  the agreement after three days of meeting here last 5 to 7  January.    Both panels agreed that a joint cease fire monitoring office  will be set up here to monitor, review, and evaluate violations  of the cease fire pact.    Sub-monitoring offices will be set up in the 13 provinces of  Mindanao where the cease fire is in effect.    Ruiz said "the ground rules of the accord will be in effect.  The MNLF will not be allowed to recruit fighters. It will also  be banned from training fighters during the cease fire. MNLF  rebels will be prohibited from carrying guns outside identified  MNLF areas."    He added "there will be no acts of terrorism or violence  while the cease fire is in effect."    "On the other hand, government forces will not be allowed to  conduct military operations against MNLF rebels. There will no  naval gunfire or shelling of pinpointed rebel areas. However,  Philippine National Police (PNP) operations against criminals  will continue," Ruiz said.    If criminals hide in MNLF areas, the Armed Forces of the  Philippines (AFP) will pursue them -- with the MNLF's help, he  added.    The cease fire agreement will be signed by the joint peace  panel represented by Manuel Yan, former ambassador to Thailand  and AFP chief of staff, representing the government and Misuari  for the MNLF.    The AFP and the PNP will provide security for Misuari when  he  and his group will travel to Cotabato and other provinces of  Mindanao. [passage omitted]</p>

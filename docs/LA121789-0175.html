			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT ON EASTERN EUROPE;  </P> <P> THE CURTAIN RISES  </P> <P> It was a year of upheaval and raw emotion, spectacle and collapse. For the  nations of the East Bloc, it was a year that neither those in power nor those  outside it could even vaguely have imagined.  </P> <P> In five of the bloc's six countries -- Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,  Bulgaria and Hungary -- a peaceful revolution of historic magnitude broke the  spine of communism.  </P> <P> The Curtain Rises: Eastern Europe, 1989, a special 14-page report in today's  editions, explains and analyzes the events that have led to this new-found  freedom with such breathtaking swiftness.  </P> <P> Step by step, the report takes you through this amazing tale of refugee flight,  political maneuvering and street protests by hundreds of thousands -- and in  the process looks at how Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev unleashed the  forces of reform in the East Blocand what lies ahead in the perilous 1990s.  </P> <P> See Section Q  </P></p>

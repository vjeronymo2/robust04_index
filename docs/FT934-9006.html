			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Observer: Scorer Fisons is used to losing at molecular roulette - its record of developing new drugs is lamentable. But management must be wondering about the fickleness of lady luck following the decision of a member of its UK salesforce to spill the beans to the Sunday Times about some allegedly dubious promotional practices. The subsequent article suggested the representative, David Thomas, resigned from Fisons because of unethical selling tactics. Not mentioned was the fact that Thomas could only afford to leave the company, and so make the revelations, because he had just won a six-figure sum on the football pools.</p>

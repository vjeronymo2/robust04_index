			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: SA copper producer's profits fall PALABORA Mining, the copper producer in the RTZ group, saw net profits fall to R88.7m (Dollars 26.3m) in the six months to June from R106.8m in the same period of 1992. The result was, however, higher than forecast. Turnover at the north-eastern Transvaal mine fell to R520.4m from R534.4m and operating profit was 20 per cent lower at R161.4m, against R202.1m. Net profit was boosted by a R10.6m extraordinary item, the result of tax changes. The 1992 results included a similar figure. The company said the results were affected by reduced sales of copper cathodes, due to lower production, offset partly by a slightly weaker rand. The average copper price for the year to date was R6,692 per tonne, compared with the 1992 level of R6,434 per tonne. Lower production was due to reduced ore grades and inventory movements. Copper sold, including metal in concentrates, was 59,492 tonnes, 10,077 tonnes below last year's sales of 69,569 tonnes for the same period. The company is looking at whether it will be feasible to operate an underground mine when the open pit life comes to an end after the turn of the century. The study is due to be completed in 1994.</p>

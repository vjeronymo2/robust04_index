			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (18): The nearly man of 1988 - Cuauhtemoc Cardenas IN THE unlikely event that the Institutional Revolutionary Party does not provide the next president, the man most likely to be head of state is Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. He bears the surname of the man who remains one of the country's most revered presidents: his father Lazaro, who nationalised the oil industry. In a political elite dominated by the descendants of the Spanish, Mr Cardenas is clearly of Indian stock - a tremendous electoral asset in this predominantly mestizo country. Mr Cardenas was narrowly defeated in the fraud-marred 1988 elections which brought President Carlos Salinas to power, and believes he was cheated of victory. The level of animosity between the president and Mr Cardenas is high: the latter can barely bring himself to mention the president's name. The rise of Mr Salinas and the technocrats in the PRI during the 1980s spelt an end to Mr Cardenas's political career in the ruling party. As a result, he and others defected to present a left-of-centre alternative to the increasing market orientation of the PRI. Yet after his being so close to victory in 1988, Mr Cardenas's Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), has performed badly. It made a poor showing in the 1991 elections and received a blow in losing to the PRI the state of Michoacan. There has also been internecine squabbling and its ability to deliver votes may have suffered. Despite these losses, Mr Cardenas and the party have played an important role as a goad to the administration, putting pressure on the government to open the political system and improve the conduct of elections. This has been partly successful, even though Mr Cardenas himself dismisses the administration's reforms as a 'backward step'. The access of government and the opposition to the media remains heavily loaded against the opposition: Mr Cardenas was interviewed by Televisa, Mexico's biggest private television network, last month for the first time in five years. While publicly condemning the government, Mr Cardenas received the minister of interior, Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, to talk over electoral reforms. The talks concentrated on attempts to ensure that independent individuals - rather than, as Mr Cardenas would see them, PRI apparatchiks - were appointed to the electoral commissions overseeing the elections at federal and state level. The fact that they failed means almost certainly that, should Mr Cardenas lose, he will refuse to accept the victory of the PRI as legitimate. Nonetheless, Mr Cardenas is as aware as anyone that the world has changed significantly since 1988. He has toned down his anti-US rhetoric and has been careful in his comments about the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'We have good relations with all countries, including the US,' he said in an interview. He did, however, make the point that Nafta has been negotiated on the assumption that the three economies are equal. In fact, Mexico's economy needs greater support because it is demonstrably weaker than that of the US and Canada. He was critical of the administration's economic policies, saying they have resulted in unemployment and a fall in living standards. 'Where are the results of the great economic project?. We have a concentration of economic power, weak growth, a growing current account deficit and a fragile economic situation. 'It's not sufficient to leave all this to the forces of the market,' he said. Investment should be oriented 'to the key sectors of the economy', which could be done both through the private and the public sector, in the latter case, for example, using existing state development banks. On privatisation, he said: 'We see neither privatisation nor nationalisation as ideological questions.' However, he added that the transparency of some of the Salinas administration's privatisations was in doubt, and his government would examine the propriety of the sales to see if action was necessary. The country's foreign debt remains a problem, he said. 'We have to renegotiate the debt which remains too heavy a burden for the economy.' Mr Cardenas has yet to gain much headway in the opinion polls. Nonetheless, the campaign has hardly begun. If as expected, the right-of-centre PAN puts up a weak presidential candidate, Mr Cardenas could once again expect to be the focus of the protest vote against the government.</p>

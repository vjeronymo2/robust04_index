			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> INTERIM POLICE CHIEF NAMED  </P> <P> Former Anaheim Police Chief Jimmie Kennedy will take over next week as interim  chief of the Claremont Police Department, City Manager Glenn Southard has  announced.  </P> <P> Kennedy, who retired as police chief in Anaheim in 1987 after 30 years on the  force, will oversee the Claremont Police Department until the city hires a  permanent replacement for Dexter Atkinson, who resigned last month. Last year,  Kennedy served a 6-month stint as interim police chief of Rancho Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Atkinson had been on paid administrative leave since August, pending the  outcome of investigations by the city and the district attorney's office. He  resigned Dec. 6 after reaching a settlement with the city that included a  $60,000 severence payment.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lawrence Mason found insufficient evidence to prosecute  Atkinson. Southard did not disclose the findings of the city's investigation,  which focused on the police chief's administration of the department.  </P> <P> The city has begun a nationwide search for a permanent police chief, who will  be chosen within the next six months, Southard said.  </P></p>

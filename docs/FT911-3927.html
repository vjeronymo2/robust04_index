			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (12): The high price of top performance - Supercomputers, a faster rate of change AFTER only 12 years service at the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Establishment, the world's first modern day supercomputer is already an antique. The Cray 1A, the pioneering computer designed by Seymour Cray after he founded Cray Research in the mid-1970s, has been consigned to a disused aircraft hangar used by the London Science Museum to store exhibits. Donated to the Museum by the Cray company, it will eventually be displayed as part of the Computing Collection. Weighing eight tonnes and operating at 160m floating point operations a second (Flops), a measure of supercomputing performance, it cost Pounds 8m in 1979. Now it is: 'Outdated, large and expensive for what it does by modern standards' according to the Science Museum's Mr Peter Bailes. Today's top of the range Cray, the YMP-8 with eight processors weighs considerably less, operates at a peak of 2.5bn flops and costs about Dollars 20m. The Cray 1A was designed to stand alone; Cray's newest machines are built for what Mr John Rollwagen, the company's chief executive, calls 'network supercomputing'; providing number crunching capability as part of a network of smaller computers. The rapid advances in technology which have so quickly dated the Cray 1A, have also changed the shape of the supercomputer business. Only a few years ago, there were two dominant manufacturers, Cray and Control Data of the US, supplying a tiny group of customers who both needed the power and could afford the price of the fastest available computing hardware. Today, the same customers - meteorologists, oil exploration organisations, aerospace companies and automobile manufacturers - still need supercomputer performance. Peugeot SA, for example, an organisation comprising the two French automobile manufacturers Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroen, has just ordered a Cray YMP2E, a two processor system that nevertheless delivers some 600 mips. It will be used for general automobile research and design including structural analysis, crash simulation, acoustic design and the simulation of car behaviour. The supercomputer landscape has changed irrevocably, however, over the past two years. Control Data, the US supercomputing pioneer has moved out of the area altogether, as commercial difficulties in other parts of its business made the heavy research and development investment necessary to stay at the leading edge too great a burden. Seymour Cray detached himself from Cray Research to establish a new company devoted to the development of the Cray 3, an innovative machine based on chips fabricated in gallium arsenide, a material which makes possible speeds of about three times the maximum possible from silicon. The new machine depends on a whole range of new technologies including assembly by robots and is proving a severe challenge even for a man recognised as the world's foremost supercomputer designer. International Business Machines, which for many years had tended to ignore supercomputing as a niche market where the return hardly justified the investment, changed its mind and came back to the market with a family of vector processors - conventional high performance mainframes with a bolt-on accessory giving a performance for certain applications close to that of a supercomputer. It also funded research into an advanced supercomputer being developed by Mr Steve Chen, formerly a senior designer with Cray Research. The three Japanese mainframe manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC launched supercomputers of impressive performance. While critics argue that their machines are let down by inferior software when compared to the Cray range, there can be little doubt that in hardware terms the Japanese machines are set to challenge the best US designs The principal change in the market, however, has been wrought by a different kind of advance. The emergence of two new kinds of supercomputer - minisupercomputers and massively parallel machines, which offer much of the performance of a conventional supercomputer at a fraction of the cost - have opened new markets for supercomputing. Supercomputers, in fact, is a name not much to the liking of computer engineers who prefer the expression 'scientific computers'. On this basis, a high performance Sun workstation carrying out scientific and engineering calculations is in the foothills of supercomputer performance. Speed is the important factor especially where, for example, weather forecasting is involved. As Mr Bryan Little, director of operations for Cray Research in Europe, points out, the calculations involved in weather prediction can be carried out by a small machine - but by the time the answer has been delivered, the storm will have passed. Minisupercomputers have the capacity to tackle many kinds of calculation and simulation. Some approach the speed of a full scale supercomputer. FPS Computing, for example, which started out building 'go-faster' processors has launched a machine which it rates at 2.1bn flops on typical mathematical routines - close to the performance of a Dollars 20m Cray for less than Dollars 2m. The kinds of customer who can take advantage of minisupercomputing power include scientists carrying out electromagnetic analysis, structural analysis, signal processing and computational chemistry. Typical of the new superminicomputer manufacturers is Convex Computer Corporation, another company experimenting with esoteric gallium arsenide technology to give speed at low cost. Cray, faced with the first threat to its pre-eminence in supercomputing in many years, has been forced to meet the challenge from Convex and other minisupercomputer makers by launching smaller, air-cooled models in its YMP series. It also bought a US-based minisupercomputer maker, Supertek Computers, and now sells its S-1 machine. Massively parallel machines are constructed by manufacturers such as Thinking Machines of the US. These rely for their power on hundreds or thousands of individual processing chips connected together and co-ordinated by special software. Where is Europe in all this? Nowhere in conventional supercomputing. It does, however, have the skills to build massively parallel machines, using, for example, the Inmos transputer, a processing chip designed for parallel processing applications. Edinburgh University, for example, is particularly advanced in transputer-based supercomputing. But it will require funding on a substantial scale for Europe to make much headway against the US and Japan. In the latest in a long series of warnings that Europe is throwing away the supercomputing future, the Italian physicist Mr Carlo Rubbia and a panel of experts have urged the development of pan-European high speed computer communications network backed by a Community expenditure by 1995 of 1bn Ecus a year.</p>

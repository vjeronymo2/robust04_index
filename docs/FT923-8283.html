			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Impasse or impetus on the road to reform: Riots in southern China pose a dilemma for the leadership's programme of liberalisation The violent events of Monday night in Shenzhen, south China's showcase of market economics, will mark either a brief detour along the road of reform or another impasse to the country's 13-year experiment with economic modernisation. The decisions taken by China's leaders over the next few weeks in response to the rioting will show whether Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader, can hold the ring, or be forced to stage a tactical retreat ahead of this autumn's 14th congress of the Communist party - one of the most important in its history. Thousands of small investors, possibly goaded by local gangs, rampaged through the city, burning vehicles and assaulting police. Twenty arrests have been made so far. China has not seen such civil strife since the spring and summer of 1989 when students occupied Tiananmen Square in Beijing in their demonstration for more democracy. The riot in Shenzhen had a less abstract, though no less potent, cause. Small investors were angry at having been allegedly cheated by corrupt officials out of the chance to participate in the local stock exchange's latest round of share issues. The government responded by sending in the police, rather than the army  - a relatively lenient approach which shows the city's importance as a symbol of economic liberalisation. Shenzhen is one of the original four special areas set aside for capitalist development. A little more than a decade ago Shenzhen was a flat track of poor agricultural land on the northern side of China's border with Hong Kong. Today, it is the brightest city on China's 'gold coast', and gold - in the form of company shares - is what lured 1m people from as far away as Beijing in the north and Sichuan in the south-west over the weekend. China's first stock market opened in Shenzhen in December 1990. Eighteen companies - embracing bicycle and television manufacturers, petrochemical and glass companies - are now listed on the exchange, eight of which permit foreign ownership through 'B' shares. These rank equally with 'A' shares which are reserved for Chinese nationals. The market is capitalised at about Yuan44.5bn (Pounds 4.29bn). Since the end of April, the market index has risen threefold and its constituent companies now trade on an aggregate historic price to earnings ratio of about 85. This compares with an average ratio of 24 in Taiwan and about 13 in Hong Kong, and indicates the high demand for equities in China. The rating in Shenzhen and, to a lesser extent in Shanghai where China's second and smaller stock market is located, reflects less the quality of the companies listed, however, and more the scarcity of available stock. For local Chinese investors, there are few assets to buy. Housing is state-owned; private car ownership virtually non-existent. Total 'official' household savings in China are estimated at Yuan1,000bn, a figure which does not take into account the savings stashed in people's homes. In Guangdong province, where Shenzhen is located, foreign currency held in private hands is estimated to be in excess of USDollars 3bn. But with negative real interest rates on savings, the Chinese are in thrall to the nation's fledgling stock markets. The potential for large gains, so far, has been large. In a similar share offering in Shenzhen last year a domestic investor who paid Yuan7,000 for 2,000 shares would today own shares worth up to Yuan50,000. 'No wonder all the trains and flights are squeezed with people from different corners of the country, with ID cards and money from the whole village in their pockets,' one Shenzhen official, referring to the latest offering, was quoted as saying in the Chinese press. It is ironic that Deng Xiaoping launched his latest drive for economic reform after his much-publicised tour of southern China in January this year. Shenzhen was the tour's focal point and has since become the model of economic liberalisation. The tour was probably Mr Deng's last attempt to steer the reform course, an effort that will culminate in the 14th congress. Mr Deng, who is 88, wants the party to 'elect' pro-economic reformers to prominent party positions and embrace his concept of a 'socialist market economy'. It is still unclear what a socialist market economy means in detail, but the broad outlines appear clear. The congress is expected to stamp its approval on the creeping deregulation of the economy that has gathered pace over the past six months. Already China has declared main cities along the Yangtze river and the Yangtze river delta open to foreign investment and external trade. The congress seems likely to accept that market forces may determine the fate of the bloated state industries. Beijing's recent decision to let 15 companies go out of business suggests that it is prepared to tolerate the social costs - principally rising unemployment - of company failures, though the move only goes a little way towards addressing the extent of the problem. More price reform is expected to be endorsed by the congress, as well as a change in working conditions to allow easier hiring and firing, and possibly further steps towards allowing people to buy their own homes. This was the direction in which China was heading on Monday when rioting hit Shenzhen. While it is possible that the violence could derail reform, this is not considered likely by observers, who feel the congress will endorse the broad thrust of Deng's plans. Nevertheless, risks exist. Deng may be China's most important leader but his power is not unlimited; rule in China is a subtle mix of consensus building and coercion. The Shenzhen riot comes at a critical time during the process of consensus building. It provides fresh ammunition for the conservatives in Beijing who are already concerned by the rapid acceleration in the country's growth rate to an annual rate of more than 15 per cent, and the inflation which is likely to increase in its wake. So far, Beijing's reaction appears measured. Mr Lau Gan, the cabinet secretary, is reported to have been dispatched to assess and report on the causes of the riot and the allegations of corruption. Serious as it was, the riot did not develop into an open challenge to the Communist party's right to rule, in the way that the Tiananmen demonstration did. The object of the crowd's anger was corrupt officials who allegedly gave preferential access to share application forms to family members and friends. It was Mr Deng who said: 'It is a glorious thing to get rich.' The people who travelled to Shenzhen were taking him at his word. China's leaders may conclude that the road to ruin for the Communist party now lies in preventing, rather than allowing, the Chinese people to give full vent to their material aspirations.</p>

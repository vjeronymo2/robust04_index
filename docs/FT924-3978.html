			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Letter: Cadbury offers institutions a route to responsible ownership Sir, Your leader on the Cadbury report ('Cadbury's code', December 2) questions whether the new code will 'adequately fill the proprietorial gap which has resulted from the growth of impersonal institutional share ownership'. The prevailing view of institutional ownership as impersonal is an odd one. The progressive concentration of equity ownership into the hands of a small number of investing institutions may not be to everyone's taste but it does at least permit management to maintain a regular and businesslike dialogue with the personal representatives of the organisations that control their company. The proprietorial gap surely yawned rather wider when the share registers of British companies were dominated by legions of private investors whose personal relationship with management was confined to conversations over tea and a bun at the annual meeting. It is precisely because of the growth in their collective ownership that institutional shareholders have found an effective voice to press for the changes outlined in the Cadbury report. To argue that the 'whole emphasis on non-executive directors largely reflects the unwillingness of fund managers to take a direct proprietorial role' misses the essential point. The enhanced status of non-executives results in large measure from the determination of those same fund managers to see their interests represented in the boardroom. Non-executives, while operating within the structure of a unitary board, are potentially the most direct and powerful conduit of institutional opinion to executive management. The recommendations of the Cadbury report will not, if properly implemented, offer an alternative to responsible institutional ownership but rather a mechanism through which that responsibility can be exercised.

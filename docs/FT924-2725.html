			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK-China talks make no progress THREE days of talks between Britain and China about Hong Kong's future ended yesterday with the two sides still sharply divided on the issue of political reform and having made no progress on other matters. The deadlock between the two was underlined by China's insistence that the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) not issue a joint communique  - a break with past practice - and by its reluctance to approve any agreements with the UK concerning Hong Kong. Explaining Beijing's position, Guo Fengmin, the leader of the Chinese side, said: 'The basis of co-operation between the Chinese and British government's has been severely undermined.' He again called on the British government to withdraw Governor Chris Patten's proposals for more democracy in the colony's 1995 elections. Only then could co-operation be restored, Guo said. Mr Tony Galsworthy, leader of the British team, said he had told the Chinese side that Britain was willing, without preconditions, to discuss with China the conduct of Hong Kong's 1995 elections. 'We do not insist that Mr Patten's proposals should form the sole basis of such discussions: we are prepared to discuss any aspect of this subject which the Chinese side wish and any ideas which they wish to put forward, as well as any areas where they feel Mr Patten's proposals might be contrary to the Basic Law.' He made plain that this offer could be taken up by the Chinese at any level. 'I'm quite sure that Mr Patten and the British government would make every effort to solve this impasse,' he said. Mr Galsworthy said the atmosphere of the three-day meeting had been generally courteous. The Chinese, however, displayed 'great rigidity' in their position on the substance of matters and there was 'no progress to speak of'. The Hong Kong stock market continued to be unsettled by the tension. The Hang Seng index fell 65.46 points, or 1.2 per cent, to close at 5,273.79.</p>

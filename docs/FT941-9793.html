			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cap Gemini seeks funds as losses mount Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French computer services group, yesterday announced increased net losses of FFr434m (Dollars 72.9m) for last year. It plans to raise FFr1.5bn in new capital. The results for 1993, which the group described as provisional, compare with net losses of FFr333m the previous year, excluding exceptional capital gains of FFr261m from the sale of a property near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Sales in 1993 fell 7.4 per cent to FFr11bn. The company forecast a gradual improvement in its performance. It was looking forward to 'less difficult market conditions' and the impact of its Genesis programme, involving a radical restructuring of the group's operations and activities. The programme, launched in 1992, is aimed at establishing a more efficient system of management across the group's various geographical and business activities. Under the new system, so-called 'strategic business areas' are organised along both geographical and industry sector lines, allowing different regions to specialise in the sector where they are strongest. The group's US operation, for example, is the centre for the oil and gas division. Cap Gemini spelt out a further reorganisation of the group in 1994. It said it would extend its programme of selling non-core assets, following the disposal of its stakes in Sweden's Jacobson &amp; Widmark AB and Carelcomp of Finland. In Germany, the company planned to integrate CAP Debis with Debis Systemhaus, a subsidiary of Daimler Benz, which holds 51 per cent of CAP Debis. 'The merger will reinforce the co-operation with Debis and create a company with sales of FFr6bn and a complete range of services,' the company said. The increase in capital, aimed at strengthening the group's balance sheet and reducing financial costs, will be largely supported by Sogeti, the principal shareholder in CGS. The company said Sogeti should participate in the capital injection in line with its 61.5 per cent stake in CGS. Details of the capital increase have yet to be finalised.</p>

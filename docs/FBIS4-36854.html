			<p>BFN     [Text] Rawalpindi -- President Farooq Leghari said Monday  that Prithvi is country-specific to Pakistan like the Pressler  Amendment and even more alarming is India's missile programme.    Addressing the convocation of the National Defence College  (NDC), Leghari said: "The Agni threatens a vast region, from  China and south East Asia to Kazakhstan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.  India's acquisition of cryogenic engines provides it a licence  to acquire ICBM [Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile]  capability. Other countries of the region cannot sit back  complacently while India acquires a potential stanglehold over  them."    He said: "It was not enough for us to be told that India  will  promise not to deploy Prithivis. How long does it take to  actually deploy those mobile launched missiles, 12 hours, 24  hours?.    "Our region must be saved from a missile race. Unless we  settle for a zero-missile regime in the region, the race will  become inevitable. The US and Russia must act positively now  and restrain India," he demanded.    Leghari said: "In response to our security imperatives, we  also seek self-reliance and indigenisation in our country in  general and defence production in particular. Import of high  tech equipment from abroad is not only a heavy drain on our  economy, but also subjects us to a high degree of uncertainty."    "We have learnt that no nation can expect to be truly  sovereign if it is totally dependent on others for import of  arms and technology.    The President urged that Pakistan must plan its  indigenisation effort with vision and follow it with the resolve  to stand on its own feet as early as possible.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACKGROUND ON THE AZUSA ROCK QUARRY  </P> <P> For the benefit of the citizens of Azusa, we wish to clarify some information  on matters relating to the rock quarry on the hillside (Azusa Rock Inc.).  </P> <P> First, in March of 1987, the City Council requested staff to review the Azusa  Rock quarrying situation. In March of 1988, the council directed the Planning  Commission to also review this matter. After hearing numerous hours of public  testimony and reviewing many documents over several months time, the City  Council elected to proceed with mitigation instead of a long and expensive  court fight. The decision to proceed with mitigation resulted from the City  Council's invitation to all three groups involved to sit at the bargaining  table and discuss resolving the problem. During the process, two of the groups  elected to actively participate, while one decided to only monitor the  sessions. Thus, the new resolution represents a culmination of efforts among  the cities of Azusa and Duarte, and Azusa Rock Inc. As a result of the group's  effort, we strongly believe that the adopted mitigation measures place more  stringent requirements upon the Azusa Rock quarry operation.  </P> <P> Second, the new resolution specifically indicates that the original conditions  under the 1956 special use permit shall remain in full force and effect. Hence,  combining the original permit and the new resolution strengthens and enhances  the conditions imposed by the original conditional use permit. This provides  the city with greater control and leverage in order to enforce compliance by  Azusa Rock.  </P> <P> The new restrictions include reviewing the Azusa Rock Quarry special use permit  every two years to monitor compliance (the Planning Commission will conduct  public hearings). Additional restrictions to be met by the quarry include  reduced hours and days of operation, the rerouting of truck traffic away from  residential areas, revegetation of the hillside, and improved dust control  measures.  </P> <P> Third, the passage of the new resolution raised some concerns regarding the  city's power of revocation and the implementation of environmental reviews. In  the event of noncompliance by Azusa Rock, the Azusa City Council may elect to  revoke the special use permit. Moreover, with respect to the environmental  reviews, the city would like to assure the community that environmental studies  will be conducted when necessary. Specifically, an environmental assessment  will be required before rock is transported across the San Gabriel River.  </P> <P> In closing, being an elected official sometimes requires making unpopular  choices. We must often stand alone in exercising the leadership that is so  essential in hearing all sides of an issue in order to make the proper  decision. We, as City Council members are aware that there are some people who  do not agree with our position in this matter; but we would like the record to  show that after a thorough review of the relevant information and after  assessing the positive and negative aspects of this situation and how it would  effect Azusa, we firmly believe that our decision was in the best interest of  the community at large.  </P> <P> TONY NARANJO, Mayor  </P> <P> Pro Tem  </P> <P> JENNIE AVILA, Councilwoman  </P> <P> BRUCE LATTA, Councilman  </P> <P> HARRY STEMRICH, Councilman  </P></p>

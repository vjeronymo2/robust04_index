			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ACCORNERO DISAPPOINTS AT BARNSDALL THEATRE  </P> <P> To operate an automobile, perform surgery, cut hair, sell houses or serve food  to the public, a license is required. To sing a recital of great art songs, all  that's necessary is to find an available stage and get on it.  </P> <P> Something is wrong with this system, as baritone Marc Accornero proved  conclusively Saturday night in Barnsdall Gallery Theatre. If singing is like  driving, and communicative artistry like delicate surgery, then in this case  the car was wrecked and the patient died.  </P> <P> Accornero's qualifications for his lofty responsibility include linguistic  facility, rhythmic accuracy, admirable taste in programming, a reliable memory  for words and music and excellent judgment in selecting his accompanist, the  always sympathetic John Boyajy.  </P> <P> Otherwise, three Bellini songs, Ravel's "Don Quichotte a Dulcinee, Mahler's  "Songs of a Wayfarer," canciones by Ginastera, Guastavino and Obradors, and  eight old Spanish songs harmonized by Federico Garcia Lorca were severely  compromised by a voice that was throaty, constricted, tremulous and lacking  resonance.  </P> <P> The tendency to sing constantly under pitch made particularly painful moments  of the "Amen" that closes Ravel's "Chanson epique" and the sustained "Ah!" that  ends Obradors' "Del cabello mas sutil."  </P> <P> The last straw was a prosaic, flat-as-a-pancake Serenade from "Don Giovanni."  If the maidservant opened her window to this Don, it would probably be to throw  something at him. BRUCE BURROUGHS  </P></p>

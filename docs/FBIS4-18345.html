			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Butrus-Ghali's Report"] </F>   [Text] The UN secretary general's latest report on the  Cyprus issue is expected to be submitted to the Security Council  in the next few days. Press reports on Butrus-Ghali's report  are contradictory. Some say that the UN secretary general will  criticize the Turkish side about the deadlock and some say he  will not. The Cypriot Government believes that Butrus-Ghali  will condemn the Turkish side for its stance and it seems that  is has received some assurances about it. Nothing is certain,  however, because it is well known that  behind-the-scenes-intervention--particularly by the  Anglo-Americans--which is common in such cases, could overturn  everything! The possibility that the same factors will  intervene in this case and the report will be modified is not  ruled out.    Rumors are already circulating that there is a difference of  views between the United Nations and the U.S. diplomats,  particularly Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, who refuses to admit that the  Cyprus issue has reached a deadlock. At the same time, Lamb  claims that "significant progress" has been achieved in the  proximity talks. Of course it is well known that the U.S.  official is not telling the truth, but due to his position and  his mission he can influence things, and his intervention could  cause the UN secretary general's report to be extensively  modified.    It is worth noting that the Cypriot officials are not at all  satisfied with Lamb's whole position and behavior. This man  does not give a clear and objective picture of the facts, hides  the truth, and tries to cover up the Turkish intransigence and  provocativeness. In any case, for obvious reasons the Cypriot  Government cannot come into an open confrontation with Lamb, who  is attempting to present Turkey's stance as heroic in order to  mask Turkish intransigence.    The U.S. coordinator went to Ankara yesterday for a new  round  of talks on the Cyprus issue. Without doubt, when he leaves  Ankara Lamb will say that the Turkish Government gave new  assurances that it will cooperate with the United Nations to  implement the confidence-building measures!    We do not believe that with the policy they are following  the  Americans contribute effectively to promoting a Cyprus solution.  On the contrary, their stance confuses things. This is because  if the Turks know that the United States, the only country that  can seriously affect them regarding Cyprus, not only is not  pressuring them but on the contrary is covering up their  intransigent and provocative stance, then why should they agree  to make any concessions? We believe that it must be pointed out  to the Americans that they must look at the Cyprus issue from a  different angle and at a higher level than Robert Lamb! And the  Cypriot people expect U.S. President Bill Clinton--who rules the  planet--to act on his promises. We must also make our own  decisions. Unfortunately, we are confined to words, statements,  and declarations. This is the bitter truth.... [as published]</p>

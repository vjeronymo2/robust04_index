			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STRAIT NAMED ENTERTAINER OF YEAR AT COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS  </P> <P> Gentleman cowboy George Strait brought the night's big prize home for country  veterans, but fellow Texan Clint Black, a 28-year-old ironworker with a knack  for ballads and a hot first record, got the bulk of trophies.  </P> <P> The only other multiple winner during Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the  Academy of Country Music Awards show was Kathy Mattea, voted top female  vocalist and song of the year winner for "Where've You Been."  </P> <P> But the night belonged to Black.  </P> <P> "It feels very emotional. It feels great. It's wonderful. It's just a big  thrill. It's hard to describe," said Black, whose first single "A Better Man"  reaped him single record of the year honors.  </P> <P> Strait, who has been named top male vocalist three times and earned best album  honors once, was his unemotional, straight-faced self after accepting  entertainer of the year honors.  </P> <P> "I thought I had as good a shot as anybody to win. I got out there and worked  as hard as anybody else. To be chosen entertainer of the year is very special,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LIST OF WINNERS  </P> <P> ENTERTAINER: George Strait  </P> <P> GROUP: Restless Heart  </P> <P> ALBUM: "Killin' Time," Clint Black  </P> <P> SINGLE: "Better Man," Clint Black  </P> <P> SONG: "Where've You Been," Kathy Mattea.  </P> <P> MALE VOCALIST: Clint Black  </P> <P> FEMALE VOCALIST: Kathy Mattea  </P> <P> VOCAL DUET: The Judds  </P> <P> NEW MALE VOCALIST: Clint Black  </P> <P> NEW FEMALE VOCALIST: Mary Chapin Carpenter  </P> <P> NEW DUET OR GROUP: Kentucky Headhunters  </P> <P> VIDEO: "There's a Tear in My Beer," Hank Williams Jr. and Hank Williams Sr.  </P> <P> Earlier story, B2  </P></p>

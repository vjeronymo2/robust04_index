			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: M&amp;G The flow of funds into unit trusts has been uneven. Despite its reputation in the field, M&amp;G's net sales of unit trusts amounted to only Pounds 92m last year, out of an industry total of more than Pounds 7bn. Its strategy of investing in high yield and recovery stocks, which produced a mediocre investment record in recession, is partly to blame. But that style of investing has produced handsome return since Black Wednesday, so M&amp;G should now return to favour among independent financial advisers. Sales in the early part of this financial year are apparently running well ahead of last. Even so, M&amp;G is not well placed to capture institutional inflows, which have accounted for more than a third of net sales across the industry this year. Fund managers with a long list of pension fund clients, such as Gartmore, will continue to enjoy the best of this business. Neither has M&amp;G launched a guaranteed income fund, the kind of product which attracted so much retail money as interest rates declined. With such funds now attracting controversy, though, that may be less of a handicap from now on. While the global bull market continues, a dull sales performance is not enough to upset the shares. Yesterday's 25 per cent dividend increase puts most utilities to shame. If the flow of savings into equities turns out to be more than a passing phenomenon, M&amp;G looks undervalued despite having outperformed the market by 25 per cent this year.</p>

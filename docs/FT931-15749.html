			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: Firm demand from investors for flood of fresh offerings THE holiday hangovers were swiftly banished last week, as the US bond markets began the new year on a hectic note. In the space of five trading days, a substantial mood-swing had taken place, and near-record quantities of new corporate debt had been absorbed. Post-holiday business began quietly enough. After a raft of year-end analysts' reports had declared that inflationary forces had been expunged from the US economy and were unlikely to resurface in any significant fashion during 1993, bond prices resumed their upward drift. At the beginning of the week, the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond came close to dipping below the 7.3 per cent level. That contrasts with the 7.75 per cent level reached in early-November, shortly after the results of the presidential election were known, when fears that a Clinton administration would pursue a stimulative fiscal policy were at their height. The friendly interest rate environment, however, induced corporate issuers to distribute a mass of new bond offerings last week. On Wednesday, for example, some Dollars 4.7bn-worth of new corporate bonds were sold - only marginally less than the daily record of Dollars 5.2bn seen on January 8 last year. On Thursday, another Dollars 4.75bn-worth of new paper hit the market, bringing the new year's cumulative total to more than Dollars 11bn. Although the new issue pressure receded during the final trading session, dealers still expect that the new corporate bond offerings will top the Dollars 30bn-mark this month. Happily, these outpourings on the supply side seemed to meet fairly firm investor demand - in part, a reflection of growing confidence in the US economy. Prices of existing corporate bonds held up relatively well, and traders reported significant buying by foreign investors. Nevertheless, by the latter half of the week, the surge in corporate debt issues was compounding concerns about the pace at which the US economy may be pulling out of recession and the size of the budget deficit problem which confronts the incoming president. The alarm-bells started to ring when initial unemployment claims for the week ended December 26 showed a drop of 40,000 - taking the figure to a level not seen for almost four years. They were not silenced when the December jobs data showed the unemployment rate unchanged at 7.3 per cent last month. Many analysts believe that the speed at which the labour market is picking up was overstated in the initial claims statistics. After all, Christmas fell on a Friday, so people laid off after the holiday season will not have filed for unemployment compensation that week. Nevertheless, an attack of nerves, exasperated by the supply situation, seized the bond market, and the long bond slumped by 1 1/8 to yield 7.44 per cent on Thursday. By Friday afternoon, it was continuing to drift lower and the yield has risen to 7.46 per cent. Still, few pundits seemed inclined to adjust their predictions for the year ahead. Most were content to reiterate their belief that the underlying expansion in the economy is moderate, at best; that the new president will tread warily; and that inflation should not rise significantly above 3 per cent. Statistics to be released this week may shed some light on the validity of these convictions. Retail sales for December - which, according to reports from the big store chains last week, were strong - are now expected to show a 0.7 to 0.8 per cent rise, while consumer and producer price indices (also for December) should confirm the low level of inflation. The market anticipates a 0.1 per cent rise in the PPI figure, to be released on Thursday, and a 0.2 per cent increase in the CPI on the following day.</p>

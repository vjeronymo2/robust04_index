			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (4): Where the whip is cracked - Andrew Jack examines the changing role of Companies House ON THE last Friday in January this year, Companies House, the government's corporate information agency, had a bumper delivery of mail: the equivalent of nine normal days' worth. On Saturday it had two days' deliveries. On Sunday, couriers brought another four sacks. A few months ago, such enthusiasm would have been implausible. But the timing marked the end of the period in which accounts from the many companies incorporated in March are required to be filed. More important, it was just half a year since the agency launched its crackdown on companies failing to make their filings within the legal timescale. That is just one example of how Companies House has begun to change, from a statutory nuisance which was largely ignored into an aggressive, commercially-oriented agency being used increasingly by businesses and individuals seeking a growing range of corporate information. One accountant who files hundreds of company accounts each year says the change has been enormous. 'You could get away with murder in the past,' he says. 'You felt unlucky if they traced you for not filing on time. We used all the old excuses which allowed us to stall for months on end, saying the director was out of the country and that we couldn't get a signature.' Many companies were reluctant to file, since they did not want people to be aware of their financial position. Others simply did not give priority to completing the accounts of many of their subsidiaries. Whatever the excuse, those that are tardy now face substantial fines and even the prospect of a criminal record if they do not comply. The new regime has not been introduced without difficulties. In the latest of a long line of complainants, the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales wrote to the Prime Minister earlier this year concerning the pedantic interpretation of the time limit for filing - which is seven months for public companies and 10 months for others. If a private company's year-end is February 28, for instance, it must file by December 28 that year, not December 31. But Mr David Durham, the agency's chief executive, is unrepentant. 'There are people who if you give them an inch will take a foot,' he says. 'You may say it's bureaucratic, but this way everyone has a very clear mandate to work to.' The new approach has certainly been impressive. He says that 82 per cent of accounts and annual returns are now made on time, against 68 per cent a year ago and 40 per cent in the mid 1980s. For accounts alone, timely returns are now running at 91 per cent. The mere fact that these performance figures are available so readily indicates something of the changes taking place. 'It used to be that if I had a query and called up three people at Companies House, I got three different answers,' says one large user. 'Now we are seeing the sort of service the public should be entitled to.' That partly reflects the greater autonomy now placed on officials at the agency, based in Cardiff. Formally it is still part of the Department of Trade and Industry. But it became the second executive agency under the government's Next Steps initiative in 1988. In 1991, it became a trading agency, giving it even greater managerial and financial independence and effective ownership of its assets. Mr Durham's comments are peppered with concerns to provide what the consumer wants. There is an emphasis on user groups and new publications. A few years ago, users of company information had to present themselves physically at the offices to obtain data. Now they can order fiches by phone, get some information by computer and even have searches faxed to them at a premium rate. Substantial further change is still in the offing. This summer should bring the introduction of two new services: a computerised directors' register - accessible by name rather than simply by company - and a mortgage register, both priced at below the standard Pounds 3 basic company search fee. In the longer-term, there are proposals for electronic filing of company returns. Wider requests under consideration include access to information by VAT numbers. But a dark cloud of uncertainty also hangs over the future of the service, which is making future planning extremely difficult. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, announced a review of Companies House last summer which could lead to full or partial privatisation. The conclusions are expected soon, and will be watched very closely. Staff are worried about their jobs, and senior managers about their roles and responsibilities. Rival company agents who process Companies House information are concerned about fair competition. Many users question the role of the private sector in collecting and storing statutory information. Meanwhile, users continue to express some disappointment about aspects of the service. Not least among their gripes is the recent decision to cancel a huge computerisation project which would have permitted far quicker capture and recovery of information, and might have allowed documents to be electronically read. They also say that insufficient scrutiny goes into the filing of returns, so that many have omissions such as failing to show the registered office or the names and addresses of all directors. More generally, Companies House sees its role as essentially clerical: to receive, store and retrieve basic corporate information, while examining for only the most cursory mistakes. No one in Cardiff, nor in the Department of Trade and Industry in London, seems to look at accounts in detail to ensure compliance with accounting standards or wider regulatory issues, or to investigate concerns highlighted in auditors' reports. That said, David Durham argues that the UK still provides one of the most efficient sources of company information in Europe.</p>

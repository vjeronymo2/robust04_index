			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Poverty in biggest cities 'has spread' Britain's biggest cities became concentrations of growing disadvantage in the 1980s, a study by the Policy Studies Institute concludes today. Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester are shown to have experienced growth problems, with inner city deprivation spreading to nearby areas. London, in spite of the affluence of some citizens, 'increasingly contains the largest concentration of poverty and relative deprivation in Britain'. On the basis of new means of defining deprivation devised by the government recently, 17 London boroughs appear among the 30 most deprived areas in England. The report - a study of changes in deprived areas between 1981 and 1991 - reaches the 'depressing conclusion' that 'government urban policies over a decade or more have as yet had only limited success in reducing disadvantage in the most deprived urban areas'. Employment opportunities in deprived areas are shown to be affected far more by general levels of activity in the national economy than by initiatives such as government task forces, 'however valuable they may have been'. The study shows that the capital's unemployment rates rose more than 50 per cent between 1981 and 1991. Urban Trends 2.

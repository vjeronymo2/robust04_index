			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fears grow over Alpine pensions - Double glazing company's silence a worry for employees FEARS HAVE been expressed over the fate of pension payments made over the last 15 months by employees of Alpine (Double Glazing), which informed staff by post on Saturday that it had ceased trading. The Department of Trade and Industry is also believed to have had meetings with former employees over events at the company. The DTI refused to comment yesterday. Repeated enquiries over several months regarding the pension payments - estimated to total about Pounds 100,000 - have failed to elicit a response from the management. Alpine, once owned by ADT, was purchased from administrators in February 1992 by a group backed by Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith. At the time of the purchase, the new management sought to effect a transfer of pension payments up to February 1992 from the ADT fund to the new company. The ADT trustees refused, however, as Alpine did not present an approved plan. As recently as December 1992, Alpine was unable to present an approved pension plan. However, the company continued to deduct pension payments from employees' salaries. Discussions with Allied Dunbar on setting up a pension plan were never followed through. One former employee said yesterday that the company had deducted Pounds 2,500 in pension payments from his salary since February 1992. The management has so far failed to respond to queries from either the employee or his solicitor. Calls to the head office and messages left with the senior management went unanswered. It became clear yesterday that Alpine has been in difficulties for some time. Many employees have not been paid for up to three months, while bills for advertising and services have also been left unpaid. On Friday Mr Robin Speirs, chief executive, gave notice on behalf of the board of a meeting of creditors to be held on June 15 which would decide whether Alpine should be liquidated. Alpine was once one of the best known names in the double glazing industry. In a recent attempt to revive the company, Alpine produced a glossy brochure entitled Nightmare on Life Street setting out its latest products including a window with a burglar alarm.</p>

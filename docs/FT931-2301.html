			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Foreign share of Japan's chip market rises sharply to 20% FOREIGN manufacturers' share of the Japanese semiconductor market jumped to 20.2 per cent in the fourth quarter last year. This matches the target increasingly focused on by the US in its efforts to force open Japan's electronics market. It reduces the risk of an acrimonious row during bilateral talks in Hawaii this weekend. US semiconductor makers welcomed the news yesterday, especially as most forecasts put the likely foreign market share in the fourth quarter at about 17.5 per cent. The share reached 15.9 per cent in the third quarter of 1992, at that stage the highest level since the 1986 bilateral semiconductor agreement was signed, when foreign chip sales accounted for 8 per cent of the Japanese market. The unexpected fourth-quarter jump fulfils the 1991 semiconductor agreement with the US, indicating that foreign market share would grow to more than 20 per cent by the end of 1992. The Japanese government has argued, however, that a 20 per cent market share was not a commitment, but an 'expectation' by the semiconductor industry. An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the increased market share was 'due to the strong efforts of both the US and Japanese semiconductor industries'. Japanese industry increased foreign purchases even though domestic semiconductor shipments were 'very low', he said. The outcome takes the heat out of what was shaping up to be a bruising meeting in Hawaii tomorrow, the first formal meetings between US and Japanese trade officials since President Bill Clinton took office in January. There were fears that a figure below 20 per cent would prompt demands for trade sanctions. The US semiconductor industry is now concerned that the higher market share in Japan should be sustained. US industry executives said much of the increase may be due to a shrinking market in Japan. 'A temporary improvement will not resolve the issue,' said Mr Alan Wolff, counsel to the US Semiconductor Industry Association. The Japanese consumer electronics sector, in particular, has been hard hit by the slowing Japanese economy. While this has reduced the overall size of the Japanese chip market, it has had little impact on US chip imports. Officials are concerned the rise in market share may be reversed as consumer electronics sales pick up in Japan.</p>

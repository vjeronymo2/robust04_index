Podlipalin (NIKIMT) under  the ``Problems, Search, Solutions'' rubric]    [Abstract] The article deals with problems of improving  the safety of RBMK reactors, particularly RBMK 1000. Due to the  effect of the neutron flux the geometric shape and dimensions of  graphite stacking blocks and fuel channels (FC) change the hole  diameter of graphite blocks decreases, the graphite stacking  contracts, and the FC diameter increases. The result decreased  clearance between the FCs and graphite stacking. The design  clearance between the FC and graphite stacking in the first unit  reactor of the Leningrad AES decreased prematurely because the  actual rate of change of the above parameters exceeded the  design rate. A decision was made to replace all fuel channels  and bore out graphite stacking holes for the channels. The  repair work took 10 months and was done during a single reactor  shut down. A technological process of restoring the clearance  was developed; it is described in great detail. Repair equipment  and fixtures were designed at NIKIMT, VNIIAES and TsNIITS  [expansions not given] and LAES [Leningrad AES] and manufactured  at NIKIMT, NIKIET, VNIIAES, NPO ``Krasnaya zvezda'', PNITI, FEI,  TsKBM [expansion not given], LAES and IAE [Atomic Energy  Institute] imeni Kurchatov enterprises. Main types of equipment  used for the repair (the cutting mechanism, welding equipment  and repair fixtures used for FC replacement and boring of  graphite blocks) are described.</p>

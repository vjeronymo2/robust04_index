			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / General Motors says Lopez finally decides to leave GENERAL Motors announced yesterday that Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its head of worldwide purchasing, had finally decided to quit GM, apparently to join Germany's Volkswagen, after a bizarre five days of wavering between the two companies. Mr Lopez, one of the best-known figures in the US motor industry, appeared to have decided over the weekend to remain at GM. The US company even scheduled a press conference yesterday afternoon to announce this and to say he had been promoted to executive vice-president of the company and president of its North American automotive operations. However, Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, told the news conference that a friend of Mr Lopez had submitted a letter of resignation from him at lunchtime yesterday. The letter offered no explanation for his move. Mr Smith added: 'It is not clear to me what his intentions are or where he is at the present time.' However, he guessed that Mr Lopez would be joining Volkswagen with whom he signed a contract of employment last week. Volkswagen seems likely to announce that Mr Lopez is joining the company after a meeting today of its supervisory board, which is expected to approve a management shake-up. The news could also boost Volkswagen shares, which fell DM7.30 to DM285.50 yesterday when the German company appeared to have failed in its efforts to poach Mr Lopez. GM's failure to keep Mr Lopez is a blow to its efforts to slash its car manufacturing costs in North America, where the company has lost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8.4bn) over the past two years. Mr Lopez led a team which demanded big price cuts from parts manufacturers and offered them workshops to improve their manufacturing techniques. The reasons for his vacillation and ultimate departure from GM remained unclear yesterday, though several factors appeared to have played a role. GM acknowledged that it had sought to keep him last Thursday by offering him the promotions which were to be announced today. In spite of these new positions, which would have given him substantial power over all North American manufacturing operations, Mr Lopez initially decided to join Volkswagen. He appeared to change his mind after meetings with members of his purchasing staff and further weekend discussions with Mr Smith. Mr Lopez had not asked for anything, but had been weighing up personal considerations. Mr Smith said Mr Lopez had told him at one point that his family wished to return to Europe and he had a contract with Volkswagen. The GM chief executive acknowledged that Mr Lopez, who hails from Spain's Basque country, had been urging the construction of a plant there using manufacturing techniques, capable of assembling a car in only 10 hours. However, GM had decided not to go ahead with such a project at the present time. Whirlwind, Page 20</p>

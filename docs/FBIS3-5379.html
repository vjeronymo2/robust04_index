			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Keep an Eye on the Real Substance of Trade </F> Friction"]    [Text] The U.S. Government has decided to issue a  presidential decree to reinstate the Super 301 provision of the  1988 Omnibus Trade Bill (which defines the unfair trade  practices of specific nations and stipulates sanctions against  them). This was no surprise for Japan, but we are concerned  about the U.S. decision.    However, Japan must have an eye on the real substance of the  bilateral trade imbalance. From here Japan may do nothing, or  engage in an anti-U.S. trade war by taking action to counter the  Super 301 provision. If Japan were, however, to take either of  these courses of action, it would damage its national interests.    As a matter of fact, the U.S. decision conflicts with GATT's  principle of "multilateralism." Even the European Union (EU) is  questioning the U.S. decision. But this does not justify  Japan's current attitude toward the trade imbalance issue.    The nature of the trade imbalance has substantially changed.  We must pay attention to the following points:    1) Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world  currently  amounts to $100 billion per year, and this is too much trading  profit for one nation. So the problem is rather more than  simply the $60-billion trade imbalance with the United States.    2) Unlike the economic background to the 1985 Plaza  agreement, Germany now has a deficit trade balance and Japan is  the only country producing a huge trade surplus today.    3) Following the conclusion of the Cold War, the United  States is reviewing the significance of the Japan-U.S. alliance.  Not only the United States, but many other countries are  beginning to consider economic issues are as critical as  security affairs. While economic frictions used be settled more  easily under the pretext of "the need for a healthy alliance" to  cope with the Cold War, this is no longer true.    The Clinton Administration is the United States' first  post-Cold War administration, and its Japan policy is obviously  different from those of preceding U.S. Administrations. It  appears Japan is too dependent on the alliance of the Cold War  era.    In fact, the unilateral actions of the United States raise  some questions. The U.S. demand for "numerical targets," for  example, does not look reasonable. However, to neglect the U.S.  demand is to remain idle despite the seriousness of the  situation.    Japan's idle attitude toward the trade issue may result in  further appreciation of the yen rate. Even if the United States  imposes economic sanctions against Japan according to the Super  301 provision, they will not redress the trade imbalance between  the two nations. After all, the huge trade surplus and the high  level of the yen rate will remain unchanged until Japan takes  action.    If Japan makes antagonistic counter moves against the United  States, it would be as good as declaring a "trade war." At  least, that would be the reaction of the market. If the market  views Japan's countermoves as the nation's "resolve to stick to  idleness," it will be the market that takes over readjustment of  Japan-U.S. relations. If that happens, the foreign exchange  market would be driven into confusion, and Japan would be  isolated on the international political scene. Neither  idleness, therefore, nor countermoves should be Japan's response.    It may be possible for Japan to file a complaint to GATT  against the unilateral action taken by the United States. Yet,  taking into account how Japan's trade surplus affects the world  economy, such a complaint would never be justified by Japan's  current trade policy.    Fortunately, the United States has decided to prepare  several  months for negotiations on whether or not sanctions should be  imposed. As a trump card, the Super 301 provision will be  played slowly, but in earnest.</p>

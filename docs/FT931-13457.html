			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Man in the News: Ultimate old school chum - Thomas 'Mack' McLarty There are not many people who can say of the 42nd president of the United States, as Mack McLarty did on Thursday morning: 'In many ways, Bill Clinton is the same person he was in kindergarten.' Nor be quick enough to realise that he should not give the impression that the Oval Office is now inhabited by a five-year-old. 'That's not to suggest he hasn't matured and grown wiser,' was his next sentence. Washington this week was filled to the rafters with FOBs (friends of Bill), all members of the extraordinary number of overlapping networks the Clintons have maintained over the years. But Thomas F McLarty, known as Mack, is the only BOF (Bill's oldest friend). Both 46, they go all the way back to Miss Mary's kindergarten in Hope, Arkansas. Now William J Clinton, still called Bill, has turned to Mack to help him in Washington as the White House chief of staff. There is, potentially, no more sensitive job in the capital. Exactly how it is performed depends on the wishes and needs of the president, and each has had his different requirements. But even a breezy look at recent history shows how much the chief of staff can make or break a president. Probably the most successful in the past 20 years was James Baker in Ronald Reagan's first term who ran a tight but not leak-proof ship. Above all, he protected his president from situations in which he might be caught off-guard. Another Baker, Howard, the former senator from Tennessee, also did well as a damage control operator when Mr Reagan's final years turned sour. Dick Cheney, later a congressman from Wyoming and the just-departed defence secretary, was a great help to President Gerald Ford in a difficult period. Better remembered are the failures: H R Haldeman, who pandered to all Richard Nixon's darker instincts and paid for it with a prison term: Hamilton Jordan, whose contempt for the Washington establishment did no favours to an outsider president, Jimmy Carter: and two of President Bush's chiefs of staff, John Sununu, fiercely ideological and personally abrasive, and Sam Skinner, who never realised until too late that his boss was in deep political doo-doo. His friendship with his president apart, McLarty comes to Washington probably the least known of the new Clinton team. The son of a successful car dealer and University of Arkansas graduate, he embarked on a political career early and, at 23, became the youngest ever state assemblyman. But his father's failing health brought him to the family firm, where he did well enough developing its leasing business that, still only 30, he was elected to the board of Arkla, the natural gas utility. Seven years later he was its president, replacing Sheffield Nelson, who was to become Mr Clinton's arch political rival, and two years on its chairman and CEO. He inherited a company in crisis, afflicted by declining oil prices, mild winters, and expensive long-term pipeline contracts. By the mid-80s Arkla's debt far exceeded its net worth. By 1989, its stock price had dropped 70 per cent and its credit rating was dubious. It is still not out of the woods even after an extensive disposal of assets, and McLarty's chairmanship is not without its critics. One acquisition, of a Houston natural gas company which may still be liable for the debts of a local savings and loan it owned before being taken over, leaves Arkla with a potentially high and still disputed charge. But McLarty gets general credit in the industry for keeping it afloat, and it was still in the charts as the 47th-largest utility in the most recent 1991 rankings of service companies by the Fortune 500. But his record as a businessman is not why he was the first person named by Mr Clinton to a Washington job. The explanation lies in Arkansas, which, to repeat the ultimate cliche, really is a small state where everybody who is anybody knows everybody else. Though out of elective state politics for more than 20 years, the chairman of one of its biggest companies is a de facto intimate of every politician, not least its governor. Sometimes this has presented problems for McLarty, as in 1990 when he remained conspicuously neutral in the governor's race between Clinton and Sheffield Nelson. But this never harmed his relationship with the Clintons. He was a discreet intimate throughout last year's campaign and a big fund-raiser. All the Arkansas references are glowing, from friend and foe alike, though he seems to have few enemies. He is universally described as methodical, intelligent and, above all, gracious. His television performances in the new limelight this week certainly showed his quiet charm. They also disclosed a canny skill at saying nothing in the nicest possible manner. He has talked a little, however, about his role as chief of staff. He does not see himself as a gatekeeper or high profile operator, which means he may have been seen more on TV in the first two days of this administration than in the next two years. The key, as he told the Washington Post recently, is: 'I really believe that Bill and I are not going to have any trouble talking straight to each other. We've done that for years and it flows very smoothly. He wants it. That was one of the real elements he felt was needed.' Mrs Clinton is getting an office in the political west wing of the White House rather than the social east wing, and will be a power in developing healthcare policy. McLarty's view is: 'Hillary's a good friend, too, someone I really greatly admire.' He even discreetly allowed that there were some differences between the approaches of the president and his influential wife. 'The linear style of thinking (reaching a decision and pushing ahead with the next item on the agenda) might be more Hillary's style and my style.' So Mack McLarty begins his capital odyssey with a clean sheet and the complete trust of the man who is president, but as a relative innocent in a city with many more snakes than ladders - one of which Zoe Baird failed to climb this week. He also has a fear of flying, but, then, there is much to do without leaving the ground in Washington.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Israel eases West Bank closure: Casablanca deal grants access to some Palestinian workers Israel has agreed to begin lifting the closure of the Gaza Strip and West Bank from tomorrow, easing the plight of more than 60,000 Palestinians denied access to their Israeli workplaces. Yesterday's move came as senior Israeli, Palestinian and European Union officials started the Middle East and North Africa economic summit in Casablanca with an urgent review of the economic crisis threatening the Palestinian peace process. The move was the first practical step taken at the three-day conference opened last night by King Hassan of Morocco. The gathering of 10 heads of government, 450 government officials and 1,100 business leaders from 60 countries is aimed at evolving new regional, financial and economic institutions after Israel's recent peace agreements with the Palestinians and Jordan, while encouraging private-sector investment in cross-border and regional development projects. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said an easing of the Gaza and West Bank closure, enforced after the recent Hamas bombing of a civilian bus in Tel Aviv, was agreed after talks between Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister. From tomorrow, women, Palestinian men over 30 and those visiting hospitals would be permitted to cross into Israel. In later talks between Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, Mr Arafat and Mr Abraham Shohat, Israel's finance minister, the EU agreed to examine the hold-up of European funds for Gaza and the West Bank. The EU has so far disbursed only Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.26m) of Dollars 120m pledged to the Palestinian Authority. The conference will close tomorrow with preparations for new regional institutions and steps towards creating a Dollars 10bn regional development bank. This would mark the start of what Crown Prince Hassan, head of the Jordanian delegation, described as a 'Middle East common market from the Atlantic to the Gulf' with a GNP of Pounds 580bn. However, while Mr Peres said the US, Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians agreed to back the development bank, Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of Israel's central bank, said he expected the institution would take two years to set up. The bank is understood to have raised objections from Britain and France. Moroccan sale oversubscribed seven times, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Rose: "Bull Grows 21.3 Percent"] </F>   [Text] Is Bull on the road to recovery? If quarterly  figures are to be believed, the French group posted an increase  of 21.3 percent (6.2 billion French francs [Fr]) in consolidated  sales for the first quarter. Bull management expects "strong  improvement" in its earnings for the same period. Total growth  "has greatly surpassed predictions," indicating "the first signs  of recovery," the group's executive committee said.    The Bull Overseas regional area shows the strongest growth,  with a 37-percent jump in sales, while Bull Europe (+9 percent)  and Bull North America (+5 percent) have simply reversed  direction. Bull's microcomputing division increased its revenues  70 percent, including 132 percent for Zenith Data Systems in the  United States. Total orders for hardware and software grew 27  percent, notably as a result of big system orders from the  Pays-de-Loire Caisse d'Epargne in France and General Electric  Information Systems in the United States.</p>

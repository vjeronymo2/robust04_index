			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Tactics to defuse a time bomb: The UK government is delaying making tough decisions on pensions The government may finally be thinking the unthinkable, according to Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. He suggested last week that perhaps it was time to consider slaughtering some of the sacred cows of the UK's state pension system. Like most other industrial nations, Britain faces a demographic time bomb as its population ages and the burden of providing state pensions falls on fewer workers. Mr Lilley hinted at two possibilities, both politically unpalatable: targeting the basic state pension at those who need it most, and raising the age at which it becomes available. While the government says it is not considering the first, it is actively studying the second. However, while it ponders, the pensions industry is becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of a coherent policy for the next century. 'I think we have a void in that we don't have an agreed government policy on pensions,' said Mr Ron Amy, group compensation and benefits manager at Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, and chairman of the UK's pensions industry trade body, the National Association of Pension Funds. At the association's annual meeting in Harrogate last month, Mr Amy announced plans for a national campaign to stimulate discussion with the government about the state's role in pension provision. 'The concern we have is that there is clearly going to be a declining level of state provision of benefits. We want the government to tell us how its cuts in state pension fit into its plans for overall pension provision in 30 years,' Mr Amy said. The focal point for industry frustration is the government's failure to equalise state pension ages for men and women. While men are not entitled to receive pensions until they reach 65, women become eligible at 60, an anomaly of most occupational schemes as well. Following a judgment by the European Court of Justice in May 1990 that occupational schemes had to offer the same terms to all members, employers began taking steps to equalise the age of eligibility. The UK government estimated that, by raising women's retirement ages to 65, it could save about Pounds 3bn a year. However, while most of Europe has equalised retirement ages, Britain has hesitated. A white paper on pensions policy has been postponed again and is not likely to be published until the autumn. The delay is a particular problem for employers with occupational pension schemes. One element of funding by employers is provided by the government through rebates of National Insurance contributions. To claim the rebate, employers must guarantee benefits to scheme subscribers equal to those available under the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme. Because women tend to live longer than men and retire earlier, employers have to contribute more to their occupational pensions to give them the same monthly benefit as men of the same age. The more generous contribution for women is reflected in government rebates. This could prove costly after a second judgment, expected from the European Court in August. It is likely to rule that if employers provide more valuable pensions for women, they must do the same for men. Thus, the government's failure to equalise retirement ages could increase employers' pension bills. 'If you are an employer, you can't bite the bullet and provide truly equal pensions until the government does,' said Mr Colin Evans, senior actuary at consulting actuaries William M Mercer and Co. Mr William Hague, under-secretary of state for pensions, said that, while the government was aware of employers' concerns, it did not wish to make a rash decision. 'There is no need for indecent haste,' he said. The government planned to hold consultations with the pensions industry in the autumn, he said. The widespread view in the industry is that the government has no alternative but to raise women's retirement age; only fear of a political backlash is preventing it from doing so. 'The civil servants at the Department of Social Security have ideas to solve these problems but the government hasn't got the mettle to take anything forward,' said Mr Gary Simmons, director and actuary at benefit consultants Wyatt and Co. While inactivity on equalising pension ages is the most pressing issue, the industry is also worried about the slow shift from public- to private-sector pension provision. In 1988, the government announced that annual state pension increases would be tied not to earnings, which rise faster than inflation, but to retail prices. This switch has cut the projected cost of state benefits to Pounds 32.6bn by 2050 rather than a figure of Pounds 79.7bn if benefits rose with earnings. The UK's state pension bill, which was Pounds 22.2bn in the 1990-91 fiscal year, will cost Pounds 34.7bn by its peak year of 2030, and there will be fewer taxpayers to share the cost because of changing demographics. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that, while there are now 3.3 workers for every pensioner, there will be only 2.4 for each pensioner by 2030. Pegging pension increases to prices rather than earnings also means that state benefits will become too small to provide even a minimal standard of living for an old person. According to the institute, state benefits will fall to 7 per cent of national average earnings by 2010 from about 17 per cent now. The UK state pension is already one of the lowest in Europe. Government critics in the pensions industry charge that its spending on the promotion of personal pensions is misguided, because such schemes cannot replace state benefits. Some pensions professionals say that personal schemes shift investment risk to the individual, are expensive to administer and are often sold to those who do not need them. Estimates from the life insurance industry suggest that 50 per cent to 66 per cent of the 5m-odd personal pension plans sold annually in Britain are funded solely with government rebates from National Insurance contributions. The figures suggest that about Pounds 6bn worth of rebates since 1988 have gone into personal pension schemes and that little saving by individuals has been encouraged. 'Personal pensions have been an enormously expensive failure,' said Mr Evans, citing high surrender rates and high expense ratios. The government has implicitly conceded some of this failing and has announced it will restructure the system of tax rebates for personal pensions from April 1996. Mr Robin Ellison, partner at pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp and a member of the Occupational Pensions Board, the pensions watchdog, said the government had yet to decide on the role for private provision, and whether employers and individuals should have the option of contributing to personal or occupational schemes. Mr Frank Field, the maverick Labour MP who chairs the select committee on social security, argues that only radical solutions are now possible. 'And the government is not sufficiently radical in its thinking,' he said. 'The time has come to universalise private pension provision with the government only providing benefits for those who have no alternative.' Private provision should be compulsory for both workers and employers, with the state contributing to the personal plans of only those who cannot work, he adds. The questions facing Mr Lilley are first, whether the government can continue providing state pensions for all, regardless of need. A move away from that, no matter how cost-effective, would provoke a political outcry, which the government can ill-afford. Second, he must confront the issue of inequality in state pension ages and brace himself for the backlash. Failure to make tough choices now will limit the government's ability to deliver a sensible, long-term policy for the future.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        AGE DEPENDENCY RATIOS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   1990      2000      2010      2020      2030  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                   23.0      22.3      22.3      25.5      31.1 France         20.9      23.3      24.5      30.6      35.8 Germany 22.3      25.4      30.6      33.5      43.6 Italy                20.1 22.6      25.7      29.3      35.3 US                   18.5      18.2 18.8      25.0      31.7 Japan                16.2      22.6      24.0 26.4      24.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             PROJECTED NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Upratings and revaluation of               Assumed  contribution limits in line with:     contracted-out rebate Prices (per cent)   Earnings (Per cent)       (per cent)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990-91           19.1                 19.1                   5.8 1990-91         18.1                 19.2                   4.8 1990-91 17.8                 19.9                   4.3 1990-91           17.4            21.3                   3.6 1990-91           17.8  23.5                   3.4 1990-91           18.4                 26.4               3.4 1990-91           16.4                 25.8     3.4 1990-91           14.1                 24.5                   3.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Pensions, Earnings and Savings in the Third Age, by Paul Johnson  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

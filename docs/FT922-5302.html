			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (6): Challenges for the prime minister In an interview, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, talked about some of the challenges he faces and the changes he is trying to bring about in Singapore society. On the legacy of Lee Kuan Yew: 'Mr Lee was of course exceptional. His personality was such that he was totally dominant. In my case it's different. . . I'm not Mr Lee so I do things my way which is more low key, a lower profile kind of leadership.' Singapore society: 'We recognise the government has an overwhelming presence in the economy and in fact in every sphere of a Singaporean's life. So in recent years we have been trying to shrink the presence of the government. . . you can see there is uncertainty in people's minds. They want the government to be there as a safety net, or a guiding hand or to do things for them. 'At the same time they also dislike the presence of the government in their daily lives. We want to get people to move out on their own and do more for themselves. They want it but are not sure that they can succeed. We are at this stage of development.' The results of the last election: 'Few people would quarrel with the idea of a more open style of government and more participation by the people provided at the end of the day the government is decisive. . . 'But their real concern is Are costs going up? Are they going to do better? Will their children have a good education? Are they missing out on economic progress? That's the signal of the way people voted.' Singapore's military: 'To be able to defend ourselves in one day of battle we require many years to build up an army. . . I always imagine Singapore to be a very small state which any adventurer could grab with one hand. Either you arm yourself to the extent that you can deter any threat or you don't do so at all - it's not worth spending the money.' The future: 'I myself prefer a more ordered, harmonious society, a society that is regulated. At the same time we should, where we can, give people more choice - on schools, on health, on arts, on culture. 'We are now at a stage when we are trying to have new out of bounds markers, when we are trying to widen the fairways. . . but it's an area where we would rather be cautious than adventurous.'</p>

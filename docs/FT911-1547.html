			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Source Perrier manages sharp improvement SOURCE Perrier, the French mineral water and cheese group, managed a sharp recovery in reported profits last year. The group, which had to withdraw its entire world stocks of Perrier water following the discovery of benzene traces early last year, saw net attributable profits rise by a provisional 30.6 per cent to FFr347m (Dollars 61m) in 1990 from FFr266m in the previous year. Perrier gave no other details of the group's results in an accounting report for its holding company. However, it pointed out that Source Perrier took a FFr1bn exceptional charge in its 1989 accounts for the cost of repurchasing and destroying stocks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Craig Doonan] </F>   [Text] Ulundi Jan 29 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] is set to boycott South Africa's first all-race elections  and enter "resistance" politics if delegates to a special  conference in Ulundi stand by their leader, Mangosuthu  Buthelezi's rejection of the poll under the current interim  constitution. The IFP president on Saturday [29 January] told  several thousand delegates gathered to finalise the party's  stance on the April poll that the present constitutional deal  would lead to a future "violent clash between the people and an  African National Congress [ANC] government".    "I do not see how we can enter elections under the  provisions  of the interim constitution. I say we must oppose the  constitution itself, as a matter of principle."    His remarks came despite last-ditch attempts by the ANC to  reach a constitutional settlement with the Freedom Alliance,  although Mr Buthelezi did not refer to or outline the latest ANC  proposals. The IFP president called on his supporters to have  "the courage to enter the politics of resistance", saying there  could be no governance of kwaZulu/Natal without the active  acceptance and participation of the IFP. "This is a region where  we dominate. No foreign forces shall come into it to rule over  us."    While he was not calling for violence or declaring war, Mr  Buthelezi went on to say: "No government has ever won the kind  of war against opposition which an ANC/SA Communist Party  government will have to wage against us if we resist the present  interim constitution."    Violent clashes between "the people" and a future ANC  government were inevitable if the IFP capitulated, and played  the ANC/SACP's political "ball game".    Mr Buthelezi said he would not stand by as an "abortion of a  constitution dictates the final annihilation of the Zulu  kingdom". He said he had never rejected the notion of  reconciliation between the ANC and IFP, but the current interim  constitution was an arena for a "struggle to the finish" and  contained no scope for constitutional or political settlements.    "I am prepared to compete with any political leader and any  political party under a fair and just constitution. I will not,  however, subject you to a constitution which is totally wrong  for South Africa." The current constitution was specifically  designed to promote ANC power and was an instrument for the  IFP's destruction, he charged, in his 16-page address.    Mr Buthelezi also repeated his rejection of the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC], saying he would neither recognise nor  obey it.    On the Zulu monarchy, he said King Goodwill Zwelithini's  future could only be secured by entrenched constitutional  provisions and "anything less than that will be an unwarranted  taking of risks and a gamble I am just not prepared to accept".    In closing, the IFP president told delegates to "search your  hearts" to decide whether he was wrong and whether he "should  submit myself and yourselves to the interim constutition, and  put you at the mercy of the TEC and other tranistional  mechanisms".    "I want to stress that I will respect any consensus that  comes out of this conference."    He also called for an end to "betraying" in the IFP Central  Committee by members who had complained to the press that he was  the "problem" in the party and that he was being led by Walter  Felgate in rejecting the April poll. He was referring to recent  remarks by senior IFP officials who have told the media they  support the party's participation in elections and have  criticised "hardliners" in the IFP for rejecting the poll.    While there is a strong pro-elections lobby in the party,  particularly among newly recruited MPs, the mood at the opening  of the conference appeared to be in line with Mr Buthelezi's  rejection of the poll. Prominent IFP cleric Rev Sipho Mzimela in  opening remarks called for delegates to "stand fast" and reject  a "socialist dictatorship".    Delegates also spontaneously applauded speakers who  reinforced Mr Buthelezi's views and who rejected a future anc  government.    Mr Buthelezi's speech was followed by a closed door  discussion of the pros and cons of contesting the April poll. A  final IFP decision on the April poll is expected on Sunday  afternoon.</p>

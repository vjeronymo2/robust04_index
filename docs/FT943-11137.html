			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Grosvenor Inns up at Pounds 0.85m Shares of Grosvenor Inns rose 12p to 150p on Friday after the expanding USM-quoted pub operator accompanied improved annual profits with an upbeat trading statement. On turnover of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.1m), including Pounds 1.43m from acquisitions, pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 increased to Pounds 854,000 (Pounds 764,000), struck after higher interest charges of Pounds 227,000 (Pounds 47,000) and Pounds 159,000 compensation to two former directors. Mr Tim Thwaites, chairman, said that trading was 'certainly much stronger than experienced a year ago, particularly in food' - the Slug &amp; Lettuce pubs showed a 21 per cent rise in food sales. Most of the group's acquisitions, of 10 managed houses, four tenancies and a joint venture, came too late to contribute to the results. But 'they are now fully on stream and will make a positive impact on current year trading'. Grosvenor had 40 outlets at the year end, including 11 freeholds. Mr Thwaites said the proceeds from February's rights issue gave the group the resources to purchase 'further individual outlets or small groups'. Gearing dropped from 32 per cent to 23 per cent. The final dividend is lifted to 2.5p, making 4.75p (4.25p), payable from unchanged earnings of 7.4p per share.</p>

At a press conference in Washington, Lin Zhen said he dropped out of sight  because his plan had been uncovered and dance officials threatened to return  him to China. He said that a lack of freedom since Beijing's pro-democracy  crackdown last year has made it impossible for him to continue his career  there.  </P></p>

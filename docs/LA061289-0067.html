			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> India Refuses Trade Talks: India will not negotiate with the U.S. over its  citation for violating the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act, the Press Trust of India  reported. Last month, the United States cited India under section 301 of the  1988 trade act for impeding direct foreign investment and closing the Indian  insurance market to foreign firms. The law allows the United States to levy  tariffs of 100% on Indian goods if negotiations fail to remove the barriers  within 18 months.  </P></p>

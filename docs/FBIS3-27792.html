			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai  said that it was inappropriate for U.S. Ambassador David  Lambertson to cite the Thai-U.S. Treaty of Amity to press for  permission for Phaisan Insurance Company to open branches in  Thailand. The ambassador made his remarks during a meeting with  Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon. Although the treaty  stipulates that U.S. companies are entitled to equal treatment  with their Thai counterparts here, the treaty does not say that  Thailand must open its insurance market for the United States.    Thai Governments, past and present, have tried all ways and  means, e.g. passage of the copyright law, to have Thailand's  name erased from the U.S. Priority Foreign Country watch list  (PFC). But the United States still keeps Thailand on the (PWL)  [Priority Watch List] list of countries on which it must keep  close watch.    Thailand, however, is ready to give permission to Phaisan  Insurance Company to open branches in the country in exchange  for its removal from the U.S. trade watch list.    The commerce minister has the authority to give permission  to  Phaisan Insurance Company to open branches in Thailand without  consulting the Judicial Council if he deems his decision  benefits the country.    The Commerce Ministry, however, has forwarded the issue to  the Judicial Council for fear of making a mistake in  interpreting the law, not because it wants to delay the issue as  accused by the U.S. side.    Chaloemphon said after the insurance market is opened for  Phaisan Insurance Company, it is hoped that the United States  will not make such a request for other U.S. insurance companies  because the treaty provisions only deal with specific cases.  The interpretation of the treaty in this case does not set the  criteria for general practice.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in his  capacity as chairman of the International Economic Committee, is  expected to call a meeting of the committee in February to  appoint a working team comprised of officials from the agencies  concerned namely the Finance, Commerce, Industry, and Foreign  Ministries to review the treaty and decide whether it should be  amended or abrogated.</p>

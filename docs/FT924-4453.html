			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons If one judges Allied-Lyons simply by how it is surviving the recession, then the company deserves some praise. To hold interim retailing profits unchanged while reducing the number of tied outlets by 500 is good going. So is the slight increase in brewing profits that appears after stripping out an extra Pounds 4m in bad debt provisions. With a 1,200 staff reduction in spirits and wine and the benefits of the Carlsberg venture yet to come, it is tempting to assume that only weak demand is holding the company back. Sadly, though, the truth may be more complicated. Allied says the beer price has stabilised, but free trade supply agreements, which make up a rising proportion of its total sales of beer, come at lower margins than sales to its tied estate. Even after recovery starts, brewing's main hopes may be in cutting costs. And it remains uncertain how food manufacturing - a particularly weak performer - will fare. Besides, recovery would benefit competitors, too, while Allied's Pounds 2bn debt could prove a handicap. True the Carlsberg venture will shortly reduced this by Pounds 135m, but the Chateau Latour disposal is proving slow to materialise and it will take Allied a while to trade its way into a position where gearing is less of a constraint. Until then its wine and spirits division must carefully pick and choose the acquisitions, on which the business heavily depends for growth. A large one would require a rights issue - something that will doubtless keep the shares in check.</p>

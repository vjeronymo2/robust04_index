			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, 11 Feb (AFP) -- All moderate Togolese  opposition parties today called for a "general mobilization"  against President Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters. They called  on the electorate to vote for their two parties, which are still  in the race for the second round of the 20 February legislative  elections.    In a joint communique sent to AFP, the eight parties,  including the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and Togolese  Union for Democracy (UTD), "exhort" voters who did not  participate in the first round on 6 February to "realize the  importance of what is at stake and turn out massively on 20  February to block the way to the forces that are hostile to  change."    According to the Togolese constitution, the head of state is  bound to choose his prime minister from the parliamentary  majority. Yesterday night the CAR and the UTD formed a "common  front" for the second round for which they are the only two  representing the opposition.    After the 6 February voting General Eyadema's party members  obtained 35 out of 81 seats, while the opposition obtained a  total of 22 and was assured of winning 12 more on 20 February.  Victory will depend on the results from 12 constituencies. In  11 of these constituencies pro-Eyadema candidates are facing  opposition representatives, while Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh  will fight it out in the last constituency with another  pro-Eyadema candidate.    In last Sunday's election, the participation rate was put at  65.12 percent, as against 39 percent during the presidential  elections of last August, which was boycotted by all opposition  parties.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Banks recoup losses as Dow marks time Wall Street THE WEEK started on a subdued note, with equities marking time in a narrow range as investors remained wary in the absence of any fresh evidence about the state of the US economy, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended just 6.48 off at 3,215.12 after a thin New York SE volume of 160.8m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.77 to 405.21. The treasury market was equally lacklustre. Although the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond firmed to 101 7/16 , yielding 7.87 per cent in the afternoon, trading was very quiet throughout the day. Trading in US stock and bond markets is expected to remain moribund until the publication of economic data at the end of the week. Bank stocks regained some of the ground lost last week, when the sector took a beating on concern over the finances of Olympia &amp; York. The property developer, owned by Canada's Reichmann family, redeemed part of a commercial paper programme after a downgrading. Citicorp, one of the most actively traded issues of the day, improved Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16 1/2 . On the big board, most actively traded stocks included Chrysler, unchanged at Dollars 16 1/8 , American Express, up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22, and AT&amp;T, Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 37 7/8 . IBM rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 87 3/8 . Among other blue chip issues, Merck advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 151 3/8 , Mobil eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 59 1/4 and Sears lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 . Coca-Cola firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 80 1/8 . The company, which is returning to India 14 years after closing its Indian operations, yesterday said its share of the international market rose to 49 per cent in 1991 from 46 per cent a year earlier. KeyCorp, a commercial banking group based in the north-east and north-western US, weakened Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 on news that it had agreed to buy Puget Sound Bankcorp for stock. Shares in the Washington State-based Puget Sound softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 . The deal values Puget Sound at Dollars 807.2m. Non-recurring restructuring charges related to the merger are estimated at Dollars 70m. In the secondary market, the Nasdaq composite eased 0.13 to 615.82. Trading was led by Lotus Development, the computer software company, which gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 after Cowen &amp; Co upgraded its near-term investment rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'underperform'. Similarly, an upgrading on Celtrix Pharmaceutical from Kemper Securities sparked interest in the issue, which jumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 11. In the secondary market, technology issues dominated trading. Apple Computer dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 but Dell Computer put on Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37. Borland International finished Dollars 1 7/8 lower at Dollars 68 1/8 after Shearson Lehman cut its fourth-quarter earnings estimate for the computer software group to 20 cents a share from 30 cents. Canada TORONTO displayed an easier bias in quiet dealings. The composite index ended 12.3 down at 3,518.6, while falls exceeded advances by 319 to 276. Volume slipped to 20.9m shares from Friday's 27.1m. Ford Motor, up CDollars 1 at CDollars 150, said it is close to a possible USDollars 1bn deal to make cars at its Oakville, Ontario, plant for use as taxis in Argentina. Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded USDollars 4.6bn in Toronto-Dominion Bank long-term debt, citing 'continued worsening of the bank's asset quality'. The stock ended CDollars  1/8 down at CDollars 16 3/8 .</p>

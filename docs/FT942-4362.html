			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Salinas may join race to head WTO President Carlos Salinas of Mexico is considering joining the race to become head of the World Trade Organisation, due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. 'Mexico's Foreign Ministry has recognised the pronouncements in favour of President Salinas, and is exploring to see whether there is a consensus for his candidacy,' a spokesman for the president said yesterday. 'This does not imply a decision has been taken.' The Mexican government is understood already to have taken soundings at the most senior level in the US State Department and the office of President Clinton's trade representative about how Washington would view Mr Salinas's candidacy for the WTO. Should he decide to stand, he would be the most heavyweight political figure to enter a race in which the two declared candidates to date are Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister, and Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister. However, Mr Salinas's entry could also split support in Latin America, which the Brazilian government hopes to rally behind Mr Ricupero. Another Mexican government official said Mr Salinas would be looking at it 'very keenly, very seriously' but would probably not decide before Mexico's presidential election on August 21. Mr Salinas's six-year term ends in December. However, for domestic political reasons, he cannot be seen to campaign too openly for the WTO job before the election. There has long been speculation that Mr Salinas, 46, would seek a senior position in an international organisation after leaving the presidency. An official who knows him well said the WTO job 'would be an important activity for an ex-president, and a job that he could do very well'. Mexico's state-owned news agency reported Mr Manuel Tello, foreign minister, as saying in Paris this week that there exists 'favourable conditions that a person with the profile of Salinas heads the nascent organisation. 'Taking into account the decisions of Salinas in favour of free trade, (it is probable that) his name begins to circulate more and more as a possible candidate for secretary-general of the WTO.' Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance minister, has recently quoted as saying that Mr Salinas was a 'suitable candidate', and that were he to be appointed head of the organisation 'we could not be in better hands'. However, the Spanish government is expected to support whichever candidate is endorsed by other European Union leaders. At present, Mr Ruggiero is the clear favourite.</p>

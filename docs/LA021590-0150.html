			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEVRON TO SELL OFF FACILITIES IN BAHAMAS  </P> <P> Chevron Corp. said it will sell an unused refinery and an operating shipping  and storage facility in the Bahamas to Venezuela's state-owned oil company.  </P> <P> No terms were disclosed for the mostly cash deal with Petroleos de Venezuela,  which owns the Citgo oil company. The deal must be approved by the governments  of the Bahamas and Venezuela.  </P> <P> The 500,000-barrel-per-day refinery was shut in 1985, but storage facilities  for 20 million barrels and marine facilities that can accomodate ships carrying  up to 500,000 tons have been used almost continuously since the entire facility  was opened by Chevron in 1970.  </P></p>

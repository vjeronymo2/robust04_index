			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Vitro and Corning end venture Vitro and Corning, the Mexican and US glass companies, have decided to end joint ownership of their consumer glassware divisions, although they will continue an alliance through supply and distribution agreements. The companies formed two subsidiaries, Vitro Corning and Corning Vitro. Both will sell their minority stakes to their partners. Corning will also pay Vitro Dollars 131m, roughly the amount Vitro paid Corning when joint ownership was concluded last January. Corning Vitro had sales last year of more than Dollars 700m and Vitro Corning achieved turnover of about Dollars 230m. The joint ventures suffered from the different administrative practices of the two companies. 'Managing from two countries was more complicated than we anticipated,' said Corning. 'There were different (management) structures, styles and accounting systems.' Corning said the different needs of customers in the US and Mexico complicated the integration of sales and distribution. Corning's US customers, especially the large discount stores, expect the timely and regular delivery of products packaged in a certain way, while Vitro's Mexican customers are less demanding. 'The separate ownership structure will allow each company to concentrate on their respective businesses, while relieved of the complexities of managing two different operations in rapidly changing markets,' said Corning. 'Both companies need increased flexibility to respond more quickly to customer expectations and the marketplace.' Corning separately announced that with Siecor Corporation, a joint venture with Siemens of Germany, it had agreed to acquire the fibre-optic cable business of Canada's Northern Telecom for Dollars 130m. Corning will provide Dollars 87m and Siecor Dollars 43m. Corning intends to finance the Vitro and Northern Telecom transactions with an equity offering in the first quarter of 1994. The two transactions and related financing will not affect Corning's earnings per share or debt to capital ratio, the company said.</p>

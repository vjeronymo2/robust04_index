			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / September bookings safe TENS OF thousands of people who booked autumn holidays with Mowat, the failed property and leisure group, will have to wait several days to find out whether their money is safe, receivers Touche Ross said yesterday. Touche Ross, which took control of Mowat yesterday morning after a syndicate of 13 banks decided to put the company into administrative receivership, said all bookings for holidays until October 3 would be honoured. Mr Nigel Atkinson, one of the receivers, said he had not yet calculated how many holidays had been booked for the period. Earlier this week, however, Mr Brian Dunlop, Mowat chairman, put the number of bookings for the rest of September at 20,000. He said there were an additional 43,000 bookings for the remainder of the autumn season. Mr Atkinson said two help-lines set up to provide information to Mowat customers were busy throughout yesterday. Mowat owns 11 holiday parks in England and offers cruise holidays on the Norfolk Broads. The helpline numbers are: 0902 880800 (Holimarine) and 0692 670100 (Pennant Boats). Mr Ian Birch, regional director of Lloyds Bank Commercial Service, which led the syndicate, denied a claim by Mr Dunlop that the banks had acted too quickly in calling in the receivers. He said the banks had agreed to allow the company to continue operating if it could raise Pounds 6.5m in new equity capital by August 27. That was subsequently extended to last Monday, by which point Mowat had received firm pledges for less than half that sum. 'If they had raised that Pounds 6.5m equity, I'm sure in my own mind that the business would have continued,' Mr Birch said. Mowat was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents and its holidays were not protected by a bond. The company's demise prompted further calls yesterday for the government to protect holidaymakers. Mr Mike Grindrod, Abta president, said he would be seeking a meeting with Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, to discuss whether all travel companies that take pre-payments should be licensed. Another unbonded company, Land Travel, collapsed in July, leaving more than 40,000 people with no prospect of recovering their money. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, said the Department of Trade and Industry should liaise with Abta on which travel companies might be in trouble.</p>

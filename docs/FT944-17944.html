			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Britain blocks EU efforts to curb CO2 emmissions Britain blocked EU efforts to agree a strategy to curb carbon dioxide emissions and boost the efficient use of energy, Mr Klaus Topfer, German environment minister, said after a meeting of the Union environment ministers which ended early yesterday, Reuter reports from Luxembourg. Mr Topfer told a news conference he had hoped to combine several existing policies on energy use and CO fossil fuel emissions. 'We couldn't agree because of the specific position of Great Britain. No doubt about that.' His plan foundered on objections by Mr John Gummer, the UK minister, to the term 'Community taxation measures' in a strategy document, a reference to a suggested EU-level CO or energy tax. Britain has previously opposed any move to increase EU-level involvement in tax matters.</p>

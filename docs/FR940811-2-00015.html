This decision is the Proposed Action of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Theater Missile Defense Programmatic Life-Cycle Final Environmental Impact Statement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (FEIS), dated September 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the lead agency, the United States Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC) prepared the FEIS. BMDO and the other military services_the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps_served as cooperating agencies. The FEIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and a Notice of Availability was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 8, 1994 (59 FR page 5758). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Record of Decision (ROD) is submitted pursuant to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Environmental Policy Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 6050.1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental Effects in the United States of Department of Defense Actions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (34 CFR Part 188), and service regulations that implement these environmental laws and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ideally, an operational TMD system would combine three components:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Active Defense <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to destroy enemy missiles in flight;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Counterforce <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to destroy an enemy's ability to launch missiles; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Passive Defense <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to evade detection and otherwise survive a missile attack. A Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) network would manage and integrate the various elements of the system. An operational TMD system could be deployed by the mid- to late-1990s. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Programmatic FEIS is a first-tier document. It addresses program-wide issues and the potential impacts of technologies associated with the Proposed Action and its Alternatives. It considers the potential impacts of research, development, testing, production, basing (not site-specific deployment), and eventual decommissioning of TMD. It also identifies measures to mitigate those impacts. As the TMD program matures, decisions will be made regarding testing, and eventual production and deployment. In the event these decisions have the potential for significant environmental impact, they will be evaluated in accordance with NEPA and CEQ regulations. Supplemental or additional documentation tiered from this EIS will be prepared, if appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Action and Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Action is to conduct research and development that will enable the U.S. to produce and deploy an integrated, comprehensive TMD system. The system would include three components: Active Defense, Counterforce, and Passive Defense. The mixture of components would be based on mission needs, feasibility, lethality, mobility, technical maturity and cost, as well as environmental considerations and other factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the Proposed Action, the FEIS also considered four Alternatives to the proposed Action: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Improve Active Defense Only <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Improve Counterforce Only <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Improve Passive Defense Only <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. No Action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the first three alternatives are considered in the FEIS as separate Alternatives to the Proposed Action, their evaluation also provides the information necessary to estimate the environmental impacts of a TMD system that blends two or three components. Pursuing only one of the first three Alternatives would yield only a limited TMD capability with only one technology area enhanced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

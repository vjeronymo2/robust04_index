			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Heads of Republics Within the </F> Russian Federation Support It..."]    [Text] On 21 April, the Russian president held a meeting  with the leaders of the republics within the Russian Federation.  The heads of the republics participating in the meeting adopted  the following statement:    "We participants in the meeting with the Russian Federation  president, representing the leadership of republics within the  Russian Federation, aspiring to stability and the affirmation of  the traditions of dialogue, compromise, and partnership in  politics, declare our support for the idea of ensuring civil  peace and accord in our multiethnic country at a crucial stage  in its history.    "Together with the Russian Federation president, we believe  that the signing of the Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in  Russia should demonstrate to Russians that politicians, state  institutions, and Russian Federation components are capable of  finding common positions for the effective settlement of urgent  and socially important tasks within the framework of economic  and social transformations. Political ambitions, hostility, and  extremism in federal relations may hinder the quest for a joint  way out of the crisis, and undermine trust in organs of power at  all levels.    "We appeal to state, political, and social circles in Russia  to assume responsibility for the stable and consistent  development of our country, and to become involved in the  concluding process of the preparation and signing of the  agreement."    dated] Moscow, The Kremlin, 21 April 1994</p>

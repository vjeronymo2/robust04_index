			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia's opposition to any moves to link trade  with human rights issues does not mean that it condones any form  of injustice. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim  said the opposition was made because it is not proper to link  trade with human rights issues. Malaysia's stand has been  consistent in that from the start it had maintained that there  should be no connection between trade and human rights issues.  He told newsmen this in Kuala Lumpur.    Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also finance minister, was  commenting  on the United States decision to renew the Most Favored Nation,  MFN, status for China. President Bill Clinton, in announcing  the decision, said the policy of linking the annual renewal of  the MFN with improved human rights should no longer be  practiced. Datuk Sri Anwar said Malaysia welcomes Clinton's  decision because this is consistent with Malaysia's stand that  trade should not be linked with human rights issues.</p>

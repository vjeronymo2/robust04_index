The Federal Parliament met in Berlin on 20 January and approved  a proposal by the United Greens Party 90 requesting political  asylum for slightly more than 600 Angolan citizens who had  sought refuge in the FRG. Only a few days ago, it looked  unlikely that they would obtain such permission because of  differences among the country's authorities.    The stance adopted by the Federal Parliament in Berlin has  done much to resolve the problems of Angolan refugees in that  country. It comes in the wake of a tug of war between the  senator for home affairs in Berlin and (?15) Angolans who had  sought refuge with Catholic and Protestant churches.    Human rights organizations across the world have praised the  stand adopted by the Federal Parliament in Berlin, adding that  it has greatly lessened the dangers faced by those Angolans  because of the Luanda regime's policy of tribal genocide and  extermination of all people who do not fall in with its  political views.</p>

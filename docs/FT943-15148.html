			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Employee buy-out faces bumpy landing - United Airlines The world's biggest employee buy-out goes to the vote in the US tomorrow when United Airlines' shareholders decide whether they are prepared to cede majority control of their company - the country's biggest airline - to its staff. The betting is that the deal will go through, but it is by no means a certainty. Last month the Pennsylvania-based Vanguard/Windsor Funds, an institutional investor speaking for nearly 10 per cent of United's shares, said it would vote against the proposal, and it may not be the only one. United's plan is to give employees a controlling stake of between 55 and 63 per cent of the company's equity in return for cost-cutting labour concessions worth Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds 3.2bn) over the next 12 years. It badly needs the proposal to succeed because it forms the basis of its strategy for restoring profitability in the face of cut-throat competition from smaller, low-cost US carriers s Existing shareholders will get a half-share in the new United Airlines plus Dollars 84.81 in cash for each share they now hold. United argues that there is no alternative to the plan, but dissenters say that with many of the airline's problems stemming from uppity and over-paid staff, the notion of an employee buy-out is tantamount to giving lunatics control of the asylum.</p>

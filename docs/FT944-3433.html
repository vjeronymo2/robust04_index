			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bid for Italian steel group A Franco-Italian consortium yesterday issued a bid for Ilva Laminati Piani (ILP), Italy's state-owned flat steels company. The bid opened what should be the final phase in the break-up and privatisation of Italy's state steel industry. The consortium is headed by Lucchini, the private Italian steel producer, in alliance with Usinor Sacilor, the French steelmaker, and Bolmat, a company headed by two Italian steel traders. The value of the bid was not revealed, but it is understood that Lucchini has a dominant stake in the consortium. Lucchini and Usinor made their offer through their jointly-owned company, Lutrix. IRI, the state holding company which owns ILP, would not say whether other offers were tabled before yesterday's noon deadline. Mr Emilio Riva, the Italian steel magnate, was considered the most likely counter-bidder. Riva made a conditional offer for ILP at the beginning of this month with Tarnofin, a consortium of local entrepreneurs, but it was withdrawn when IRI announced it wanted to remain open to other offers. IRI is expected to evaluate the offer at a board meeting on Thursday, in the hope of striking a deal by the end of the year, the deadline set by Italy's European Union partners for the privatisation of the Italian steel industry. If IRI and its advisers are not happy with the original offer they could call for new bids, or open private negotiations. The Franco-Italian bid follows weeks of talks set in motion by Mr Bruno Bolfo and Mr Vittorio Malacalza, who head Duferco, a steel trading company, and Bolmat. They had indicated that a number of international steel producers were interested in ILP.</p>

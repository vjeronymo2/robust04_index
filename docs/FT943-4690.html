			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maize shoots on the acid savannah - A new grain option for the ranchers of Colombia and South America 'I'm so excited, I feel drunk just looking at it,' said a farmer of flat land in eastern Colombia as he looked at a crop of maize pushing its way through the soil. For the farmer this was the first time that a crop had ever grown on his acid and infertile soil which is typical of South America's vast savannah lands, traditionally used only for cattle ranching. Seventeen years of research by the Cali-based International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the Mexican-based International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) has led to the development of a maize variety that grows in savannah soils. Called 'Sikuani' after the name of a Colombian tribe, the new variety could increase the productivity of savannah land by allowing farmers to ranch cattle and to grow a crop. Dr Shivaji Pandey, a CIMMYT plant breeder, says: 'This revolutionary maize tolerates acid soils. Sikuani also improves the soil quality, benefitting the pasture or subsequent crops too.' Scientists developed the new variety with germplasm - or genetic material - from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand and Venezuela. The Colombian Institute of Agriculture, the national agricultural research body, and its semi-private branch, the Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research (CORPOICA), asked 15 Colombian farmers to test Sikuani in their fields. The result was that the variety yielded an average of 3 tons a hectare in the acid soils. While this might be considered low on fertile soils, it offers South American savannah farmers the chance of a much higher return from their land than just ranching cattle. Dr Ral Vera, leader of CIAT's tropical lowlands programme, says: 'Planting Sikuani in the savannahs will have a revolutionary effect: a new economic option, a new way of working. 'Farmers will see that integration of cropping and ranching can make the whole system more productive. Farmers willing to experiment were the final decisive factor in producing this variety.' Two years ago CIAT scientists developed a rice variety that will grow in acid soils. Savannah farmers now have options they could only dream of until recently - to plant rice or maize, or both, on their land to complement their cattle. The new maize will grow in about 125 days and will give farmers the opportunity to plant two crops a year - from September to January and March to July. While some of the maize produced on the savannahs will be marketed for human consumption, some will also be used for cattle feed in the dry season. This will mean that savannah farmers do not have to buy maize from outside sources. The opportunity to use a crop-pasture system could open the way for an increase in both crop and livestock production on South America's savannahs, which cover almost half the continent's agricultural land. Especially prevalent in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, the savannahs are one of the few land areas of the world not to have been exploited by farmers. 'The savannahs represent most of the area in the world that can be expanded for agriculture,' said Dr Richard Thomas, CIAT scientist. Scientists point out that although there are large farms on the savannah lands, there are also many small farmers who make only a meagre living on the poor soils and that changing to a crop-pasture system offers them a real hope of increasing their earnings. There could also be environmental benefits. Many savannah pastures are overgrazed and a crop-pasture system could mean that farmers reduce their stocking densities and farm their land on a more sustainable basis. Also, farmers whose land is more productive could be less tempted to expand into forest areas and remove trees for agriculture. CORPOICA released the new maize variety to farmers in Colombia at the end of July. If savannah farmers become convinced of the benefits of both keeping cattle and growing maize on their land, the problem could be that not enough of the Sikuani seed will be available. Two Colombian seed companies, and also CORPOICA, are planning to produce and market seeds of the new variety, which is also being tested in Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Paradise too good to be true: Hong Kong banks are enjoying bumper profits. But will they last? Seen at night from the Star Ferry as it makes its way across Victoria Harbour towards Kowloon on the mainland, Hong Kong's banks gleam brighter than ever. The political uncertainty afflicting the colony in the last years of British rule has not damaged the ability of the 175 banks to earn money in what is now the most profitable banking market in the world. Banks in the colony commonly make post-tax returns on equity of more than 20 per cent - twice that of banks in many European countries. But such profits may not last forever. Banks are already mulling the likely effects of Chinese rule after July 1997; some wonder if earnings will deteriorate before then. 'We live in a fool's paradise, and they never last long,' says Mr Werner Makowski, managing director of Dao Heng Bank, one of the biggest banks in Hong Kong. 'We've had 10 years of growth, and bad debts are ridiculously low,' says Mr Tony Nicolle, Hong Kong general manager at Standard Chartered, the UK-listed international bank with roots in the colony. The fool's paradise might yet end with a painful correction similar to that in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries at the end of the 1980s, when bad debts cut heavily into profits. But most local bankers think it is more likely to give way to a gradual squeeze on earnings. 'You cannot rule out the risk of collapse (in profits), but it is not my best guess,' says Mr David Carse, the chief banking supervisor for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Earnings will come under pressure because Hong Kong will find it hard to maintain the exceptional combination of factors which have boosted bank profits in the past three years: The Hong Kong economy has been expanding rapidly, achieving growth of more than 5 per cent in each of the past two years. It has been boosted by free-market reforms in China, which have led to buoyant economic growth in the Pearl River delta adjacent to Hong Kong. Fast growth in surrounding Asia Pacific economies - averaging more than 6 per cent over the past decade - has also led to strong demand for loans and trade finance. Despite the recent growth in bond issues, Hong Kong companies have traditionally sought debt finance from banks rather than capital markets. This has underpinned a steady expansion in balance sheets - bank loans in Hong Kong grew by 15.4 per cent in the year to last September. Borrowing has been encouraged by negative real interest rates forced on the colony by the exchange rate 'peg' between the Hong Kong and US dollars. Hong Kong has been obliged to keep interest rates low despite inflation of 8.5 per cent last year. 'There is a huge demand for credit. Borrowing money is the cheapest thing you can do here,' says Mr Makowski. Banks have managed to sustain the so-called 'cartel' - or interest rate agreement - under which the Hong Kong Association of Banks formally sets interest rates paid on Hong Kong dollar deposits of less than HKDollars 500,000. By keeping rates artificially low, the arrangement has bolstered the net interest margin (the gap between interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans). The level of bad debts has been extremely low, at less than 0.2 per cent of loans, compared with 10 times that in some OECD countries. Hong Kong bankers say that this is not only because of rapid growth and full employment, but local culture. 'People just do not default on loans here,' says Mr Stephen Li, a banking analyst at Jardine Fleming, the securities house. These factors have sustained Hong Kong's banks at a time when many elsewhere have been in crisis. Yet although no calamity has yet struck the colony, investors have lost much of last year's confidence in its banks: share prices of Hong Kong banks have fallen by an average of 35 per cent from a peak in February. In part this drop reflects the 27 per cent fall in the Hang Seng index over the same period, as international fund managers' euphoria about Asian markets has dissipated. Yet there is also unease over whether Hong Kong banks' profits can be sustained. There are three main pressures: First, Hong Kong banks do not want to continue making new property loans at a rate that might create an asset price bubble. 'It will remain a very profitable market, but it cannot continue to grow at the same rate. That would be dangerous,' says Mr Paul Selway-Swift, executive director of Hongkong Bank. Banks also face pressure from regulators. The prime example is in the domestic mortgage market. There has been strong demand for loans in the past three years as prices of flats have escalated, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has set limits on borrowings and warned banks of the risk of mounting bad debts. The maximum ratio of mortgage loan to value of property is now 70 per cent, and it is hard to get more than a 50 per cent mortgage on luxury flats. 'We are getting to the stage where banks' huge increases in mortgage lending will be constrained,' says Mr Carse of the monetary authority. Second, margins will erode as banks use accumulated capital to compete. The interest rate agreement has restrained competition but there is pressure for its abolition from the Hong Kong Consumer Council, which estimates that it boosted bank profits by HKDollars 5.2bn in 1991. The council argues this was largely at the expense of small consumers. The banks maintain that the cartel reinforces stability and avoids the need for them to impose fees and charges that could cost consumers HKDollars 4bn a year. Yet few bankers are optimistic that margins can be sustained indefinitely. 'I do not foresee dramatic change, but over time profitability will be gradually chipped away,' says Mr Nicolle of Standard Chartered. Third, banks' costs are rising. Hong Kong has traditionally been a cheap place to operate. Because the colony is so compact, banks have been able to use technology and staff efficiently. However, salaries are rising fast because of stiff competition for employees, and banks that rent branches and offices face a sharp escalation in rental costs. A gradual deterioration in the banking conditions of the past three years would not constitute a disaster. The possibility remains, however, of banks being hit more severely if investors lost confidence in China's commitment to economic reform. A policy shift by China could badly disrupt Hong Kong's economy and undermine local property prices. Prices for the residential property market are thought to have fallen by about 10 per cent since Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, warned in March that the government might have to take 'exceptional' measures to curb speculation. But they remain vulnerable to a further correction as Hong Kong's interest rates rise in response to the tightening of US monetary policy. Banks in the colony depend strongly on property - 39 per cent of their profits are estimated to be linked to the sector. For the moment, most bankers believe they are unlikely to be hit by a wave of defaults on mortgages: the average proportion of income spent on repayments is only two-thirds of the peak level in 1981. That cushion might be insufficient if an economic downturn led to large falls in property prices and higher unemployment. But for most bankers, this seems an unlikely prospect. Though the windfall profits of the early 1990s may not be repeated, even those who acknowledge the risks ahead cannot bring themselves to worry too much. 'It is all too good to be true,' says Mr Makowski of Dao Heng Bank. 'But while it lasts, why not enjoy it?'</p>

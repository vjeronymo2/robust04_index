			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> TRAIN PANEL OKS CONSULTANT PACTS  </P> <P> Anaheim-based Willdan Associates was selected Friday to provide $50,000 in  civil engineering advice to the bistate commission overseeing plans for  high-speed rail service between Anaheim and Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Meeting in Ontario, the California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation  Commission also approved a $5,000-per-month government relations contract to  influential county lobbyist Frank Michelena and his Sacramento business  partner, Paula Treat.  </P> <P> Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth, who is vice chairman  of the train panel, abstained on both votes because Treat and Willdan  contributed money last year to his reelection campaign. In addition, Michelena  is listed on Roth's statement of economic interest as having provided Roth with  food and gifts last year.  </P> <P> State Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear) also abstained, for the same reasons.  </P> <P> Commission officials said the contract awarded to Michelena did not have to be  open to competitive bidding and was based solely on the recommendation of Paul  Taylor, the panel's executive director, and the commission's community and  government relations committee. The contract awarded to Willdan, however, had  been open to bids.  </P> <P> Also at Friday's session, transportation officials from San Bernardino and  Riverside counties argued that stations for the proposed high-speed train  should be built in their areas.  </P> <P> But Roth argued that firms bidding on the right to build and operate the rail  service have already been told officially that they are to recommend where the  stations should be.

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Loblaw slows fall in earnings LOBLAW, Canada's biggest food distributor and controlled by the George Weston group, slowed a long slide in profits in the final quarter of the fiscal year ended January 2 1993. However, food price wars in eastern Canada and the US continued and Loblaw took a special CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.90) charge to cover problems with a US subsidiary recently sold. Fourth-quarter net profits fell to CDollars 28.8m from CDollars 29.5m, on revenues 19 per cent ahead at CDollars 2.4bn. Per-share earnings came to 33 cents in both periods. For the year, net profits fell 24 per cent to CDollars 79.8m or 88 cents a share, from CDollars 104.7m or CDollars 1.17. Revenues rose 8 per cent to CDollars 9.6bn. Loblaw said it continued to improve market share and expected reasonable growth this year. Confederation Life, one of Canada's biggest insurers, has been hit by property woes. Net profits for 1992 fell to CDollars 1.9m, after CDollars 161m of special charges, from CDollars 17.3m a year earlier. Revenues slipped by nearly 10 per cent to CDollars 3.9bn. Commercial property investments totalled CDollars 7.5bn or 40 per cent of assets. Torstar, publisher of the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest daily newspaper, earned net profits of CDollars 48.8m or CDollars 1.21 a share in 1992, including a CDollars 54m special gain, against losses of CDollars 3.4m or 9 cents a share in 1991. Revenues rose 3 per cent to 921m. Newspaper publishing was hit by lower advertising, but books improved, the group said. Molson, the Canadian brewing and retailing group, plans to buy back up to 4.48m non-voting A shares and may propose a bye law to ensure that A stockholders would participate equally with the voting stock in case of a takeover. The buy-back will be financed with CDollars 180m received in a brewing deal with Miller of the US.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: ANTIQUES;  </P> <P> MAKE MINE MEISSEN  </P> <P> ONE OF THE EARLIEST, and arguably the finest, hard-paste porcelains was  produced in China as early as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 to 906). Made of kaolin,  a fine white clay mixed with feldspar, it was fired at high temperature. And  the ingredients fused to make the hard, white non-porous pottery that was  sought after far and wide. Export porcelain from China was enormously popular  in the West, and by the 18th Century, Europeans were importing a million pieces  a year.  </P> <P> It took a long time for European manufacturers to learn the secret of making  hard-paste porcelain. A viable formula was developed in 1709 by J. F. Bottger  and others in Meissen, a small town outside Dresden in Saxony (now part of East  Germany). And soon after, the first true porcelain factory in the Western World  was established by one Frederick Augustus, elector of Saxony. Production began  in 1713.  </P> <P> Meissen porcelain compared favorably with Chinese models, both from a technical  and an artistic point of view. The first designs were close to the Chinese in  inspiration, although after the 1720s, a form of German rococo became popular.  By then, Meissen perfected the characteristic brilliant-white paste, enamel  colors and graceful styles on which the factory's reputation rests today.  Painted decoration was derived from many sources: from Japanese enameled  pottery, for example, and from Chinese famille verte porcelain. To these were  added innumerable European scenes -- landscapes, harbors and groups of urban  and rural figures, often set in panels on colored grounds.  </P> <P> Before long, Meissen's famous crossed-blue-swords logo was known and respected  around the world. The firm's most talented sculptor and designer, J. J.  Kandler, virtually created the European porcelain figure. Among the most  popular pieces produced were the models of children and mythological characters  made between 1860 and 1890 and the models of soldiers that appeared after 1870.  Designs from the 18th Century continued to be produced, and to this day remain  in vogue.  </P> <P> For today's collector, Meissen work is generally scarce and expensive. But  because such a wide variety of artifacts was produced -- baskets, plates,  bowls, tea caddies, candlesticks, figurines, scent bottles, snuff boxes, dinner  services, tureens, vases and more -- bargains occasionally appear. Examples  from recent auctions include: a cane handle, circa 1743 ($9,000), a teapot and  cover, circa 1725 ($9,000), a figure of a jay ($17,500) and a figure of a  rhinoceros ($2,300), both modeled by Kandler, circa 1745, and a circular snuff  box with a solid-gilt interior, circa 1770 ($27,500).  </P> <P>  Meissen may be found at the following locations: Quatrain, (213) 652-0243, and  Robert Stewart Reed, (213) 657-3644, in Los Angeles; Speidel Antiques, Pacific  Palisades, (213) 459-1611; Panache Unlimited, Fullerton, (714) 879-2696;  Roberta Gauthey, (714) 494-9925, and Richard Yeakel, (714) 494-5526, in Laguna  Beach; Castle Antiques, Costa Mesa, (714) 646-3333; Snooty Fox, Ventura, (805)  648-5484; and Hood Antiques, (619) 281-8034, and Mission Gallery, (619)  692-3566, in San Diego.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / El Salvador clinches aid from EC THE European Community will step up economic and political co-operation with Central America to promote development and human rights, following a meeting of EC and Central American foreign ministers which ended in Lisbon yesterday. Several programmes of economic and technical assistance were agreed, including Ecu13.8m (Pounds 9.78m) to help improve telecommunications in the six Central American countries, and a separate Ecu7m for El Salvador to support small enterprises and projects in areas most affected by the 12-year civil war. Assistance to support national reconstruction in El Salvador was also discussed yesterday in a separate meeting called by Portugal, the current EC president, with representatives from the Community, the US, Canada, Japan, other donor countries, and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. El Salvador's government says it needs around Dollars 1bn to rebuild the economy following the civil war. The EC has already promised up to Ecu50m. In Washington yesterday, President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador said he expected the US to provide around Dollars 250m in reconstruction aid. The Bush administration has asked Congress to approve the aid and has promised to give its full support to moves to help rebuild El Salvador's economy, Mr Cristiani said. The announcement came as a surprise to EC officials who reacted with some irritation. 'It's another example of the US jumping on an initiative without telling anyone else and claiming leadership,' said one diplomat in Lisbon. Support for human rights and democracy were dominant concerns among EC ministers who also agreed to an Ecu1.5m programme for the promotion of human rights in the region. This will help to provide better training for police and armed forces, and support human rights initiatives.</p>

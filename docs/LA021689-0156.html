			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: THEY'VE COME OFF THE STREETS TO MAKE THINGS WORK OUT  </P> <P> The exercise studio sits in a little section of Santa Monica where trendiness  meets desperation. The upscale studio is some kind of converted garage, and the  big corrugated tin door is usually lifted open, allowing in the breezes from  off the Pacific Ocean a block away. On the sidewalk, marchers in the passing  parade look in. Some stop to watch the action, nodding in time to the pounding  rock music that you just can't work out without. Eardrums need exercise, too.  </P> <P> Many of the spectators are street-type people, dazed and down and out, not in  Beverly Hills, but close. Most of the exercisers appear to be nearer the  opposite end of the socioeconomic scale.  </P> <P> "We see the people walking by," says Kim Haves, director of Main Street Dance  and Exercise Studio. "The diversity (between the exercisers and the spectators)  is huge."  </P> <P> An awkward situation. What to do? Main Street decided to offer workouts for the  homeless, which I thought was pretty hilarious when I heard about it.  </P> <P> Shades of Marie Antoinette! The people are hungry? Let them do abdominal  crunches.  </P> <P> This is a perfect example, it seemed, of why the rest of the world makes fun of  Southern California. This is a perfect example of why Southern Californians  make fun of Southern California.  </P> <P> As it turns out, I was slightly wrong, a unique development.  </P> <P> The Main Street staff doesn't herd bag ladies and winos in off the street and  have them dance around to "Sledgehammer."  </P> <P> What they do is offer free workouts to "transitional" homeless, which means  people who have entered recovery-type houses in order to begin putting their  lives back together. If exercise is good for the body and soul, a theory that  is the foundation of all sports except Clipper basketball, why should only the  well-to-do have access?  </P> <P> The program was inspired by a thief. About a year ago, Main Street hired a  recovering street-type person to work at the studio. He was a sterling  employee, except for his sticky fingers. He ripped off several thousand bucks  from the studio safe, almost bringing the mom-and-pop type operation to its  knees.  </P> <P> This incident, instead of turning Main Street management's hearts against  society's rubble, turned attention to the problem right outside the open garage  door.  </P> <P> Main Street owner Lisa De Mondesir contacted local social-aid programs, and she  and her small staff instituted the fitness classes for the homeless. They also  started a dance class for battered women from a local shelter, and a physical  theater workshop for runaway teens and recovering addicts, taught by Kim Haves'  husband, Stefan. There are about 35 regulars in the three programs.  </P> <P> It's all financed by contributions from corporations, local businesses, and  even from some of the Main Street workout regulars. The classes are taught by  the studio's instructors, working free.  </P> <P> Only in Los Angeles, world capital of two breeds: the homeless and the fitness  snob. The twain have met to sweat.  </P> <P> One recent evening, four men and two women from the nearby halfway house were  huffing through an hour-long workout. They were all wearing new shoes and  workout outfits, donated by Reebok and earned by faithful attendance at two  months' worth of classes.  </P> <P> At hour's end, the exercisers staggered off the floor with the kind of tired  exhilaration you see in a team that has just won a big game.  </P> <P> "I stopped coming here for a while," said Martin, a hipster-surfer type. "I was  going out with the same girl I used (drugs) with. When I started working out,  she thought it was a joke. She laughed at me, and it was embarrassing. I  figured she must be right, that it was a joke, so I stopped coming.  </P> <P> "I'm glad I came back. Now, when I talk to people, I don't look at the ground."  </P> <P> Martin was into heroin and pills. He did time in a youth detention center for  attempted murder. He said he merely fired a warning shot over the head of  someone who was threatening him. Like others in the class, Martin seemed like a  person with a lot of energy in need of an outlet.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode," said Caryn. "I come down here and  let it out. What did I do to let it out before? Use.  </P> <P> "If I don't work out, I go crazy. It's my new addiction."  </P> <P> It took some recruiting to pry most of these people from the relative safety of  their transitional home and into a dance and exercise class.  </P> <P> "For me, personally, I could never picture myself in a crowd like this,  dancing!" Gilbert said. "Before, I'd rather make a fool of myself in a bar,  flat-face on the floor."  </P> <P> Stanley, a man who spent most of the last couple of years living in streets and  alleys after the breakup of his family, said, "This makes me feel like part of  the community, getting back in tune with people."  </P> <P> Funny, but it turns out that Stanley works out for the very same reason Jane  Fonda works out.  </P> <P> "It helps you get comfortable in your skin," he says.  </P></p>

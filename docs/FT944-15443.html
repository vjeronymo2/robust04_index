			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (3): Mafia gangs target the west - The former Soviet Union / Jimmy Burns on fears of money laundering There are increasing fears among regulators and law enforcement agencies that so-called Russian Mafia networks may be penetrating western financial systems with the object of laundering their illicit cash. The break-up of the Soviet Union has brought in its wake a huge flight of capital estimated by senior bankers to be as much as Dollars 1bn a month. It has also led to a proliferation of gangs involved in financial corruption and illegal trade whose operations threaten to extend well beyond the former Soviet Union states. These fears were voiced in July this year by Albert Pacey, the director-general of the UK's National Criminal Intelligence Service, during a visit to Moscow and in evidence to a House of Commons committee. British police believe that although Russian gangsters are most active in eastern Europe and Germany, there are indications that they may move their operations to other parts of western Europe. The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) refuses to discuss specific cases. However, last year under new regulations requiring banks and other institutions to report 'suspicious financial transactions', there were 13,000 cases reported to NCIS of which 200 involved Russians. 'That is not a large number, but what distinguished the Russian cases were the amounts involved - from Pounds 500,000 to several million pounds,' says Mr Pacey. An NCIS briefing paper earlier this year states that 'the nations of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union have enormous potential to impact significantly upon Europe and the United Kingdom . . . the situation in the Russian Federation continues to give particular cause for concern.' According to NCIS, the significance of the UK in terms of criminal groups emanating from the Soviet Union and eastern Europe is that 'UK financial institutions, over a long period, are being used for the transfer of large sums of illicit funds'. NCIS identified four areas for potentially illicit transactions emanating from the former Soviet Union: Laundering of funds from 'general criminal activity' including extortion; Laundering of funds involving trade in high-technology equipment; Laundering of funds from the sale of weapons, commodities, and precious metals, including radio-active material; and The transfer to the west of former Communist Party funds. The extent to which regulatory authorities in the west are managing to curb these illicit activities remain unknown. Theoretically, any unusual cash transfers to the UK emanating from the former Soviet Union should be brought to the attention of the Bank of England, while Russian businessmen wishing to set up a trading operation in the UK are subject to immigration controls. In practice, according to some senior bankers, some Russians may be taking advantage of areas such as the property business, which is not subject to significant institutional controls. They may also be using offshore centres to confuse investigators tracking money flows. Ray King, finance director of Chartwell International (UK), a financial consultancy firm which specialises in the former Soviet Union, says part of the problem for regulators in the west is identifying what amounts of Russian flight capital actually emanate from criminal activity. 'If you are a western bank it is very difficult to know what the current rules and regulations are regarding capital export from the former Soviet Union,' says Mr King. He believes that it is difficult to prove that any of the Russians who are investing in property in London or setting up trading companies are engaging in illegal activity 'although there are clearly a few cowboys who are bending the rules'. There is certainly some evidence suggesting that the problem may be even graver. According to other banking sources, some trading companies in the UK have in recent months been approached by individuals in the former Soviet Union with known connections with the criminal fraternity who asked them to arrange for transfers running into several millions of pounds. Meanwhile, some estate agents are thought to have refused to proceed with contracts with Russians after becoming suspicious about the amount of money available and the dubious nature of references given. Few money transfers, however, involve a direct transaction between the former Soviet Union and the UK. One area of concern to regulators is the financial offshore centre of Cyprus where numerous 'brass-plate' Russian companies have been set up together with banks to facilitate hard currency deposits by businessmen and officials. There are suspicions that some of the Cyprus-based companies - with on-transfers to other financial centres such as Switzerland - are being used to launder illegal profits from activities such as arms smuggling, prostitution, and bogus trade deals.</p>

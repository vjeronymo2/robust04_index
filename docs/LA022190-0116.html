			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTEN TIME;  </P> <P> FASHION: FOR A LONG TIME BILL WHITTEN DESIGNED IN OBSCURITY WHILE HIS ROCK  MUSIC CREATIONS STOLE THE SPOTLIGHT, BUT NO MORE.  </P> <P> Talking about the Grammys disturbs Bill Whitten.  </P> <P> Over the years he has designed more costumes for more Grammy winners than he  can count. Michael Jackson's beaded, spangled stage clothes are Whitten  creations. So are Lionel Richie's, Neil Diamond's and even some of Elton  John's.  </P> <P> But, there is no Grammy award for the category of costume design. So, at  tonight's televised presentation, when more than 60 awards will be handed out  -- some for categories as esoteric as album notes -- there won't be a Grammy  for the designer who put Michael Jackson in a single rhinestone glove.  </P> <P> "I'm just as much a part of the music industry as Michael Jackson," Whitten  said.  </P> <P> He was perched on a tall stool with his thin arms wrapped tightly around his  chest. His matted tendrils of shoulder-length hair, brocade slippers and black  tunic topped by a collar of black boa-feathers read like a rock fashion calling  card.  </P> <P> The feathered collar covered his chest and each time he rocked back and forth  in frustration, as he did any time the conversation tended toward Grammys, one  or two would drift to the floor, adding to the feathered nest that encircled  him.  </P> <P> Whitten's name is rarely recognized outside the music business, yet his  clothing designs are known the world over. With each moon-walking step and hand  gesture, Michael Jackson displayed the Whitten style. The single glove and  ankle-high black pants, and white socks with loafers were all designed for one  purpose.  </P> <P> "It was very simple," Whitten calmly explained. "The audience was missing his  hand and feet movements. They couldn't see the quick gestures he was making."  </P> <P> Whitten dressed Elton John in extravagant capes and electric boots. He put  Stevie Wonder in African print caftans and took Neil Diamond out of flower  embroidered shirts and into bugle beads.  </P> <P> "When I came into the business the only man in a beaded jacket was Liberace.  Nobody had tasty beading for men. Nobody."  </P> <P> Neil Diamond was the first performer to find Whitten, back in 1974. Whitten had  opened a custom shirt business called Workroom 27. The tiny shop was virtually  invisible, located on the second floor of a building on Santa Monica Boulevard  in West Hollywood. It was open for six months before the first customer walked  through the door. Then Diamond showed up.  </P> <P> It wasn't long before Diamond became an advocate of Whitten's custom-designed  clothes, and he spread the word. Doc Severinsen found his way to Workroom 27,  and he brought the members of the band Chicago. Jim Brown came in and returned  with Hugh Hefner. The domino effect took a year and a half to pay off. When it  did, Whitten went from leasing one room to buying the entire building.  </P> <P> At the height of his rock 'n' roll rag business he had a factory that employed  50 people churning out the stage clothes for 20 groups -- the Commodores, the  Jacksons, Edgar Winter and Steppenwolf among others -- as well as stars and  regulars on the Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor television shows.  </P> <P> "They (lead singers) didn't have one place they could go that could outfit them  and the band. I was the one source for all that."  </P> <P> Whitten's business crested as more and more bands demanded a personalized stage  style. Then he became selective and scaled his client list to include only  top-rung performers. Today he regularly suits up Michael Jackson, Lionel  Richie, his old friend Neil Diamond and others such as magicians Siegfried and  Roy.  </P> <P> As he tried to down-scale his business, his popularity seemed to grow not only  among performers but their wives and friends, and the fashion cognoscenti. Two  of his most ardent clients are Brenda Richie, wife of Lionel, and Susan Fields,  (of the Chicago retail empire, Marshall Fields).  </P> <P> Finally, he decided to give into the demand by opening a store on Melrose  Avenue.  </P> <P> The store, called Bill Whitten, is scheduled to open March 4 and will carry  everything from pajamas to evening wear for men and women. The broad range of  apparel and accessories is priced at the high end of the spectrum. T-shirts  start at $50 and some of the evening gowns top off at $20,000.  </P> <P> The clothes are not as outlandish as some of his stage costumes. The lines are  clean and spare. They have to be, because the surface textures run riot. White  silk suit jackets for men are beaded with bits of bone. Whitten sews metal  sequins on 150-year-old, hand-loomed fabric from the Far East to make jackets.  Evening dresses using a floral motif have beading that traces the print, adding  three-dimensional pistils and stamens for the flowers.  </P> <P> Whitten's most inventive decorations appear on tuxedos. Scrolls of embroidery  decorate the shoulders and pocket flaps, and peek around the vents of tuxedo  jackets. Other black wool tux jackets sport large shawl collars of matte black  suede or slick black leather.  </P> <P> The clothes invite touching. From the sheer cotton voile pajamas and nubby  chenille jackets to the fish skin boots that feel like leather, everything  demands a tactile encounter, which is why the store is designed to look more  like a gallery than a retail space. The expensive dresses will be kept in a  glass vault.  </P> <P> The prices shriek Rodeo Drive. The workmanship on the garments is akin to  European couture. And the exquisite beading and embroideries seem incongruous  on the street known for its funky, forward clothes. But Whitten says the drums  of the underground beat louder in West Los Angeles than they do in Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> "I have to create the underground trend first," he says. "Those are the people  I need to reach." So he is starting on both coasts in the trendy pulse points,  Melrose Avenue first and then, in early summer, in Manhattan's SoHo District.  If other cities want a Bill Whitten store, he's only too happy to oblige. He  intends to franchise them.  </P></p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / The Markets: Resting the case for the defence - Global Investor In the United States it was the blue rinse widows who were accused of pushing up stock prices in their flight from low short term interest rates. In Britain we have the actuaries, who have an endearing habit of making assumptions about present and future income flows which ignore the market's view of capital value. If employers are not to face vast increases in pension contributions, their funds have to generate the kind of returns that keep the actuarial profession happy. Trustees and fund managers are thus hungry for income and are tempted to behave like blue rinse widows, chasing either high yields or short term capital gains. Small wonder that commercial property is in vogue for the first time in years. The nervous gyrations in the securities markets since Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised US short term rates 10 days ago are perfectly designed to encourage that interest. A high yielding real asset with no stock market quotation has a strong feelgood factor for insomniac fund managers when equity valuations are in dangerous, low-yielding territory. Nor is it just that land, bricks and mortar have defensive merit. As the chart demonstrates, property has not looked so cheap relative to equities for years. Rents, which must over the long run bear some relationship to the economic cycle, are at their lowest level, in real terms, since the 1960s. Property is the last haven of value in a mature bull market. It is the only asset category where the yield looks high both by historical standards and in relative terms. It also has a huge income advantage over gold and commodities, which have been exercising such a powerful lure over the hedge fund operators. And the property yield curve, the relationship between short term interest rates and property yields, again provides bankers with a powerful incentive to lend to property entrepreneurs. For the first time since the 1960s it is possible for a developer to contemplate putting up a building that will generate an immediate income surplus over the cost of servicing a mortgage debenture. In the short run that will put further downward pressure on yields, even if in the long run it leads to an oversupply of space. There are snags. For a start, rents are still falling. Modern leases no longer run to 25 years as they did at the chart's starting point and the property fraternity is waiting anxiously to see whether the government will end upward-only rent reviews on leases. That would seriously reduce the quality of the financially engineered income stream that property now offers. The illiquid nature of the asset provides a more fundamental reason for a risk premium over gilts and equities, a premium which also has to reflect the fact that the product cycle has shortened. Money has to be spent on property at closer and closer intervals if it is to remain attractive to potential tenants. For Mr Norman Bowie, the former partner in Jones Lang Wootton who first emphasised the importance of making full allowance for depreciation in property valuation, this implies that stock selection, supported by research on location, and the local or regional economy, is the sine qua non for successful investment. The trouble is that once people wake up to the merits of property it becomes increasingly difficult to follow that advice. In the nature of things, entrepreneurs find it easier than investment institutions. This is a very imperfect market where the best opportunities tend to be made rather than bought. Some parts of the market already look over-excited, notably retail property, where the fall in the yield on the Investors Chronicle Hillier Parker index over the past year from 7.5 per cent to 6.6 per cent understates the euphoria that has been apparent in some recent deals. Curious that retail real estate should have performed so well when retail shares have so dismally underperformed. In today's very uncertain conditions in the retail sector, where the buyer is unquestionably king and stands to become even more choosy after April's tax increases, that looks unsustainable. I suspect that many property investors' perceptions about retailing still reflect the merry days of the 1980s consumer boom. That was heavily influenced by a one-off change in the personal sector's balance sheet and borrowing habits resulting from financial deregulation. It will not be repeated in this half of the 1990s. Dull, dull, dull There are ways of riding the wave of enthusiasm for investment in commodities without suffering the loss of income that comes from investing directly in beans, bellies and white rhino hides. Consider Hanson which reports next week. This was once a dull company with lively, acquisitive management. Now it looks to some investors like a dull company with a dull and ageing top management whose products are so dull that they look appealing in a market where anything half exciting looks horribly expensive. Coal and basic industries sound a better formula at this stage of the cycle than finance or retailing, especially when they come with recovery potential as at Hanson, with the costs of the US coal strike out of the way and the UK domestic economy on the mend. Disposals, notably that of Beazer Homes USA, add another layer to the gloss. Divestments make more sense than acquisitions in such an overheated market and at Hanson this well packaged story comes with a yield attached of only marginally less than 5 per cent. However it is still hard to buy the commodities story in an economic cycle where the economies of the big industrialised countries are so unsynchronised and there is so much deflation still going on in Japan and continental Europe. Growth in China and the dynamic Asian economies will ultimately make big demands on energy and other raw materials markets, but the officials in Beijing are trying to damp down the rip-roaring Chinese economy. And there is something uncomfortably suspicious about a market in which highly leveraged hedge fund operators succumb to an outbreak of serious long-termism. The convincing aspect at Hanson consists largely of that yield, which is nearly 50 per cent more than the market average. But this is no time to be snobbish about such things. It is certainly not when so many other current analysts' favourites in dull, old-fashioned British engineering are yielding less than Hanson and sport multiples that are discounting rising earnings for as far as the eye can see. Take British Steel, where on some estimates the prospective 1995 price earnings ratio is a little less than 20 and today's yield is 1.3 per cent. No doubt the dividend will be raised as earnings recover. But that is, in the analytical jargon, a forward looking rating, as are those at companies like GKN and Lucas Industries. Now turn to the unfashionable financial sector and compare those ratings with General Accident, where the current yield is 5.1 per cent. There are worries about where the insurance cycle will peak, but we do know that GA does not cut the dividend. If you think that the bull market is alive and well, and that last week's dizzy spell was a mere blip, you will not be concerned. Remember, however, that this is an economic cycle in which markets are playing a disproportionate role in financial intermediation, whereby money is channelled from savers and lenders to borrowers and spenders. In the words of Mr Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research, the S&amp;P is the American money supply. So if Mr Greenspan's monetary tightening in the US is to work, and if Wall Street still exerts an influence on London, Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, and indeed all the other relevant indices, have to undergo a correction. The case for the income defence rests.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 10/2/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Per cent change over period  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           US      Japan  Germany   France  Italy   UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week      0.06    0.04    0.12     0.12    0.16    0.10 Month     0.26    0.20    0.51     0.55    0.72    0.45 Year      3.63    3.22    7.25     9.63   10.94    5.63  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week     -0.62    0.10   -0.29   -0.301    0.05   -0.47 Month    -0.83   -1.89   -0.65    -0.58    0.89   -0.12 Year      6.61    7.19   10.52    15.76   24.18    9.95  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week     -1.04    0.47   -0.61    -0.31   -0.22   -1.13 Month    -1.42   -3.49   -1.35    -0.89    0.89   -1.35 Year      9.71    9.21   13.15    19.95   34.53   16.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Week      -1.6    -0.3    -3.2     -1.2     1.1    -2.2 Month     -0.3     6.7    -6.1      0.1    15.2    -0.1 Year       8.4    25.1    27.2     31.4    44.0    27.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES                 IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO  10/2/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   PER CENT CHANGE                            CLOSE    WEEK   MONTH    YEAR  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Femsa B (Mex )              24.6    23.3    18.3    134.3 Mycom (Mal)                 7.80    21.9    17.3    217.9 Nitsuko (Jap)           1,600.00    18.5   100.0    183.2 Yuasa Corp.

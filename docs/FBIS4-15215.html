			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- A senior aide to Russian  President Boris Yeltsin said Saturday [2 April] Russian  reformist politicians will band to create a new political group  intent on reinvigorating moves toward democracy.    Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Intelligence Policy  Committee of the State Duma, said in an interview with Kyodo  News Service in Tokyo that the new group will help prevent  Russian democratic forces from being splintered.    The State Duma is the 450-member lower house of the Russian  parliament.    The group will consist of Poltoranin, former Deputy Prime  Minister Yegor Gaydar, former State Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis  and other reformist politicians, he said.    The establishment of the new group will be pushed to help  accomplish Yeltsin's recent proposal to have the Russian  parliament adopt a declaration committing all political forces  to seek to achieve national reconciliation, he said.    Poltoranin said he is convinced that Yeltsin will agree to  join the new group, saying the president is aware that he has  drawn his political strength chiefly from reformist politicians.    "The president is aware that his support base comes from  reformists and he would end up losing his power if he lost their  support," he said.    Poltoranin dismissed as false propaganda the rumors that the  health of Yeltsin has deteriorated to a level so bad as to make  it difficult for him to engage in his presidential duties.</p>

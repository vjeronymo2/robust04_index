While meeting and feting outgoing Chinese Ambassador to  Portugal Wu Tao, Foreign Minister Barroso said: After  establishing diplomatic relations in 1979, particularly after  the Portuguese and Chinese Governments signed a joint communique  on the Macao issue in 1987, the two countries have been  enhancing bilateral relations in an all-around manner.    Barroso said: Portugal and China have different national  conditions and systems. However, their ways of resolving  problems left over by history and of handling relations between  the two countries can be termed exemplary. He expressed the  hope that Portugal and China will further enhance bilateral  relations and will continually make contributions to advancing  the common interests of the Portuguese and Chinese people and to  facilitating global peace and prosperity.    The Portuguese foreign minister also pointed out: At  present, the Portuguese and Chinese Governments are making joint  efforts to facilitate a smooth transfer of Macao. Macao has  become a link for the two countries to enhance bilateral  relations. Portugal and China will still continue to maintain  friendly relations for generations after 1999.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez </F> with unidentified reporters on the agreement reached by the  Guatemalan Government and the General Command of the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, to create the Commission for  Historical Clarification, CEH; place and date not given;  broadcast in progress -- recorded]    [Text] [Enriquez] ...a historical event. As President  Ramiro De Leon Carpio visited -- I believe -- the Roosevelt  Hospital, he was asked the same question. I believe my reply  will be the same. I must tell you that the Guatemalan  Government's political resolve is shown once more. Reaching a  full and lasting peace is our objective. We believe the work  done by the government's peace delegation in Oslo was excellent.  I congratulated them for their almost 15 days of hard work. I  can tell you from experience that this type of work is  exhausting. However, this work was not completed in vain,  because we took two more steps toward achieving the peace we all  desire.    [Reporter] Is the Army satisfied with the agreement reached  by the government and Army representatives?    [Enriquez] I do not think any military members disagree with  accepting and signing certain agreements. What we are doing  here has national resonance, and those things that could affect  the Army have institutional resonance. I refuse to believe  someone will place his personal interests above national and  general interests. As I said earlier, this situation does not  prevail in the Army. Of course, there may be someone who is  unsatisfied because it was once said that the Army would never  hold talks with armed groups. This was even said at Esquipulas  II. However, the Guatemalan Army is an institution that always  respects the Army General Commander's mandates. On that  occasion, it was said that there were going to be talks with  subversives, and we held talks with them. There are even Army  members currently holding talks with subversives. From the  institutional and my personal point of view, I can tell you that  the two agreements are good enough to lead to reconciliation and  peace in Guatemala.    [Reporter] Have the objectives of the Guatemalan armed  conflict been accomplished by creating this commission? You  said on repeated occasions that there would not be an avenging  commission? Could you....    [Enriquez, interrupting] ....I believe you are completely  right. We always said, even when I was a member of the Peace  Commission, that the CEH [Commission for Historical  Clarification], which was initially called the Truth Commission,  did not intend to seek revenge. Its goal was to learn what  really happened to ensure that new generations will not make the  same mistakes and to prevent Guatemalan society from becoming  polarized to the extreme of starting to kill each other again.  These last 34 years have been very painful years of mourning,  death, deception, and polarization. It has been a very long  night for Guatemala; we now believe a dawn is coming for  Guatemala. The CEH meets the equanimity, justice, and  impartiality requirements, but, above all, the commission seeks  no revenge. This is why the cases will not be handled  individually, but collectively.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, what can be concluded from a number  of recommendations made by General Victor Manuel Argueta  Villalta?    [Enriquez] In reference to what?    [Reporter] In reference to his statement that those sectors  that wanted to question him legally lacked moral authority.    [Enriquez] I think the Guatemalan Army, as a legitimate  armed  group established to defend the State, fulfilled completely its  constitutional duties during these 34 years. All Guatemalans  must be proud of the Guatemalan Army because thanks to this  Army, this legendary Army with high morale but very poor  resources, Marxist-Leninism was not established in Guatemala.    If it were not for the Guatemalan Army, we would now be  regretting the establishment of Marxist-Leninism in Guatemala.  Because of the Guatemalan Army, we have a better Guatemala. It  is not as developed as it could have been if the subversives had  not undermined progress in Guatemala. However, we anticipate a  better Guatemala. We must all recognize that there is poverty  in the country, and we must work to achieve better standards of  living for all people. We, Guatemalans, must work to achieve  this goal. We cannot sit around and wait for money and  happiness to come from the heavens. We must all work harder and  with greater integrity, tolerance, and understanding to attain a  happy society in Guatemala.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, changing the subject, the human  rights ombudsman has requested that the Army defend the  sovereignty of Guatemala, which is being challenged by Belize.  Will you do this?    [Enriquez] That is our duty. We will fulfill our  obligations, but we also know Belizean reality and the reality  of what is currently taking place. I know this reality first  hand because I have traveled there, and if necessary, I will go  there again.    There is no problem between Belize and Guatemala at this  time. There are no definite borders; there is [word indistinct]  between El Peten and Belize. This situation will have to be  defined according to the recommendations made by this newly  installed Belize Council, as stated by the foreign minister and  the president. This Council will conduct a study and will make  recommendations to the president on a referendum or popular  consultation to end this territorial claim of Guatemala, which  is recognized by Belize, England, and the world.    [Reporter] Meanwhile, what will the Guatemalan Army do about  the threat from Belizeans to expel Guatemalans, whom you had a  chance to visit, from the neighboring area? Is there Guatemalan  Army presence there?    [Enriquez] We have soldiers there; there are also soldiers  from the Belizean Army. We have talked to the Guatemalans  residing there. They have not been forced to leave the area.  We coordinated efforts with the INTA [National Institute of  Agrarian Reform] president. The commander of Military Zone No.  23 is aware of these efforts, and he was instructed to assist  these people. But they will not be removed from the area.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]?    [Enriquez] This cannot be done. That could create a more  serious conflict in the area.    [Reporter] What will happen if the Belizean Army wants to  expel these Guatemalans? This is our concern.    [Enriquez] My answer to that is the following: The chief of  the Belizean Army spoke to [name indistinct] Rodriguez, and he  told him that they were not interested in evicting these  Guatemalans. He said that they should leave once they obtain  land, that they will be offered transportation to move to their  own land, and that they will not be moved from one place to the  other. They will leave that area, which is an ecologically  protected area. There is a Maya cemetery in the area.    [Reporter] In the meantime, you will not allow that they  be...    [Enriquez, interrupting] Listen, our main duty is to protect  our fellow citizens, and we will give our lives for our fellow  citizens. You can rest assured of this.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, going back to the Truth Commission  issue, people's sectors have expressed violence could increase  while [words indistinct] is approved. What is the opinion of  the Army?    [Enriquez] Well, the accords for the creation of the  Commission were already approved and signed.    [Reporter] Yes, but these groups fear violence may increase  before the Truth Commission begins operating.    [Enriquez] I know this Commission will begin working  immediately after the final accord is signed.</p>

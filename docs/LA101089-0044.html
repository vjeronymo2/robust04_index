			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCCER GAMES ON SCHOOL SITE GET OFFICIAL KICKING AROUND  </P> <P> Kids playing soccer on the school grounds on a sunny fall afternoon. What's  wrong with that? Well, in one North County community, it's illegal.  </P> <P> "Incredible," said Solana Beach schools Supt. Ray Edman. "But true."  </P> <P> The schoolyard in question is the future Fairbanks Ranch elementary school to  be built in 1991, or '92 at the latest, depending upon Edman's success at  solving the bureaucratic maze that the state imposes on school districts.  </P> <P> The schoolyard is home to more than 200 soccer-crazy youngsters. Add to that  gang their parents, their coaches and their fans, and there's usually quite a  crowd on the 9-acre site of the future school, at the corner of El Apajo and  San Dieguito Road.  </P> <P> Jaguars and station wagons line the curb. Sounds of the competition echo from  behind the shrubs that line the vacant lot. Good clean fun. But illegal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Permit Needed  </P> <P> San Diego County lawyers told the Solana Beach school district in December that  county zoning laws require the district to obtain a permit before any nonschool  usage of the Fairbanks field can be allowed.  </P> <P> The cost of the permit, which probably would be granted, is a bit steep for the  small elementary school district. Edman estimates that it would cost from  $3,000 to $12,000, plus six months' of effort, to obtain the required county  document.  </P> <P> Ironically, once the school is built, the grounds will be open to the soccer  players and any other group that meets the district's criteria because school  property is exempt from county zoning ordinances.  </P> <P> But that's tomorrow, and this is today.  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Chairman Susan Golding came to the rescue by suggesting a  middle road -- an amendment to the county's zoning ordinance that would allow  compatible activities on undeveloped school sites under the same rules that  apply for schoolyard activities.  </P> <P> But, when the matter recently came before supervisors, San Dieguito Planning  Group officials mounted a campaign against the proposal and convinced board  members to send the matter back to the county Planning Commission for another  look.  </P> <P> "We've been painted as the bad guys," Al Frowiss, planning group chairman,  said. "But this is a countywide issue," he explained, "and it is not at all  correct to bastardize the county zoning ordinance" just to allow a bunch of  children to play ball on a Fairbanks Ranch site.  </P> <P> County planners concede that a change that would allow soccer on the Fairbanks  field would also allow relatively unregulated activities on any other school  site in unincorporated areas of the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fee Waiver Suggested  </P> <P> Frowiss suggested that, instead of changing the zoning ordinance, the county  waive the permit fee for the Solana Beach school district and grant the permit,  with conditions to assure neighboring residents that the vacant lot won't  become a neighborhood nuisance.  </P> <P> Edman said the school district has rules for use of school properties, and the  rules will be followed if the county allows the district to supervise the  activities.  </P> <P> Hours of operation, types of activities, adult supervision and other  requirements will be met, Edman said, if the county will permit the school  district to take charge of its Fairbanks property.  </P> <P> Also, Edman said, "we could charge fees for the use of the site, which would  give us funds to keep the property free of litter and in shape."  </P> <P> Attorney Paul Marks, a member of the San Dieguito Planning Group, questions  whether the rules Edman plans to enforce are adequate because they contain no  requirements for fencing or restrooms.  </P> <P> Marks informed the County Planning Department that "the existing soccer field  on El Apajo in the Fairbanks Ranch area has been the subject of problems for  neighbors because the children using the soccer fields have used their back  yards as latrines."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Community Asset  </P> <P> Edman insists that the future school site is a community asset that should be  used, legally, by area youngsters for such healthy, wholesome sports as soccer.  Even rich kids need a place to play, he contends.  </P> <P> So, the Solana Beach school district is mounting a campaign to overwhelm the  opposition: letters to county planning commissioners and county supervisors and  a petition drive to obtain at least 1,000 signatures in favor of using the site  as a soccer field. A sizable band of supporters is expected to attend the  county planning commission when the issue is discussed Oct. 20.  </P> <P> But, while the planning group and school district spar over use of the vacant  land, the soccer play continues in full swing, as it has for two seasons.  </P> <P> "We must do something about this situation," Edman said. "We can't continue to  turn our backs against the use of the property. We need the authority to step  in and control activities there.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, we are going to have to act to shut the soccer field down."  </P></p>

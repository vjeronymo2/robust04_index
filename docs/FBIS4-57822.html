			<p>BFN     [Text] On 23 May, Haiti's main neo-Duvalierist group  Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti,  FRAPH, called on its militants to mobilize and oppose by arms  any attempted U.S. invasion of Haiti. Emmanuel Constant,  secretary general of this party, said during a news conference  that in case of a U.S. invasion, FRAPH would automatically  become the Haitian People's Armed Revolutionary Front [Front  Revolutionnaire Arme du Peuple Haitien].    Condemning any and all invasion plans, Constant explained  that FRAPH militants would fight invaders with machetes, sticks,  and stones [if need be]. Claiming to draw its inspiration from  the center-right but not from the extreme-right, which is made  up of rich and heartless people, Constant asked the government  of Provisional President Emile Jonassaint -- which is not  recognized by the international community -- to practice true,  non-demagogic social justice.    Constant also pointed out that UN Security Council  Resolution  No. 917, which imposes a total embargo on the country, calls for  the resignation of Police chief Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel  Francois, while the Governors Island agreement and the  parliamentary plan for solving the crisis provided only for his  transfer within the Army. Let us listen to Emmanuel Constant.    [Begin Constant recording] In spite of the gestures of good  will made by all sectors in Haiti, including the political,  people's, military, civilian, professional, and private sectors  -- and the parliamentarians surpassed themselves -- the cartel  made up of Aristide, Barnes, Casimir, and the Black Caucus wants  to keep killing people by imposing a genocidal embargo on Haiti  as of 21 May. The government of the president of the Republic,  attorney Emile Jonassaint, must be able to restore order and  discipline immediately so that social justice can reign in  Haiti. His ministers -- regardless of whether or not they have  experience -- should immediately effect administrative and  judicial reforms and set up an emergency program aimed at  helping the population, in view of this genocidal Resolution No.  917 of the UN Security Council. [end recording]    But this is not all. FRAPH's organization secretary made  proposals to the Haitian Army. Let us listen.    [Begin Constant recording] FRAPH wishes the Haitian Armed  Forces not to receive any foreign or local mediators, because  the Army is a branch of the executive and cannot negotiate with  itself. FRAPH wishes the military to work toward the  professionalization of the Army and the improvement of the  working and living conditions of Haitian soldiers, and to  withdraw completely from this negotiation dossier.

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No better in Scotland Sir, I think that the article by Gerald Cadogan (Property, April 16/17) may leave people with the impression that the system of home-buying in Scotland is better than that in England and Wales. It is neither better nor worse; it is equally deficient. True, there is no gazumping, but the downside for the buyer in Scotland is as follows. The great majority of homes are advertised for sale as 'offers over' a certain amount. A closing date is announced for the offers, and each person interested in the home must pay for a survey and then put in their offer - in total ignorance of how much other offers are or how much is expected - by the closing date. It is a blind bidding system with no negotiation. If your bid is not the highest, your offer will almost certainly not be accepted and you will have lost the money you paid for the survey - at least Pounds 100 for just a valuation survey. Blind bidding or gazumping, home-buying in Britain is no joy. Steven R Huggins, ground floor right, 18 Balcarres Street, Morningside, Edinburgh EH10 5JD</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Further delay for Lebanese debut Lebanon's debut eurobond offering is now planned for late September, after being delayed twice in the last year due to adverse market conditions, particularly for emerging market borrowers. The offering, now expected to raise Dollars 150m rather than the Dollars 300m originally planned, will be preceded by a series of investor presentations. The mandate for the deal has been awarded to Merrill Lynch. Dealers said there had been no real price talk for the issue, and the maturity date had yet to be decided. However, the deal is expected to short-dated, and price talk earlier in the year suggested that the deal would be in the region of 350 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield. 'The message on Lebanon is fairly positive,' said one syndicate manager. 'Things have turned around pretty quickly there, and the economic numbers are looking good.' However, Middle Eastern countries do not have a history of borrowing in the eurobond market, and investors are likely to require extensive briefings on the economic outlook for the country. Further, some investors will be unable to participate in the deal because the country has no credit rating. However, dealers said that Lebanese flight capital held in Switzerland was likely to be invested in the paper, and such investors would not be concerned by the lack of a rating. Elsewhere, dealers are still expecting Japan Highway's Dollars 500m government-guaranteed 10-year deal to be launched before this weekend. The market will then brace itself for a slew of Japanese issue from the likes of Metropolis of Tokyo, the Japan Development Bank and the City of Kobe. Yesterday, General Electric Capital Corporation and the Council of Europe each launched offerings in the eurolira sector totalling L150bn. The high 11 1/2 per cent coupon on GECC's three-year deal proved attractive to retail investors, who will hold the bonds until maturity, and so are not necessarily concerned about interest rate volatility in the Italian market.</p>

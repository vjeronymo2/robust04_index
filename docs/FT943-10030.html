			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Pin-striped debt collectors to pin-point Names: The growing business of demanding money The news that the Lloyd's insurance market has decided to employ debt collectors to help recover funds from loss-making Names may not be quite as alarming as it sounds. The business of collecting debts is clawing its way up-market, and is becoming a matter of pin-stripe suits and executive cars as much as baseball caps and grubby vans. Lloyd's has set up a committee, with Mr Bernard Bradford as chairman, to examine ways of collecting money. He will have no shortage of offers of help from collection agencies scenting commission and solicitors smelling litigation fees. The companies he is likely to select will not be at the frayed-cuff end of the trade and will adhere to guidelines of the Credit Services Association. These guidelines enjoin collectors to 'be circumspect and discreet when attempting to contact the debtor whether by telephone or by personal visit', and 'unless instructed otherwise, to accept all reasonable offers by debtors to pay by instalments'. The largest operators are quoted companies such as Intrum Justitia. 'It's becoming a professional industry with sophisticated computer systems,' says one practitioner. But it is still possible to be a debt collector without any qualifications. Sharks are still about. The Credit Services Association, the trade body, has 150 members but there are at least 300 debt collection agencies competing for business which, like the Lloyd's debts, often springs from the 1980s. 'When credit was abundant in the late 1980s, there was a lot of debt about,' said Mr Roy Goldsmith, association secretary. 'People were concerned about the front end of their business. They weren't so concerned about getting debt in. A lot of debt collection people saw this as an opportunity to make money.' They still do. But the competition has been made more intense with the arrival in the market of solicitors such as Dibb Lupton Broomhead, which is working with Lloyd's. 'It's cut-throat,' said the credit manager of one finance house. 'Every day I have people from these 300 firms ringing up and touting for business.' Those which win Lloyd's business will almost certainly be association members and their executives will probably be members of the Institute of Credit Management. Their first task will be to decide the nature of the debt they want to collect. Mr Terry Robinson, the chairman of Commercial Credit Consultants in Liverpool, said: 'Credit trading can be divided into two almost at the start: trade credit and consumer credit. Although they share a lot of common ground, their similarities will diminish with the ageing of the debts.' With trade debt, a collector explained, the creditor may well be dealing with a customer to whom he or she might wish to continue selling. This would suggest the need for a more sensitive approach than with a consumer debt where 'all you want is the money back the fastest and cheapest way'. Mr Bradford and his colleagues will have to decide to what extent they want to continue a relationship with their debtors. If they decide they are not interested then the going, for the debtors, might be rougher. At the start, the debt collection agency will try to contact the Lloyd's loser by letter and then telephone, Mr Robinson said. Mr Goldsmith said: 'Basically we are debt negotiators. We try and negotiate initially and often the debtor is more ready to negotiate with a third party than the party who's owed the money.' In the Lloyd's case the agency will probably be referred back to the loser's lawyer, which opens up the whole panoply of legal process. The trick here for the agency will be to decide whether the debtor is a Can't Pay or a Won't Pay. If the former, then the agency will settle for a nominal amount, if the latter, then a summons will be quickly sent. The agency will want a judgment in the County Court or the High Court and then if the debtor still refuses to pay, an enforcement order. This is the stage where, as last resort, a bailiff could be sent in by the County Court, or a sheriff by the High Court, to seize belongings. The agency could ask the court to attach the earnings of the debtor: this would have the effect of seizing money held in a bank account. It could claim a property as security. But the system does not give all the cards to the agency. Lloyd's debtors will have the chance to extend the legal process, the longer to avoid repayment. The finance house credit manager said: 'We've got people on our books with three or four County Court judgments against them and we still can't get the money out of them.'</p>

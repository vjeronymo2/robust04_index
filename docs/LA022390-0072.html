			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKE TRAGEDY GIVES RISE TO SAFETY DEBATE;  </P> <P> SURVIVAL: THE SEARCH FOR THE LAST BODY FROM CONVICT LAKE IS SUSPENDED TO LET  DIVERS REST. OPINIONS ON HOW TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS ARE DIVIDED.  </P> <P> The search for the last of seven people who drowned in this frozen Sierra lake  was suspended Thursday to allow divers to rest and organizers to bring in more  equipment.  </P> <P> But as the recovery efforts quieted, a debate began over what, if anything,  officials can do to guard against future tragedies.  </P> <P> Recovery efforts were curtailed after the Truckee, Nev., Fire District took  back the air-propelled boat that had aided teams working on the ice-capped  lake, where three teen-agers and four would-be rescuers died after they fell  through the ice Monday.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department diving team, which Wednesday  recovered five bodies from the lake bottom, also left for home and will be  replaced by another team when the search for the body of Dave Meyers, 53,  resumes within a few days.  </P> <P> Meyers was a counselor at Camp O'Neal, a residential facility where five of the  victims lived or worked. Officials at first believed they had spotted his body  with an underwater camera late Wednesday, but now believe they may just have  seen his jacket.  </P> <P> In addition to five bodies recovered Wednesday, another was brought to the  surface on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The youths who perished in the lake accident were 15-year-olds David C. Sellers  of Tulare and Shawn Rayne Diaz of Dinuba, and Ryan McCandless, 13, of Redlands.  Also killed were U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, 31, volunteer  firefighter Vidar Anderson, 58, and camp counselor Randy Porter, 36.  </P> <P> Mono County Sheriff-Coroner Martin Strelneck said the search was called off  until more equipment and fresh divers could reach the lake.  </P> <P> "We're regrouping for another attack," he said. The air-propelled boat was  returned to Truckee because it might be needed for rescues in thawing lakes  there, Strelneck said.  </P> <P> The deaths have caused a schism of sorts within the community between those  arguing that officials should do more to guard against drownings and those who  feel that common sense, not signposts and warnings, should govern conduct.  </P> <P> The Sierra is populated with independent, outdoors-oriented people who are  familiar with local conditions. But the area also is dependent on tourists, who  know little of the dangers inherent in the wild.  </P> <P> Tourism is "drastically important" to the economy of eastern Sierra resort  towns, according to Donna Forrester of the Mammoth Lakes tourism office, and  officials have portrayed the area as a playground for winter sportsmen. A  Convict Lake brochure lists ice-skating as one of the area's popular winter  sports.  </P> <P> The cable television station that serves the area routinely airs a promotion  showing skaters enjoying ice-covered Convict Lake on a sunny winter day. The ad  was pulled immediately after Monday's deaths, but returned to the air within a  day or so. After a reporter raised questions about the ad on Thursday, station  officials said it would be replaced.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials have fought efforts to open the lake to winter  fishing, which, like ice-skating or hiking, would bring people onto the lake.  Monday's tragedy began when teen-aged hikers ventured onto the lake.  </P> <P> An effort by the state Department of Fish and Game to open the eastern Sierra  for winter fishing was tabled last year after opponents, including Mono  County's Strelneck, argued that it would raise the risks of accidents like the  one Monday.  </P> <P> The current fishing season runs from the last Saturday in April until Oct. 31.  The plan would have allowed fishing year-round at Convict and other local  lakes.  </P> <P> "My concern was that this would increase the hazardous situation because of the  increased number of people walking on the ice," Strelneck said Thursday.  </P> <P> But he said that tourists and residents should exercise "common sense" before  venturing onto lakes. "We have to rely on the intelligence of individuals who  come up here to be able to use their heads," he said.  </P> <P> The weekly newspaper in Mono County, the Review-Herald, Thursday sharply  criticized the absence of signs warning of the dangerous conditions at Convict  Lake.  </P> <P> "For reasons which are all too obvious and painful, it's time that the powers  that be in the Eastern Sierra take action to assure that the scenario . . . is  never replayed," the paper declared.  </P> <P> "One hopes that these seven people have not died in vain, that we can learn  from their misfortune," the paper added in a second editorial.  </P> <P> Friends of the drowning victims have said that they will work to have signs  posted at the lake to prevent another tragedy.  </P> <P> "They definitely need signs out there," said Tracey Wood, a friend of Clay  Cutter, one of the victims.  </P> <P> "I know people are going to be rebellious, but before they advertise a lake for  ice-skating they better let people know how thin the ice is."  </P> <P> Sappell reported from Convict Lake and Decker from Los Angeles. Also  contributing to this story was Times staff writer Kevin Roderick at Convict  Lake.  </P></p>

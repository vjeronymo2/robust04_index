			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS ABLE TO OFFSET THE GRIFFEYS  </P> <P> When he was still known as Ken Griffey and the "Sr." wasn't appended to his  name, he dreamed of playing in an outfield with his son.  </P> <P> To imagine that he would hit the first in a historic sequence of back-to-back  home runs by father and son was something else.  </P> <P> "I'd think of it, but you're never sure it's going to happen," said 40-year-old  Ken Sr., who joined the Mariners on Aug. 29 after being released by the Reds.  "We had been talking about it last summer, but he was in the Northwest and I  was in Cincinnati. I just didn't think it was going to happen. . . . We weren't  trying for it. I was just trying to hit the ball."  </P> <P> Ken Jr. followed his father's example. After the elder Griffey lined an 0-and-2  pitch from Kirk McCaskill 402 feet to center field in the first inning Friday  night, 20-year-old Ken Jr. followed with a 388-foot blast into seats in  left-center to bring the 34,180 fans to their feet. "It was fun," said Ken Jr.,  who was outdone by his father on distance but not in the brilliance of his  post-home-run smile. "I just wish we'd have won the game."  </P> <P> Dave Winfield, who used to watch Ken Jr. frolic around Yankee Stadium when he  and Ken Sr. played in New York, prevented the Griffeys from fully enjoying the  night.  </P> <P> Winfield hit two home runs and had five runs batted in, becoming only the 26th  player in history to reach 1,500 RBIs, as he led the Angels to a 7-5 victory at  Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> "He had to ruin it," Ken Sr. said in mock sorrow. "He really hit them, though."  </P> <P> The night was full of memories for Winfield, who took over the club lead with  65 runs batted in as the Angels gained their fifth consecutive victory.  However, because the Oakland Athletics defeated Minnesota, 9-1, the Angels were  mathematically eliminated from the American League West race.  </P> <P> That didn't spoil the occasion for Winfield, who was 0 for 19 against the  Mariners this season until his third-inning homer off Matt Young (8-15).  </P> <P> "Tonight was like keeping up with the Joneses, only it was keeping up with the  Griffeys," Winfield said. "It was great. It was a great game. . . . It was  special, this game,"  </P> <P> Ken Jr. returned the compliment. "Winny hasn't changed a bit," he said. "I just  got taller."  </P> <P> The historic moment came after Harold Reynolds led off the game with a walk.  Ken Sr. smashed McCaskill's changeup slightly to the left of straightaway  center.  </P> <P> Ken Jr. worked the count to 3-and-0 and was given the hit sign, at least partly  because of the potential historic moment. "I've given him the green light often  on 3-and-0, but I really thought they were going to try and walk him," Mariner  Manager Jim Lefebvre said. "I almost didn't see it because I had my head  turned. . . . What a moment. You'd like to win this game after seening Senior  and Junior going back-to-back. You're never going to see this happen again. I  mean, with another father and son. I hope we see it again."  </P> <P> The 3-0 lead vanished in the third on a run-scoring single by Dick Schofield  and Johnny Ray before Winfield unloaded against Young for a 5-3 lead. The  Mariners pulled even in the seventh on a pair of unearned runs following center  fielder Devon White's misplay of Reynolds' single, but the Angels took the lead  for good after a double by Ray, a groundout, and Winfield's 18th homer of the  season, off a fastball over the plate.  </P> <P> The homer made a winner of Bob McClure (2-0). Bryan Harvey earned his 23rd save  and tied Dave LaRoche for the Angel career lead with 65 saves.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> General Manager Mike Port said Friday no decision has been made on whether  Manager Doug Rader would return next season, but the delay seems to favor  Rader's chances of getting a contract extension. It's unlikely Port would make  Rader wait if Rader was not going to be rehired. . . . Bryan Harvey's 23rd save  gave him 65 with the Angels, tying a club record held by Dave LaRoche.  </P> <P> Bobby Rose, recalled from triple-A Edmonton on Thursday, became the sixth man  to play third base for the Angels this season.  </P> <P> He follows Rick Schu, Jack Howell, Kent Anderson, Donnie Hill and Pete  Coachman. The Angels have also used six players at first, six at short and  seven at second: Johnny Ray, Mark McLemore,541290337  </P></p>

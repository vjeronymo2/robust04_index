			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Battle For Midland: TUC chief calls for referral MR NORMAN Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, added his voice to calls by trade unions that the proposed Pounds 3.7m bid for Midland Bank by Lloyds should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, Mr Willis said the proposed merger had important implications for competition and service provision in private and business banking. He said it was reported that a merged bank would control 30 per cent of all lending to medium-sized and small businesses, an area where banks were already under criticism for their lending practices. An emergency motion condemning the bid, with the feared loss of 20,000 jobs and the closure of 1,000 branches, was passed unanimously by delegates at the Wales TUC annual conference yesterday. Mr Leif Mills, general secretary of Bifu, the banking union, said industrial action would be considered if the merger went ahead. He accused Lloyds of a 'deafening silence' over what benefits would follow such a move. He said the reason behind the plan was to create advantages for those manipulating the money market.</p>

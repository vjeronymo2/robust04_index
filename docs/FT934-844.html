			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London copper prices climb to 3-month highs Copper's price rose strongly again on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, moving to its highest level for three months. In the past three trading days the cost of copper for delivery in three months has risen by 6 per cent, or Dollars 103.25, to Dollars 1,802.50 a tonne. The price rose Dollars 35 yesterday in the thin, pre-Christmas market and traders and analysts remained split about its prospects. 'The overall fundamentals of this market still remain bearish, although sentiment is currently being helped by the recent drawdown in LME stocks,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. 'However, the decline in stocks is likely to prove a temporary phenomenon and has been attributed to delayed shipments from the Commonwealth of Independent States and light Chinese offtake. US demand for copper has improved but this is not enough on its own to prompt a turnaround in sentiment in this market.' But, according to Mr Wiktor Bielski of Bain and Company, part of the Deutsche Bank Group, 'the fundamentals in the copper market are getting better all the time'. He cited US copper demand - up 8 per cent so far in 1993 - and falls in copper stocks on both the New York Commodity Exchange and the LME. Stocks represented only eight weeks' consumption, the lowest ever coming out of a recession, he pointed out. There had probably been a 1.5 per cent increase in western world copper demand this year, compared with 1992, and 'people are begining to realise there will not be a big surge in supply in 1994'. Mr Bielski said that only 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of extra annual copper capacity was scheduled for next year - the big surge was to be expected in 1995. Nevertheless, in the short term he expected profit-taking temporarily to halt copper's upward climb at between 82 cents a pound (Dollars 1,807.25 a tonne) and 84 cents (Dollars 1,851.36).  ----------------------------------------          LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS         (As at Monday's close)  ---------------------------------------- tonnes  ---------------------------------------- Aluminium          +8,825 to 2,443,325 Aluminium alloy       -60 to    48,700 Copper               -525 to   586,175 Lead                 +375 to   300,350 Nickel               +138 to   121,764 Zinc               +1,675 to   886,025 Tin                   -60 to    18,830  ----------------------------------------</p>

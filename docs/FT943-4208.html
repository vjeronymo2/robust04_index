			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Sterling futures recover Short sterling futures rose sharply yesterday when the Bank of England left short- term interest rates unchanged, writes Philip Gawith. As soon as the Bank confirmed in its morning operations that rates were on hold, prices rallied sharply. There had been fears, following the monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday, that UK monetary policy might be tightened. The Bank's stance was backed up by the release of the CBI's August distributive trades survey, which suggested a possible fall in the rate of GDP growth, and a further drop in inflation. The December short sterling contract finished 18 basis points up at 93.73 on fairly heavy volume - nearly 66,000 lots were traded. Sterling had a steady day, helped by the firmer dollar, with the trade weighted index closing at 78.8 from 78.6. Sterling three-month LIBOR eased to 5 13/32 per cent from 5 15/32 per cent. The dollar rose nearly a pfennig, helped by favourable comments from a variety of US and German officials, to finish in London at DM1.5562 from DM1.5486. It was also firmer against the yen, ending at Y99.4 from Y98.965. New York trading closed with the dollar at DM1.5565 and Y99.60. The firmer dollar caused the D-Mark to weaken against most European currencies. It finished at L1,016 against the Italian lira, from L1,019. The Swedish krona rose to SKr4.906 from SKr4.923. Analysts said short sterling had been the beneficiary of a massive short covering rally, with numerous stop-loss orders triggered, once the Bank had shown its hand. The longer end of the yield curve benefited from the distributive trades survey. Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, commented: 'This survey should effectively put the kibosh on speculation of an imminent rate hike.' Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, said the general weakness across all aspects of the survey pointed to a fall in the rate of GDP growth, with underlying retail price inflation also likely to fall over the next quarter. 'A rate rise against this background would be extraordinary,' he added. At the shorter end, Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said there had been a 'very positive reaction to the Bank's non-action'. He said the market had seen very good buying, and was awash with rumours of large stop-loss orders being triggered if prices continued to rise. The pound was helped by a good trade figure which, analysts said, showed there was less chance of a sterling crisis, and less need for the government to raise interest rates in fear of one. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.2bn shortage in UK money markets, at established rates, in its morning rounds. UK and continental European interest rate markets benefited from a string of bullish comments from senior Bundesbank officials. Bundesbank board member Mr Otmar Issing said in an interview that German inflation and M3 growth could be expected to continue their fall, while Mr Hans-Juergen Krupp said he could not understand why the dollar was so weak. A Bundesbank spokesman also confirmed that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, had not said in a speech that German short-term rates could not fall further. He had simply suggested that a decline could not be expected in the next few weeks. This prospect of lower rates was endorsed by Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets. In a research paper published today, he suggests that the discount rate is likely to be cut at least one more time. Cautioning against reading too much into these pronouncements was Mr Michael Gallagher, director of IDEA, the financial markets consultancy: 'These statements should be seen as an attempt by the Bundesbank to keep the market guessing on interest rate policy rather than a formal statement of intent.' He said the real issue was not whether economic conditions would allow another cut - inflation and money supply figures favour one - but whether it was needed. With current data suggesting the recovery was not stalling, he said a further cut was 'probably unnecessary', concluding that 'we see fading prospects for such a cut'. The US currency was helped by the Bundesbank comments, and a senior Clinton official saying the administration favoured a stronger dollar. The market largely ignored a string of comments about US-Japan trade talks. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, said the market had decided to test the upside of the current trading range after failing to break lower earlier this week. The release today of the August PPI figures should give the market new direction, as it will provide some sense of how the Fed is doing in the battle against inflation. Mr Dave Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, downplayed the PPI, saying: 'Any big market impact will have only a 30-minute half-life.'</p>

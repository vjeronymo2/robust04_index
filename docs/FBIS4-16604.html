			<p>BFN     [Text] It is possible for the dismantling of Paldiski  training reactors to start at the beginning of May. This has  been reported by Juri Tikk, the government's special  representative in Paldiski. The necessary equipment for  dismantling the reactors and the containers for transporting  nuclear fuel are in place and are located at the training  complex on the Pakri peninsula.    In the words of Tikk, the Russian side demands social  guarantees to those Russian officers who will participate in the  dismantling work. The Russian side wants a single agreement for  dismantling and evacuation to Russia of both the reactor nuclear  fuel and the entire reactor complex. The Estonian side wants a  separate agreement concerning the removal of the reactor nuclear  fuel from Estonia and a separate agreement concerning the  reactor complex being emptied of the reactor fuel, said Tikk.    The nuclear fuel can be taken away in a container either by  railway or by sea. The entire reactor, the complex weighing  (?over) 100 tonnes, can be taken to Russia by railway or by sea,  by using a floating crane and [words indistinct] special  containers. But none of the projects have as yet been finally  confirmed, stated Raul Luks.    The most dangerous stage during the dismantling of the two  reactors located on the Pakri peninsula is, in the words of Raul  Luks, the lifting of the reactor lids to remove the nuclear fuel.    At the nuclear facilities in Russia, in the words of Tikk,  on  three occasions when the lids of reactors have been opened. A  radioactive steam cloud has escaped into the atmosphere. This  has a radius of approximately 10 kms, stated Tikk.    Estonia does not intend to conceal anything during the  dismantling of the reactors, explained Tikk. In his words, a  radiation monitoring service operates in Estonia which relays  information on the level of radioactivity.</p>

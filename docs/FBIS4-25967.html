			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by staff reporters Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F> 1627) and Fang Hsiao-yi (2075 2556 1837): "In an Exclusive  Interview With Our Reporters, Governor Zhao Zhihao Says Shandong  Implements an Outward-Driven Strategy and Will Focus on Using  Foreign Capital To Build Steel Plants This Year"]    [Text] Shandong, 12 Jun -- In an interview here with our  reporters on 8 June, Shandong Governor Zhao Zhihao said that  Shandong is comprehensively implementing an outward-driven  strategy. It has adopted all positive methods and measures to  promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of  Shandong's national economy on the basis of fulfilling the  quadruplication task ahead of schedule and raise it to a new  level. These measures include inviting banking investments,  transferring stocks, exchanging markets for technology, and  expediting construction of two projects which will straddle the  next century, i.e. the development of the Huang He Delta and the  construction of offshore Shandong.    In the course of the interview, Governor Zhao said: Shandong  Province has earnestly implemented a series of principles and  policies by the party Central Committee and the State Council  and, in light of the province's reality, carried out its work in  a creative way. It fulfilled the task of quadrupling its  national economy ahead of schedule in 1993 and thus laid a good  foundation for its development this year.    Zhao said: In light of the international and domestic  situations and environments, as well as the reality in Shandong,  the provincial party committee and the provincial government  have put forward an outward-driven strategy under which Shandong  will boost its economic growth by developing its export-oriented  economy and improving the quality of its economy as a whole.  The utilization of foreign capital will be grasped as a key to  boosting economic growth and numerous flexible methods will be  adopted to extensively invite foreign investments, especially  banking investments. Great efforts will be made to increase the  number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises to over  10,000 and raise the foreign capital actually used to over $3.5  billion this year, an increase of over 50 percent. Governor Zhao  disclosed: With regard to key development projects this year,  the province has defined the direction of using foreign capital  to build large iron and steel plants, power plants, and  automobile industrial projects. The focus of foreign capital  introduced into Shandong this year will be placed on  infrastructure, basic industries, and the technological  transformation of enterprises, as well as on capital and  technology intensive industries. To this end, Shandong has  selected a number of large and medium enterprises for "grafting"  and transformation through the use of foreign capital. Governor  Zhao said: Shandong should reach a new level in its exports  this year. Beside bringing into play the role of foreign trade  companies at all levels as a main force, we should take  foreign-invested enterprises as a focus for expanding exports  and strive to increase the province's foreign exchange earnings  by 20 percent. Meanwhile, we should steadily develop Shandong's  overseas enterprises and gradually improve such networks as the  sales promotion of Shandong products abroad, fundraising,  technological cooperation, and information.    According to statistics, Shandong's overall economy has  constantly developed in a good direction this year. There are  three principal characteristics: The introduction of reform  measures has been smooth and the transition from an old to a new  structure has been stable; the national economy has developed in  a sustained way, with the major indexes satisfactory; and social  problems have been satisfactorily resolved. The masses are in a  good mood and the society is stable. Governor Zhao said: In  the first quarter of this year, Shandong's national economy  maintained its fine development momentum, with a GDP of 66  billion yuan, an increase of 18.3 percent over the same period  last year. The situation in agricultural production was fairly  good, with total summer grain output expected to top 40 billion  jin, the highest level ever. The growth in industrial production  has tended to stabilize. In the first four months of this year,  industrial output value at the township level or above rose by  27.9 percent and the production-marketing ratio was 92.1  percent, an increase of 2 percentage points over the same period  last year. The scale of investment in fixed assets was  initially kept under control and the export-oriented economy  developed steadily. Foreign exchange earnings rose by 16.1  percent and the actual use of foreign capital by 25 percent.  Financial revenue and expenditure rose steeply, with revenue  growing by 21.8 percent and expenditure by 20.9 percent. The  banking situation was fine, with deposits in financial  institutions rising by 17.46 billion yuan compared with the  figure at the beginning of this year and loans increasing by  6.26 billion yuan. Commodity sales were relatively stable, with  the total volume of retail sales growing by 28.3 percent.    Since reform and opening up over a dozen years or so ago  Shandong, characterized by its rapid, stable, and overall  development, has gradually developed into a big economic  province on China's eastern coast. After reviewing the  earth-shaking changes which had taken place in impoverished  Shandong, which in the past was noted for its people "braving  the journey to the northeast to eke out an existence," Governor  Zhao said with feeling: We owe all this to the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, to the party's basic line of "one  center, two basic points," to the correct leadership of the  central authorities, and to the hard struggle of the people of  the whole province. He said: Shandong's strategic goal in  economic and social development for some time to come will be  divided into three steps: The first step is the goal of  quadrupling the 1988 GDP ahead of schedule, which was  accomplished in 1993; the second is to octuple the GDP by the  end of this century; and the third is to attain the level of an  intermediate developed country in Asia in 2010 in terms of  economic aggregate and basically achieve modernization.    Governor Zhao said: To achieve this goal, while improving  the quality of economic development, we should strive from now  till the year 2000, to attain a higher economic growth rate than  the nation's average, with the GDP growing by an annual average  of 10 to 12 percent, the total agricultural output value by 5 to  6 percent, the total industrial output value by over 15 percent,  the added value of tertiary industry by 16 percent, the foreign  exchange earned from exports by 16 percent, and a natural  population growth rate of less than 8 per mill. Proceeding from  the actual conditions in Shandong, we should focus on doing a  good job of the "3321 project" (reinforcing the three  foundations: Agriculture, basic industries, and infrastructure;  fighting well the "three major campaigns"; invigorating Shandong  through application of scientific and technological advances,  developing the export-oriented economy, and developing tertiary  industry; and doing a good job in the two major projects  extending beyond this century: the "offshore Shandong"  construction and the development of Huang He Delta), and  cultivate a number of leading industries and superior products  so that Shandong's economy can scale a new height.</p>

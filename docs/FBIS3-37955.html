			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, February 24, LETA -- The President of Latvia  Guntis Ulmanis has accepted the resignation of his Press  Secretary Anta Busa. During the news conference at the cabinet  of minister he said that "Anta has commited a number of  inaccuracies which cannot be made good by any other means".    The resignation of the president's press secretary is  directly linked with her comments in the telephone interview to  Martins Kibilds, a reporter of the daily "DIENA". He asked Busa  to comment on president's response to the protest voiced by the  Latvian Russian-language press due to the fact that the  President Guntis Ulmanis had donated to the Latvian schools  books by Adolfs Silde. It turned out that during the Nazi  occupation Silde had published anti-semitic articles hailing the  massacres of Jews.    The answer Kibilds got from the press secretary was the  following exclamation: "It would be better if the Jews could  finally leave us alone. We have trembled and knelt before them  long enough. It should be stopped once and for all."    In the interview to the Latvian Radio Busa said that she was  forced to tender her resignation because the ruling party, the  Latvian Way, was worried about her influence on the president as  well as the increasing role of the president in the political  life of Latvia. Busa said that her persecution was inspired  directly by the Minister of Special Tasks Edvins Inkens. Inkens  in his turn remarked that none of the ministers would be able to  interview as Busa had said.</p>

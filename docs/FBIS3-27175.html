			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Korea has Agreed to International </F> Atomic Energy Agency Inspection of Nuclear Sites"]    [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], in a  statement issued in Vienna on 15 February, announced that the  DPRK had agreed to IAEA inspection of seven nuclear sites in the  Korean territory.    The talks and negotiations between the IAEA and the Korean  Government had been interrupted for as long as three weeks  before the agreement was made on 15 February. Going through the  interpretation and announcement of the nuclear inspection  activities of the IAEA, the Korean representative to the IAEA  said that he, on behalf of the Korean Government, informs the  IAEA that the Korean Government agrees to the inspection.    According to the agreement made by the two sides, the main  objective of the IAEA inspection team is to verify whether the  Korean side did not (?transfer) material from the seven nuclear  sites, which the Korean side declared after the previous  inspection activities. To facilitate the inspection work  henceforth, the Korean side is to allow the inspection team to  take photographs of these seven designated nuclear sites again  and to inspect again some nuclear facilities that the inspection  officials had sealed.    However, the agreement between the two sides does not  include  the provision that the Korean side will allow the IAEA  inspection team to inspect the two nuclear sites near Pyongyang  which the Western officials regard as secret nuclear weapon  production bases. An IAEA official welcomed the Korean decision  and said that the inspection activities will begin next week at  the latest.    The United States and the ROK welcomed the agreement as soon  as it was announced. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department  said that this was a necessary and positive step and would help  the IAEA precisely grasp the status of the Korean nuclear sites.  He added that a satisfactory result of the inspection and the  resumption of the inter-Korean dialogue on the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula would facilitate the next round of  U.S.-Korean negotiations. ROK media noted the possibility of  U.S. suspension of the U.S.-ROK Team Spirit joint military  exercise this year in view of the positive Korean attitude, in  addition to the possibility of reconsidering the plan to deploy  Patriot missiles to the ROK.    Korea has adamantly refused to admit that the nuclear sites  in the Korean territory are used for the production of nuclear  weapons, and at one time rejected IAEA inspections. The  negotiations between the IAEA and Korea on the nuclear sites was  interrupted by the Korean declaration in March 1993 that it  would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. U.S.  and Korean delegates held 18 rounds of unofficial talks on  nuclear inspection during the second half of last year, finally  reaching agreement.    The agreement is as follows: Korea agrees, in principle, to  the inspection of seven Korean nuclear sites by the IAEA. In  return, the United States will call off the ROK-U.S. Team Spirit  joint military exercise for 1994. On the basis of this  principle, the two sides agreed to prepare for the third round  of official high-level talks to discuss the issue of improving  Korean-U.S. relations.    However, after the United States had announced its plan to  deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, Korea withdrew its agreement  to the nuclear inspection.    As to how to resolve the issue of the inspections of the  nuclear sites in the Korean territory, the Western countries  called for a tough stance of putting pressure and applying  sanctions on Korea. Nevertheless, the Korean leaders said that  the Korean Government and people would never submit to the  Western pressure and threats.    The result of the negotiations between the Korean Government  and the IAEA proves that dialogue is the only effective way to  settle an international dispute. The Korean Government's  decision will be beneficial to the security and stability on the  Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia as a whole.</p>

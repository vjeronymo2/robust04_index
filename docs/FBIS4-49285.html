			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Jiangsu </F> Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission (adopted on 16  March 1994)"]    [Text] The Eighth Plenary Session of the Jiangsu  Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission was held in  Nanjing 15-16 March 1994. Thirty-three members of the  commission attended the session. The secretaries of various city  discipline inspection commissions, the directors of various city  supervisory bureaus, and the responsible persons of various  departments of provincial-level organs, of various units  directly under the provincial government, and of the discipline  inspection and supervisory organizations under the party groups  (party organizations) of schools of higher learning in Nanjing  attended the session as observers. The Standing Committee of  the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission  presided over the session.    The guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the CPC  Central Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee and the  important speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the  plenary session were reported and studied at the plenary  session. The guidelines of the State Council's meeting on  anticorruption work and the important speech made by Premier Li  Peng at the meeting were also reported and studied at the  plenary session. The plenary session held that the fact that  the Central Committee called on the whole party, while taking  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as the guide and keeping in mind the  overall interest of party work, to deepen the anticorruption  struggle in a sustained and more effective way is ample proof  that the party Central Committee and the State Council are  determined to combat corruption, improve party work style, and  promote the building of a clean government, and demonstrates the  common desire of the whole party and the people across the  country. The plenary session unanimously expressed its support  for this call and its determination to carry it out.    The plenary session heard the speech made by Chen Huanyou,  secretary of the Jiangsu provincial party committee and Jiangsu  governor. It agreed that the requirements for deepening the  anticorruption struggle set by Comrade Chen Huanyou in line with  the guidelines of the Central Committee are clear, and the  measures he proposed are forceful and that since they are in  line with the Jiangsu's reality, they must be earnestly  implemented. The plenary session discussed and endorsed the  "Opinions on Implementing the Guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and  Deepening the Anticorruption Struggle in a Sustained and More  Effective Way" delivered by Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the  Jiangsu provincial party committee and secretary of the  provincial discipline inspection commission, on behalf of the  Standing Committee of the provincial discipline inspection  commission.    The plenary session maintained that the party committees,  governments, and discipline inspection organs at all levels  across the province have done a large amount of work in  conscientiously implementing the party Central Committee's and  the State Council's "Decision on Successfully Handling a Few  Tasks Related to the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future,"  that the anticorruption drive has enjoyed a healthy development,  and that Jiangsu has achieved phased, marked successes in  carrying out the three tasks since we began implementing the  guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission in August 1993. However, we  must be aware that the progress of the work is still uneven,  that some successes are not consolidated, and that negative and  corrupt phenomena are still very serious at present. By no  means can we afford to slacken the anticorruption drive in the  slightest degree. It is necessary for party organizations at  all levels and the broad masses of party members across the  province to conscientiously study the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission  as well as Comrades Jiang Zemin's and Li Peng's important  speeches, to further improve understanding, to seek unity of  thinking, to resolutely launch the anticorruption drive in depth  and over a protracted period of time in accordance with the  anticorruption work-related plans and requirements of the  central authorities and the provincial party committee while  consolidating the successes we have achieved so far, to make  efforts to successfully fulfill various tasks, and to achieve  greater successes than last year's.    We must conscientiously do a good job in ensuring that  leading cadres of the party and government are honest and  exercise self-discipline. Leading cadres of the party and  government organs at and above the county (department) level  must continue to implement the five regulations put forth by the  central authorities last year as well as the three requirements  put forth by the provincial party committee, and must  conscientiously implement the five regulations put forth and  reiterated by the central authorities this year. We must  combine the efforts to ensure party and government cadres'  honesty, self-discipline, self-inspection, and self-correction  with organized supervision and supervision by the masses to  guarantee that all regulations are practically implemented.  Cadres of the party and government organs at and below the  county (department) level must behave themselves in conformity  with the regulations on cadres' honesty and self-discipline,  too. Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions also must  be honest, exercise self- discipline, observe disciplines, abide  by laws, and oppose various negative and corrupt phenomena, such  as abusing power to seek personal gains, committing  embezzlement, taking bribes, and indulging in squander and waste.    We must further step up efforts to handle criminal cases and  concentrate efforts on investigating big, important cases. We  must persist in treating the investigation of  discipline-violating and law-breaking cases involving leading  bodies and leading cadres of the party and government, judicial  departments, administrative law- enforcing departments, economic  administration departments, and their working personnel as the  major work. We must focus attention on investigating cases  involving leading cadres' committing embezzlement, taking  bribes, and abusing power for personal gains; cases involving  law and discipline-enforcing personnel's committing malpractices  out of personal consideration, perverting justice for a bribe,  and breaking the laws during law enforcement; and  discipline-violating and law-breaking cases involving legal  persons. We must resolutely implement the policy of being  strict with party members and government functionaries, strictly  enforce the laws and discipline, and sternly punish corrupt  elements. Those who violate party and government discipline and  criminal law must be dealt with in strict accordance with the  party and government discipline and the laws. We absolutely  must not let corrupt conduct have a "lenient environment" or let  corrupt elements do whatever they like and remain at large. We  must resolutely eliminate the phenomena of refusing to observe  discipline or abide by laws and the phenomena of being lax in  enforcing discipline and laws. We must sternly deal with those  who give unprincipled protection to and harbor law and  discipline violators. We must further strengthen coordination  among discipline inspection organs, supervisory organs, judicial  organs, and departments supervising administrative law  enforcement to form a combined, integral force for handling  cases and to improve the efficiency of big, important cases'  investigation. We must continue to improve the work of treating  the people's letters and complaints as well as the work of  encouraging the people to report law and discipline-violating  cases to the authorities, and practically protect the legitimate  rights and interests of informers. We must commend and  encourage those who have rendered meritorious services in  informing against others for law and discipline violations, and  sternly deal with anyone who retaliates against informers.    We must practically succeed in carrying out special tasks  for sorting out unhealthy practices and in rectifying them. We  must continue to conscientiously sort out and rectify  unwarranted collection of fees. Collection of unwarranted fees  whose cancellation has been announced must be stopped. From now  on, any new item of fee for collection is not permitted to be  arbitrarily added to the existing items without the provincial  authorities' prior approval. We must pay close attention to  implementing the regulations that accounting of revenues and  expenditures of administrative levies and fines must be done  separeately. We must conscientiously check up on and rectify  illegal possession and noncompensatory use of enterprises'  vehicles, computers, and communication equipment by organs or  individuals; transferring enterprises' funds under various  pretexts to the illegal coffers set up by institutions for their  private use or to be used for the welfare of staff and workers;  and other unhealthy practices. We must resolutely put an end to  the unhealthy practice of requisitioning donations from  enterprises under various pretexts. We must continue to pay  close attention to sorting out the party and government organs'  setting up enterprises and doing business. We must resolutely  finish the work of handling the economic entities set up by  organs which are not permitted to set up enerprises and the  economic entities which are required to terminate their  relationship with organs by the end of June. We must continue  to do a good job of lightening peasants' burden, resolutely  reduce their unreasonable burden, do a good job of checking up  on and rectifying the use of public funds on travels abroad  (outside national boundaries) for tourism from start to finish,  strictly examine plans for travel abroad (outside national  boundaries) on official business before granting approval, and  resolutely curb the excessive activities of traveling abroad  (outside national boundaries) on official business.    The plenary session maintained it is necessary for us to  fight corruption by looking into both its root cause and  symptoms, to take comprehensive measures to deal with the  problem, and to persist in encouraging honesty and  industriousness in the performance of official duties. We must  improve education in adherence to the party's mass line, in its  purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, in fighting  corruption and advocating honesty, and in professional ethics  among the vast numbers of party members and cadres. We must  conduct widespread activities of education in enhancing the  concept of party spirit and in setting an example of honesty in  the performance of official duties among party members and  cadres. We must vigorously encourage healthy trends and carry  forward the fine tradition and work style of being honest and  industrious in the performance of official duties for the  people. We must strengthen the building of a legal system; we  must establish and perfect a system on improving party style,  running a clean and honest government, and encouraging  industriousness in the performance of official duties; and we  must improve the mechanism of interaction through supervision  and strengthen democratic supervision by the masses in a bid to  make our drive to improve party style as well as the running of  a clean and honest government gradually embark on a track of  standardization and systematization.    The plenary session called on discipline inspection organs  and supervisory organs at all levels to conduct supervision over  law enforcement at focal points in a planned way by revolving  their efforts around the implementation of the important  decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee,  the State Council, the provincial party committee, and the  provincial government on deepening reform, promoting economic  development, and maintaining stability. They are required to  expose, investigate, and deal with in a timely manner those who  refuse and fail to enforce orders and prohibitions, practice  fraud to deceive superiors and delude subordinates, harm the  interests of the whole out of consideration for local interests,  interfere with reform and development, use public office for  private gain, abuse power for personal gains, and neglect their  duties so as to guarantee the smooth implementation of various  policies and measures adopted for reform and development.    The plenary session stressed that the party committees and  governments at all levels must strengthen leadership over the  anticorruption work, that they must practically adhere to the  strategic principle of "grasping two links and taking a tough  stand on both at the same time," that they must mobilize all  party members, that the party and government must make joint  efforts to handle their work, that the principal comrades in  charge of the party and government [organizations] must  personally pay attention to the work, that they must persist in  the leadership responsibility system, that those at the higher  level must supervise the work of those at the lower level and  set an example for the latter, and that those at higher and  lower levels must take concerted actions to guarantee that  various anticorruption tasks are carried out to the letter.  They must give full play to the role of press units to  successfully publicize the anticorruption drive. They must  strengthen leadership over discipline inspection and supervisory  work and support such organs to fulfill their duties and  successfully carry out their work. The discipline inspection  and supervisory organs at all levels must further improve  themselves, actively fulfill their duties of discipline  inspection and supervision, and promote their work to a new  level.    The plenary session called on Jiangsu's party organizations  at all levels and its broad masses of party members to  resolutely implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session  of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, to unite as  one, to handle tasks in a down-to-earth manner, to unswervingly  launch the anticorruption drive, and to make new contributions  to deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting economic  development, and maintaining social stability under the guidance  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line.</p>

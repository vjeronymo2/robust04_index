			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of 23 Palestinian leaders from the  territories, led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, today issued a  manifesto expressing opposition to the concessions they say the  PLO is making in the negotiations with Israel. The public  statement says that any agreement which legitimizes Israel's  unilateral and illegal actions in the territories -- such as the  expropriation of lands, establishment of settlements, and the  annexation of East Jerusalem -- will not bind the Palestinian  people and its national institutions.    At a Jerusalem news conference, 'Abd-al-Shafi, who headed  the  Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel, attacked  the PLO and 'Arafat. He claimed that they are cut off from what  is happening on the ground and that the Palestinian people will  pay a heavy price for their mistakes. He also demanded  democratization of the PLO and for the entire Palestinian people  to be involved in deciding on the composition of its  institutions.    Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el adds that among those who  signed the manifesto are Ghassan al-Khatib and Dr. Mamduh  al-'Akar, who participated in the Palestinian delegation to the  Washington talks.</p>

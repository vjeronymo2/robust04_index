			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Observer: Blackballed Still on the subject of PR, what are we to make of the latest bit of house-cleaning by the Public Relations Consultants Association? It has finally got round to blackballing the management buy-out remains of Charles Barker and Georgeson - four months after the parent Corporate Communications went into receivership - leaving its principal directors in business and its past creditors substantially out of pocket. The PRCA says that while former board members remain with the two companies, neither will be considered as members. The Institute of Public Relations, the other professional body, is still deciding on its response. Martin Langford, the PRCA chairman, denies that the action was simply designed to prop up the industry image and says there can be no further action unless and until the DTI rules on the role of the directors in the receivership. Even so it looks like a toothless PR gimmick.</p>

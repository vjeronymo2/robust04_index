			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] A Finance Ministry bulletin states that the banks  that were subject to intervention will reopen on 20 June. This  bulletin confirms guarantees stipulated by law for deposits up  to 4 million bolivares, an amount that covers all the claims  [nominas] these banks have received.    Private commercial banks, which will provide the funds to  make payments to depositors, have not made a decision yet on the  purchasing of bonds to be issued by Fogade. Representatives of  the banking sector expressed their surprise yesterday over the  government decision to intervene eight financial institutions.    During a joint news conference, (Jose Monzi Izquierdo),  president of the National Banking Council, and Juan Tomas  Santana, president of the National Banking Association, said  they do not agree with the decision, because the executive did  not inform them.    (Izquierdo) asked for justice and fairness for employees and  depositors of the intervened banks. Meanwhile, Santana said he  does not disagree with the decision to intervene the banks, but  he resents not being informed. Representatives of the banking  sector reiterated that once they receive the government's  explanations on the case, the financial sector will voice its  official position.    Meanwhile, according to Congress President Eduardo Gomez  Tamayo, the executive must give the public extensive  explanations on the intervention of these financial  institutions. Tamayo has said the prevailing circumstances of  this sector are unsavory and alarming, because the fate of  depositors has not yet been determined.    The Congress president has said the parliamentarian blocs  are  refining details to discuss constitutional reforms.    In another turn of events, the Chilean Government has  offered  financial counsel to our country to overcome the crisis  triggered by the intervention of the eight banks. Chilean  President Eduardo Frei has made this offer to his Venezuelan  counterpart, Rafael Caldera, who met with Frei to discuss  topical issues. The Chilean counsel could help our country a  great deal, because Chile experienced a similar financial crisis  in 1983, when the military regime intervened five private banks  and closed two others. The cost of the Chilean bank intervention  amounted to up to $4 billion-worth of subsidies. These five  banks owe $3.5 billion to the Chilean Central Bank.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Special Report - Courses and Careers: University still beckons for the energetic - Despondent about your A-level grades? Education correspondent John Authers has some advice for aspiring college entrants FINDING A university place during the next few weeks could be even more stressful than taking A-levels. Improved A-level results, plus an unexpected cut in government funds to universities, have conspired to cut places available via the 'clearing' system to applicants who had no conditional offers, or who narrowly missed their grades. The Polytechnic Central Admission System reported yesterday that 23 universities and colleges have withdrawn their arts and humanities courses from the clearing system because they were already full. The Universities Central Council on Admissions, the other body which oversees clearing, also predicts that places may be tighter this year. But this does not mean that you should panic if your A-level grades did not quite reach the hoped-for level. Clearing will be much harder than usual this year, but university places are there for those who are prepared to be flexible. This is particularly true in practical and scientific courses, which have the same level of government funding as last year. For example, Surrey University, which specialises in scientific and applied courses, does not anticipate allocating any fewer places via the clearing system this year than it did last. Many new combined and vocational courses have been introduced by universities during the last few years, as higher education has expanded. These could be of interest to those prepared to be flexible. So what do you? The clearing process will not start until Wednesday. In the interim, universities must confirm offers they have made. This involves 200,000 university decisions in a very few working days. Applicants should have two offers - a firm offer and, another, usually for lower grades, as insurance. If the firm offer has been satisfied, then the university must offer the applicant a place. Similarly, if the firm offer has been missed, but the insurance offer has been fulfilled, the second-choice university must offer a place to the applicant. This works both ways. Applicants are not free to 'shop around' for an alternative place until they know that they have not been awarded places by their two first-choice universities. Those who had no conditional offers are free to telephone universities with vacancies as soon as their results are published. UCCA warns: 'Admissions offices must confirm the places of all the candidates holding conditional offers who have met those conditions. Until this is done, there may be very little admissions offices can tell candidates who telephone in.' Applicants eligible for clearing, once it starts, will receive a clearing entry form and leaflets from UCCA. They are advised to make direct contact with a small number of universities - many of which have special 'hotlines' for the purpose - to check whether there are vacancies. BBC Student Choice '93 will provide advice on Radio 5 about vacancies and universities will advertise in national newspapers. Information should be readily available in schools, colleges and career services. In all cases, universities should advertise the minimum number of A-level points they will require. Check possible vacancies daily. If lucky, you should be able to persuade the university to submit a Q request for your papers from UCCA. This shows that the university is serious, and it is via this process that 90 per cent of clearing places are offered. However, the process is time-consuming, so do not ask more than one university to make a Q request. Fill in the clearing entry form, listing up to four choices of university and course, in order of preference (with any university which has made a Q request put in first place). Computers do the rest - each choice on the form will be matched to see if the university has vacancies, and whether your A-levels are good enough. UCCA also has a clearing panel for giving individual attention to applicants who slip through the net. The entire process can last until September 25. Nobody pretends that the next month will be enjoyable for those looking for places - but places are there for those with the energy and flexibility to look.

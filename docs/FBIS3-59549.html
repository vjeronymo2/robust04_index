			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Rodgers: "Three Into One"] </F>   [Text] In 1990 France's national research agency, the  CNRS, decided to reorganize its supercomputing strategy. The  result is a new Institute for Development and Resources in  High-Performance Computing (IDRIS), which replaces three  previous centres -- CCVR [Vector Computation Center for  Research] and CIRCE [Interregional Electronic Computing Center]  in Paris, and the Strasbourg Computing Centre. IDRIS was  officially opened at the old CIRCE site at the University of  Paris-Sud last month.    With the development of the RENATER high-speed computer  network, it made sense to have just one supercomputing centre,  according to Victor Alessandrini, professor of theoretical  physics at University of Paris-Sud and director of IDRIS.  RENATER offers 35 megabit/s connections in some regions and two  megabit/s elsewhere. "The mission from the CNRS", says  Alessandrini, "was to develop a centre of excellence and to  promote world-class high-performance computing and numerical  simulation in all areas of science in France." IDRIS will also  be the focus of French involvement in European and international  collaborations in high-performance computing and networking.    IDRIS's most powerful machine is a Cray C98 with eight  processors. The C98 has a peak speed of eight gigaflops (8 x 10  in the ninth power floating point operations per second) and is  routinely achieving three gigaflops - making it the most  powerful vector supercomputer available to academics in Europe.  The Cray has about 1500 users at present and some 40-50 percent  of its time goes on climate change modelling, oceanography and  other environmental research. Other subjects include quantum  chromodynamics, fluid dynamics, quantum chemistry, molecular  dynamics simulations of materials and plasma physics.    IDRIS plans to buy a massively parallel computer next year  with a peak performance around 20 gigaflops and hopes to have  teraflop performance (10 in the twelfth power flops) available  in about three years. The centre has about 70 staff, including  50 specialists in the use of high-performance computers. Some  15 staff are working on the user interface; another 15 are  working on scientific applications and will interact closely  with users of the machine. There are also five staff porting  existing computer codes to massively parallel machines. Other  high-performance computers available to French university  scientists include a Connection Machine at the University of  Paris with a peak speed of 16 gigaflops, and an IBM 3090 in  Montpellier.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Hamlet of the Hudson brings house down GOVERNOR Bill Clinton knows about speeches. He writes many of his own and there is enough of the southern Baptist tradition of oratory in him to make them sound good - when he is on form. But he would have to exceed his finest performance to come close to what Mr Mario Cuomo pulled off on Wednesday night in nominating Mr Clinton as the party's presidential candidate. The address by the governor of New York can be assessed on two levels - the purely political and as a piece of political theatre. On both it won rave reviews. There were nagging doubts before he spoke that the Hamlet of the Hudson, a man of many moods and not all benign towards Mr Clinton, might give the nominee short shrift. Some of the earlier highlighted speeches - Jesse Jackson's, Barbara Jordan's and the petulant Jerry Brown's - had focused more on the party than praise of Mr Clinton. Mr Brown never mentioned his name. Mr Cuomo invoked it 32 times, beginning with the first sentence and ending with the last. More than that, each progressive value he has long attributed to himself he said Mr Clinton possessed to an equal or even greater degree. The embrace was total, and Mr Clinton could have asked for no finer send-off. 'Magnificent Mario Cuomo' was how the nominee gratefully put it. He put all the politician's oratorical skills on display. The timing, the pacing, the wit, the savagery were all there in a wondrous bundle of metaphor, imagery and, when turning the fire on President George Bush and the Republicans, cold partisan scorn and contempt. He brought the house down when he contrasted the Democratic and Republican attitudes to the imperative of helping the needy. 'That is the fundamental Democratic predicate. Surrender that Democratic principle and we might just as well tear the donkeys from our lapels, pin elephants on instead and retreat to elegant estates behind ivy-covered walls, where, when they detect a callous on their palms, they conclude it is time to put down their polo mallet.' Mr Bush, he said in another passage, did not understand that the ship of state was foundering. 'He seems to think the ship will be saved by imperceptible undercurrents, directed by the invisible hand of some cyclical economic god, that will gradually move the ship at the last moment so that it will miraculously glide past the rocks. 'Well, prayer, prayer, is always a good idea; but our prayers must always be accompanied by good works. We need a captain who understands that, and who will seize the wheel before it is too late. I am here tonight to offer America that new captain with a new course before it is too late, and he is Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.' Some close Cuomo watchers claimed this was stock stuff, lifted from many a recent speech. But the governor hates to leave his home state and he has not had a national audience like this since the party's convention in San Francisco in 1984. Back then, he talked about his democratic values. But he never extended them as personally to Mr Walter Mondale as he did to Mr Clinton. That he did, surely laid to rest forever the dreams of his supporters that he will himself one day become president. If Mr Clinton wins in November, perhaps he will redeem a half-promise and elevate Mr Cuomo to the Supreme Court at the first opportunity. If nothing else, that should improve the quality of the court's written judgments.</p>

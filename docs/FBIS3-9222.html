Kanis said  Slovakia hoped for better ties with Hungary, between the two  countries and also the two ministries.    "Our talks covered regional security, bilateral military  cooperation, NATO's peace partnership programme, and cooperation  between the Visegrad countries," the Slovak minister said.    Fur saw the new Slovak foreign policy as promising, citing  as  a major gesture that Kanis visited Budapest first.  Hungarian-Slovak military cooperation has gone well so far, Fur  added.    Kanis said the new government wished to use the half a year  up until the elections to intensify foreign relations.  "Nationalism in Central Europe implies isolationism, while  integration symbolises openness, and balance in the region," he  said.</p>

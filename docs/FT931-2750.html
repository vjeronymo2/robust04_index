			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Power shares up on VAT changes SHARES IN regional electricity companies in England and Wales moved ahead yesterday in spite of the chancellor's decision to levy value added tax on power bills from next year. Most shares reached their highest level since privatisation. Norweb finished the day up 13p at 539p, against a previous high of 530p. Shares in British Gas, whose customers will also see price rises because of the VAT decision, fell yesterday. Analysts said this reflected institutional sales for technical reasons rather than concern about the tax. The electricity shares' buoyancy reflects a belief in the City that sale volumes are unlikely to suffer significantly when VAT of 8 per cent is levied in April next year and 17.5 per cent VAT comes in 12 months later. This is because most people see fuel as a basic necessity. There is a disadvantage for the companies though, because their bad debt problems are likely to grow. Yorkshire Electricity expects the proportion of its 2m customers that experience difficulties in paying bills to rise from its present 15 per cent. The company spends an average Pounds 130 a year on chasing each of the most regular payment defaulters. This is sometimes more than the value of electricity the defaulters have used. On the positive side the regional electricity companies will see cashflow benefits resulting from VAT receipts. In some cases those receipts will be kept for three months before they are paid to the government. The Budget also benefited utility companies' shares because of changes to the tax credit system. From next month tax credits attached to dividends will be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, said pension funds would be concerned about the resulting shortfalls in incomes from investments. Some would be trying to increase their holding of gilts and of high yielding shares such as utilities, he said. Other analysts said electricity shares also benefited yesterday from disclosures that the industry regulator was planning less rigid controls on supply prices than some had feared.</p>

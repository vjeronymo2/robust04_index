			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GIANT HEADACHE FOR MOTHER RUSSIA;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: AN INTELLECTUAL BOOST TO NATIONALISTIC SOUNDINGS CANNOT GIVE MUCH  COMFORT TO GORBACHEV -- OR OTHERS.  </P> <P> Spectacular developments on the periphery of the Soviet empire have, until  recently, obscured the rise of Russian nationalism. Yet ethnic unrest in the  Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic may well grow into the biggest  headache yet for Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Early warning signs cropped up two years ago when the ultra-nationalist  organization Pamyat blamed the country's ills on "the Judeo-Masonic  conspiracy." The group didn't make much headway then (its candidates lost in  last year's elections for the Congress of People's Deputies), mainly because it  failed to attract support from the Russian intelligentsia. Now the situation  has changed.  </P> <P> Igor Shafarevich, a world-renowned mathematician and respected dissident, is  one prominent Soviet intellectual who has lent his authority to the nationalist  cause. His provocative essay, serialized in the literary magazine Nash  Sovremennik, begins with the unobjectionable premise that ethnic Russians are  entitled to national pride just as any other ethnic group. He rejects as  russophobic any attempts to explain Russian history in terms of servility,  intolerance and a craving for strong authority, pointing out -- correctly --  that any such charge addressed to other groups would be judged racist.  </P> <P> Inexplicably, however, Shafarevich refuses to follow his own advice and  proceeds to blame Jews for the misfortunes that Russia has suffered in this  century. His arguments are as old as they are spurious: The dominant role that  Jews gained in revolutionary organizations at the turn of the century caused  Russia to abandon its predestined historical path; after the revolution, Jews  effectively controlled repressive institutions in the country; the horrors that  Russian people suffered under the Marxist regime are due largely to vengeful  sentiments imparted to Jews by the Talmud.  </P> <P> "Either remain foreigners without political rights," counsels Shafarevich to  the "non-indigenous" elements residing in Russia, "or accept Russian  citizenship based on love of homeland."  </P> <P> One finds among the intellectuals who have caught the chauvinistic bug the  names of prominent current writers such as Valentin Rasputin, Vladimir  Soloukhin, Vasily Belov and Vadim Kozhinov. On various occasions, these authors  have intimated the need to purge political, social and artistic institutions in  the Russian republic from alien influences.  </P> <P> Uri Bondarev, the powerful secretary of the Russian republic's Writers' Union,  charged last fall that Russian writers are being pushed to the edge in their  own land. Liberal magazines such as Ogonyok, Neva and Zvezda, he said, give far  too much space to non-Russian writers; it is time for ethnic Russians to claim  supremacy in the affairs of their own republic.  </P> <P> One after another, speakers at the union's plenary meeting rose to condemn  "cosmopolitan intellectuals" and swore to stamp out their pernicious influence.  Some thanked Shafarevich for "the courageous stand" he took in the face of  Jewish dominance. Anatoly Builov went further than anybody else in his avowed  anti-Semitism: If life in the Soviet Union has been miserable for so many  decades, he asked, wasn't it because so many Jews, some hiding under Russian  identities, have occupied leading positions in the Soviet hierarchy?  </P> <P> The ethnic purity espoused by Russian ultra-nationalists smacks of racism.  Alexander Pushkin, a Russian literary icon, was descended from an Ethiopian  slave brought to Russia by the Peter the Great. Boris Pasternak, the author of  "Dr. Zhivago," was a Jew. Osip Mandelshtam, arguably the greatest Soviet poet,  also was a Jew. Can anybody deny their contribution to Russian culture?  </P> <P> Russian nationalism is not tenable as a political movement, particularly when  it is fastened to dormant anti-Semitism, which is bound to breed racial hatred  and violence.  </P> <P> Whatever the future of Russian nationalism, its immediate prospects are  unsettling. The situation in the country brings to mind Germany in the waning  years of the Weimar Republic, where the populace, worn down by an economic  malaise and political uncertainty, cast about for scapegoats and clamored for a  Fuehrer to spur the nation toward better times. We know what happened next:  Hitler, the Holocaust, World War II.  </P> <P> Those who think that the true legacy of Russian intelligentsia is not a quest  for racial purity but a heightened capacity for compassion had better speak out  now.  </P></p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Finding the hand on the purse-strings WE NEED to know who has the authority to sign a contract,' says Mr John Macomber, chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, when asked about deals with the former Soviet Union. 'Who controls the foreign currency? Who decides if foreigners can invest in their oil and gas business?' For all international companies, pinpointing worthwhile deals in the midst of current upheavals in the former Soviet Union is no easy matter. Trading and financial institutions have disappeared. Privatisation plans are creating turmoil in Russia. Inexperienced officials in other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are wrestling to fill the void left as Moscow-led institutions have been cut adrift. Raw material supplies to factories are being sold to the west for foreign exchange. Banks that can be trusted as sovereign guarantors for projects are almost totally absent outside Russia. Ms Beatrice Kuhne, a Berlin-based trade promotion expert from the Federation of German Industry, says: 'Everyone thought it would be better there when (Russian President) Yeltsin freed prices and investment conditions in November. But the result is chaos. We tell our people that the only thing that works is barter.' Two years ago, Britain's Davy McKee won a Pounds 1.5m contract to supply modifications to an aluminium rolling mill in Mikhailovsk in Siberia. Today, the goods are ready to ship, but the buyer - a Soviet trading company - no longer exists and foreign exchange for payment has evaporated. In Italy, where the mood is a mixture of confusion and wait-and-see, Fiat is anxious to conclude a deal for a joint venture with Vaz, the former state automotive producer at Togliattigrad in Russia. The deal envisages Fiat taking a one-third stake in Vaz, modernisation of the plant, retooling, and production of a new model, initially at 300,000 units a year. However, any deal is complicated by the fact that Vaz relies for 20 per cent of its components on factories outside Russia, while another 30 per cent of components come from inside Russia but from factories not integrated with Vaz. In the food industry, where investment is urgently needed, and western governmental sympathy has been greatest, movement is also likely to be slow. For example, Mr Peter Cheshire, director of marketing at the UK sugar group Booker Tate, says that any joint venture in the sugar industry is at least two years away. His company operates an experimental plot in conjunction with a local partner in the Ukraine. 'They don't even have a clear idea of a currency. It's total chaos at the moment, though it's still worth working there,' he says. While cautionary tales are the norm, some worthwhile deals are being forged: the attraction is the republics' long-term potential and the feeling that now may be the time to grasp the opportunity. Mr Lorenz Schomerus, head of the external trade department of the German Economics Ministry, says that normalisation in the former Soviet republics would open the way for at least DM60bn (Pounds 20.9bn) worth of trade. Salamander, the German shoe manufacturer, has a 49 per cent stake in Lenwest, a St Petersburg joint venture. Although Salamander's own shoe exports to the Soviet Union are likely to drop at least tenfold this year, the company claims its joint venture is coping well. Even Davy McKee, in contrast to its experience in Mikhailovsk, agreed just a month ago a Pounds 40m contract to supply an electrolytic tinning plant at the Karaganda steelworks in Temirtau, Kazakhstan. Karaganda has foreign exchange earnings of its own which it has been willing to commit to paying Davy McKee. Helping to explain the west's lack of enthusiasm for Mr Yeltsin's requests for new money, governments have another, though more prosaic, nightmare: the fear that fullscale Soviet default on officially supported export credit guarantees could cause billions of dollars of losses. One of the greatest unknowns, German officials say, is the adequacy of the foreign currency reserves of the new republican foreign trade banks. 'The main problem is arranging financing and export credit insurance,' says Mr Hans Koch, a board member of Lurgi, the plant-building subsidiary of the Frankfurt-based Metallgesellschaft group which has been trading with the Soviet Union for decades. The company's projects are 'more or less stuck at the moment', he says. Ms Tatiana Berls, in charge of relations with the Soviet republics at Apco Associates, a Washington consulting firm, said US manufacturers are delaying entry into the market because of current instability. But, she says, 'once the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are in there, business will follow'. Mr Eberhard von Koerber, chairman of the German subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri, a multinational engineering company with long-standing Soviet links, echoes a common sentiment: 'We can't simply sit back and wait until everything is clear and sorted out. That might take 10 years, and by then someone braver than us would have come in and got all the business.'

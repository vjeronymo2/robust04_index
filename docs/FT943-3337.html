			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Swaps volume up by 58.5% in 1993 The total amount of swap transactions outstanding rose 58.5 per cent last year to Dollars 8,475bn, according to the latest survey by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The volume of new swaps written in the second half of 1993 rose 11.8 per cent to Dollars 2,912bn from Dollars 2,605bn in the first half. According to ISDA, the continued growth resulted from an increase in hedging by end-users. However, the pace of growth appears to be slowing as the plain vanilla swaps market reaches maturity. Activity in more complex swap-related transactions, such as caps, floors, collars and swaptions, rose most sharply, by 88.5 per cent for the whole year from Dollars 592bn in 1992. New activity amounted to Dollars 607bn in the second half of 1993. ISDA said the continued growth in the over-the-counter swaps market does not necessarily represent a substantial increase in risk, as the figures represent the notional principal amount used to calculate the cash flows involved in swap transactions. 'Notional principal amounts reported by survey respondents are the base against which cashflows are calculated and do not measure market value or credit risk,' according to Ms Gay Evans, ISDA chairman and a managing director of Bankers Trust. 'Derivatives credit risk . . . typically varies from 1.2 per cent to 2.2 per cent of the notional amount for many dealers.' The survey, conducted by Arthur Andersen, gathered data from 66 firms representing the majority of ISDA member swap dealers.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A man, a woman, and the law MY WOMAN friend and I wish to have a long-term relationship without making any legal commitment. We would pursue our separate careers from separate households but would leave open the long-term possibility of becoming a single household, with or without a formal marriage. Can our public description of each other create an implied legal commitment? If we referred to ourselves as fiance(e)s, for example, would it be possible for one partner at a later date to argue that, legally, marriage had been implied, or even offered? Would it be advisable to draw up some legal agreement in order to secure the certainty that no legal commitment is in any way created accidentally? While the use in public of a description such as you mention would not, of itself, give rise to any change in your legal status or liability towards each other, the use of the particular expression 'fiance(e)' might be relied-on at some future date as evidence to support a claim that there had been a contract to enter into marriage. It would be wiser to use some such term as 'partner,' which is not indicative of an agreement to marry. A formal agreement which disavows expressly any intention to become married would help, but it would operate only from the date of the document and would not preclude an assertion that there had been a subsequent change of heart and an agreement to marry. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

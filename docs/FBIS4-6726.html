			<p>BFN     [Text] According to an unofficial source, the Royal  Government of Cambodia may be reshuffled very soon. These  changes would affect the ministries of economy and finance,  foreign affairs and international cooperation, and interior and  national security.    Another source has revealed that these changes will not  affect the role of any current cabinet ministers. In other  words, this reshuffle only involves moving officials from one  ministry to another. In this process, an official, who is  currently a minister, could be taken away from a ministry and  made a deputy prime minister. A few weeks ago there were rumors  that Sam Rangsi, currently minister of economy and finance,  would be promoted while Chak Sarik, currently governor of Kandal  Province, would replace Sam Rangsi.    An official who requested anonymity has disclosed that the  Ministry of Interior and National Security may be split into  two, namely the Ministry of National Security and the Ministry  of Interior. However, this plan is still under consideration.  It has not been decided yet which officials from what party  would be in charge of what ministry. Yu Hokkri [currently  co-minister of interior and national security] could be  transferred to another ministry and another official, also from  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], would be in charge of the  Interior Ministry or the National Security Ministry and could  also have the rank of deputy prime minister.    These sources add that the planned reshuffle is not the  result of conflict in the cabinet but is just a rearrangement of  leading leaders to suit their respective expertise and  competence.</p>

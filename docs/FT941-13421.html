			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Pollution ruling against factories A Japanese district court yesterday ordered a group of leading companies to compensate residents for suffering caused by air pollution from factories. The ruling comes after a 12-year wrangle since plaintiffs sued several companies, including Tokyo Electric Power, NKK and Tonen, as well as the state, for pollution from factories and car exhausts. The plaintiffs sought Y2.6bn (Pounds 15.5m) damages and suspension of the emissions. Of the 435 people who filed the suit in 1982, over 30 have since died. The bureaucratic nature of Japan's courts and a lack of lawyers means it often takes years to reach a verdict and a case can take 30 years to reach the supreme courts. The district court of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, ordered 12 companies to pay Y463m in damages to local residents for diseases such as chronic asthma, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Mr Hisashi Nemoto, the presiding judge, said the companies were responsible for air pollution in Kawasaki, known as one of the most polluted districts in the country, and the factory emissions containing sulphur dioxide were responsible for the illnesses. Mr Nemoto rejected a request by residents to order tighter controls on discharges of pollutants from the factories, saying the plaintiffs' claims were too vague. He also turned down claims that the state was responsible for the rise in health problems due to the construction of roads.</p>

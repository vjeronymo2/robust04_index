			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's direct  involvement in Asia's first regional security dialogue is  negligible, but the forum is nevertheless a matter of keen  interest for Seoul officials including Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu.    The six members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Thailand, Singapore -- sit down with their seven "dialogue  partners," including South Korea and five other neighbors, for  the first time in July to address their common security concerns.    There is no telling where this dialogue, named "ASEAN  Regional Forum (ARF)" will go, but it is certainly a  symbol-laden beginning in a region where no such dialogue  channel ever existed, mainly due to complex conflict of  political interest, the vestige of the cold war and gap in  historical and economic development history.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, currently  visiting Bangkok which hosts the first ARF July 25, called the  forum more symbolic than substantive at this point.    But he sees this as an important impetus for sub-groupings,  what he described as sub-ARF.    For instance, senior officials from Northeast Asian  countries  -- South Korea, Japan, the United States, China and Russia --  may decide to talk amongst themselves on their security issues  before reporting to the ARF, Han said.    "By having something like the ARF, the region has a growing  chance of engaging in multilateral regional security dialogue,"  he said.    Attesting to South Korea's interest in the forum, much of  Han's meeting with Thai leaders here Wednesday focused on  exchange of opinions on the future of the ARF, its relations  with APEC.    The birth of ARF had more to do with competition with APEC  Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) rather than consensus  of needs.    ASEAN has long functioned as the leader organization in Asia  until APEC came along in 1989 and took the spotlight in economic  affairs of the region.    Unwilling to let go of the spotlight, ASEAN members braved a  new initiative by tackling security agendas.    Last year, 18 nations including ASEAN members, their  dialogue  partners and five guests agreed in July to launch ARF.    South Korea had said that it welcomes such initiative and  promised full participation in the discussion process.    Han had always said Northeast Asia needs security talks of  its own, ideally in the form of mini-Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    "Our participation in the ARF is more symbolic than anything  else -- symbolic in that we are taking part in this region's  initiative," explained Yu Pyong-u, director-general of Asian  Affairs Bureau at the South Korean Foreign Ministry.    "But our true security interest lies with Northeast Asia,"  he  said.    "The ARF would certainly be a good precedent, it would tell  us how we can work in a separate channel in Northeast Asia, how  we can complement it to ARF," said Yu.</p>

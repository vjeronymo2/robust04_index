Most of those disappointed are to be found in  what was the four-party coalition, while some of the harshest  reactions have come from the Christian Democrats [DC]. [DC  leader Mino] Martinazzoli said the government has had a short  life. He wanted elections to be held in June. Guido  Dell'Aquila has carried out some interviews:    [Begin recording] [Gerardo Bianco, DC spokesman in the  Chamber of Deputies] I was not expecting this outcome because  the position taken in parliament by the majority parties  reconfirmed confidence in the government. In other words,  Ciampi and his government still have a parliamentary majority,  so the justification for his resignation has origins outside  parliament.    [Marco Pannella, Radical leader] The country knows that  everything is once again in the hands of the institutional  authorities, which certainly offers a wealth of wisdom and  honesty to the whole country.    [Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the Left leader]  Today's action is important because it is the only pacifying  action which can be implemented in our country. It gives  citizens the instrument of a parliament which truly represents  the new Italy and hopefully a government with progressive forces  at its center.    [Umberto Bossi, Northern League leader] It is a government  which has remained in office despite the fact that the whole  country wants change, wants an election. It seems to me that  consequently a legitimate action is being carried out. It seems  to me that Ciampi has upheld civil liberties -- he has kept his  word. [end recording]</p>

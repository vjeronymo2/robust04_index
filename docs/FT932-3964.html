			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: Unexpected vintage Sir, Of course, I would never want to be accused of placing facts in the way of a good story, but Observer ('Loosening up', June 8) has translated an Afrikaans/Dutch word incorrectly. Actually, the anecdote is even better with the correct translation. Buitenverwachting - the wine served by the ANC newspaper, New Nation, when Roelf Meyer, the government negotiator, and ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa jointly accepted the 'man of the year award' - actually means 'beyond expectations', and not 'waiting outside'. In contrast with Allesverloren (all is lost), the wine served to Meyer shortly after President De Klerk's 1990 speech un-banning the ANC, it would seem the talks are going better than some fear.

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Phoenix plans to end timber importing PHOENIX TIMBER, the Essex-based timber products group, is to sell its timber importing business in order to cut its Pounds 10m borrowings and concentrate on Protim Services, its property services subsidiary. The decision, announced after the Stock Exchange closed last night, was taken 'in view of continuing losses incurred in the company's timber importing activities and the deteriorating prospects for the construction industry', said Mr Peter Quinn, chairman. The group is due to announce its results for the year ended March 31 in early June. They will show that its trading position has deteriorated. Mr Quinn warned of an increased deficit in the second half, but expected full year losses not to exceed Pounds 2.5m pre-tax. The group reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 656,000 (Pounds 1.42m) for the year to March 31 1990, but four months later announced that the construction downturn was forcing it to close its joinery subsidiary based in Stoke on Trent. For the six months to end-September Phoenix ran up a taxable loss of Pounds 379,000 compared to the previous year's profit of Pounds 479,000. The share price closed unchanged at 39p.</p>

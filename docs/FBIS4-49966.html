			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan will cut import  tariffs on more than half of its agricultural products in  preparation for its entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT), the Council of Agriculture (COA) said  Wednesday [11 May].    Import tariffs on 660 out of 1,300 farm products are  expected  to be cut during the second half of this year, but not by a  significant margin, a COA official said.    The average import tariff on agricultural products is  expected to be cut to 20.5 percent from the current 21.6 percent  before the end of this year, moving closer to targets set by a  number of foreign nations, particularly the U.S., the official  said.    A Taiwan mission, led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu  Ke-sheng, has left for Washington for the second round of  U.S.-Taiwan trade negotiations under the GATT framework.    The U.S. negotiators, who have asked Taiwan to cut import  tariffs on agricultural products to under 20 percent, are  expected to agree with Taiwan negotiators on a range between 13  percent and 20 percent, a formula modeled after precedents set  by South Korea and Japan, the official said.    The Taiwan negotiators will proceed to Geneva on May 16 to  attend further tariff reduction talks with officials from five  countries, including Canada.    Taiwan has held negotiations with more than 10 nations since  March to discuss tariff and non-tariff trade issues related to  Taiwan's GATT membership. Among the issues discussed, tariff  cuts on agricultural products have been a major concern.    So far Taiwan has held tariff reduction talks with Hungary,  South Africa, Brazil, New Zealand, Turkey, Australia, Chile,  Egypt, Singapore and Switzerland with a view to accelerating  Taiwan's entry into GATT.    The 12-member European Union is also scheduled to hold  bilateral tariff reduction talks with Taiwan in May, and will  most likely use the results of the second-round Taiwan-U.S.  trade consultations as reference for its own negotiations with  Taiwan.    Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September  1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this  year.</p>

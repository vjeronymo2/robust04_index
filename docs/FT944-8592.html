			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Ahern leading Fianna Fail race The likely shape of Ireland's future coalition may become clearer today when Fianna Fail, the senior partner in the outgoing coalition, decides on a successor to Mr Albert Reynolds, who resigned as prime minister on Thursday. Two candidates have so far declared themselves: outgoing finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern, the clear favourite, and outgoing justice minister Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn. Mr Reynolds' resignation followed the withdrawal from government of the Labour party, junior coalition partners. Mr Dick Spring, Labour's leader and deputy prime minister, accused Mr Reynolds of misleading the Dail, Ireland's parliament. The row began with Mr Reynolds' appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court, a move bitterly criticised by Labour. Under fire from Labour and opposition parties, Mrs Quinn offered her own resignation on Wednesday night. It was turned down by Mr Reynolds. It is widely expected that if Mrs Quinn won the nomination, Labour would look elsewhere for a new alliance with one of the opposition parties, leaving Fianna Fail to go into opposition. The politicians have until Tuesday to agree a new government, after Mr Reynolds decided not to seek parliament's dissolution but to try to forge a new alliance between the existing parties. If he is unsuccessful a general election will have to be called. Mr Ahern represents Dublin. Once known as 'anorak man' because of his dress sense, he is respected in business circles for his management of the economy. A former chief whip, he is the party rank and file's favourite to succeed Mr Reynolds. As a former trade union official, he earned a reputation as a negotiator, a skill which could be useful if Fianna Fail is to form a new alliance. A meeting of the parliamentary members to select a leader was adjourned on Thursday after news that Mr Whelehan had resigned. Mr Reynolds is expected to submit his resignation as party chief at today's meeting. He had been expected to announce he was stepping down earlier but is understood to have delayed the decision in a bid to influence the succession. He is said to favour Mrs Quinn. Mrs Quinn represents Galway West. She has won a reputation for competent handling of the difficult justice portfolio, despite a recent slip-up over the release of IRA prisoners, which she quickly had to cancel after the murder of a Newry postal worker in Northern Ireland.

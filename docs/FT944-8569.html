			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Doubts over Angola pact Accusations of truce violations from both sides in Angola's 19-year-old civil war have put fresh pressure on the country's fragile peace pact. Just ahead of the scheduled signing tomorrow of the pact in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, the rebel Unita movement reported that government forces had ignored a truce to attack and capture the rebel-held northern town of Uige. There was no immediate comment from the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos but it made accusations of its own that Unita forces had violated the truce, declared on Wednesday night, with three attacks on government-held towns. Leaders of several southern African nations are due to meet in Lusaka today to discuss threats to the peace pact, which follows one in 1991 that held for about 18 months.</p>

NAVSTAR consists of navigational satellites; a ground  command, control and telemetry system; and users' navigational  gear intended for determining their position based on measured  pseudoranges to the satellite.    Models of receiver gear, the design of which meets  requirements of ground, airborne and naval users, were developed  by the mid-1980's. Receivers (of the Collins firm) demonstrated  the capability of determining coordinates with an accuracy to 9  m and height to 11 m. But the level of accuracy achieved does  not satisfy a number of military and civilian users.    Under an order of the U.S. Defense Department Mapping  Agency,  experimental, high-precision STI 5010 gear providing an accuracy  of 10-15 m in determining coordinates in real time and 2 m over  several hours of operation was created in the early 1970's. By  1980 a group of organizations evolved in the United States  interested in creating high-precision receiver gear for geodesy,  metrology and so on. It included the Mapping Agency, National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration and U.S. Geological Survey. These  organizations drew up an "interdepartmental coordination plan  for using the NAVSTAR system in geodetic work," which specified  each department's level of involvement in developing methods of  geodetic use of the system. And already in the early 1980's  Texas Instruments created the TI 4100 series  navigational-geodetic apparatus (Geostar 4100 modification),  which permitted achieving an accuracy of 10-15 m in determining  coordinates in real time and 1 m in 4-6 hours of operation. The  accuracy of mutual position of two points at a distance up to  1,000 km was around 1 decimeter. The gear weighed 27.2 kg.    By the mid-1980's various firms had developed a large number  of different versions of users' geodetic apparatus. A special  place among the versions is held by receivers operating  according to the radio interferometer principle. These devices  permit providing a level of accuracy of one centimeter in  determining mutual position of two or more users separated by a  distance up to 1,000 km without using high-precision  navigational signals.    Accumulated experience of using the users' geodetic  apparatus  as well as the achieved level of accuracy and promptness of  determination will provide the opportunity to sharply expand the  area of application of geodetic receivers and go beyond the  bounds of traditional navigation. This apparatus is needed for  installation of sophisticated engineering structures, for  determining coordinates of aerial cameras during aerial mapping,  and for obtaining other geodetic data (azimuths, differences of  optometric elevations, components of the deviation of vertical  lines, gravitational force values) necessary for supporting  military and civilian users.    Heightened requirements are placed on geodetic receivers  being manufactured under the U.S. Defense Department order. One  is the capability for converting the coordinates obtained into  essentially any local coordinate system serving as the basis for  creating national maps and other cartographic products.</p>

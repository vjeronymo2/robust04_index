			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Aznar serious about Spanish Elections JOSE MARIA AZNAR, the 40-year-old leader of the Partido Popular, is intense and serious. At election meetings he speaks in grave, clipped sentences while his right arm pumps up and down. His neat black hair and moustache can make this image a little uncomfortable at times. But there is little doubt that Spain's conservatives, liberals and Christian Democrats owe him a huge debt for making them real contenders to govern again after nearly two decades in the political wilderness. He was made PP leader in 1989 and he has since succeeded in dragging the party from the right towards the centre, attracting young voters in the process. Mr Aznar would try to form a government of professional politicians and businessmen if the party let him.</p>

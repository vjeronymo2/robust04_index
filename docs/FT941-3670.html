			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn sells two offshoots for Pounds 2.7m Porter Chadburn, the packaging and consumer products group, has entered into a conditional agreement to dispose of two subsidiaries, Sportline and TPL Marketing, to H Young Holdings for about Pounds 2.7m in cash. Sportline distributes Head sports equipment and luggage to the mail order and retail trade in the UK while TPL sells a variety of products into the promotional and incentive markets. In the 12 months to April 2 1993 the two offshoots incurred operating losses of Pounds 152,000. The disposals represent the first steps of the strategy of disposing of businesses which do not meet the group's financial criteria. H Young, the Henley-based purchaser, is a marketing and distribution company. Completion is scheduled for March 31.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Chinese Tanks From Outstanding </F> Debts?"]    [Text] According to sources in Beijing, the Chinese tanks  fulfill the technical parameters demanded by the Hungarian side.  A delegation of the Hungarian Interior Ministry held talks  recently with the Norilco military industry firm on purchasing  such tanks. The delegation, led by State Secretary Attila Korom,  left Beijing on 18 January.    According to our correspondent, the Chinese side does not  exclude the possibility of selling the tanks in exchange for the  107 million Swiss Francs Chinese state debt to Hungary  accumulated in the course of bilateral clearing trade. However,  this way, the price is higher than in the case of free currency  accounting.    The Hungarian Interior Ministry is conducting information  talks on the purchase of 100-150 PSZH tanks, and the Chinese  offer stands at $375,000 a piece. Thus, the value of the entire  transaction stands around $50 million. The Nikex foreign trade  firm has been put in charge of carrying out this purchase. The  executive manager of this firm, Attila Varadi, who participated  in the current negotiations, used to be the Hungarian commercial  attache in Beijing, and later worked at Gyorgy Matrai's  Autotrade company. Originally, it was the Autotrade that won the  right to settle the Chinese debt to Hungary, but it failed to  carry out this task in time, probably due to Matrai's arrest in  connection with the Samax- affair. Varadi left the Autotrade  after the arrest of his boss.</p>

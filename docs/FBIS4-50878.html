			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fang Jin (2455 3866)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou Jiahua  of the State Council met this afternoon at the Great Hall of the  People with representatives of the China and Hong Kong chapters  of the Association of Young Company Presidents who came to  Beijing for a visit.    Zou Jiahua welcomed the representatives' visit. He said:  Youth is the hope of our times. You not only are youths, but  also company presidents. You have been doing important work in  enterprises in Hong Kong and have played a very significant role  in the economic development of the mainland and Hong Kong. Hong  Kong's economic development, prosperity, and stability are  inseparable from the mainland, and the mainland's economic  development also needs Hong Kong's support. Therefore, it is  very beneficial to both sides to increase economic cooperation  and exchange between the two sides.    The China and Hong Kong chapters of the Association of Young  Company Presidents are organized by the heads of large Hong Kong  companies, the second generation of famous Hong Kong  entrepreneurs, and accomplished young businessmen in Hong Kong.  The association has more than 100 members. The visiting group,  which is made up of more than 80 young company presidents and  led by Wang Mingang and Li Dazhuang, arrived in Beijing  yesterday afternoon. This is the first visit to Beijing by a  group of the two chapters since they were founded. Members of  the group hoped that, through the visit, members of the  association will have better understanding of the mainland.  They especially hoped association members will gain in-depth  understanding of the mainland's situation and policies since the  policy of reform and opening up was adopted. During their stay  in Beijing, members will visit the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office and hold forums with officials of the State  Commission for Economic Restructuring, the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the Bank of China.    Zou Jiahua briefed the group on the reform of China's  taxation system, developing the economies in China's central and  western regions, and his recent visits to the United States and  Canada, which members of the group had been concerned about.    Also attending today's meeting were Chen Ziying, deputy  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office; Hu Deping,  vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and  Commerce; and persons in charge of relevant departments.</p>

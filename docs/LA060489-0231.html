			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN LIONS' ODDS ON HAVING CUBS IMPROVING  </P> <P> The recent discovery of four female mountain lions -- one possibly pregnant --  in north Orange County may mean the cats have a better chance of producing  offspring in the rapidly developing region than researchers once believed.  </P> <P> The four adult females were captured in the past two weeks in the foothills of  the Santa Ana Mountains north of Santiago Canyon Road.  </P> <P> In addition to the lion who may be pregnant, another appears to have mated  recently, meaning at least one male lion has established a presence in the  area, according to Paul Beier, a wildlife biologist who heads the Orange County  Cooperative Mountain Lion Study. The two-year research project, funded by the  county, was begun after lions mauled children in two separate attacks in 1986.  </P> <P> The four recently captured were tagged, fitted with radio collars and released  so that their behavior can be studied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Optimistic Picture'  </P> <P> "This is good news," Beier said, referring to the possible matings. "This gives  us a more optimistic picture of reproduction in the (mountain lion)  population."  </P> <P> Beier said as many as 35 lions may roam foothills and canyons in the Santa Ana  Mountains. In 1988, researchers found and tagged four adult cats in Ronald W.  Caspers Regional Park, a 7,500-acre recreation area, where the two 1986  maulings took place.  </P> <P> But the mating patterns of these lions, all females, caused some dismay among  scientists. One of the females is traveling with two yearlings, but the other  three have shown no reproductive activity for more than a year, Beier said.  </P> <P> The four captured recently were found in Blind and Fremont canyons, a rugged  area of mountains, grassland and chaparral owned by the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> Although cattle ranchers use the area for grazing, no stock has been reported  lost to the lions.  </P> <P> Beier said there are occasional sightings of the big cats on Santiago Canyon  Road. An adult and a kitten were found dead on the road early this year.  However, there have been no reports of attacks or encroachments in residential  areas.  </P> <P> Researchers expanded their original study boundary from Caspers Park to north  county in mid-May because the area encompasses land that is destined to become  county wilderness parks.  </P> <P> "The county would like information about how the lions use these habitats so  that when these areas become parks we can use the land in a way that minimizes  the encounters between humans and animals," Beier said.  </P> <P> Although researchers believe the Caspers Park lions travel over a large area of  terrain that takes in parts of Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties, the  range of the north county lions has yet to be determined, Beier said.  </P> <P> Researchers would also like to know where the cats hunt, what they eat, how  they behave at the edge of developed areas -- for example, do they venture into  areas of heavy construction activity? -- and the points at which they cross  Santiago Canyon Road.  </P> <P> Beier said he is working on a proposal to extend the mountain lion study,  scheduled to expire in February, for another three years.  </P> <P> "We really need another three to five years to answer the questions the county  wants answered," Beier said. "Right now, we think the lions are doing OK, but  we would like to make sure."  </P></p>

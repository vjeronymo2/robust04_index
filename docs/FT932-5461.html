			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Wishful thinking over German interest rates lifts prices EUROPEAN government bond markets regained some of their previous losses to close higher on the day, helped by some wishful thinking that the Bundesbank might ease interest rates as early as today. German bond prices picked up sharply towards the close of dealing in London. The recovery was driven by short-covering of positions as some dealers decided to double-guess the Bundesbank ahead of its meeting today. The central bank has been signalling for some time that it is reluctant to lower interest rates because of the poor money supply figures recently. However, there was a perverse argument taken by some in the market that the signals have been intentionally misleading. The June bund futures contract opened down at 93.91 and fell sharply in the morning to 93.58 as the Bundesbank's money market repo drained DM5.5bn from the banking system and left the interest rate at 7.6 per cent. This was compounded by some stop-loss selling when the contract touched 93.68. A short-squeeze forced a reversal and the June contract climbed to finish 21 basis points higher than Tuesday's close at 94.06 and 15 points higher on the day, with heavy turnover of nearly 79,000 contracts. The September contract was also heavily traded as dealers began to roll over into the far month. THE June bond future on the French Matif exchange was dragged up by the performance of the bund market to close 8 basis points stronger at 116.70. THE prospect of a further base rate cut in the UK and a feeling that the bond market had been oversold helped to lift gilt prices yesterday, with the long end of the market gaining over half a point. Figures released by the Bank of England yesterday showed that foreign investors, who have been keen buyers of gilts over the past three months, took up Pounds 1.59bn in April, the highest monthly investment for more than a year. Buyers have been taking advantage of the relative weakness of sterling and one economist argued yesterday that the Bank would be happy for the pound to hit DM2.60 before it intervened. US Treasuries were mixed in light trading yesterday as investors and dealers awaited tomorrow's publication of the May employment report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 103 1/8 , yielding 6.873 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at at 99 29/32 , to yield 4.158 per cent. After Tuesday's big rally, which was sparked by a sharp decline in gold prices, the market settled down yesterday. Dealers reported that activity was unusually light, with many players choosing to digest their gains and wait on the sidelines until tomorrow's release of the May jobs data. Yesterday's economic figures were mixed. Although April's index of leading economic indicators rose only 0.1 per cent, below market expectations, investors chose instead to focus on the day's bearish news, which came in the form of a 22.7 per cent jump in April home sales. The surprisingly strong home sales number led to sporadic selling in early trading, but by the afternoon longer-dated prices had recovered their losses. IN Tokyo, the strength of the yen and consequent high price of government bonds encouraged profit-takers to move in. The price of the Japanese government bond futures contract for September hit a high of 107.42 on the strength of the currency and of US Treasury bonds. However, leading city banks sold into strength and brought it down to 106.95 by the close of dealing in Tokyo, dealers said. The trend continued in London on modest volume but dealers said a two-way view was developing as foreign investors, who had been heavy buyers of Euroyen bonds, began to see them as fully valued and started to switch into government bonds. AUSTRALIAN government bonds recovered from their trouncing on Tuesday caused by the very disappointing level of the current account deficit. The seasonally adjusted figure for April came in at ADollars 1.79bn against predictions of around ADollars 1.2bn. Heavy selling pushed the yield on the 10-year government bond up by 15 basis points to 7.73 per cent but an improvement in the Australian dollar against its US counterpart helped the yield to tick back to 7.64 per cent yesterday.</p>

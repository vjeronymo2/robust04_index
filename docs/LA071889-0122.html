			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL IS ACCUSED OF SAFETY VIOLATIONS IN FATAL REFINERY BLAST  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. and two top officials at its Torrance refinery have been  charged with violating state safety standards in an explosion a year ago that  killed a man and injured two others, according to documents released Monday.  </P> <P> The misdemeanor charges -- filed late Friday in order to avoid the deadline of  a statute of limitations -- name refinery Manager Wyman Robb and Tom Gregory,  then assistant refinery manager for Mobil, in a total of six separate counts of  "willfully" violating occupational safety standards. The Mobil officials also  each face an additional charge that they "induced others to knowingly or  negligently violate the state safety code."  </P> <P> Gregory, who has since been reassigned, was also accused of two counts of  obstructing Torrance fire officials. According to court documents, one Mobil  employee at the explosion scene put his hand in front of a fire investigator's  camera and several others persuaded Mobil employees to stop talking to fire  officials.  </P> <P> Penalties on each charge are jail terms up to six months and fines ranging from  $1,000 to $5,000.  </P> <P> In the fatal accident on July 15, 1988, Cal Cat Chemical employee Winston  Alexander Jones, 30, of Harbor City was on top of a tank that exploded, killing  him instantly. David Moustofi, 32, of Long Beach suffered second- and  third-degree burns on 75% of his body and Jerry Lekberg, 41, of Oakland was  burned on 5% of his body.  </P> <P> In filing the charges against Mobil, Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord also  threatened to seek an unusual probation condition that would allow a judge to  shut the refinery down if it failed to live up to other future conditions of  its probation.  </P> <P> Lord's office filed the charges after the district attorney's office decided  that there was insufficient evidence to support felony involuntary manslaughter  charges against the refinery's supervisors and management, said Deputy Dist.  Atty. Fred Macksoud.  </P> <P> "We felt there was negligence but we didn't feel there was the gross  negligence" necessary for a manslaughter conviction, said Macksoud, of the  district attorney's Environmental Crimes Division.  </P> <P> Neither Robb nor Gregory was available for comment. But Mobil spokesman Jim  Carbonetti said, "We are surprised and disappointed" by the charges and vowed  to contest them in court.  </P> <P> Carbonetti added that company officials had cooperated fully with local, state  and federal agencies and never had been advised about Torrance fire  investigators' complaints of interference. The investigators said in their  report that the explosion was probably caused by failure to follow proper  procedures in handling chemicals that can react with each other violently.  Investigators said that the explosion may also have been caused by sparks from  the use of the wrong electrical cords or the failure to ground equipment  properly.  </P> <P> In addition to the charges against the Mobil officials, a subcontracting firm  also faces action. Charged with three counts each of violating safety standards  -- but not willful or knowing negligence -- were the president, chief chemist  and project manager of Cal Cat Chemical Co. of Benicia, a refinery  subcontracting firm whose workers were cleaning the contaminated water storage  tanks at the refinery.  </P> <P> The explosion July 15 is one of a number of mishaps to plague Mobil's refinery.  The series of explosions, fires and accidents -- which began with an explosion  and two-day fire in November, 1987 -- prompted a city lawsuit alleging that the  refinery is a public nuisance.  </P> <P> In addition, an initiative measure will be placed on the ballot in March, 1990,  to limit the refinery's use of hydrofluoric acid, an acutely toxic substance  used to boost the octane of unleaded gasoline.  </P> <P> Several hours before the July 15 explosion, an unrelated explosion and flash  fire injured eight contractor workers, two seriously, in another part of the  plant. Investigators pegged the cause of that accident to a welding torch that  ignited fumes in a water treatment area.  </P> <P> In their report on the July 15 accident, city fire investigators faulted Mobil  for failing to train refinery workers in handling the substances used to clean  tanks holding water contaminated with sulfur compounds.  </P> <P> Investigators said that Mobil failed to establish and follow a  hazardous-materials management plan. And investigators also said that Mobil had  failed to inform employees of hazardous materials in their work area and that  refinery officials did not follow their own safety procedures.  </P> <P> The Mobil arraignment was set for Aug. 14 by Municipal Judge Thomas Sokolov.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Hugo Martin, James Rainey and Jeffrey L. Rabin contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

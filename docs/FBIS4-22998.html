Pavlov, St. Petersburg; UDC 612.28+612.014.41:612.7]    [Abstract] Reports that nitrogen substitution with the  inert and less dense helium lowers resistance and facilitates  respiratory muscle work and the reverse effect of air  substitution with an SF[.sub]6[/]-oxygen mixture prompted an  investigation into the characteristic features of breathing  control during inhalation of normotoxic helium- and  SF[.sub]6[/]-oxygen mixtures at rest and during constant  muscular activity on the basis of analyzing rapid and stable  changes in the ventilation and biomechanical parameters of the  respiratory system and the level of the central inspiratory  activity. To this end, ten healthy 22-42 year old men, trained  beforehand in order to adapt them to the experimental conditions  until full stabilization of the indicators under study, were  examined using He and SF[.sub]6[/] as the diluent gases  changing the respiratory mixture density at a 20.9+/-0.5%  oxygen concentration. The SF[.sub]6[/]-O[.sub]2[/] density  exceeded that of air by 4.21 times and the He-O[.sub]2[/]  density was less than that of air by 2.94 times. The  experimental procedure is outlined. The study shows that at rest  and especially during muscular work, air substitution with the  He-O[.sub]2[/] mixture suppresses the central inspiratory  drive, respiratory work, and electric activity of the  inspiratory muscles while inhalation of the  SF[.sub]6[/]-O[.sub]2[/] mixture definitely has an  opposite effect: the effort for developing an level lower  maximum inspiratory flow at a constant pulmonary ventilation  (compared to air) and a constant chemoreceptor stimulus rises  while the central inspiratory activity increases by almost  threefold. It is speculated that afferent signals from the  respiratory muscles' mechanoreceptors which maintain the  necessary alveolar ventilation within a broad range of  mechanical stress play a crucial role in optimizing the  ventilation regime in humans in gaseous media with different  density while the ability to assess the stress imposed on the  system is maintained even in patients with a traumatic severance  of the spine in the neck area. Consequently, participation of  the nonmuscular afferents in the respiration resistance  perception cannot be completely ruled out, yet an analysis would  call for a different experiment design and new methodological  techniques.

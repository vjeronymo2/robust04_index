			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Venture capital For some years the government has been trying, with limited effect, to improve the lot of the UK's under-capitalised small company sector. The changes to the venture capital trust scheme announced yesterday should go a long way to improving their prospects. The revised scheme goes further to meet the interests of investors, venture capitalists and the growing companies themselves. As a result, the government's target of attracting Pounds 2.5bn investment into the sector over the next three years looks achievable. For investors, the scale of the tax breaks offered will prove attractive enough to ensure a steady flow of funds. Such investments will be risky, but the venture capital groups' expertise and broad portfolio approach should limit the dangers. As for the companies, the scheme should fill a widely recognised gap in their funding requirements. Fast-growing groups without significant assets often find it difficult to borrow from banks, but are too small to approach the likes of 3i. Now they will benefit not just from urgently needed capital, but also from experienced venture capitalists' advice.</p>

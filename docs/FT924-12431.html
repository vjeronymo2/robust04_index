			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wolseley surprises with 14% rise SHARES IN Wolseley, the heating and plumbing distributor which owns the Plumb Centre chain, yesterday rose 64p, or 19 per cent, to 408p after the company announced higher than expected profits. Pre-tax profits increased some 14 per cent to Pounds 91.3m in the year to July 31. Analysts had expected Pounds 70m and Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, said the company forecast a lower figure. 'These results took us somewhat by surprise,' he said. The group was helped by a second-half upturn on the US East Coast, a better-than-expected Pounds 7.9m contribution from Brossette, the French company acquired in February, and a 49 per cent increase in operating profits from a streamlined manufacturing division. But Mr Lancaster remained cautious. He said France was weakening and no improvement was expected in the UK. Turnover increased 12.5 per cent to Pounds 1.95bn, mainly due to the inclusion of Brossette and a strong performance by two of the company's four US subsidiaries. Ferguson, which operates throughout the East Coast, increased profits 34 per cent and saw record sales in July as lower interest rates brought signs of recovery. But there was no improvement in California, where Familian recorded its first-ever trading loss. Overall US operating profits increased 3.2 per cent to Pounds 32.5m. The UK was affected by recession and margin pressure. Plumb Centre sales were flat, Builder Centre was weak and plant hire lost money. In spite of Brossette's inclusion operating profits from the UK and France fell 4 per cent to Pounds 38.4m. Manufacturing, which has been overtaken in size by Wolseley's distribution business, increased profits from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 25.5m, of which Pounds 2.3m came from released provisions. The figures were helped by the disposal of two loss-making subsidiaries. Car aerial and pump manufacturing performed well. Wolseley said cash flow remained strong. In spite of taking on about Pounds 30m of borrowings with Brossette, net borrowings fell almost Pounds 9m to Pounds 58.9m, giving gearing of 17.2 per cent. Earnings per share increased 13 per cent to 26.27p. A final dividend of 9.45p is proposed, to make a total of 12.55p, up 3.7 per cent. At the interim stage, Wolseley's profits fell from Pounds 38m to Pounds 33.7m pre-tax. See Lex</p>

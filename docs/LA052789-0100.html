			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL AIDE PLEADS GUILTY IN PROBE OF INSURANCE FRAUD  </P> <P> A former office administrator for a Woodland Hills law firm pleaded guilty  Friday to mail fraud and agreed to cooperate with federal authorities  investigating a group of Los Angeles-area lawyers suspected of defrauding  insurance companies of millions of dollars in legal fees.  </P> <P> Kathleen M. Monahan, 45, became the third target of the federal probe to agree  to assist the government. She was accused of mailing an inflated bill from the  office of attorney Alan Arnold to an insurance company in November, 1985. U.S.  District Judge John Rhoades set an Aug. 21 sentencing date for Monahan, who  pleaded guilty to a single count of mail fraud.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyers Investigated  </P> <P> The Times reported last January that federal authorities are investigating at  least a dozen lawyers from the San Fernando Valley, the Westside of Los Angeles  and Beverly Hills who have appeared together repeatedly in cases in which  insurers were obliged to pay their fees.  </P> <P> Federal investigators and insurers contend that the lawyers conspired to  prolong litigation and fatten their fees through various legal maneuvers,  including filing spurious claims against each other's clients. Some of this  litigation is still pending, including cases in San Diego, Orange and Los  Angeles counties.  </P> <P> According to the charge against Monahan, she was part of a scheme "to defraud  the judicial systems of the United States and the state of California and  numerous insurance companies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Network of Attorneys'  </P> <P> The fraud on the courts stemmed from the lawyers representing themselves as  "independent attorneys, free from any conflict of interest," when in fact they  were part of "a network of attorneys with interlocking financial and  professional interests," according to the charge.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. George D. Hardy declined to say when more charges will be  filed. He confirmed that Monahan's plea bargain, sealed by court order,  requires her to assist the investigation.  </P> <P> Last February, Suzanne Rubin, former operator of a Reseda-based court reporting  service, pleaded guilty to one mail fraud count and agreed to cooperate in the  probe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agreed to Guilty Plea  </P> <P> A third target, Studio City lawyer Marc I. Kent, has not been formally charged,  but has agreed to plead guilty to two counts of mail fraud, Kent's lawyer and  prosecutors said.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed against the alleged mastermind of the scheme,  attorney Lynn B. Stites, who divides his time between homes in Bell Canyon in  Ventura County and Gstaad, Switzerland.  </P> <P> In court papers, prosecutors have referred to Stites as "the organizing  attorney," saying he had "a secret financial connection" with other lawyers in  the group. Stites has refused interview requests.  </P></p>

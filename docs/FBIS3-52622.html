He said former members of the Parcham (flag) and Khalq  (people) Parties and militias supporting them, misused the  general amnesty in Afghanistan. "The Islamic government will no  longer pardon the rebels who challenge the authority of the  government," he warned.    Kheyrkhah added that the Afghan Government has never  recognized the militias supporting General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam.    He was critical of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar who  leads the Hezb-e Eslami and said he was trying to take advantage  of any "illegal leverage" to strike a blow on the Islamic  government.    According to the Afghan diplomat most of the mojahedin  parties are firmly behind the Kabul government in the recent  clashes which began four days ago.    President Rabbani's forces have mopped up central Kabul of  Hekmatyar's and Dostum's forces and are going ahead with their  cleaning up operations in the suburb of Kabul, he said.    Kheyrkhah said government forces have attacked Dostum's  headquarters in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, captured  the airport and forced Dostum to flee the city.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- Heavy fighting has  been going on for two days on the several-dozen-km-long front  line in the northern part of the Sarajevo battlefield.    According to Serb intelligence sources, Muslim forces have  engaged about 15,000 soldiers of the 7th, 2d, and 3d Corps, as  well as parts of the Sarajevo Corps, in their attacks from the  direction of Kakanj and Vares, Mt. Zvijezda, and Olovo.    According to an assessment by Serb military sources, the  objective of the comprehensive Muslim operation is to capture  the Nisici plateau, to take control of the Nisici-Srednje and  Olovo-Sarajevo roads, and to break through the lines in Ilijas  and Vogosca, which would enable them to link their forces from  central Bosnia with those from Sarajevo.

Twenty people are under arrest, and  they reportedly received gifts or favors to change their votes,  according to the Attorney General's Office.    [Begin Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta recording] We  received reports in certain instances that gifts such as lunch  and tickets were given to people who voted. [end recording]    There was a positive assessment of the participation of  state  officials in the political campaign.    [Begin Arrieta recording] Quite the contrary, concerning  officials' participation in the electoral process, there was a  significant decrease.

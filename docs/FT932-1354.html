			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / New review expected for Thorp THE GOVERNMENT is likely to announce in the next few days that the future of the controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria will be assessed in a second round of public consultation. The move, after months of deadlock, would almost certainly delay a final decision on British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 2.8bn plant until the autumn. The question of whether to give the go-ahead to Thorp, which environmentalists have labelled Britain's biggest white elephant, is one of the most contentious environmental issues facing the government. In a detailed report, commissioned last month, BNF claims that each week of delay costs it Pounds 2.4m - its earlier estimate was Pounds 2m. It originally expected to get a licence to start operating the plant in January this year. The report says a nine-month delay - to September - could cut more than Pounds 90m off the total profit in the first 10 years of operation, which BNF has estimated at Pounds 500m. BNF adds in the report that if the government proceeds with a further consultation it will cut the costs of delay by laying off some of the 1,750 staff who have been waiting to start up the plant. BNF's figures assume that about a third of the costs of delay can be passed to foreign customers under 'cost-pass-through' contracts. It is understood, however, that this has not yet been raised with customers - if they resisted, the costs of delay could be higher. Ministerial backing for more consultation follows recent advice from the attorney-general that the government would run the risk of judicial review on its eventual decision, prompted by legal action from pressure groups, if it were not seen to consider the economic case for the plant. The Department of the Environment is preparing a report setting out the environmental and economic case for the plant, which could be published by August. Collecting public responses could take at least two months. Any consultation appears likely to stop short of the full public inquiry which environmental groups such as Greenpeace have demanded. BNF has said in the past that it sees no need for further assessment, but last night it declined to comment. Energy economists such as the Sussex University-based Science Policy Research Unit have criticised BNF's claim that abandoning the plant would lose the UK Pounds 900m in the next 10 years.</p>

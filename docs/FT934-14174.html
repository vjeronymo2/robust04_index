			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (18): Subscriber base now 23 million - Mobile communications / The world's fastest growing cellular market is the Asia-Pacific region OVER the past 18 months Europe has provided the launchpad for the second generation of mobile telecommunications networks and a new range of services based on digital rather than analogue technology. These new digital networks - labelled with acronyms like GSM, MCN and PCN (or PCS in the US) - promise to deliver a wide range of sophisticated new voice and data services to corporate, individual and residential customers and will help ensure that mobile telephony remains the fastest growing segment of the world telecommunications industry. The 1980s saw the birth of mobile cellular telecommunications, but the 1990s have seen them blossom. According to Mobile Communications, the FT Newsletter, the worldwide cellular telephone subscriber base grew by more than 40 per cent to 23m last year. In the US, which remains the biggest cellular market, subscriber numbers have grown from around a million in 1984 to over 12m today and the pace is still accelerating. Economic and Management Consultants International (ECMI), the Washington-based consultancy, has forecast 17.7m US subscribers by the end of 1995 and 25m a year later. In western Europe the picture is similar with the subscriber base rising by almost 35 per cent to 7.25m in the 12 months to the end of July. CIT Research, the London-based technology consultancy, has predicted nearly 12m subscribers by the end of 1996 and 19.1m by the year 2000. Growth is more difficult to predict in eastern Europe although a number of countries including Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have plans for cellular systems and some like Hungary are leapfrogging the older analogue technology and moving directly to digital systems. In some areas of the former Eastern Bloc, including eastern Germany, cellular systems provide a relatively cheap and effective alternative to the dilapidated, inadequate and unreliable fixed wire systems. Licensing new cellular operators - sometimes including overseas companies like US West - also provides an opportunity to introduce competition. But the fastest growing cellular market is the Asia-Pacific region. The number of cellular subscribers in the largest markets grew by 50 per cent to 4m last year, and growth in the current year is again expected to outstrip that in Europe and the US. Indeed, it is not just cellular radio services which are booming in region. Telepoint and paging services have also proved highly popular, particularly in Hong Kong where there are now three telepoint networks and more than 800,000 paging subscribers, matching the tally for the whole of the UK. This worldwide surge in demand for mobile telecommunications services means that by the end of this decade half of all telephone calls world-wide are expected to originate or terminate on a mobile phone - and a growing proportion of those telephones will be operating on the new digital technology. Digital technology provides some advantages over older analogue systems. Among these, digital mobile telephones can provide more reliable, clearer and more secure telecommunications - although at least for the moment these usually have to be offset by higher equipment costs. But digital services are also intrinsically more 'efficient' because by converting ordinary sound into computer code they can also pack at least 10 times as many calls into the same 'space' in the radio spectrum. They are also easier to integrate with modern fixed telecommunications and data processing equipment and enable network operators and others to provide a wide range of value added customer services like messaging services and data transmission. Although the US led way with the first generation of cellular services in the early 1980s, Europe has taken the lead in switch to digital systems in the 1990s. The driving force behind this move was the adoption in the mid-1980s of a pan-European digital telecommunications standard called GSM, (Groupe Speciale Mobile). The adoption of a single digital standard to provide a seamless cellular system across Europe has provided several key advantages including ensuring substantial economies of scale for infrastructure and handset equipment manufacturers. In contrast, in the US a dispute between network operators over two rival digital standards, one called time division multiple access (TDMA) and the other called code-division multiple access (CDMA) has delayed the widespread introduction of digital systems. Twenty-three operators in 16 European countries committed themselves to building GSM networks, and more than another 20 countries around the world, including many in Asia, have adopted GSM as the basis for their next generation of cellular services. The first GSM networks were launched 15 months ago in Germany, France and Denmark, and all the leading European Community states apart from Spain now have them in operation, although in some coverage is still patchy. GSM subscribers have accounted for about one third of all new subscribers to cellular networks in western Europe since then. By the end of this year, Dataquest is forecasting that there will be 1.1m digital subscribers in Europe, growing to 8.31m by the end of 1996. The biggest market by far has been Germany which had over 500,000 subscribers to its two GSM networks by the end of July - 80 per cent of the European total. Most countries have licensed two GSM network operators in contrast to the first generation of cellular analogue networks, which were mostly provided by the state-controlled PTTs except for the UK where two competing analogue cellular network operators were also licensed. These were Cellnet, in which BT, the former state monopoly operator, holds a 60 per cent stake, and Vodafone , the market leader. Vodafone's GSM network is already operational while Cellnet plans to launch its system early next year, initially on a regional basis. Meanwhile, Vodafone has already has reached GSM roaming agreements with a number of other network operators overseas which enables GSM subscribers carrying their personal smartcards to make calls using a GSM phone anywhere in Europe. For the moment, these GSM services are mostly being marketed as premium services for business customers. Another set of new digital services, being pioneered in the UK, are aimed at the broader consumer market, complimentary rather than rival to the traditional fixed line domestic telephone. Last month the first of these new PCN (Personal Communications Network) services, dubbed One-2-One, was launched in the London area by a joint venture of Mercury Communications and US West. Initially, its coverage is confined to the M25 area around London, but there are plans to expand coverage rapidly. Next April a second PCN service is due to be launched by Hutchison Microtel, a subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom. Meanwhile, Vodafone has launched a second national digital service called MetroDigital which exploits GSM technology. Like One-2-One MetroDigital is designed to provide a lower-cost local digital portable telephone service for use mainly in urban areas. The arrival of these new services has, as expected, already triggered an advertising blitz and fierce pricing war between operators in the UK and is also likely to lead to some repositioning of the two analogue networks - both Cellnet and Vodafone have recently revised their tariff structures. Elsewhere in Europe, PCN services are likely to be developed in Germany, France and Spain. Some countries have also licensed digital call-only Telepoint services, such as Hutchison's Rabbit service in the UK and France Telecom's Be-Bop service in Paris. GSM and the other new digital services will not replace the older analogue networks immediately - there will probably be a gradual migration to them. Similarly, although it is likely to be many years before mobile systems can compete directly on cost with fixed wire networks, new competition is likely to erode the premium that mobile telephony still commands.  ---------------------------------------    WESTERN EUROPEAN CELLULAR GROWTH  --------------------------------------- This list shows the top 12 countries for subscriber growth in 1992, with the percentage growth share in each case.

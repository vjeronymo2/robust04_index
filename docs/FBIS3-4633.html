			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] After Harmoko was elected to the general  chairmanship of the DPP [Executive Committee] of GOLKAR  [Functional Group] at its Fifth National Congress and Megawati  Soekarnoputri became the general chairman of the DPP of the PDI  [Indonesian Democratic Party] last December, attention has now  shifted to who will lead the PPP [United Development Party].  Will the PPP put forward someone new? Who will replace Buya  Ismail and will he be capable of matching the agility shown by  Harmoko and Megawati?    Although it is not yet clear what political tricks Harmoko  and Megawati will put into action, we can make some quick  guesses. Harmoko will probably raise the issue of poverty, which  the Sixth Development Cabinet has made a priority. There is some  evidence that this problem hurt GOLKAR in the eyes of the people  in the last general election because the PDI took over the  notion of the "little people," which is identical to poverty. On  the other hand, Megawati might stir up the problem of  democratization and human rights and also indirectly resurrect  the romantic notion of her deceased father's greatness and  advance the fervor of the "little people," something already  brought up by Soerjadi.    Although the 1997 general elections are still four years  away, they feel closer because conjecture is that the "festival  of democracy" at the end of this century will be very intense.  All that's left is the PPP. Will it grasp the best opportunities  in this arena of struggle or will it allow the party to become  smaller, trapped as it is between GOLKAR and the PDI?    It is clear that the appearance of Megawati on the scene is  an indication that the current of political democratization is  growing stronger and that the undercurrent can no longer be  dictated to according to the will of the superstructure. The  undercurrent is showing that it is winning and this, we can be  certain, will burst out everywhere. We can be sure that the  congresses to be held by the NU [Moslem Scholars Association]  and by the PPP in 1994, for example, will be important political  events. Various political observers have recently pointed out  that 1994 will be a difficult year politically; this cannot be  separated from those two events. At the same time, conjecture is  that demonstrations on human rights, democratization, or cases  of that kind will also continue to flare up.    Conjecture is that the NU congress will be very lively  because up to now there have not been any candidates for the  position held by Gus Dur (Abdurahman Wahid -- editor) who can  equal the quality of his leadership. Although Gus Dur stated  some time ago that he was not willing to be a candidate for the  general chairmanship of the PB [Executive Committee] of the NU,  the majority of NU's rank and file, especially the younger  generation, still hopes that he will be prepared to lead them  again. Things will be very lively if Gus Dur is willing to be  put up again as a candidate on grounds that he is receiving  strong support from the undercurrent, even if the superstructure  seems less than willing to accept him. So it is thought that  there will be a political clash. The problem is: Whether that  clash will be as strong as the one in the PDI or not depends on  how the government views it, especially as far as the interests  of GOLKAR's political hegemony are concerned.    At the same time, projections are that the PPP congress will  be even more intense because the strong current of  democratization which is running through it will force the NU to  reclaim its position in the PPP after having been dominated for  such a long time by the MI [Indonesian Muslims]. It is quite  possible that these two factions, which have been jockeying for  position in the PPP for such a long time, are now setting up  strategies for the upcoming congress. The NU is busy trying to  figure out how to reclaim its dominance and the MI will make  every effort to defend its position. Conjecture is that the  clash will be intense and the slogan "fusion is now complete,"  promoted up to now by members of the PPP, will be tested again.  The NU will claim its position as the PPP's largest shareholder.  Political gamesmanship is a matter of the battle for and the  distribution of power. Having learned from the Megawati case,  the NU will probably not want to accept a candidate for its  leadership who is just handed to it by the bureaucracy, i.e., by  the MI faction, as has been done up to now. But this all depends  on the level of NU's political independence within the PPP. Has  it gotten to the point where it can think strategically in that  way or can it still be easily manipulated, as it has in the past?    NU's desire to reclaim its position in the PPP is part of  the  nervousness felt by NU members at seeing the development of  GOLKAR and of the PDI under the respective leadership of Harmoko  and of Megawati. Only if the NU wholly returns to the PPP will  the party be able to rise again, as when it was triumphant in  the 1977 and 1982 general elections.    As is well known, the PPP has gone downhill since the 1987  general elections, after the NU adopted the firm policy of no  longer supporting the PPP. In fact, in the 1987 general  elections NU figures stood shoulder to shoulder with each other  to deflate the PPP's figures. This just shows that without the  NU the PPP is actually just a toothless tiger, there is nothing  in it.    The NU adopted a firm policy of no longer supporting the PPP  because of the political actions of Naro, who is from the MI  faction, towards NU figures within the PPP. It seems easy to  ignore the fact that Naro was a government man who was  infiltrated into the PPP to deflate that party's figures so as  to guarantee GOLKAR's continued political hegemony as the  "single majority party". It is quite clear that Naro's political  maneuvers were intended to push the NU somewhat out of the PPP  and over into GOLKAR. This is quite natural because GOLKAR needs  strong roots and GOLKAR knows that no group has stronger  underground roots than the NU. Isn't GOLKAR just a "banyan  tree"--and note that this is NU's symbol--which, no matter how  big it is, cannot be sturdy without fertile "soil"?    Before it merged with the PPP, the general elections of 1955  and of 1971 proved that the NU was strong. In the 1955 general  election, for example, the NU took third place with 45 seats,  behind the PNI [Indonesian Nationalist Party] and Masyumi. In  the 1971 general election the strong political forces which had  been victorious during Bung Karno's time, such as the PNI and  Masyumi (which became Parmusi [Indonesian Moslem Party]/MI),  became weaker, except for the NU, which still held its own.  Because of its sturdy roots, NU's power could not be shaken even  though it was hit by various political crises.    On grounds of a program of political restructuring, the NU  was forced to merge with the PPP together with other small  Islamic political parties. It must be admitted that when the PPP  was created, the NU was the dominant faction compared with the  other parties. It is not an exaggeration to say that the keys to  the PPP's strategic politics at that time were held by  charismatic NU figures.    The NU was unable to face up to this program and was forced  to merge into the PPP. Even though it was predicted from the  start that the party would be dogged by internal conflicts, it  turned out that the NU was able to smooth them over in order to  face an even greater battle: winning the general election. But  when Naro entered the picture, NU politicians could no longer  continue to tolerate them.    The firm policy of not supporting a particular political  party--the PPP--allowed NU members to make their own political  decisions. In the 1987 general elections GOLKAR's spectacular  rise was actually closely connected to the contributions made by  NU rank and file, most of whom changed their political choice  from the PPP to GOLKAR. NU politicians struggled to support  GOLKAR in hopes that the NU, the largest mass organization in  the country, would get a sufficient political reward.    But it seems that NU's strong support of GOLKAR in the 1987  general elections was not welcomed in any significant way. It is  clear that temporary use was made of the NU in the interests of  the 1987 general elections and that afterwards it was disposed  of again. Ironically, many NU figures were willing to be  manipulated in that way when they sacrificed the support of the  rank and file who made a large contribution to GOLKAR's victory.  In turn, the break in GOLKAR-NU relations could no longer be  avoided and it seems that the NU no longer fully supported  GOLKAR in the 1992 general elections, which resulted in a drop  in the number of votes for that party, especially in the NU's  base, for example in East Java.    Conjecture is that the strained relationship between GOLKAR  and the NU will mean that NU politicians, for example younger  figures such as Slamet Effendy Yusuf, will not be among GOLKAR's  leaders in the period 1993 to 1998. If NU politicians are not  among GOLKAR's leaders in the period 1993 to 1998, conjectures  are that the relationship between the NU and GOLKAR will become  even worse. That is why it is possible that the NU's rank and  file will return in droves to the PPP at the next general  election.    It is clear that at the 1994 PPP congress the NU, as the  largest shareholder, will reclaim its position at the top of the  party leadership. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Row as LME fails to act over squeeze on zinc A ROW blew up yesterday about the apparent inaction of the London Metal Exchange's executive committee in the face of a technical squeeze on the zinc market. The backwardation - premium for cash metal over forward prices  -soared to Dollars 217 a tonne. Traders said that during the late afternoon Dollars 60 a tonne was being paid to borrow zinc for one day but this eventually fell back to Dollars 20. When a similar situation arose on the exchange in December, 1989, the LME executive imposed a limit of Dollars 20 a tonne on the daily backwardation and questions were being asked last night about why it had not acted this time. Traders suggested Metallgesellschaft, the German group, was playing a key role but its LME ring dealing subsidiary insisted there was no concerted action either by MG or its many customers to squeeze the market. Some of its associates had turned to the LME to cover sales contracts which they might have difficulty filling because of technical difficulties. For example, in Canada Cominco's Trail lead-zinc refinery was not performing properly yet; in Australia floods in Queensland had delayed shipments by MIM; and in Germany the Berzelius refinery was to close sooner than expected for a refit. An MG official said that it had not attempted 'to draw blood' from the shorts - those who had sold zinc they did not own and were now attempting to cover their positions - and its customers had all agreed to back MG's efforts to ensure that the LME zinc market remained liquid. The LME executive had been kept fully informed. He hoped that the shorts also had good reasons for their position. 'But our clients are zinc miners, smelters, refiners and dealers and I have no sympathy for anyone who deliberately sells zinc they do not own to push the price down just because a trend line on a chart crosses a particular point. Traders said the main victim of the squeeze was an investment fund and that the squeeze was likely to be over by the end of April. Meanwhile, the large backwardation is drawing huge quantities of zinc into LME warehouses and traders are expecting an extra 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes to show up in today's stock figures. Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken, said there was no fundamental reason for zinc prices to rise. 'There are ample stocks of the metal,' he said. The LME executive failed to respond to a request for comment last night after zinc for immediate delivery closed Dollars 107.5 a tonne up at Dollars 1,430 while metal for delivery in three months rose by Dollars 6.50 a tonne to Dollars 1,213.50.</p>

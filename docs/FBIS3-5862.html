Mak and B.A. Hamzah: "Navy Blues" -- from </F> "The 5th Column"]    [Text] Since World War II, Thailand's defence has been  focused landward, on the northwestern trans-Mekong region.  Today that focus appears to have changed. As the Thai military  expands and modernises its forces, it seems to have taken a  heavy maritime bias. Such a shift is not immediately explicable,  given that Thailand has no real external threats to its maritime  security. So long as good relations exist with China, Bangkok  need not fear Beijing, and even India's forces serve more as a  counterweight to Indonesia than a threat to Thailand. The more  likely explanation for the Thai navy's ambitious modernisation  drive is Thailand's desire to protect its economic  infrastructure, especially since the nation's industrial and  economic zones are located along or near the coast.    Whatever the reason, it is quite clear that the Thais are  attempting to build a "two-ocean" navy to maintain simultaneous  control over its eastern and western seaboards, respectively the  Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. Long-term plans include  the acquisition of two helicopter carriers, the addition of  three new naval bases, the construction of new frigates and,  ultimately, a submarine programme. Together these plans suggest  that Thailand may be thinking about more than simple protection  of its economic interests. The country's former navy chief,  Adm. Wichet Karunyawanit, has noted that although Thailand now  enjoys "friendly relations with all its neighbours, we cannot  afford to be complacent. We need to maintain our military  preparedness."    Some of Thailand's hardware choices appear to put steel into  the admiral's words. For example, although the helicopter  carrier contracted from Spain ostensibly would be used for  disaster relief, it will be built with a 12-degree ski ramp.  For helicopter operations such a ramp would be a distinct  handicap. But it makes perfect sense for operating  Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing aircraft such as the Harrier  jet fighter. Indeed, sources say the navy is in fact  considering the purchase of surplus Harriers from the Spanish  navy.    Likewise, a major port, north of Sattahip, includes a  dockyard designed to do more than just support the helicopter  carrier. Its mid-length gate design will also allow the  simultaneous docking of two frigates. Altogether Thailand's  naval expansion is the most dramatic within Asean.    Naturally these moves have made some in Asean nervous. True  enough, those who believe that Asean's future security needs  will be met collectively may find Thailand's purchase of an  aircraft carrier and more frigates reassuring. But Asean today  remains far from any such arrangement and indeed cannot yet  agree even on the establishment of a defence pact. And though  the Thai navy's current chief, Adm. Prachet Siridet, has  completed a regionwide visit to reassure his counterparts that  Thailand's purchases are for purely defensive purposes, the  question remains: defence against whom -- and what?    An article last year in THE NATION, a leading Thai daily,  may  provide a clue. According to the article, by the year 2010 the  U.S.-Thai security relationship would no longer be significant.  Indeed, the U.S. by then would be Thailand's "Friendly Enemy  Number One." The article further predicted that Thailand would  re-ally itself with Japan, as it did during the Japanese  invasion of Southeast Asia more than a half-century ago. Most  ominously, the article claimed that the Thai navy would become  "the most influential policy decision-maker in 2010 -- since  Thailand now has the world's third-largest fishing fleet" after  Japan and Taiwan.    This latter is not a comforting scenario for Thailand's  neighbours. These neighbours harbour strong suspicions about  Bangkok's aspirations for blue-water status, not least because  Thailand over the past 300 years has had expansionist tendencies  whenever it was militarily strong. Indeed, THE NATION even  offered a scenario in the year 2008 in which a war is almost  provoked when a Thai fishing trawler fitted with modern defence  systems sinks a Malaysian patrol boat in the Malaysian fishery  zone.    Far-fetched? Not if you consider past incidents when Thai  fishing trawlers deliberately rammed Malaysian patrol boats in  an effort to escape arrest for poaching. In one incident last  year, Thai fishermen abducted a Malaysian sailor to Hat Yai and  released him only after official protests were made. One  Malaysian sailor is still missing and believed to have been  thrown overboard by the fisherman.    The point is that Thailand has made a move to join the big  league with its naval purchases, especially the carriers, and  its neighbours need reassuring. Aircraft carriers, after all,  can be regarded as offensive platforms for power projection,  which is why all Southeast Asia fears China's planned  acquisition of a carrier and why India's carriers provoked  suspicion despite a substantive public relations effort to  soothe fears.    The one thing that is certain is that the Thai navy will  make  big waves when it takes delivery of its first carrier three  years from now and embarks on its planned submarine programme.  Will these be used to protect its fishing fleet? Are we  witnessing the rise of a new maritime power flexing its muscles  in Southeast Asian seas? Will the Thais trigger a new arms race?  Or are they merely responding to Malaysia's purchase of two  British frigates -- or China's expansion into the South China  Sea? These are questions many in Asean are asking. And right  now we have more questions than answers.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Uphill fight for Taiwan grand plan - A Dollars 300bn, six-year infrastructure programme suffers from cuts, corruption and crime / The problems besetting a scheme to raise the islanders' quality of life After years of delays, the Mucha line of Taipei's Mass Rapid Transit system is scheduled to start running by the end of the month. But no one is putting money on that deadline being met either. The Dollars 16.6bn Taipei MRT was to have been the centrepiece of Taiwan's Dollars 300bn, six-year national infrastructure development plan, announced in 1990 with great fanfare. Instead it has become a symbol of the troubles of the ambitious scheme, which has been plagued by massive cuts, delays, corruption and interference from organised crime. Lured by glossy government brochures and the promise of substantial business, international contractors flocked to Taiwan after the plan was announced. Most have been disillusioned. 'The way things are structured right now, this is a terrible market - one of the worst markets in Asia,' said an American working at an international construction company. Like others interviewed he asked not to be identified. 'In this respect Taiwan is quite similar to Japan, although Japan has gotten better in recent years. It's extremely difficult for outsiders to come in. You can get jobs if you play the game, but to get jobs and make money - that's a completely different story.' Historically the ruling Nationalist party has been loath to invest in infrastructure, preferring instead to bank funds for an illusory reconquest of mainland China. After martial law was lifted in 1987 there was a public outcry against the 'carpetbagger' regime. The development plan was in part an attempt to address demands for services and improvements in the quality of life for the highly industrialised island's 21m residents. But the scheme was also used as a bargaining tool to wrest diplomatic concessions from western governments. The US, the UK, France and Germany risked Beijing's wrath subtly to upgrade relations with Taiwan. Hence the plan's original eye-catching price tag, hugely inflated by the inclusion of projects already under way. In fact only a third of the 700-odd projects were new. In mid-1993 the plan was officially scaled back to some 300 projects costing more than Dollars 200bn. But two-thirds of them have fallen well behind schedule and many others are being quietly dropped. Projects on the drawing board include a proposed 345km high-speed rail from Taipei to Kaohsiung at a cost of Dollars 16.7bn; a planned Dollars 10.8bn mass transit system for the city of Kaohsiung; 22 power projects totalling some Dollars 22bn, including the Dollars 6.7bn fourth nuclear power station, now out to tender; a range of smaller environmental projects; and telecommunications projects. In late July the government said it planned to relax restrictions on foreign companies' participation in the domestic construction industry to comply with entry rules for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Taiwan wants to join by the end of the year. The Gatt's government procurement agreement stipulates that foreign companies must not be discriminated against in the awarding of government contracts above Dollars 5m. Before November 1993, bidding on public construction contracts in Taiwan was open only to non-Japanese companies. This was part of an effort to counter Taiwan's growing trade deficit with Japan. But many Japanese have been able to circumnavigate these restrictions. Citing obstacles ranging from labyrinthine bureaucracy to rigged bidding practices, industry insiders expect strong resistance to implementing the Gatt provisions. Simply gaining access to information is the first difficulty. Five ministries are in charge of developing and administering their own individual projects, and there is little co-ordination. Infrastructure projects tend to be dominated by state-run contractors, especially the Bureau of Engineering Services and the Retired Servicemen's Engineering Agency. Politicians are often shareholders in Taiwanese contracting companies and have access to privileged information on tenders, such as secret price ceilings. Politicians are also alleged to exert influence on the bidding process. . Foreign companies complain of archaic regulations out of line with international practices, complex bidding criteria and tendering conditions, difficulties in procuring imported labour, elaborate licensing systems and problems enforcing contractual agreements. Price ceilings are often set at unrealistically low levels, so foreign companies may not bid directly. Instead they subcontract parts of the project from the local company that wins the bid. This is however fraught with hazards as the foreign company is used as a handy scapegoat if something goes wrong. The ubiquitous problem of underworld influence in the construction industry has been made worse by the large sums of money involved in the six-year plan. 'The gangsters are realising this is good business,' said a Taiwanese working for a foreign engineering company. Part of the problem is that the government gives out exceptionally high advance payments - often 25 per cent - for contracts. Companies associated with organised crime win the contract, take the advance payment offshore and invest it. The actual work is then subcontracted out. This often results in shoddy workmanship.</p>

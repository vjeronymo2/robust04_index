			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Indosuez bank sets up US investment arm BANQUE Indosuez, the French group, announced yesterday it had set up a New York-based US investment banking arm, Indosuez Capital. The new unit, headed by Mr Les Lieberman, a former investment banker at Wall Street finance house Kidder Peabody, will give North American clients access to Banque Indosuez's capital, its worldwide investment banking network, and its institutional customer base. Mr Lieberman said Indosuez Capital would complement the parent's existing successful US trading operation, which trades foreign exchange, fixed-income securities and non-equity derivatives. The new unit will focus on merchant banking activities, financial restructurings, private placements in debt and equity securities, and mergers and acquisitions. Its establishment, however, will not effect the existing arrangement with Blackstone Group, the US investment banking boutique which works with Banque Indosuez on some deals.</p>

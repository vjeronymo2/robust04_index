			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Refinancing plans expected at Young Group Young Group, the USM-quoted opencast and drift coal-mining concern, is expected to announce today a refinancing package, following the suspension yesterday of its shares for the second time in seven weeks. The company requested yesterday's suspension - early last month it warned of substantially lower-than-expected profits for the year to November 30 1991 - announcing that it needed more working capital and confirming that it was in negotiation with its bankers and large shareholders to arrange additional finance. As expected the Durham-based company, which operates in the UK and Venezuela, failed to publish its annual results by the end of March. The warning, which coincided with the reinstatement of dealings in its shares after a fortnight's suspension from mid-February, triggered a dive from 96p at resumption. When dealing was again suspended yesterday, the price was 35p. Confirmation last week of a Pounds 16m contract from British Coal Opencast, Young's biggest-ever scheme, did not deliver the hoped-for boost to the share price.</p>

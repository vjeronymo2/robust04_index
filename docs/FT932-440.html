			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht bill challenge defeated THE government last night defeated a challenge to the Maastricht treaty bill from Euro-sceptic peers by a majority of 177 in the Lords. But 16 Tories, including former cabinet minister Lord Tebbit, defied the government. On the fourth day of the committee stage, peers rejected by 207 to 30 a move by Labour's Lord Bruce to exclude from EC competence 'a contribution to education and training of quality and to the flowering of the cultures of the member states'.</p>

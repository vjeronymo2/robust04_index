			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Abtrust to raise size of trust Abtrust is seeking to increase the size of its New Dawn investment trust by more than 50 per cent with a conversion share issue. The trust, which invests in the Far East excluding Japan, currently has assets of about Pounds 80m. A placing of the C shares has already raised Pounds 29m, net of expenses, and the public offer, which opens today, could raise up to Pounds 15m more. Shares in the trust have been trading at a slight premium to net asset value in the last few months. C shares will be issued at 250p, with one warrant attached to every five shares, exercisable at 270p between 1997 and 2000. The C shares will be converted to ordinary shares when 90 per cent of the new money has been invested.</p>

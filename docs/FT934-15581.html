			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Matthew Clark takes control of own fortunes - Philip Rawstorne on the success of the group's three year restructuring programme MATTHEW Clark, the drinks producer and wholesaler, got a solid vote of confidence from the market at the weekend for its three year programme of strategic restructuring. Shares in the group jumped 25p to 523p - a reflection of investors' satisfaction with its latest acquisition, the Pounds 32.5m purchase of Grants of St James's from Allied-Lyons. The fact that the move will be funded by Clark's second rights issue within four months made the reaction even more remarkable. But Grants adds tone as well as substance to the transformation of the group by Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive. Since he began to reshape it in 1990, the shares have outperformed the brewers and distillers sector by 50 per cent. In 1989, Clark was a leading independent drinks distributor. Well over half its annual profits came from Martell cognac, which it had distributed in the UK since 1833. Its portfolio included Jameson's Irish whiskey, Macallan malt whisky, and Taittinger champagne. The only brands Clark could call its own, through a 52 per cent stake in JE Mather, the Leeds-based producer, were Stone's Original ginger wine, and Old England British sherry. Run on traditional lines by the Clark family, which had a shareholding of about 17 per cent, the company was jogging along comfortably until the ground was suddenly cut from under its feet. Seagram took over Martell, Pernod-Ricard acquired Irish Distillers and Clark had lost the distribution of its most profitable brands. For another year, Clark struggled to fill the gap with other agency brands such as Domecq sherry, Fundador brandy, and Grand Marnier liqueur. But the loss of the Macallan Scotch whisky business after the 1990 alliance of Remy Cointreau and Highland Distilleries confirmed the inherent uncertainty of the agency business. By then, Mr Aikens, recruited from Courage by Clark's non-executive directors, was already beginning to devise a strategy for more solidly based growth. Under his direction, the company began a gradual withdrawal from the agency business to concentrate on its core British wine and sherry operations. British sherry may not appeal to connoisseurs - and will even have to stop describing itself as sherry in 1995 - but it sells more readily than the Spanish product. It now has more than 50 per cent of the UK sherry market and sales are growing at more than 6 per cent a year. In December 1990, Clark bought out the minority holders in Mather, Bass and Grand Metropolitan's IDV spirits division, for Pounds 12m. The partnership had been a constraint on Clark's development, effectively preventing it from acquiring or producing new brands because of possible competition with Bass and IDV products. As the search for brand acquisitions got under way, Clark disposed in rapid succession of three non-core businesses, almost recouping the money spent on Mather. A series of management changes followed. The Clark family reduced its shareholding and retired from the scene. Mr Michael Cottrell, chairman of Taunton Cider and former managing director of Courage, took the chair. Mr Hugh Etheridge came from Strong &amp; Fisher as finance director and Mr Tim Hazell, another ex-Courage executive, took over as sales and marketing director. Mr Peter Huntley, a member of Elders IXL strategy group, was appointed business development director. With the arrival last month of Mr Robin Manners, former Bass director, as a non-executive, only one member of the pre-1990 board, Mr Tony Grayson, production director, now remains. Clark took longer than expected to make its first brand acquisition but organic growth in its British sherry and wines operations came up to market expectations in spite of the recession and the squeeze on margins by its main customers, the multiple grocers. An attempt in late 1991 to acquire Allied-Lyons's Showerings business, with brands such as Gaymer's cider, Babycham, and VP wine, failed. A number of other approaches came to nothing. In May last year, however, it bought Strathmore, Scotland's leading bottled water brand, for Pounds 11m. The purchase took Clark into another growth sector. The brand had gained a 25 per cent share of the bottled water market in the Scottish grocery sector in six years and was beginning to expand into England. Sales through Clark's distribution network are now growing at the rate of 20 per cent a year. Earlier this year, Mr Aikens moved into another cash generative growth area with the Pounds 18.6m acquisition of 74.9 per cent of Freetraders, an independent drinks wholesaler. The business, which reported a 45 per cent increase in sales and operating profits of Pounds 2.3m last year, neatly complements Clark's existing strengths in the take-home trade. Even before the addition of Grants' wines and spirits business, Mr Aikens expects the operation to be contributing 40 per cent of Clark's profits within the next six months. In the three years of strategic restructuring, Matthew Clark has taken control of its own fortunes and increased its market capitalisation from Pounds 26m to Pounds 74m.</p>

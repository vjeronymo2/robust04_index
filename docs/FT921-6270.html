			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Norwegian banks' credit losses rise NORWAY'S banking industry last year experienced credit losses of NKr19.8bn (Dollars 3.09bn) in 1991, up from NKr12.3bn in 1990, according to a report released yesterday by the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission. BISC, the country's finance watchdog, said the sharp rise in losses was caused mainly by the experience of the commercial banks. It said the banks' volume of non-performing loans rose significantly, particularly those loans to households, while operating costs also increased sharply due to write-offs on securities and property portfolios. The commercial banks experienced combined credit losses of NKr15.4bn in 1991, up from NKr7.9bn in 1990. The savings banks posted credit losses of NKr4.4bn in 1991, roughly the same as in 1990. BISC said the banks' results in 1991 worsened significantly and 15 commercial banks and nine savings banks - comprising the biggest in each group - posted operating losses last year, against nine of each in 1990. The commercial banks' operating losses totalled NKr14.56bn in 1991 against losses of NKr4.72bn, while the savings banks' losses amounted to NKr1.88bn against NKr1.16bn.</p>

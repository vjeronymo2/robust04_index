			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Holiday discounts described as 'myth' Discounts on holidays being offered by the large travel agency chains are a myth, as consumers are obliged to buy expensive insurance, Mr Christopher Kirker, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said yesterday. Large chains currently offering 11 per cent discounts on summer 1994 holidays were demanding that holidaymakers 'pay two or three times the fair price for obligatory insurance,' Mr Kirker said. He added that the discounts were also being funded by tour operators who were being asked to pay commissions of up to 17.5 per cent if they wanted their brochures to appear on retailers' racks. Mr Kirker said consumers' choice of holiday was being limited by the links between the largest tour operators and travel agents. He said: 'The time has come for our sector of the industry to expose to the British public how restricted is their choice at the multiples' high-street holiday shops, whose recommendations are heavily biased towards their parent tour operator's product, regardless of their suitability.' Mr Kirker added that many consumers did not realise that the reason they were sold a particular holiday was because of incentive agreements between travel agents and tour operators. He said there had been a recent case of a customer going into an agency to request a particular operator's holiday, only to be told that the company was not a 'recommended brand'. Instead, the agency recommended a holiday provided by the tour operator which owned it, Mr Kirker said. He said that the number of holidaymakers who preferred independent travel to a standard package holiday had increased in recent years. 'We know that our clients demand much more freedom of choice than is available at a tour operator-owned multiple holiday shop. They want to choose where they go, when they go, from which airport they wish to fly  - and they expect to stay in accommodation they have selected for the duration they need,' he said.</p>

For consumers to have meaningful input, they need information and better organization. Consumers need to be informed about the complex issues relating to governance and management of the HCBC system, including linkages with the institutional and acute care systems; resource allocation and cost controls; access to services, including eligibility, assessment, and care planning and coordination; and the scope, organization and quality of services. This information should serve to empower consumers to become partners in the planning and implementation of state and community HCBC systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of critical importance is the mobilization and organization of consumers at state and community levels. Effective input into systems development and implementation can be achieved only through the collaboration of individuals and interest groups at all levels within the State. Collective action by consumers, based on sound information, will result in consumer-driven HCBC which is available, accessible and appropriate in relation to defined needs within allocated resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration on Aging is interested in receiving applications for conducting statewide demonstration projects resulting in replicable models of consumer involvement in the design, development, and implementation of home and community based care systems. Such models of consumer-driven HCBC may be targeted to the elderly, or to the elderly in concert with other target populations (e.g. persons with disabilities).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed projects should emphasize empowering individuals and groups at state and community levels to participate in the development of consumer-driven systems of home and community-based care. Applicants must identify the resources and mechanisms for developing and disseminating information, and for the mobilization and organization of individuals and groups to impact on HCBC policy, programs and services. Applicants should also focus on the development and implementation of mechanisms that would allow formal consumer input. Applications should address how proposed strategies will be targeted or modified to reach special populations such as low income and minority individuals and residents of rural areas. Innovative approaches are highly encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals are invited from public and private non-profit organizations with demonstrated experience in representing and serving consumers of home and community based care. The Administration on Aging plans to make 4&hyph;6 awards with an approximate federal share of $125,000 per year for an estimated project period of two (2) years. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> deadline date  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for applications under this priority area is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 1.2&blank;Capacity Building and Mentoring Program in Home and Community Based Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In the absence of a cohesive federal policy on long-term care, States have been in the forefront of developing home and community-based care infrastructures. The staff of certain State Agencies on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging have significant knowledge and experience in the design, promotion, and implementation of home and community based systems. At the same time, the development of state systems has been an uneven process, with some States having achieved comprehensive statewide programs of home and community-based care while others are just now beginning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As highlighted in Part I of this Announcement, home and community based care is one of the Assistant Secretary for Aging's priorities. In the past, the Administration on Aging has funded substantial demonstration and research projects in this area and continues to do so. However, an understanding of, and experience in, the development of state home and community based care infrastructures constitute a unique body of knowledge. It encompasses creating systems to assure quality of care, maximizing consumer choice and participation, developing financing mechanisms and budgetary systems, and understanding the pertinent policy environment. AoA's 1993 Home and Community Based Care Survey of all fifty States documented a variety of technical assistance and capacity-building needs in these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

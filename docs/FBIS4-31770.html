			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/6/1994 -- The Steering  Committee and Council of Delegates of the Socialist Party of  Labor [PSM] released an extensive document entitled "June 1994  Statement" comprising its creed: "The Socialist Party of Labor  was born out of love and obligation for the truth."    The PSM refuses in the document to analyze the current state  of affairs in Romania, which it terms as "the responsibility of  those who took over the power from the Romanian people," "whom  they have deceived and confused," but it rather declares its  discontent, which however "has not turned into confrontation,  blind passion, and street riots," because the PSM does not  believe "that a social state of law can be built through  violence, be it even explainable, by the tendency to seize (by  making noise and use force and terror) the political stage and  the power, in the last analysis."    "Indignant" about the tendency of some political parties and  personalities "to shift the political struggle to the streets,"  the PSM warns the "right" and "the anarchist forces" about what  can result from this: "...We are witnessing in this June 1994 a  new attempt at destabilizing the Romanian state's institutions.  Some try to browbeat and eliminate from activity, in  undemocratic ways, the inconvenient personalities, from  parliamentarians to the country's president." The PSM considers  this is because "certain parties" "have no patience for  democracy," trying instead "to eliminate the political  opponents."    Rejecting violence, extremism and terror, the PSM declares  its "confidence in the democratic values and the respect for the  state of law," inviting its members and supporters "not to react  violently to any provocation and not to allow the escalation of  violence and terror," and addresses this appeal to all fellow  countrymen.</p>

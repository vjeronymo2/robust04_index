			<p>BFN     [Text] In its meeting Thursday, the General Secretariat of  the Nasirite Arab Democratic Party [NADP] decided to hold the  party's second General Congress on 28 and 29 April.    In his political report to the General Secretariat meeting,  NADP Secretary General Diya'-al-Din Dawud said that with the  deteriorating situation in the country, the call for national  dialogue has lost its credibility. He noted that violence is  constantly increasing and there are more than 25,000 detainees  in prisons. Nevertheless, he said, the government is repeating  its claims about security and stability, imagining that it is in  full control, refusing to listen to the views of the opposition,  and believing that the security solution is enough to confront  violence.    The secretary general said that government decisions are  being determined by the policies and dictates of foreign  quarters, like the World Bank and the United States. He noted  the feeble government position on GATT and the government's  promotion of the Middle East market from a position of impotence  and capitulation.    Dawud saluted the valiant Palestinian intifadah and NADP  youths and leaders at universities and in all positions for  rising up to entrench the concept of pan-Arabism, defend the  firm Arab right to Palestine, and confront the continuing  Zionist massacres against our Arab people. He stressed that the  Nasirite voice in our people's anger in the wake of the  al-Ibrahhimi Mosque massacre was the loudest, strongest, and the  best.    Meanwhile, the NADP has issued a statement to the nation on  U.S. President Bill Clinton's description of Jerusalem as  Israel's unified capital. The statement said the American  remarks are a natural result of the humiliating agreement known  as Gaza-Jericho and the full surrender to the Zionist enemy's  designs.</p>

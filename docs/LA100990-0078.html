			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 14 FIRMS TO BACK IBM STANDARD FOR PCS  </P> <P> In a new thrust in the ongoing battle over personal computer standards, 14  computer companies are expected to announce Wednesday that they will join  forces to promote an International Business Machines design called Micro  Channel.  </P> <P> Micro Channel is a pathway -- known as a "bus" -- that carries information from  one point to another within a computer. It also allows computers to give  instructions to peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers. A rival  bus design, known as Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), has the  support of most of IBM's major competitors in the personal computer business,  including Compaq Computer.  </P> <P> The new Micro Channel Developers Assn. will include IBM, Intel, NCR Corp.,  Chips &amp; Technologies and Ing C. Olivetti &amp; Co., sources said. It will  provide PC vendors with technical data about Micro Channel and otherwise  promote its use as an industry standard.  </P> <P> "This group is trying to breathe some life into IBM," said John McCarthy, a  Forrester Group analyst. "They are afraid of losing out to EISA."  </P> <P> EISA, created in September, 1988, was the brainchild of a group of computer  makers known as the Gang of Nine. The group, led by Compaq, received a  tremendous boost last October when Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled the first  personal computer based on EISA. Since then, several computer makers have  adopted the EISA standard for 32-bit computers.  </P> <P> IBM's Micro Channel, introduced as part of the PS/2 family of computers, is  still in more computers than the EISA bus. But lack of the sets of chips needed  to implement Micro Channel has made it more difficult for computer vendors to  use the design, hindering its adoption as an industry standard.  </P> <P> Analysts said the presence of Intel and Chips &amp; Technologies in the Micro  Channel coalition could mean that the group will also unveil plans to develop  chip sets for Micro Channel. Intel already makes a chip set for EISA.  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel at Pounds 2.05m CUSTOMERS of McLeod Russel Holdings, the maker of paint and varnish, seem to be becoming more confident about the future, claimed Mr Nigel Openshaw, the chair-man. In his report covering the six months to March 31 he said pre-tax profit had marginally improved to Pounds 2.05m, against Pounds 1.96m. Turnover was Pounds 21m (Pounds 20.8m). Conditions continued to be difficult for the surface coating companies. The commercial vehicle market remained depressed and average batch sizes were small. The market for Granyte Surface Coatings did not improve, although profits rose as result of cost cutting and improved efficiency. The market for car paint distribution deteriorated, but marine paints traded at a profit. Earnings per share came to 3.13p (3p). The interim dividend is held at 2.75p and the strong balance sheet and ample cash resources underpinned the final (3.1p last time), Mr Openshaw concluded.</p>

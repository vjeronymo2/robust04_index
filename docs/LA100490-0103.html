			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MORE BARS:  </P> <P> The Canyon Inn, 6821 Fairlynn Blvd. (just off Esperanza Road), Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> Open weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. and weekends from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714)  779-0880. Anchored in a strip mall, this may well be the "last of the  neighborhood saloons," as management claims. There's lots of wood, a jukebox  heavy on classic rock, and help that knows the regulars -- from suits to  shirt-sleeves types -- by name. RICK VANDERKNYFF  </P></p>

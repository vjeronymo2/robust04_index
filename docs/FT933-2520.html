			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / US urges China not to test bomb THE US is urging China not to conduct an underground nuclear explosion which would break a year-old worldwide moratorium on nuclear testing. US intelligence reports suggest China is preparing for an explosion at its Lop Nor test site. President Bill Clinton yesterday said China should 'step away' from any plans to test a nuclear bomb. The US president earlier this year extended the moratorium on US testing. This effectively precludes any British tests which use the US Nevada test site. Russia is not expected to resume testing, and France, which would like to conduct tests, appears likely to refrain so long as only China among the nuclear powers is testing. Diplomats have speculated China would delay any resumption of nuclear testing until after the decision next Thursday on the location of the Olympic Games in the year 2000, to avoid damaging Beijing's chances. Yesterday China's top Olympic official ruled out a 1996 Games boycott but refused to say that Chinese athletes would actually go to Atlanta. Earlier the chief executive of the Beijing bid committee, Zhang Baifa, said a boycott was possible because of political interference by the US House of Representatives, which passed a resolution in July opposing China's bid on human rights grounds. Zhang stressed that this was a personal opinion he first expressed last month. But He Zhenliang, vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), dismissed the apparent boycott threat as 'unfortunate rumours' based on an erroneous interpretation of a statement. 'There will be no boycott,' he said categorically. Boycott is a non-question.' President Bill Clinton yesterday told Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, that the US would like to see a political initiative to stop the violence in Somalia, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Clinton said he could not provide details of a possible settlement because 'our position is not well enough formed yet .' But he said 'it certainly doesn't mean more troops there.'</p>

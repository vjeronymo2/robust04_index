			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Birthday Wishes: Pope John Paul II remembered Mother Teresa on her 80th  birthday Monday, saying: "Giving prayer thanks to God for . . . your lifelong  dedication and service to the poorest of the poor, I wish to assure you of my  warmest best wishes." The birthday telegram was released in Vatican City.  </P> <P> Looking for Kicks: Kitty Dukakis says she drank anything with a kick -- hair  spray, nail-polish remover, after-shave lotion -- during her battles with  depression. "The last thing I swallowed was hair spray," Dukakis says in her  book, "Now You Know," released this week. "I just pulled off the spray top and  gulped the ingredients." The wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was  recently in an Alabama recovery clinic, where she found "ease through  understanding . . . good things are happening."  </P> <P> Rita Remembers: Rita Jenrette says she once tried to get tour guides to take  groups by the spot on the Capitol steps where she and her former husband,  ex-Rep. John Jenrette of South Carolina, made love one late night. Jenrette  said: "It was a cold night. I had on a long fur coat." But, she concluded: "It  was a romantic interlude. . . . It was really a nostalgic moment."  </P> <P> Prediction Comes True: A professor of Middle East studies at St. John Fisher's  College in Rochester, N.Y., said she had predicted Iraq might annex Kuwait, but  she struck the sentences from the final draft of her book. Tamara Sonn's  "Between Qur'an and Crown" went to press just before Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug.  2. "I took (the prediction) out . . . because I didn't want to be too  inflammatory," she said.  </P></p>

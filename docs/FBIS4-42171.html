			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Sir Leon Brittan, European </F> commissioner for foreign trade, by Mark Frankland and Dick  Leonard; place and date not given: "The Tory With a Message:  Europe Is Good for You"]    [Text] As befits a man who is fighting two Euroelection  campaigns -- a personal one to succeed Jacques Delors as  president of the European Commission as well as the British  Euroelections -- Sir Leon Brittan chooses his words with care  when talking about the Conservative Party and Europe.    The Tories divided? Not so, he protests with a languidly  elegant movement of the hands: their election manifesto has  `accommodated' all sections of the party. `Now, if you said all  the parties are responding to an unhappy and querulous national  mood in relation to the European Union, then I'd agree.'    But in a conversation with THE OBSERVER, the wary Sir Leon  did react to the latest Tory idea to deconstruct the Commission,  where he is in charge of international economic relations.  David Heathcoat-Amory, Foreign Office Minister, last week  suggested the Commission emasculate itself by handing over its  right to introduce legislation to the Council of Ministers.    `It would never work,' says Sir Leon, insistent as a  barrister used to talking to not very bright juries. `The  essence of the Council of Ministers is that it is 12  governments.' The Council is equipped to `consider proposed  laws and decide on them, which is exactly what it does, but it  cannot produce them.'    Sir Leon does not believe `a fundamental change in the  Commission's role is in anybody's interest.' Nor is the  Commission too `undemocratic.' People who `criticise the  Commission for being unelected would hate the consequences of it  being elected, because if it was, you would be well on the way  to an embryonic European government.'    Happy to demolish Heathcoat-Amory, Brittan is more guarded  about a nationalist John Major confessing that his spirit sinks  whenever he has to leave Britain's shores. `Just a statement of  a patriotic kind. If that's the way he feels, that's the way he  feels.'    It is obviously not the way Sir Leon feels, for a Tory more  comfortable in Europe is hard to imagine. Shortly after  arriving in Brussels to take up his job at the Commission,  Brittan invited Jacques Delors home to dinner, unawed by the  formidable president and ready to entertain him in French.    If Brittan now hopes to succeed Delors, it is because he  applied the generalist skills of the British politician to the  traditionally compartmentalised world of the Union. `Wisely or  unwisely, over a period of time I've poked my nose into other  people's business and made speeches about everything under the  sun.'    Brittan's spirits seem equally high on his frequent trips to  speak at British Euroelection meetings. His message is bullish:  Europe, including that Tory taboo, European monetary union  [EMU], is good for you though you may not yet know it.    `Britain can be relaxed about EMU. Nobody's pushing Britain  to join, just as nobody is pushing us to rejoin the European  exchange rate mechanism. Britain has secured the rather  remarkable position of having an option (to join EMU) but not an  obligation -- as near as you can get in politics to having your  cake and eating it.'    He insists the convergence of European economies that is a  precondition for monetary union will be achieved, and that EMU  itself will reduce costs, to everyone's advantage, of trading in  the European market. `It is not unrealistic that, by 1999, a  critical mass of European countries will be able and want to go  ahead.'    His chief argument to the sceptical Brits is that the time  of  European Union excesses is over, and that it would be stupid to  bolt when Europe is becoming British-friendly.    `Everyone was in favour of the single market and yet it was  the creation of the single market which necessarily meant  removing 12 national sets of rules and involved the most  intrusive intervention in business and other life. Though  people desired the end, they were not entirely happy with the  means, and didn't appreciate the means were necessary to achieve  the end.'    These wounds would now be healed by the salve of  subsidiarity, explained by Brittan as `you don't do what you  don't need to do, and don't hesitate to do what you can do  best.' If water quality can best be assured by national  governments, clean air is a pan-European concern. The result is  that the amount of Eurolegislation proposed by the Commission  has halved since 1989.    Brittan mocks the over-regulated, over-subsidised Europe of  several years ago and says European institutions have to learn a  lesson from critical reactions to the widespread Maastricht  treaty. `By the way we conduct ourselves and by our vision, we  must show that we're not trying to snuff out the nation state  but to do together the things that are best done together.'    He offers the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a  dramatic example of how Europe has changed to suit Britain.  `When I began the international economic relations job, there  were large numbers of people who didn't want a settlement at all  because they said it was an Anglo-Saxon concoction, and what's  this got to do with the great European ideal? But by the end,  everyone agreed that the Gatt deal was good.'    Leon Brittan sounds like the best President of the European  Commission the British could realistically hope to get, but few  people in Brussels think Europe's leaders will give him the job  when they meet in Corfu next month. The Belgian premier  Jean-Luc Dehaene and the former Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers still  seem more probable choices.    Asked if he is handicapped in the race by being British, he  answers in his best old-fashioned courtroom manner: `I thought  one of the fundamental principles of the European Union was that  we weren't allowed to discriminate on grounds of nationality.'</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: MGN speculation Mirror Group Newspapers strengthened 8 to 186p after announcing a sharp rise in first-half results to Pounds 69.9m from Pounds 15.3m. The results were surrounded by speculation that the 54.8 per cent stake held by the group's administrators - some 220m shares - would be placed yesterday. Speculation was hotly denied, but several media analysts were being unusually tight-lipped, leaving the strong impression that they had been asked to place the shares and had been gagged ahead of the sale. NatWest Securities, which published a large and bullish piece of research on MGN only a month ago, was not responding to calls yesterday, and James Capel was uncommunicative. Senior traders believed that there was 'no smoke without fire' and that brokers appointed by the administrator, Arthur Andersen, had been sounding out possible buyers. Later the market latched on to the argument that the stake would be placed at 160p a share after an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on September 23.</p>

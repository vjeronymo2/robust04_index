			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Advantages seen in 'single-table' deals COMPANIES which bargain with several unions separately are likely to pay higher wages and perform less well financially than companies which deal with just one union or several negotiating together, according to a study by economists. The economists also find that bargaining separately with several unions makes companies more prone to strikes lasting a day or more. The report was compiled by Mr Stephen Machin and Mr John Van Reenen of the economics department at University College, London, and Mr Mark Stewart of the economics department at Warwick University. It comes when many employers are considering whether to simplify their industrial relations by cutting the number of unions they deal with or introducing 'single-table' bargaining arrange-ments. Under the 'single-table' approach, several unions, often representing different groups of workers, bargain together. The study says data drawn from the government-funded Workplace Industrial Relations Survey of 1984 show that what matters 'is not the presence of multiple recognition, but whether or not multiple unions bargain en masse or as individual entities'. The study suggests that skilled workers benefit more than semi-skilled and unskilled workers from fragmented bargaining. It adds that the mark-up for skilled workers in such arrangements over similar workers covered by single bargaining procedures is 8.3 per cent. Semi-skilled and unskilled workers benefit by 5 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively. The economists say wages differ little between establishments where the workers belong to multiple unions - but bargain jointly  - and those in comparable units with a single union. The evidence found by the economists about the effect of fragmented bargaining on financial performance, measured by rising demand and the use of plant, is less clear-cut. They say, however, that the difference between fragmented and 'single-table' bargaining is more noticeable among manufacturers than non-manufacturing employers. The study finds that bargaining arrangements have little effect on any type of industrial action. For strikes lasting at least a day, however, a 'significant difference' is found between multiple and 'single-table' bargaining. 'This supports the notion that workplace disputes may result from inter-union competition in bargaining,' the economists say. Multi-union bargaining arrangements in workplaces have long been considered by many industrial relations experts to be a restraining force on industrial effici-ency. The 1968 Donovan Commission, set up by the then government, strongly advocated moves to industrial unionism, based on single industry-wide unions, on the grounds that inter-union competition was divisive. Companies setting up plants almost all recognise just one union, if any.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: THANKS IN OH-SO-FRENCH WAY  </P> <P> (In 1953 a young man climbed the crooked steps of the Paris Herald Tribune  building on the Rue de Berri and submitted an article on "Explaining  Thanksgiving Day to the French." The editor said, "I'll give you $10 for it."  In disgust, the youth took back the manuscript and, instead of pursuing a  career in journalism, went into city planning for Detroit. He was never heard  from again.)  </P> <P> One of our most important holidays is Thanksgiving Day, known in France as "le  Jour de Merci Donnant."  </P> <P> "Le Jour de Merci Donnant" was first started by a group of Pilgrims  ("Pelerins") who fled from "l'Angleterre" before the McCarran Act to found a  colony in the New World ("le Nouveau Monde") where they could shoot Indians  ("les Peaux-Rouges") and eat turkey ("dinde") to their hearts' content.  </P> <P> They landed at a place called Plymouth (now a famous "voiture Americaine") in a  wooden sailing ship named the Mayflower, or "Fleur de Mai," in 1620. But while  the "Pelerins" were killing the "dindes," the "Peaux-Rouges" were killing the  "Pelerins" and there were several hard winters ahead for both of them. The only  way the "Peaux-Rouges" helped the "Pelerins" was when they taught them how to  grow corn ("mais"). The reason they did this was because they liked corn with  their "Pelerins."  </P> <P> In 1623, after another harsh year, the "Pelerins' " crops were so good that  they decided to have a celebration and give thanks because more "mais" was  raised by the "Pelerins" than "Pelerins" were killed by the "Peaux-Rouges."  </P> <P> Every year on "le Jour de Merci Donnant," parents tell their children an  amusing story about the first celebration.  </P> <P> It concerns a brave "capitaine" named Miles Standish (known in France as  "Kilometres Deboutish") and a shy young lieutenant named Jean Alden. Both of  them were in love with a flower of Plymouth called Priscilla Mullens (no  translation). The "vieux capitaine" said to the "jeune lieutenant":  </P> <P> "Go to the damsel Priscilla ("Allez tres vite chez Priscilla"), the loveliest  maiden of Plymouth ("la plus jolie demoiselle de Plymouth"). Say that a blunt  old captain, a man not of words but of action ("un vieux Fanfan la Tulipe"),  offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier. Not in these  words, you know, but this, in short, is my meaning.  </P> <P> "I am a maker of war ("Je suis un fabricant de la guerre") and not a maker of  phrases. You, bred as a scholar ("Vous, qui etes pain comme un etudiant"), can  say it in elegant language, such as you read in your books of the pleadings and  wooings of lovers, such as you think best adapted to win the heart of the  maiden."  </P> <P> Although Jean was fit to be tied ("convenable a etre emballe"), friendship  prevailed over love and he went to his duty. But instead of using elegant  language, he blurted out his mission. Priscilla was muted with amazement and  sorrow ("rendue muette par l'etonnement et la tristesse").  </P> <P> At length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence, "If the great  captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me, why does he not come himself  and take the trouble to woo me?" ("Ou est-il, le vieux Kilometres? Pourquoi ne  vient-il pas aupres de moi pour tenter sa chance?")  </P> <P> Jean said that "Kilometres Deboutish" was very busy and didn't have time for  those things. He staggered on, telling her what a wonderful husband  "Kilometres" would make. Finally, Priscilla arched her eyebrows and said in a  tremulous voice, "Why don't you speak for yourself, Jean?" ("Chacun a son  gout.")  </P> <P> And so, on the fourth Thursday in November, American families sit down at a  large table brimming with tasty dishes, and for the only time during the year  eat better than the French do.  </P> <P> No one can deny that "le Jour de Merci Donnant" is a "grand fete" and no matter  how well fed American families are, they never forget to give thanks to  "Kilometres Deboutish," who made this great day possible.  </P></p>

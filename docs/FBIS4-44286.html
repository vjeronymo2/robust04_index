			<p>BFN     [Text] The British ambassador in Athens conveyed a verbal  message to the Greek Government stressing that his country's  refusal to accept Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's  candidacy for the European Union [EU] Commission presidency is  not in any way related to the Greek presidency. The British  message further stressed that there will be no deviation from  this position, even at the extraordinary EU summit that will be  held on 15 July in Brussels.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made a statement on  the issue today and told correspondents that Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou will assess the prerequisites for our  country's representation at the extraordinary EU summit. It is  recalled that the prime minister said in Corfu that our country  will be represented at that summit at a lower level.    At the same time, commenting on press reports that the  British prime minister, speaking in the House of Commons,  attributed responsibility for the failure to elect a EU  Commission president to the Greek Presidency, Mr. Venizelos  expressed his regret and said that if this stands it is an  isolated remark that is at odds with the impression of all the  other EU members.</p>

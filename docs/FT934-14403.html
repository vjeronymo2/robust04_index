			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Success in a fragile market - Stephen Court meets a glass-etcher who carved a niche in new areas PHILIP BRADBURY'S glass-etching business began in the sedate world of reproduction Victorian door panels. But he has had some bizarre and high-profile orders too, such as a glass map of the world made for the pop star Tina Turner. The map, measuring 8ft by 4ft, had electric lighting and cost Pounds 10,000. It showed all the places where the singer had given concerts during a recent international tour. Then there was the ship-in-a-glass for a beer advert. As the pint was downed, so the ship appeared to sink. Bradbury has also decorated glass for the sets of the period British television series, The House of Eliott and Lipstick On Your Collar. Although much of his bread-and-butter trade comes from the private housing market, Bradbury's business kept growing during the recession. Yet he wears the mantle of entrepreneur with diffidence. He says his main failing is that: 'I approach business like an artist, and I don't use the tools available to business people, such as a marketing strategy.' The key, he finds, is in producing designs which are aesthetically pleasing, for a reasonable price. 'I know what designs I like, and I think I am no different to most other people. We try to tune in to what the individual customer wants.' Allied to this is a lean business operation. Bradbury took a mortgage on his house to start the company. 'Since then it has been self-financed. We haven't had to borrow a penny from the bank.' He has between two and four employees, according to demand, and tries to keep a tight rein on employment costs. Bradbury has been in the glass business for 17 years. He set up Philip Bradbury Glass seven years ago. 'I was very interested in the technical challenge of etching glass, and was pleasantly surprised by the demand for it.' He did not have a mortgage for his home, and borrowed Pounds 100,000 on the property. Most of that went into buying the leasehold of a shop in Finsbury Park, which doubles as showroom and workshop. The remaining Pounds 20,000 was put into equipment, such as a machine for sandblasting, which is the main technique he uses for etching glass. Turnover hit Pounds 83,000 in 1990-91 and exceeded Pounds 200,000 for the financial year to July 1993. The Victorian reproduction work includes making panels of two panes and a fanlight - for exterior doors, costing under Pounds 200. The glass panels for star, or Oxford, frame interior doors are more complex but smaller, and cost up to Pounds 130. These have nine panes, with cobalt blue or ruby coloured glass in the sides and corners. The amount of 'new' work done by the company has been growing. The current ratio of 'new' to 'restoration' work is about 60:40. Signs, corporate awards, logos, gifts, advertising designs - the scope for etched glass is reassuringly wide. Corporate customers have included British Telecom, Pepsi, Hertz and EMI. Much of the growth has been by word of mouth. In spite of the diffidence about conventional business techniques, Philip Bradbury Glass is in the Yellow Pages business directory and the Building Conservation Directory, and advertises in magazines catering for the period housing market. He has just introduced a work station for computer-aided design work and is planning to extend the workshop into the yard at the back of his shop to increase working space and improve the reception area. One of Bradbury's most significant customers has been the JD Wetherspoon chain of pubs. The period Victorian style fits in well with Bradbury's designs. 'There has been a return to traditional styling in pubs,' he says. 'People feel at home in a Victorian atmosphere.' Pub contracts have shown the robustness of the glass business - and its fragility. The work Bradbury is most proud of is the decoration for the windows and mirrors of the Oueen's Head, in Acton Street, near London's King's Cross station. The centrepiece is a large etching of Queen Victoria, beautifully reproduced from a Penny Black stamp. The night after the pub was opened the windows were smashed. As with the glaziers still engaged in repairing the bomb-shattered City of London after the second major IRA attack, the whole project had to start again. Philip Bradbury Glass. 83 Blackstock Road.

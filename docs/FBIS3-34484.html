			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hadas Neifman] </F>   [Text] A delegation of Saudi businessmen has arrived in  Israel to examine investment possibilities. Moti Trotosh, Union  of Chambers of Commerce vice president, said the delegation  includes private businessmen who came for purely business  purposes, but in his opinion this visit will be followed by  political contacts.    According to Mr. Trotosh the delegation will mainly deal  with  energy related deals, because after the contacts with Qatar on  this issue new vistas have been opened to Israel in the gas and  oil sphere.    The Saudis are also examining trade possibilities after  peace  agreements are signed.</p>

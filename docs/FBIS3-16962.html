			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Crimea"]    [Text] The Crimean Tatars think that the holding of a  referendum on 27 March on the peninsula's relationship with  Ukraine and on the dual citizenship problem contravene both  Ukraine's laws and those of the Republic of Crimea. This was  stated on 17 March by Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the  Tatar People's Assembly, in an interview with a NEGA  correspondent. R. Chubarov personally supports the Ukraine  president's edict canceling two points in Crimea President Yu.  Meshkov's edict. In his opinion, "the war of laws unleashed  between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine, which will have a  continuation, will push Crimea into an abyss." In which case  one would not be able to talk about any economic transformations  on the peninsula, R. Chubarov thinks.    The Crimea president's decision to put his representatives  in  charge of city and rayon executive committees is drawing  negative reactions in the regions. In particular, Sergey  Kunitsyn, chairman of Krasnyy Perekop town soviet and deputy of  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, described these intentions  "illegal and contravening the Constitution of the Republic of  Crimea." Under the Constitution of Crimea, an executive  committee is an organ of a soviet, and a soviet is formed  through the holding of general elections, S. Kunitsin thinks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jovan Lakicevic] </F>   [Text] The recent convention of a group of Sarajevo Serbs  who expressed loyalty to Alija Izetbegovic and supported his  concept of a unitarian Bosnia under Muslim domination, is a  matter of choice for the individuals who gathered there.  However, this has nothing to do with the already expressed  legitimate will of the Serbian people in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here is a commentary by Jovan Lakicevic:    [Lakicevic] The Sarajevo political circus, stage-managed by  some kind of a Serbian Citizens' or Serbian Consultative Council  under the auspices of Alija Izetbegovic and the vigilant eye of  U.S. Envoy Charles Redman, is one of those events that  inevitably causes feelings of shame and resignation among decent  people. This is so primarily because of the awareness of the  kind of humiliation some of our compatriots in Sarajevo are  prepared to accept in order to accomplish their extremely banal,  petty, and personal ambitions.    Their decision to live in the Muslim part of Sarajevo is  their own choice, and it was therefore not at all necessary to  raise it to the level of an improvised political meeting and  some kind of political proclamation that support Alija's idea of  a unitarian Bosnia under Islamic domination. However, the  meeting of a group of Sarajevo Serbs, who, as they themselves  said, hold prominent posts in cultural, economic, political,  humanitarian, (?business) and other organizations, with the  unconcealed illusion that they will retain these with this  action, has gone one step further. These Serbs did not hesitate  to ask Izetbegovic and the United States to scrap the Srpska  republic for the sake of unitarian Bosnia, and demand trials for  their compatriots for having committed war crimes.    Regarding the first demand, they have obviously overlooked  the fact that 90 percent of Serbs in Bosnia hold a different  view and that they have expressed their view on two occasions.  First, they voted in favor of the program of the Serbian  Democratic Party, and then, with the same percentage, to stay in  the former and future Yugoslavia.    Regarding war criminals, it appears that these concealed and  newly discovered fans of Alija's sovereign Bosnia, who are  susceptible to amnesia, completely overlooked the fact that the  most serious crimes in Sarajevo have actually been committed by  Alija's former proteges: Juka Prazina, Caca, and others, and  that they have been liquidated by Izetbegovic's camarilla so  that the International Court for War Crimes in The Hague could  not one day lay its hands on the greatest monsters of the  Sarajevo horror, who incidentally were not Serbs, but Muslims.    The aforementioned Sarajevo Serbs, who hastily gathered  themselves in the Citizens Council and expressed loyalty to  Izetbegovic's leadership, appear not to have learned anything  from the experience of the Zagreb Serbian People's Party, a  similar party in form and function. This so-called Serbian  party of Milan Djukic's at one time played the role of folklore  detachment to the vociferous young Croatian democracy, but when  it had finished its sad, subservient role, Tudjman dismissed it  completely. This appears to be the inevitable fate of all  volunteer servants who are prepared to betray the interests of  their people for personal gain.    Those who were in a position to see it on television saw  that  the so-called Serb convention in Sarajevo was also attended by a  former top-ranking member of the League of Communists of Serbia,  Zarko Papic. Also attending was Dr. Ivan Djuric, who was  brought for this occasion from Paris and is otherwise known as  someone suitable for all anti-Serbian actions anywhere from  Belgrade to the capital city of France. Those who were not  present but were dying to be there were the representatives of  the Citizens Association of Serbia, the Independent Trade  Unions, the Belgrade Club of Independent Intellectuals, the  Center for Anti-War Action, the Fund for Human Rights, the  Helsinki Parliament of Citizens, Women in Black, the European  Movement, and other similar quasi peace-loving organizations  from Belgrade, whose number is almost identical to the number of  their members.    They were not there because UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  did not secure a plane for them to fly from Belgrade to  Sarajevo. The president of the Serbian Renewal Movement did not  go there either, even though he wanted to. He sent a letter to  the organizers of the Serbian self-humiliation in Sarajevo,  criticizing UNPROFOR for not meeting their wishes, unlike the  wishes of those of who commanded the destruction of Sarajevo,  which it had met on so many occasions in the past.    Things appear to be somewhat more complicated than it  appeared to those nervous, impatient, and not-to-be passengers  to Sarajevo. UNPROFOR people, that is, the political circles of  the Western alliance, obviously correctly assessed that their  trip to Sarajevo to serve Izetbegovic and Silajdzic would be a  causal motive for their new political disgrace at home in  Belgrade. They therefore needed to be protected from this,  because all these pacifist organizations that used all available  means, including those coming from abroad, to fight for peace  and brotherhood and unity at a time when Serbs in Bosnia and  Krajina were literally forced to take arms and protect their  basic human and civil rights and the right to life, have not  finished playing the role given to them by their inspirers and  founders on the Serbian political scene.    One should therefore not be angry with UNPROFOR, because  people in UNPROFOR, or rather, the people behind UNPROFOR,  actually thought about their political future when the  organizations were not.    Regarding the organizers of the aforementioned convention of  Serbs in Sarajevo, they should simply be left to their own fate,  or rather, the choice they themselves have made. This really has  nothing to do with the Serbian people in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and their already expressed will and  determination.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi </F> by unidentified correspondent in Tehran -- live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] British officials have accused  the Islamic Republic of Iran of having provided the IRA with  military and other types of assistance. The responsible  officials of our country have provided an appropriate response  to British propaganda. Last night the Iranian president in his  remarks revealed other examples of British Government  interference in the domestic affairs of Iran, namely the  discovery of an spying network [halqeh-ye jasusi] in the Iranian  Embassy in London. To clarify the details of this issue and to  receive greater information, we have invited Mr. Mahmud Va'ezi,  deputy foreign minister for American and European affairs, to  provide you dear listeners with more information. Before  starting each part of the interview, we will have a short report  that our dear colleagues in the political department of the  first channel have prepared about the background to the latest  events. Then we will start the interview. [passage omitted]    I wish to thank Mr. Va'ezi for taking part in our program  tonight. We start our discussion by asking Mr. Va'ezi to tell  us about the details of the event.    [Va'ezi] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate.  Before starting to discuss the main topic, I wish to refer  briefly to the nature of our relations with England during the  past 15 years; in other words, the period after the Islamic  revolution. During the past 15 years, we have witnessed many ups  and downs in our relations. The main reason for it is that, in  view of its past record in the region and particularly in Iran,  England finds it difficult to speedily adjust itself and its  behavior -- its political and propaganda behavior -- with the  policies we have pursued since the revolution. Indeed, our most  turbulent [motelatemtarin] foreign relations have been with  England, compared to any other country.    [Correspondent] Let us now turn to the issue our president  referred to last night, namely the English spying activities  [jasusi] in our embassy in London. Please let us know how this  issue started and when did you learn about this spying network  [halqeh-ye jasusi].    [Va'ezi] Nearly more than two weeks ago, when we were  carrying out some repairs in the new embassy building, we  discovered a listening device after pulling down one of the  walls. It was a relatively powerful listening device placed  inside the wall. As a result, we did not wish to make an  immediate judgement or to reveal other issues that might have  followed from it. When we discovered this, we asked our  technical experts to investigate the matter further. This was  about two weeks ago.    [Correspondent] You referred to the new embassy building.  Please tell us what building that is.    [Va'ezi] If you recall, at the beginning of the revolution,  an attack was carried out by opposition groups against the  building where the Iranian Embassy was situated. As a result  the building was exploded [as heard] and set on fire. We  realized afterwards that the attack was led by the British  security service.    [Correspondent] I even heard that the Iraqi intelligence  network and the British Government were together in that  incident. Then the building was rebuilt. Apparently that is  the building you mean?    [Va'ezi] That is right. That building was eventually rebuilt  after a delay. Several months ago its rebuilding came to an end  and gradually the embassy sections were transferred to the new  building. It was during the transfer when we came across the  listening device, which was installed somewhere in a wall in one  of the rooms in the building.    [Correspondent] Why didn't you announce the discovery of the  device and did not raise the issue in the media at the time?    [Va'ezi] The clear reason was that after we discovered the  listening device, our experts needed to carry out further  investigation. And security and operational issues required  time. That was why we wanted all our work to be carried out  without any propaganda and in good time until yesterday when the  matter was actually announced.    [Correspondent] Did you inform the British authorities  through diplomatic channels about the discovery of the listening  device?    [Va'ezi] We summoned the British Embassy charge d'affaires.  The Foreign Ministry director general for Western Europe made a  strong objection over the action by the British Government and  asked for further clarification of the matter.    [Correspondent] When I was consulting foreign press  cuttings today, I found a commentary that said apparently as  soon as the British Government became aware of the cutting off  of the connection between the listening device and their own  center, they embarked on a plan for accusing Iran of supporting  the Irish republicans and made that clamor. Does your  interpretation and information tally with that or not?    [Va'ezi] Of course, because the accusation was a false one  and was in no way correct. The two can definitely not be  interconnected from the point of view of their content [as  heard]. But taking into consideration the coincidence of the  two actions, it seems that it was a preemptive act by the  British Government. After the cutting off of their connection  with the listening device, they made that claim in the press,  and they embarked on extensive propaganda to cover up the  scandal they were certain would come to light.    [Correspondent] Yes, one of the international news agencies  had noted -- in corroboration of the Mr. Va'ezi's statement --  that the British Government embarked on making up that  accusation against Iran to create a preemptive atmosphere  regarding any revelations about the listening device. Please  tell us what was the reaction of other European countries --  which are in your brief -- towards the initial British  accusation against Iran?    [Va'ezi] It is interesting that when the British Government  announced its accusation against Iran, they said they had been  coordinating with the rest of the Western Europe states. We  witnessed that -- with the exception of the American secretary  of state -- no other state and no other official in any Western  state showed any reaction. Even in our contacts with Western  states, we found that that was not an important issue for them,  or an issue on which any coordination had taken place with them  beforehand. It seemed that it was a plan carried out by Britain.    As you know, Mr. Major's administration is in a very bad  position at the moment, and from the point of view of  popularity, it is at its lowest point since his coming to power.  It seems that through the raising of such issues, they can  divert public opinion of their own people to a certain extent  from those problems Britain is going through at the moment.    [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, the president's statements last  night were partly concerned with the fact that the media,  particularly the press, in Britain acted in a totally  coordinated and guided fashion within the wave of the British  propaganda against Iran. In your opinion, does that mean that  the issue was a pre-planned scenario, that they had prepared  themselves for it beforehand, or do you think otherwise?    [Va'ezi] Certainly that was a pre-determined scenario,  because when they summoned our charge d'affaires in Britain,  before their discussion had ended, the British radio made an  announcement. Extensive propaganda had been planned beforehand,  and they embarked on it. Anyway, all the information at our  disposal and what has reached us so far indicate that that was a  planned action. Fortunately with the strong approach of Iran,  especially the summoning of the charge d'affaires and the fact  that they had raised an issue that had no truth in it, there was  no room for any further maneuvers. Anyway the matter subsided  within a week.    [Correspondent] You mentioned that preliminary  investigations  have been carried out about the listening device and that is why  the matter has been announced. Is there any information  regarding its type, form, operation, and use to inform our  listeners about at this juncture?    [Va'ezi] The information we have so far: the device weighs  about 450 grams. The battery in the device is interesting; that  is, from a technical point of view the device can operate a  longer time without being accessed again. The various  electronic sections in the device indicate that the device can  have various functions. That is the data we can announce so far.  Undoubtedly there will be more information we will announce  later.    [Correspondent] We read in the press that apparently the  device included a microphone and a transmitter. Can you confirm  that?    [Va'ezi] That is so.    [Correspondent] The transmitter was next to it?    [Va'ezi] They were all together.    [Correspondent] Can you give any information about the range  of the transmitter?    [Va'ezi] At the moment our information is not complete  regarding this particular issue. God willing, later.    [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, please tell us in what part of  the embassy the device was installed? Was it a sensitive area  or not?    [Va'ezi] As I said before, we have been making use of the  new  embassy building gradually. And taking into account that we had  taken over from the building contractors, the building needed  some modification. The modification was in an area we had not  put to use yet. We wanted to carry out the modifications and  then use the area. When a wall was demolished we found out the  fact. When a room or a section is not being utilized, one  cannot acually talk about its sensitivity.    [Correspondent] In fact that was the answer to my next  question; that is, whether any damage has been done to any data  within the embassy through the existence of the device.    [Va'ezi] We have not made any use of that section of the  embassy. We were going to make use of it gradually, after the  repairs we were carrying out.    [Correspondent] Have you instigated any investigation on how  the device was installed in the embassy? Has any one or any  committee been charged with the investigation? And has the  contractor been contacted?    [Va'ezi] Immediately after the device was found, we began  our  activity because we did not want the matter to be revealed at  the first juncture. Certainly the type of activity we had up to  yesterday was different. We had made our plans beforehand.  That is why we shall be continuing our investigations somewhat  more openly from now on.    [Correspondent] The Central News Unit has not yet received  any report on a formal reaction by the British Government--and,  particularly, the British Foreign Office--to this issue. Why is  that, Mr. Va'ezi?    [Va'ezi] One reason could be that following Britain's claim  two weeks ago regarding links between the Islamic Republic of  Iran's intelligence organization and the IRA, discussions took  place immediately between British parliamentarians, between  British officials and their intelligence service and the  opposition groups that exist in Britain, on the other hand.    [Correspondent] Do you mean groups in Britain who oppose the  Islamic Republic of Iran?    [Va'ezi] Yes. That is an issue that has worried the British,  particularly because of its direct effect on public opinion in  our country because of our people's hatred of such groups. We  strongly rejected the claim about a link between us and the IRA  during talks with British authorities both in London and Tehran.  On the other hand, with the strong evidence that we possessed,  we raised the issue of their links with Iranian opposition  groups. That was one reason for that issue becoming defused.    The reason they have not reacted thus far is that this issue  would bring all other previous matters to life, and it seems  that the British Government does not have a strong hand on that  issue. That is why it tries to raise new issues to divert  attention from the case and derail it from its main course.    [Correspondent] Do you, in fact, predict that British  authorities will create new diversionary focal points to  distract attention away from current discussions?    [Va'ezi] That is usually the method they employ.    [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, what is our next step? We have  witnessed the discovery of such British networks and bugs in the  world many times, as evident in the memoirs of their experienced  spies, including Mr. Peter Wright's "Spy Catcher", in which the  cases of many other embassies were revealed. Now, this is my  question: From a diplomatic and official view, what is our next  step regarding this act by the British Government?    [Va'ezi] As you know, we have not had a healthy relationship  on a suitable scale since the revolution. Our relations with  Britain have had some problems, most of which were the  responsibility of the main offender, the British Government.  The thinking in the British Government goes back to  pre-revolution ideas. To be more precise: There are factions  within the ruling circles of the British Government that seek  tension in relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. If we  look at the last 15 years of relations between Iran and Britain,  we see this type of crisis every six to eight months. For this  reason, relations are not on an acceptable level. We are now  waiting for an explanation from the British Government. We will  definitely take other steps after hearing their explanations.    [Correspondent] We have seen warnings in some press opinions  that relations between the two countries will possibly be  reduced, and new problems will possibly emerge in relations with  London. Are you of the same opinion, and do you have similar  expectations?    [Va'ezi] Taking into account the information currently  available and the fact that relations between Iran and Britain  are not on a friendly and high level, any comment now might be  too early. We have to wait until all issues are clear. I will,  therefore, leave this comment for the next opportunity.    [Correspondent] During the past week, British officials  tried  to reassure their domestic public that they would not have a  crisis or a reduction in the level of relations with the Islamic  Republic. They tried to reduce somewhat the initial negative  climate. Mr. Va'ezi, we discussed the coordinated reaction of  the press and other British media with the initial government  action in setting up a propagandistic climate against the  Islamic Republic. But the information received until now at the  Central News Bureau of radio and television indicates that only  two London newspapers have had very short references to this  news today and have tried not to publish the news on a large  scale. Does this not mean that there has been no coordination  on this occasion between the press and the British Government  and, therefore, the press is waiting for new coordination?    [Va'ezi] It seems that the British Government was not  waiting  for such speed in what was announced yesterday. They were  possibly expecting this discussion with us along with the claim  regarding IRA relations two weeks ago. The fact that this was  not announced practically foiled the former designs. They were  not prepared to work on such a subject. They have waited since  yesterday afternoon because they are waiting for a new  propaganda policy between the Foreign Office and the press. I  think beginning tomorrow we will be able to witness a new move  from the British press and propaganda organizations. [passage  omitted]</p>

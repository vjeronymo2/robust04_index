			<p>BFN     [Text] Prompted by the increasingly frequent incidents on  the part of the Jablanica-Prozor road, which is under the  control of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], particularly by  the brutal attack on women and older Bosniak men that occurred  on 2 May, the Executive Council of the Party of Democratic  Action [SDA] for Jablanica has issued a statement. Fazlo  Dervisbegovic reports on the details.    [Begin Dervisbegovic recording] It is obvious that the  responsible civilian and military bodies of the Prozor commune  are either incapable or unwilling to implement the agreement  negotiated and signed by the highest representatives of the  Bosniak-Muslim and Croatian peoples. The Jablanica SDA  Executive Council is appealing to the citizens of the Jablanica  commune and the surrounding area to refrain from going for  supplies to the area of the Prozor commune. Second, we demand --  the statement of the SDA Executive Council reads -- that all the  state bodies in the Jablanica commune -- the civilian  authorities, military structures, and police stations -- put  their maximum effort into preventing and eliminating all forms  of black marketeering and other criminal activities in the area  of the Jablanica commune. Third, we suggest that the  appropriate civilian authorities and other structures  indefinitely suspend the issuing of permits for trips to the  area of the Jablanica commune, and fourth, we condemn the UN  Protection Force's very passive attitude to the events in Prozor  on 2 May 1994, when our fellow citizens sought their protection.    With the aim of shedding light on these events and their  background, the Jablanica SDA Executive Council wishes to inform  the general public, the appropriate republican institutions, and  the [word indistinct] of the SDA of Bosnia-Herzegovina, reads  the statement of the Jablanica SDA Executive Council.

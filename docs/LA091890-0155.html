			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> AZTECS TO GET NATIONAL ATTENTION  </P> <P> If the San Diego State football program ever wanted to make a positive  impression on the nation, it will have the opportunity to do so Saturday.  CBS-TV announced Monday that the SDSU-Brigham Young game, which begins at 12:13  p.m., will be shown to 80% of the country.  </P> <P> The other 20% will see a Southeast Conference game between Georgia and Alabama.  </P> <P> The SDSU-BYU game had been scheduled to be regionally televised, but because of  the interest in Heisman Trophy contender Ty Detmer and the Cougar team, which  is ranked fourth by UPI.  </P> <P> "We feel we have a great opportunity this week to show some people our  program," Aztec Coach Al Luginbill said. "Just for us to be able and execute  against a good football team will be interesting."  </P> <P> The Aztecs will be without the services of freshman linebacker Jamal Duff  Saturday. Duff missed Saturday's Long Beach State game with a deep contusion of  his thigh. Trainer Brian Barry said he is being cautious with Duff's injury,  saying if the bruise does not heal fully, the bone could form in the muscle.  "We're not going to play Jamal until he's completely healthy," Luginbill said.  . . . Running back Tommy Booker, who missed most of the second half Saturday  with an ankle contusion, missed practice with the stomach flu. Barry said he is  doubtful for Saturday because of the ankle. . . . Safety Zac Stokes, who  fractured his shoulder early in the preseason, is healthy and ready to play. .  . . Luginbill announced that freshman safety Sam Williford of Pasadena became  the 23rd SDSU player to redshirt -- the same number that redshirted last  season. DAVE McKIBBEN  </P></p>

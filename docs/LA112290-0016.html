			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE / JULIAN;  </P> <P> COUNTRY LIFE SUITS DOCTOR  </P> <P> The first day on the job in Julian, Dr. Brady Hartman got a taste of the  difference between city and country medicine.  </P> <P> "One of my first patients was kicked by a horse," he said.  </P> <P> Another difference between city and country doctoring is apparent: Hartman  wears casual clothes, as though he were going to be tinkering in the yard.  </P> <P> Hartman's new business is the culmination of his longtime fantasy of moving to  the country. He formerly practiced corporate medicine in San Diego.  </P> <P> "I think I was looking for a relationship with my patients that I thought you  could have better in this setting," he said. "I think it's a bit more personal  than in the city."  </P> <P> His office is in an old house, and his waiting room is a rustic living room,  with hardwood floors and comfortable furniture.  </P> <P> With the nearest hospital an hour away in Escondido, and with no specialists in  town, Hartman often treats ailments a family doctor in the city wouldn't  handle.  </P> <P> He is certified to give heart tests with his own EKG machine, and he recently  became certified for taking X-rays. He sets simple fractures and performs minor  surgeries.  </P> <P> Hartman, 54, hopes the move to Julian is permanent. "I'd like to finish my  career here, but it's too early to say yet."  </P></p>

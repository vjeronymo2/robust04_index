			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Prudence pays dividends for M&amp;S 'IT doesn't worry me if I'm not described as entrepreneurial and all those other business-school adjectives,' says Sir Richard Greenbury, Marks and Spencer's chairman and chief executive. 'I'm quite prepared to be a tortoise provided we get there.' Sir Richard's cautious prudence has paid off. M&amp;S yesterday snatched back the crown of the UK's most profitable retailer. The Stock Market's downbeat reaction surprised some analysts, who suggested the City was concerned about a wage settlement that will add 6 per cent to M&amp;S's wage bills, and was disappointed that sales growth was not greater. But, as one analyst put it, 'Marks and Spencer has never been a top-line story'. The company makes money by being a superbly-run operation, and that was perhaps more true this year than ever, with pre-tax profits up 10 per cent even stripping out last year's exceptional items, on turnover up only 3.4 per cent overall. Improvements in information technology helped M&amp;S keep firmer control of its stock, avoiding the need to discount to get rid of surpluses as many other retailers do. That technology has also improved distribution, enabling M&amp;S to respond quickly to changes in fashions, and keep operating costs down. The result was a 6.8 per cent rise in UK operating profits, on turnover up only 1.8 per cent. The improvements in efficiency also enabled M&amp;S to freeze prices for 75 per cent of its clothing, and reduce prices for 25 per cent by cutting its buying margins. Profits were also boosted by improved performances abroad. Sales in continental Europe increased 22 per cent, while operating profits were up 15 per cent to Pounds 27m. In North America, there was evidence that the company's homegrown expertise was bearing fruit. The Canadian operations climbed out of the red for the first time, with an operating profit of Pounds 0.1m, after the closure of 30 stores and a 55 per cent reduction in staffing in the past two years. Brooks Brothers in the US increased operating profits by 20 per cent - the third successive rise - while Kings Super Markets also saw operating profits grow 20 per cent. In the Far East, improved merchandise values, cataloguing and distribution lifted sales 64 per cent, and operating profits 68 per cent to Pounds 10.6m. As UK consumers start spending again, and the company steps up its overseas expansion, M&amp;S looks likely to remain a tortoise to watch.</p>

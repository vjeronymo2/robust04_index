In answer to a question on what will happen during Nevruz,  Ciller said: I do not think anything will happen during Nevruz.  If we could die together during the War of Independence, we can  also celebrate the holiday together in order to protect the  undivided integrity and independence of this country.    Ciller further noted: I will make Nevruz a national holiday.  Nevruz will be the holiday of all of Turkey. We will enter 1995  with Nevruz as an official holiday. We will celebrate Nevruz  together. If we could die together, then we can also celebrate  holidays together. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Sainsbury downgrades managers The supermarket group J. Sainsbury, which said on Friday it was cutting 650 jobs in its head and area offices, is stripping out layers of store management in a pilot programme which staff fear could lead to further job losses. The company is phasing out section managers, who have responsibility for particular areas of stores, in 25 outlets of various sizes around the country. They will be replaced by new posts of assistant manager and team leader. The 350 section managers in the stores have been told to reapply for one of the new posts by May 9 or take redundancy. Those not appointed to one of the new posts will be offered alternative shop-floor employment, but their wages will be guaranteed for only two years. A section manager said: 'They are trying to get people to go. Two people's jobs will be done by one person.' Sainsbury insists that the move was 'not initiated as a cost-cutting programme' but was aimed at improving efficiency and customer service. It said the section manager's role had become 'often a very physical job and not enough of a management role.' The company will evaluate the programme in the autumn. If it is successful it is likely to be extended across Sainsbury's 350 superstores, affecting several thousand section and department managers. The changes are not connected with the restructuring being carried out in Sainsbury's head and area offices, which the group said on Friday would lead to the loss of 650 jobs in the next six to eight months. Annual savings from the redundancies and other initiatives are estimated at Pounds 50m. Sainsbury is likely to announce a provision of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m to cover restructuring costs when it announces current-year results in May.</p>

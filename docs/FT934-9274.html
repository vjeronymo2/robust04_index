			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Europe by any other name JONATHAN SWIFT would have been richly diverted by the contortions western European governments are performing over how they should christen the 12-nation grouping just reborn under the Maastricht treaty. Just as in Gulliver's Travels the rulers of Lilliput and Blefuscu fought for decades over whether they should crack their eggs at the big end or the little end, the leaders of late-1993 Europe are spreading confusion over the small matter of a name for their remodelled organisation. Is it still the European Community - grown from the 1957 Treaty of Rome and responsible for 35 years of deepening economic and political integration? Or is it something new, with ambitions that sound grander and vaguer - the European Union? The legalistic answer is that it is both. Maastricht created a hybrid in which the old European Community coexists with a new framework for co-operation between its individual sovereign governments, within the European Union. When its members discuss matters that fall within the parameters of the Treaty of Rome, such as trade, they are the EC. When they talk about new areas of co-operation under Maastricht - foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs - they are the EU. Confused? You are not alone. Even the organisation's own foreign ministers have already found difficulty in following this fine distinction to the letter. Deciding when they should switch EC hats for EU ones in the Council of Ministers this week looked like becoming the diplomatic equivalent of determining how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Small wonder that they decided to rename themselves the Council of the European Union, regardless of whether they are discussing EC or EU business. In doing so, they (like Maastricht) papered over fundamental disagreements between governments concerning the nature of their enterprise. 'Federalist' ministers could go away crowing that the cause of Union had been advanced by one glorious centimetre, even though the EU enjoys no 'legal personality'. Sceptics such as Britain could protest that they had not budged one inch from their insistence on co-operation case by case. That still leaves the problem of what mere mortals are to make of it all. To listen to the British government sometimes, you would think it was still more appropriate to call the EC/U the Common Market, when it has long since been something substantially more than that. The Euro-priests, on the other hand, invest the nomenclature itself with almost mystical powers, as if to think Union means that it is. This newspaper has no easy answer to the conundrum, but in order not to sow daily confusion, we have to choose. As the opening words of the treaty state: 'The high contracting parties establish among themselves a European Union, hereinafter called 'the Union'.' The FT will take the union's heads of state at their word: European Union it is.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Most French oppose Maastricht A MAJORITY of French - 54 per cent - would now vote against the Maastricht treaty, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, exactly one year after the referendum that gave the European union pact a 1.1 per cent margin of approval. The Sofres poll, conducted for Le Figaro newspaper and Europe 1 radio station, has sombre implications for France's ruling coalition parties and their unity in European and presidential elections in the next two years. The survey shows the French split, on Europe as on other issues like unemployment, between what most of them expect to happen and what most of them want to happen. Thus, 79 per cent expect their government will press on with European construction. But the share of those who believe this will benefit France has dropped over the past year from 41 to 33 per cent. A plurality - 46 per cent - want 'a pause' in European integration, a sentiment related probably to the fact that 42 per cent say they would prefer the franc to float free of the D-Mark in order to reflate the economy, as opposed to 39 per cent whose priority is still a strong franc as France's passport to European monetary union. The poll highlights the problem for Mr Edouard Balladur, the pro-European premier, leading a coalition of his own RPR Gaullist party which remains almost two-thirds against Maastricht and of the centre-right UDF whose majority still backs Maastricht. If, in next June's European parliament elections, this division is reflected in two separate electoral lists (roughly along RPR and UDF lines), it may tear Mr Balladur's government apart.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (10): Heavy dependence on export markets  -Trade SINGAPORE'S exports rose 9.3 per cent last year to SDollars 95.2bn. At this level they were nearly half as much again as gross national product, underlining the country's heavy dependence on itsforeign trade. Just under half this total constituted non-oil domestic exports which rose by 8.5 per cent compared with 10 per cent in 1989. Consu mer electronics sales grew more slowly, partly due to the relocation of production to cheaper centres in the region, but sales of computer disk drives rose by 31 per cent to SDollars 7.2bn. Domestic exports of oil grew 30 per cent to SDollars 17.1bn as a result of rising prices and increased volumes passing through local refineries following the onset of the Gulf crisis. Re-exports of traditionalcommodities including rubber, copper and plywood fell sharply although there was an increase in re-exports of non-traditional goods such as colour television sets and integrated circuits which suggests that Singapore remains a trade conduit for production relocated elsewhere in the region. Main export markets last year were the US, European Community, Malaysia and Japan with the US taking the largest share at SDollars 20.2bn. Officials at Singapore's Trade DevelopmentBoard say the country's heavy dependence on exports means it attaches considerable importance to the successful completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateraltrade negotiations. According to Mr David Chin, TDB Director, Singapore's concerns are threefold. It wants to improve access for its products on foreignmarkets, foster liberalisation of service industries which now account for three-quarters of its economic growth, and strengthen the rules of the system which provides opportunities for foreigners to harass Singapore industry with the launch of trade-diverting anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions. In spite of the record exports, Singapore's overall trade deficit still rose SDollars 4.9bn to SDollars 14.6bn in 1990. A strong performance on the invisibles account left the current account balance of payments in surplus by SDollars 4.3bn (compared with SDollars 5.0bn in1989). Published foreign exchange reserves, generally thought to be an understatement of the government's true holdings, rose by SDollars 9.9bn to SDollars 48.5bn.</p>

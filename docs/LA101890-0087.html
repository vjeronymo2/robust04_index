			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASHTON-TATE HAS FIRST PROFIT IN 18 MONTHS  </P> <P> Citing increasing sales of its flagship database management software program,  Ashton-Tate Corp. on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings of $1.1 million,  its first quarterly profit in 18 months.  </P> <P> The results surprised Wall Street analysts, who had widely estimated losses of  up to $5 million at the faltering Torrance-based software publisher.  </P> <P> Revenue for the quarter totaled $60.4 million, up 12% from the $53.9 million a  year ago when the company lost $19.3 million. For the first nine months of the  year, the company lost $12.5 million, compared to $27.6 million in the year-ago  period. Sales so far this year totaled $165.5 million, down 18.5% from the  $203.2 million recorded a year ago.  </P> <P> Ashton-Tate has been hard hit since releasing a flawed version of its  market-leading dBase database management program in late 1988 and then  recording as "sold" thousands of copies stockpiled on wholesalers' shelves.  That resulted in losses of more than $50 million over the last 15 months.  </P> <P> After working feverishly for months, the company released a corrected version  of the program in late July, and executives have said sales are noticeably  picking up.  </P> <P> "We are very pleased with the progress we've made," said company President  William Lyons. "The product has been favorably reviewed . . . and our customers  are confirming that it is stable and reliable."  </P></p>

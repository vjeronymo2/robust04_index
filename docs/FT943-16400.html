			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / University year move may be rejected Universities yesterday seemed likely to reject a plan to shift the beginning of their academic year from October to January, John Authers writes. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, which co-ordinates applications to all higher-education colleges, said this would be necessary to accommodate the vastly expanded number of applicants. Students would not make applications until after their exam results were known at the end of August, it suggested, while the practice of making offers conditional on A-levels should be abandoned. Universities would then be able to plan with certainty to ensure that they did not exceed government targets, while potential students would be able to make more realistic applications. But vice-chancellors fear this would involve too much upheaval for a system which is also planning to introduce a new degree structure. Instead the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents university managers, said it was likely to campaign for exam results to be released earlier. The year could then start in September, allowing universities to run three 15-week semesters each year. The committee said two-thirds of its members wanted the marking of public exams to be accelerated. They thought this was plausible because marks for the equivalent baccalaureat qualification in France are available six days after the exams have been completed.</p>

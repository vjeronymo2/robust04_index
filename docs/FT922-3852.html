			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Japan's upper house passes UN peace troops bill JAPAN'S upper house of parliament approved early today a controversial bill that would allow Japanese troops to serve abroad in peace-keeping missions for the first time since the end of World War Two. The bill, voted in plenary session by 137 against 102, now goes back to the more powerful lower house for final approval. The 252-member upper house passed the Peace-Keeping Operations Bill two hours after reconvening a full midnight session, a parliamentary spokesman said. The bill, which had been subject to continuous filibustering tactics by opposition parties, would allow Tokyo to send up to 2,000 soldiers abroad to trouble spots as United Nations peace-keepers. The diet's upper house had spent three successive all-night sessions on interminable procedural motions. To the annoyance of many Japanese, the politicians' tactics have reduced debate over a serious revision in foreign policy to a farce. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party together with two small centrist parties has a majority in the chamber. But it had held back from forcing a vote for fear of being accused of cutting short deliberation of a very sensitive bill. So, the opposition Social Democratic and Communist parties have run riot with the Diet rule-book. Knowing that procedural motions take precedence over substantive ones, they filed no less than eight no-confidence motions. They have then prolonged the voting through a technique called the 'ox-walk' in which members edge their way toward the ballot box an inch at a time. By yesterday afternoon, opposition members had perfected their technique to the extent that a single vote took a record 13 hours and three minutes, exceeding a record 11 hours 37 minutes set on Saturday. The votes were taking so long that Diet officials relaxed a rule which required members to ask special permission of the chairman if they wished to go to the toilet during a vote. Television viewers were treated to the unedifying spectacle of scores of their elected representatives sleeping on the job. Other film clips showed aides bringing piles of packed meals into Diet waiting rooms. The Diet's press office was flooded with 'countless' calls protesting about the waste of taxpayers' money. The marathon has taken its toll on members, many of whom are elderly. The oldest parliamentarian, Mr Tadashi Yaoita, who is 87, was applauded in the chamber when he staggered to the ballot box. The bill's tortuous journey through the Diet reflects the deep divisions it has caused in the country between those who believe that Japan must play a bigger role in world affairs and those who think sending troops abroad would infringe Japan's peace constitution.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM'S UMBRELLA ALSO COVERS RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY;  </P> <P> ABORTION: BISHOP LEO MAHER'S PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST A PRO-CHOICE CATHOLIC  POLITICIAN IS AS MUCH WITHIN U.S. RELIGIOUS TRADITION AS PLYMOUTH ROCK.  </P> <P> Before Thanksgiving, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops ruled that "no  Catholic can responsibly take a 'pro-choice' stand when the 'choice' in  question involves the taking of innocent human life." Bolder -- if not wiser --  than his colleagues, Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego acted promptly on that  ruling. Assemblywoman Lucy Killea's "media advertisements and statements  advocating the 'pro-choice' abortion position," he stated, put this practicing  Catholic from his diocese "in complete contradiction to the moral teaching of  the Catholic Church." Then he banned Killea, who is running for the state  Senate against anti-abortion Republican Carol Bentley, from the sacrament of  Communion until she recants.  </P> <P> No faithful Catholic would take such action lightly, which brings us back to  Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> The holiday rests on Protestant Pilgrims who dissented from the Church of  England's authority and followed their consciences to New England, landing at  Plymouth Rock. From these Pilgrims flowed a belief that Alexis de Tocqueville,  the French observer of democracy in America, would later identify as our  "general distaste for accepting any man's word as proof of anything."  </P> <P> But Pilgrim dissenters were not the only ones who landed here, a point to which  the current political tempest in San Diego testifies. Nearly a century before  the Pilgrims crossed the Atlantic, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese  explorer in the service of Catholic Spain, sailed into San Diego Bay. He did  not stay, but other Roman Catholics did -- including the Franciscan Junipero  Serra, who founded the first of California's many missions in San Diego in  1769.  </P> <P> The Catholic tradition has been less reluctant to accept a man's word as proof,  especially when that word is thought to come through a centuries-old, unbroken  authority that could be traced back to St. Peter. In that tradition, the  National Council of Catholic Bishops regards the Catholic Church's teachings as  true and intends that they should be received as authoritative, particularly by  members of that body.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, San Diego's voters will likely prevail against Bishop Maher's  vision of the church and send Lucy Killea to the state Senate, a victory that  would give pro-choice advocates a 21-19 edge in that house of California's  Legislature. Reasons for that forecast reside in our past.  </P> <P> From Plymouth Rock to San Diego Bay, American origins produced an understanding  about religious civility. No religion, hierarchical or otherwise, would be  established by the state or be permitted exclusive rights. Thanksgiving affirms  that civility. We understand, however dimly, that the holiday involves the  intertwining of political and religious liberty.  </P> <P> Religious traditions based on hierarchy and authority did find their place in  the United States. But Tocqueville got it right. Most Americans -- often in  political matters and particularly in religious ones -- do not accept "any  man's word as proof of anything." Undoubtedly some voters will be influenced by  Bishop Maher and decide that Killea is not fit to serve. Politically, however,  Maher's forthrightness will backfire -- if not by aiding Killea on Tuesday,  then by alienating further the millions of American Catholics who are already  discomfited by their church's stance on a wide range of sexually related  issues.  </P> <P> But one should pause before agreeing completely with critics who take Maher  simply to be heavy-handed, more imprudent than adroit. As a bishop, Maher is  responsible for his church's integrity no less than elected political leaders  are responsible for the integrity of their government. In good conscience, he  can no more allow members of his church to reject its teaching with impunity --  especially when the actions of a particularly visible member have the effect of  contradicting that teaching publicly -- than elected political leaders can  blithely allow lawbreakers in their jurisdiction to proceed unhindered.  </P> <P> Some teachings of Maher's church, like some laws at times, may be unjust and  rightly subject to change. But neither Maher's conscience nor the traditional  religious authority that informs his position on abortion finds that to be the  case now. The bishop's action against Lucy Killea has its logic and  authenticity.  </P> <P> This week between Thanksgiving and San Diego's special election, as we keep  struggling with the immense issues that abortion raises, we should give thanks  for our religious and political diversity, including the commitment and  civility on which it depends. Let it encompass the likes of Carol Bentley, Lucy  Killea and, at least a bit, those of Bishop Maher as well. Their collision  could produce better religious teaching and sounder public policy.  </P></p>

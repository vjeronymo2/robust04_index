			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> NEW FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN FOR PIER  </P> <P> Five of the largest local development-oriented firms are heading up a new  campaign to raise the remaining $2.85 million needed to rebuild the municipal  pier, a city spokesman announced Thursday.  </P> <P> The group of businesses backing the "Landmark Campaign" will serve as the  umbrella organization for all private fund-raising efforts for the pier, said  Dennis Williams, an assistant public information officer for the city.  </P> <P> The campaign's co-chairmen are Roger J. Work, vice president and general  manager of the Huntington Beach Co., the city's largest private landowner, and  Robert L. Mayer, the Newport Beach-based developer of the sprawling Waterfront  project.  </P> <P> The new campaign is scheduled to begin Saturday with an event planned as part  of the Waterfront's four-day grand-opening ceremonies, which began Thursday.  The pier benefit, to be attended by a select group of business leaders, will  feature a concert by surf-music performers Jan &amp; Dean.  </P> <P> The $11.7-million pier reconstruction project is scheduled to get under way  within the next two weeks. The city thus far has received about $8.85 million  for the project, mainly from federal, state and county grants, Williams said.  </P> <P> Although Thursday's announcement of the fund-raising pledge coincided with the  first day of the Waterfront Hilton hotel's opening ceremonies, none of the  officials at the hotel fete mentioned the new campaign.  </P> <P> Instead, Mayer joined other project promoters, city officials, local business  leaders and about 250 guests gathered outside the hotel for the opening event  amid pomp, celebration and self-congratulatory speeches. With flashbulbs  popping and video cameras rolling, officials cut a ribbon christening the  beachside hotel and dedicated a time capsule buried last week at the site.  </P> <P> The grand opening, which runs through Sunday, comes almost two months after the  $55-million, 13-story hotel opened for business July 24.  </P> <P> Scheduled hotel events still to come include a beach-themed fund-raiser from  6:30 to 11 tonight to benefit the Huntington Harbour Philharmonic, which puts  on the "Cruise of Lights" boating parade each holiday season. Also planned is  fund-raising a ball for Children's Hospital of Orange County.  </P> <P> The hotel is the first of six planned phases of a $600-million project that  will sprawl along the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A few days  ago, China's National Narcotics Control Commission, a Ministry  of Public Health, and the National Medicine and Drug  Administration issued a "Circular on Strengthening the Control  of Natural Caffeine," calling on the public security organs in  all localities to strictly cope with such illegal and criminal  activities. The National Narcotics Control Commission has  instructed departments in charge to adopt measures to strengthen  caffeine control.    The circular says: Since last year, some localities have  begun producing natural caffeine in the pretext of pooling funds  with others or exporting it. Some have not made declarations in  accordance with the law. Some even have illegally produced,  sold, and advertised their products without the approval of  public health, medicine, and drug control departments. These  acts have interfered with social order and harmed the health of  the people. Some have constituted crimes.    The circular calls on all localities to ban the illegal and  criminal acts of producing and dealing in natural caffeine  without approval. It says that those violating the law will be  held accountable for their criminal acts by judicial organs in  accordance with the law, and that the act of illegally  producing, selling, importing, or exporting natural caffeine  will be punished as the crime of smuggling, selling,  transporting, or manufacturing drugs in accordance with the  provisions of the NPC Standing Committee's "Decision on  Narcotics Control."</p>

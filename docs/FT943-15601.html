			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / People: Stud owner joins Bloodstock Agency Kirsten Rausing, a member of one of Europe's wealthiest families, has been appointed a non-executive director of The British Bloodstock Agency, which buys and sells racehorses on behalf of wealthy clients. Rausing, who is the granddaughter of Ruben Rausing, founder of Sweden's TetraPak packaging business, is the largest individual shareholder in the BBA - which claims to be the world's largest and longest-established bloodstock agency. She bought a near 10 per cent stake in February 1991. The company, which employs 40 staff and bought and sold around 200 horses last year, is starting to recover after several years of losses. Its wealthy clientele has been hard hit by the collapse in bloodstock prices, the recession and the problems of the Lloyd's insurance market. Estimates of the wealth of the Rausing family range from Dollars 9bn (Forbes magazine) to Pounds 5.2bn (Sunday Times). Several members of the family now live in Britain. Rausing, who is vice-chairman of the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, owns the Lanwades and St Simon Studs near Newmarket and the Staffordstown Stud in County Meath, Ireland, all of which are operated on a commercial basis. Meanwhile, the BBA is still looking for a new chief executive with a strong financial background. Peter Bickmore, who has been running the group's insurance business as well as being managing director of the group, is stepping down in order to concentrate fully on running the group's insurance business. John Harvey-Barnes, the finance director, is 65 next year and is expected gradually to hand over some of his financial responsibilities to the new chief executive.</p>

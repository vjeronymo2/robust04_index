			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Liberty The Stewart-Liberty family and Mr Bryan Myerson of Concerto Capital Corporation arguably deserve each other. One would certainly not seek to defend non-voting shares, or even Liberty's recent trading record. But the appeal to high principle which forms part of Concerto's attempt to enfranchise Liberty shareholders - including a liberal quote from the Cadbury report on corporate governance - strikes a discordant note. Mr Myerson may make his turn one day, as he did a couple of years ago when Aquascutum sold out to the Japanese. But no one should shed any tears if he gets stymied by the Liberty family's united front and the present lack of Far Eastern interest in upmarket UK retailing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brussels, April 8 (AFP) -- Belgium confirmed  Friday [8 April] that 10 Belgian UN troops were executed at a  Rwandan military barracks in the unrest that erupted in the  capital Kigali after the country's president was killed in a  plane crash.    A Defense Ministry spokesman said the troops, who were  killed  Thursday, had been assigned to guard Rwanda's prime minister,  who was assassinated by Rwandan security forces in the upheaval.    Their commander, interviewed from Kigali by Belgian radio,  said the Belgian soldiers were "mistreated" by Rwandan troops  before they were killed.    "These soldiers were in charge of security for Rwandan Prime  Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, whose home was surrounded by  Rwandan soldiers. She tried to flee. Our soldiers were  apprehended while they tried to help clear the way for her," the  Defense Ministry statement said.    "The Belgian soldiers were disarmed, then taken to a  military  camp in Kigali where they were executed," it said.    Their commander, Colonel Luc Marchal, told the radio their  bodies were now in Kigali hospital and that they would be  transferred Friday to the UN mission hospital there before being  repatriated.    They all belonged to the 2d Commando Battalion from Flawinne  in southeast Belgium.    Marchal also said there had been violent fighting Thursday  between different groups in the Rwandan military.    He said part of a battalion of the former rebel Rwandan  Patriotic Front in Kigali "made an incursion in the camp of the  presidential guard who was guilty of these crimes, and seriously  cleaned up the presidential guard unit."    According to Marchal, "they gave them a lesson and I presume  the presidential guard or any other unit will not start up this  sort of thing again."    The Rwandan Patriot Front, largely made up of the Tutsi  minority, had opposed Habyarimana, who comes from the Hutu  majority that has long dominated Rwandan politics. They were to  be brought into a transitional government under a peace pact  signed last August to end three years of civil war. [passage  omitted]</p>

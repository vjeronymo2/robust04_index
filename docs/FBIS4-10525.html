			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the socialist bloc in the Chamber of  Deputies dissociates himself totally from the resolution passed  by the Senate office led by Senator Sansaricq. The socialist  bloc remains committed to the parliamentary plan regarding the  unblocking of the Governors Island agreement, says Deputy Duly  Brutus:    [Begin Brutus recording] We remain faithful to the plan  which  we ratified in the Chamber of Deputies in the Haitian  parliament. We are waiting for the Senate's position with Sen.  Firmin Jean-Louis; on the other hand, we feel that we must  continue negotiating a solution to the Haitian political crisis.    [In Creole] The socialist bloc does not relate to this  position on the application of Article 149 of the Constitution.  We believe the time is not right to take such a step, mostly  because we think that the parliament has made some progress on  the international level. It would be a pity if today we were to  take some false steps that would cause the parliament to lose  the credibility it has on the international level. [end  recording]</p>

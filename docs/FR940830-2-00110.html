			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on The Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> US v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> EPS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> When a shared network obtains market dominance, it can preclude use of it by other parties (financial institutions or third party processors) by explicit exclusions or by more insidious means, generally pricing. These issues are clearly recognized by the proposed Final Judgment, and language in section IV establishes what the ``prohibited conduct'' would be on the part of MAC. The judgment goes on to say that MAC ``shall not restrict in any manner, directly or indirectly, the ability.&blank;.&blank;.to obtain ATM processing or authorization for access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant from any qualified third party processor.'' Generally, equal access shall be provided to qualified third party processors on equal terms as those extended to intercept processors, including aggregation of transactions. Reciprocity of processing, including pricing and terms, is also contemplated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defendant is also ordered to offer volume discounts to all, on substantially equal terms, and the judgment also permits MAC to offer transaction switching at nondiscriminatory royalties that shall not be greater than the price for switched transactions. This last stipulation may need a bit of clarification for the Final Judgment to have its intended effect, however, and that is the substance of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banks and other financial institutions have ``joined forces'' in many, widely different combinations to offer electronic banking services to their customers since the advent of ATM's and other electronic terminals. Generally speaking, these combinations are formed for (1) marketing purposes, (2) particular geographic areas, (3) brand identification that differentiates services available to particular sets of customers, and (4) cost efficiencies that result from larger transaction bases (economies of scale). Whatever the reason, there now exists a diverse tapestry of electronic banking associations across the United States, but in some areas, a monopolistic enterprise threatens the existence of many smaller networks. Such is the case with MAC and its ATM network. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Open access is available, but only from a technological point of view. Financial institutions and third party processors are essentially forced to join the dominant network to provide the greatest access possible to retail customers. There would be no problem if the dominant network would change only for transactions (without surcharge or royalty) based on volume of transactions presented. Then the user of the subordinate network would be paying for the marketing benefits of its smaller network and only for the use of the ``electronic highway'' provided by the dominant network. In fact, the brand identity of the dominant network serves no purpose to an otherwise ``unbranded'' user. Moreover, no one would argue that the choice to join MAC should be made by weighing the advantages of its brand (with all the consequent marketing and service differentials) against an alternative brand, but MAC's current pricing structure places a punitive burden on third party processors and financial institutions and forces membership in the network, requiring MAC identification, thus hastening the demise of subordinate networks and eliminating choice between different providers of service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Just recently the Quest Network of Kentucky sent a letter to its participants indicating that its viability had been re-assessed, with the outcome that the Quest brand would be discontinued in favor of MAC by June 1, 1995 (letter attached). The only reason for this change was the layering of pricing to participants in the Quest Network caused by the brand identity of MAC on its members who were also members of the Quest Network. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A simple solution to this issue would be the ability of subordinate networks to use the dominant network for transaction switching, paying a competitive and nondiscriminatory price for that use, but without the requirement of brand identification (and subsequent terms and pricing) of membership in the dominant network. Reciprocity should also be a requirement, such that if the dominant network desired the ability to use the subordinate network's transaction switching service, it, too, would have to provide full, complete and nondiscriminatory access to its network without mandating membership and brand identity by the dominant network members. In essence, ``open access'' should be the rule without ``branding'' each network with the other's identity in an area where there is clear dominance by one network over others. This is the case in Illinois where four (4) networks act cooperatively to permit universal access to any cardholder in that state without requiring any one network member (or third party processor) to join any other network. Pricing is based solely upon the number of transactions processed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The concept of ``ubiquity and convenience'' can only be accomplished by a truly open environment where individual institutions, processors or networks can have access to the dominant electronic banking network, which in this case is MAC, and where MAC members can enjoy the same reciprocity at the subordinate network terminals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not clear what effect the proposed Final Judgment will have on point of sale (POS) services. Although MAC may or may not be practicing the exact same ``anti-competitive'' conduct in the POS area as in the ATM area, certain barriers do exist which discourage competition. For example, although MAC seems to allow member financial institutions to use third party processors to provide POS services to such financial institution's sponsored merchants, the costs of such an option are prohibitive. MAC charges a $25,000 ``Processor Initialization Fee'' to such a third party processor (MAC Point of Sale Schedule of Fees attached). The MAC Point of Sale Schedule of Fees states that this fee is for test time and certification, but the $25,000 only includes 20 hours of test time and there is a charge of $250 per hour for test time which exceeds the 20 hours. This set-up or establishment fee is plainly excessive in relation to the $100 per hour, $1,000 maximum third party processor set-up fee set forth in the proposed Final Judgment. In addition, MAC charges third party POS processors $1,000 per month for the first communications port, $2,000 per month for each additional communications port and a $300 per month ``Processor Residency Fee''. Given the importance and dramatic rise in POS transactions over the years, failure to explicitly include POS antitrust stipulations in the proposed Final Judgment could have a devastating effect on competition in the POS area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, there is a curious exclusion of ``access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function'' from branding restrictions in Section IV(H). If these cards should be issued by a MAC member, and their use might include the necessity to utilize transaction switching services of MAC from a terminal other than a MAC terminal, should they not also be included in the philosophy that says there can be no brand restriction by MAC? It is recognized that use of these unique types of cards may involve ``off-line'' transactions throughout some period, but the settlement and switching of settlement transactions may necessitate the same unrestricted access to the network that magnetically striped cards would employ in an ``on-line'' mode. As an example, if a cardholder in an ``electronic benefits'' (EBT) processing area that utilizes ``smart card'' technology is able to withdraw a certain amount of cash from ATM's as part of the benefit distribution process, and that cardholder uses an ATM belonging to a network or processed by a third party processor other than MAC, the network or processor should be able to switch settlement transactions through MAC (paying the standard switching fee) without paying an excessive royalty or finding it necessary to become a member of MAC in order to complete the transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Clinton loses a second top aide to Whitewater: Altman resigns as deputy US treasury secretary Mr Roger Altman, the deputy US treasury secretary, resigned yesterday, making him the second prominent Clinton administration casualty of the Whitewater affair. In a letter to President Bill Clinton, he regretted 'any mistakes or errors of judgment I may have made'. He hoped his departure would 'help diminish the controversy'. Mr Clinton, a friend of many years standing, replied: 'I believe you have taken the right step under the circumstances.' Ms Jean Hanson, the treasury's legal counsel, is also expected to leave shortly. Like Mr Altman, her testimony to Congress on Whitewater was questioned. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, had recommended undersecretary Mr Frank Newman as Mr Altman's replacement, a department spokesman said. The fate of Mr Altman, a leading architect of administration economic policies for the past 18 months, was in effect sealed last week. It was then that the two senior Democratic senators on the finance committee - Mr Don Riegle, the committee chairman, and Mr Paul Sarbanes - privately told Mr Bentsen and Mr Lloyd Cutler, the White House legal counsel, that Mr Altman had lost the confidence of Congress and should therefore resign. Since then, White House officials have repeatedly qualified earlier statements of confidence in Mr Altman and said the final decision had to be his. A similar experience had befallen Mr Bernard Nussbaum, the White House legal counsel, who resigned four months ago. Mr Altman had endured nine hours of grilling by the committee on August 2 on the question of his knowledge of briefings given by the treasury to the White House on the status of investigations into Madison Guaranty. This is the bankrupt Arkansas savings bank previously owned by the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land development. At the time of the briefings, Mr Altman was acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency responsible for cleaning up the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. He repeatedly denied any interference with the investigatory processes and said he had been cleared of any ethical or criminal wrongdoing by Mr Robert Fiske, the former Whitewater special counsel, and by the non-partisan government ethics office. But additional controversy centred on his delay in 'recusing' (disqualifying) himself from the Madison case because of his longstanding friendship with the Clintons. Mr Altman, a former Wall Street investment banker, had appeared to be one of the rising stars in the administration and was widely seen as a successor to Mr Bentsen.

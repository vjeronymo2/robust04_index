			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Governments' powers to defend currencies are dwindling INTERNATIONAL investors are being given increased powers by the liberalisation of financial markets to force policy changes on governments, an International Monetary Fund study has concluded. The report amounts to an admission by the governments of leading industrial nations that they have limited powers to keep their currencies within agreed limits when faced with severe market strains. The study is one of a series of official inquests into the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism between last September and early this year. It concludes that, when faced with heavy selling of their currencies by investors, governments' ability to influence markets by currency intervention or interest rate changes is severely constrained. The report says: 'The discipline exerted by capital markets over government policies is neither infallible nor is it always applied smoothly and consistently. Nevertheless, the markets eventually decide on what are unsustainable situations, and when they do, their size alone increasingly allows them to force adjustments.' The study reflects the tone of another report on the currency turbulence by Mr Lamberto Dini, deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, delivered to finance ministers from leading industrial nations in Washington yesterday. Although the Dini study contains no specific policy recommendations, it warns against the re-introduction of exchange controls. The best way for a country to avoid pressure on its currency, Mr Dini concluded, is rigorous medium-term policies. The Dini report underlined that international monetary stability requires close consultation among countries to identify inconsistent policies and encourage policy changes where these are needed. Ministers welcomed the report yesterday, but some regretted that Mr Dini had not been more positive about the powers of governments to influence the exchange markets by selling and buying currencies. 'The report could perhaps have made more of the effectiveness of intervention when the conditions are right. It is not always the size of the intervention, it is choosing the right moment,' said Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister. Mr Alphandery said the report showed the need for new prudential regulations for the foreign exchange market, because so much currency trading is carried off banks' balance sheets, but he warned that more needed to be done to strengthen supervision of non-bank participants in the exchange markets. The IMF study says that as a result of worldwide financial liberalisation, Dollars 1m trillion (Pounds 649.3bn) a day is swopped among investors on currency markets. This development can lead to up to Dollars 200bn being of investment being switched out of a specific currency within one week. Faced with such large flows of money, the ability of central banks to use their foreign currency reserves to alter market sentiment is limited.

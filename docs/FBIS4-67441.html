			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by A. Poltov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 17 Apr -- While attention is being  focused on the Russian Pacific Fleet in connection with the  dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, at least  four of its decommissioned nuclear submarines are tied to their  moorings while being in quite a dangerous condition, because it  is difficult to extract their nuclear fuel due to explosions or  problems they suffered while they were in service. This was  learned by a TOKYO SHIMBUN investigation on 17 April. In giving  warning, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stated, "The  failure to deal with nuclear submarines that have previously  suffered accidents is a more serious problem to safety in the  Sea of Japan than is the dumping of radioactive waste into the  sea."    These nuclear submarines that have suffered accidents or  difficulties are three E-II class cruise missile submarines  which have been moored at the Pabrovsk [name as published] base  near Vladivostok, and one V-I class attack submarine which has  been moored at the Kamchatskaya base. Between 1979 and 1985,  all of them suffered difficulties with or explosions of their  nuclear reactors due to malfunctions of their cooling systems.  In August 1985, one of them suffered an explosion in its  nuclear reactor, which killed 10 of its crew, due to a sudden  rise in the temperature of its cooling water.    Decommissioned nuclear submarines usually are scrapped after  they have been dismantled. However, these four submarines have  been moored at their bases because it is difficult to remove  their nuclear fuel because of the fear of large-scale  radioactive leaks from their nuclear reactors. Although an  institute of the Russian Defense Ministry is currently studying  technology for the safe dismantling of nuclear submarines that  have suffered accidents, the development of this technology has  been greatly delayed due to the recent financial difficulties.  Therefore, the outlook for dismantling these nuclear submarines  is uncertain.    The high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stressed: "Because  the radioactive waste that is the focal point in the dumping  issue is very low-level radiation, it causes no actual problems  to human beings. However, troubles with nuclear submarines that  have suffered accidents may cause serious problems affecting  humans." Also, he added, "If we cannot speed up the development  of new technology for dismantling them through assistance from  Japan and other nations, this will have serious consequences."</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Slowdown seen in management salary rises ANNUAL rates of pay increases for managers have slowed to an average of less than 10 per cent, according to the latest executive-pay index produced by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries. The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions, as well as salaries and bonuses. It is based on the group's regular pay surveys, and is calculated each quarter for the Financial Times. The most recent survey, which covered 419 companies, shows that on April 1 the average for managers of all levels of seniority was Pounds 77,793. This was 8.6 per cent up on the Pounds 71,633 average on the same date last year. The corresponding increase between 1990 and last year was 13.6 per cent. Over the latest 12 months the salary component of the total pay package has increased on average by 8.8 per cent to Pounds 55,240, while bonuses have risen by only 4.2 per cent to Pounds 4,421. The pensions element is 18.4 per cent higher at Pounds 8,305, with company cars up by 2.1 per cent to Pounds 8,508, and other benefits by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 1,319.

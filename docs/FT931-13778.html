			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Currency policies affect European turnover - Italy and Spain put in good second half performances writes William Cochrane, reviewing 1992 trading In a pattern which begins with optimism and ends in disappointment, European bourses seem to be getting into the habit of producing better turnover figures in the first half of a given year than they do in the second. This was the way in 1990, and again in 1991; and the same can be said for last year in aggregate, although there were distinct variations in individual countries. The variations, however, make up a pattern of their own. The countries which did worse in the second half of 1992 than they did in the first included Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, all supporting hard currency policies. Those which did better were Italy, Spain and the UK, all of which devalued during the second half of last year. Mr James Cornish, European market strategist with NatWest Securities, which produces the figures, observes that it was a good year in toto. UK turnover rose by 20.4 per cent over 1991 as the devaluation effect combined with the perception that the UK, like the US, was entering economic recovery earlier than the rest of Europe. Nearly all of the rest put up useful increases: France 8.4 per cent; Germany 6.4 per cent; Italy 8.8 per cent; the Netherlands 9.5 per cent; and Switzerland 6 per cent; with only Spain of the eight countries covered showing a decline, of 7 per cent. Occasionally, some countries had an exciting time. France enjoyed itself, in stock market turnover terms, in June, September and December: in June following the Danish 'No' vote on the Maastricht treaty, and President Francois Mitterrand's decision to call an autumn referendum on the same subject; in September, along with most of Europe, on the partial collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, following a fall in the dollar at the beginning of the month, the thin 'Yes' majority in the French referendum and resulting devaluations and currency floats; and, last month, as devaluation speculation against the franc combined with renewed critical appreciation of the French economy and the Paris equity market. Germany had already had a stab at reflecting a decaying growth rate in the second half of 1991. Last year, it cranked itself up in January on hopes of interest rate cuts; but as those hopes effectively decayed, and the German economy moved into the prospect of recession, its equity market turnover showed a downward trend through most of 1992. Mr Cornish observes that most of the investment into German paper was going elsewhere, into the bond market. The Bundesbank's tight grip on the monetary tiller was accompanied by figures for net foreign investment in German fixed interest stocks rising from DM5.5bn in the first quarter of 1992, through DM8.1bn in the second and DM17.8bn in the third, to DM28.9bn in October/December. Italy positively mushroomed in October and November, as the devaluation effect combined with excitement stirred up by the privatisation prospect for a number of government-controlled companies. Spain, with another strong final quarter performance, combined a small devaluation with a strong post-devaluation performance in the currency markets. Switzerland, finally, was the Continental performance market of the year, as long term economic improvement weighed in the scales with its reputation as a safe haven - and its capacity to reflect this as an equity market with a preponderance of defensive stocks.</p>

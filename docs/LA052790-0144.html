			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YEAS AND NAYS FOR IRVINE MAYOR CANDIDATE SALLY ANNE SHERIDAN  </P> <P> The pillars of political integrity are shaking in Irvine after revelations that  City Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan has engaged in dozens of real estate  transactions with city employees and Irvine Co. executives that netted the  Sheridans' real estate partnership a handsome profit of more than $130,000  since Sheridan joined the council in 1986 (May 17, Orange County Section).  </P> <P> These transactions presumptively taint Sheridan's capacity to render objective  and disinterested judgments on matters concerning city employees and the Irvine  Co.  </P> <P> How can we ever know if Sheridan's votes on important policies -- such as the  Irvine Business Complex, open space preservation or residential developments,  which all involve the Irvine Co. -- were influenced in any way by her business  relationships with Irvine Co. executives?  </P> <P> How can we be certain that the explicit or implied promise of future real  estate deals from the Irvine Co. doesn't color Sheridan's view of what policy  decisions are in the best interest of all Irvine residents?  </P> <P> We can't, and that fact should outrage every resident in this city! We  shouldn't have to worry about the judgmental integrity of our elected  representatives. Their capacity for objective, fair and effective  decision-making should never be compromised by financial transactions with  major interests in the city for personal gain or profit.  </P> <P> MARK P. PETRACCA  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

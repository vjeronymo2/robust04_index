			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Chill winds in bi-polar west HISTORY, far from being over, remains an instructive, though potentially misleading guide to the future, be it of nations, politicians, or stocks and shares. Last week's riots in Los Angeles, a product of America's past, suggest the US version of liberal capitalism possesses serious flaws; while Germany's unexpected descent into division indicates the difficulty of creating a new nation after the unexpected unification. But such history-making events will also determine more mundane futures: the careers of politicians, such as Mr Bush and Mr Kohl, and the returns for small investors. Whether or not the US and Germany eventually converge on the same capitalist model, the short-term economic prospects for the west's two largest countries look very different. In the US, it now seems that a sustainable economic recovery is under way; with the nation nervous and the election coming, the Federal Reserve will do everything it can to ensure there is no triple-dip. But Germany looks to be edging nearer to recession. This would spell danger for politicians and investors across Europe, since the Bundesbank and the government, whether by omission or commission, now determine short-term prospects across the continent. Wall Street certainly believes the US recovery is under way. The market's price-earnings ratio remains high by historical standards; and in real terms the market is fast approaching its peak last reached before the 1987 crash. Yesterday's news provide grounds for optimism: non-farm employment rose by almost twice as much as expected, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.2 per cent. Yet suspicion remains that Wall Street is running ahead of itself. This modest improvement in hiring prospects, and other indicators in the manufacturing, retailing and housing sectors, suggest only a modest recovery, by past standards. That the US stock market faltered yesterday, once the employment data signalled that another interest rate cut was unlikely, suggests that low returns on cash, rather than expectations of a profits surge, are supporting equities. Higher inflation Neither low US interest rates, nor the current US bull market, will last forever. The recent rise in bond yields suggests more cautious investors are already nervous about inflation. The US remains, as always, a country for which growth now is more important than the risk of higher inflation later. Yet historical valuations, while relevant for the US, are more dangerous when applied to the UK equity market. Britain, too, has tended to be a growth-seeking society. But hitching sterling, and therefore the UK inflation rate, to the world's most inflation-wary country - Germany - implies a very different future. The UK's stock market culture appears unconvinced about the costs of Britain's new regime. The FT-SE has risen by more than 13 per cent since the UK general election, reaching a new nominal high this week. Students of the past suggest the UK market rally has further to go: equity yields are still low compared to bond yields, while, in real terms, share prices are low compared to the peaks of 1989 and 1987. Pallid recovery But whence will these expected future profits come? The economic recovery looks, at best, pallid; last week's interest rate cut, while welcome, leave short-term real interest at chokingly high levels; and the ERM leaves little room for further easing. The European interest rate floor now looks set to remain about 10 per cent into 1993: the Bundesbank's determination to keep its head, while all around are losing theirs, will see to that. The German government's capitulation in the face of a comparatively civilised strike confirms its weakness. The engineering employers are unlikely to be so malleable in the face of similarly high union demands, but IG Metall will test their mettle. A further German interest rate rise looks as likely as not. It would provide a test of whether Germany has been knocked from pole position within the ERM. If France proves able to hold this week's modest cut, the answer may be yes - temporarily. But recent history does not bode well: the last French bid for leadership ended miserably last autumn. The luxury of wide bands gives the UK a better chance; but three-month interest rates are already discounting a rise in UK rates. The deeper question, which will certainly not be on the official agenda at this weekend's meeting of EC finance ministers, is whether the ERM, at least in its current hardened form, would survive a rise in German rates. This seems a strange moment for Sweden to be trying to join. Some kind and battle-weary finance minister should take the Swedes aside. A less rigid ERM would also test whether Mr Major's government does mark a real change in Britain's post-war economic history. If low and stable inflation is to be Britain's future, then an independent and reconstituted Bank of England would be the best signal of his resolve. If not, then search out those historical yield ratios. The UK could yet revert to type.</p>

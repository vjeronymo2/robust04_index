			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 96 (586): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] The prime ministers of Belarus and Russia,  Vyacheslav Kebich and Viktor Chernomyrdin, on Thursday met in  Moscow to discuss the implementation of the two countries'  monetary union treaty.    Kebich said after the meeting, held behind closed doors,  that  he had asked Chernomyrdin to speed up the provision of a loan  Russia had promised to Belarus. "The prime minister of the  Russian Federation promised assistance in this matter," Kebich  said.    Sources in the Belarusian delegation told Interfax that  Kebich, in explaining his request for an earlier arrival of the  200-billion-ruble loan, said that lack of cash forces many of  Belarus's enterprises to delay the payment of wages to their  workers.    At the same time, the Belarusian delegation said it realized  that Russia was unable to give Belarus or any other member of  the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) any loans without  approval by parliament. The Belarusians also mentioned that a  Russian 1994 national budget the draft of which the legislature  has passed at the first reading would limit Russia's total loans  to other CIS countries to 185 billion rubles.    The above-mentioned sources in the Belarusian delegation  said  the Russian government had assured Belarus that it would do its  best to provide the loan earlier but had given no specific dates.    Kebich said that "today it is extremely important not only  to  carry through the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus  and Russia but also to find ways of forming a political and  economic union of the Slav states." Talking to reporters, he  said that such a union might subsequently be joined by  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other CIS countries. In his view,  the union member states need not have a single currency, namely  the Russian ruble."Setting up an interstate bank would be enough  to solve (their) economic problems," he said.    Kebich said disagreements between Belarus and Russia over  the  status of the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) remain an obstacle  to the materialization of the two countries' monetary union.  The Russian Finance Ministry wants the NBB to be a branch of  the Central Bank of Russia, which, Kebich said, Belarus cannot  accept.    He also believes the exchange of Belarusian rubles for  Russian ones by bank transfer could be done at a rate of four or  five Belarussian rubles to one Russian ruble. He said the rate  was based on the cost of consumer goods in the two countries, he  said.    In the meantime, NBB chief Stanislav Bogdankevich called the  conditions made by Russia at the second round of monetary union  talks unacceptable. He told a news conference in Minsk that he  was against Belarus and Russia having a single budget. As for  Russia's offer to provide credits to close Belarus's budget  deficits, he described that as "totally unacceptable." Apart  from that, Bogdankevich still considers Article 5 of the  monetary union treaty unconstitutional. "I did not initial that  fundamental article, which provides for what is effective  abolition of the National Bank of Belarus," he said. "Therefore  the document is no more than a letter of intent." "The treaty  cannot be signed on those terms. Negotiations are needed to take  us back to our mutually advantageous positions," he said.    Kebich's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin said the prime  minister  considered it his moral duty to carry through the work he had  begun two years ago despite any pressure or resistance to  Belarus's union with Russia. "What is today needed for real  unification are not declarations or promises but persistent  practical measures," Zametalin quoted Kebich as saying.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Nikkei reaches two-year high Economic optimism continued to sweep the Tokyo stock market yesterday, with the third day of rising prices pushing it to the highest point since March 1992. The rise in the Nikkei average, by 140.84 points to 21,402.78, reinforces its break through the technical barrier of 21,000 earlier this week and leaves it nearly 23 per cent ahead of the level at the turn of the year. Early this morning, the average was ahead a further 48.01 points, at 21,450.79. 'If there are still any doubters at this late stage, this should show that the book is closed on the recession and that sentiment should be on the upswing for the next year or two,' said Mr Alan Livsey, equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. Analysts said the rise reflected the decision by formerly cautious Japanese institutional investors to increase share purchases, as shown by a sharp rise in volumes. Yesterday, 850m shares changed hands, more than twice last year's daily average. Japanese institutions, absent in the early stages of the market's rise this year, have been encouraged by a recent string of good economic indicators, likely to be extended today when the Bank of Japan publishes its latest Tankan quarterly report on the short-term economic outlook. Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, marks the institutions' change of sentiment from last week's publication of Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey, showing that companies planned to increase capital investment by 1.1 per cent in 1994, the first rise for three years. 'Domestic institutions' confidence in the 1994 economy and the prospects for profits recovery has increased,' he said. However, analysts are divided over whether corporate Japan will show an earnings recovery this year. Japanese analysts tend to be less cheerful than foreign-owned ones. Sanyo Investment Research forecasts a 2.3 per cent profits decline, while Kleinwort Benson has a 20 per cent recovery. For this reason, share prices might fall back again in the next few months, warned analysts. World stock markets, Page 41</p>

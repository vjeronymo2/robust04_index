Autonomous </F> Okrug Intends To Secede from Arkhangelsk Oblast"]    [Text] Arkhangelsk -- Nenets Autonomous Okrug has  scheduled a referendum on secession from Arkhangelsk Oblast for  20 March. Okrug Governor Yuriy Komarovskiy has officially  informed Oblast Administration Head Pavel Balakshin of this  event.    The Nenets Autonomous Okrug (capital -- the city of  Naryan-mar on the Pechora River near its mouth at the Barents  Sea) was formed 64 years ago. Today it has 55,000 inhabitants  -- the overwhelming majority of the people are newcomers who  came to open up the north. Arkhangelsk geologists discovered a  major oil deposit on the territory of the okrug in the tundra,  called Ardalinskoye, which is being developed jointly with the  U.S. firm "Conoco."    The Russian Constitution, adopted 12 December last year,  equated Arkhangelsk Oblast with the Nenets Autonomous Okrug  within it -- they are now equal components of the Federation.  Proceeding from this legal base, the okrug leaders have  prepared a draft edict of the Russian president "On Measures of  State Support for the Socioeconomic Development of Nenets  Autonomous Okrug." The key point in this document is the  okrug's right to export 10 percent of all of the oil extracted  on its territory.    The draft edict, which has acquired the necessary agreement  by ministries and departments, has already reached the  president's reception room, but its subsequent progress has been  stopped in connection with an appeal by Oblast Administration  Head Pavel Balakshin.    "We do not interfere in political, financial, social, or  administrative decisions by the okrug's leaders," Pavel  Balakshin said. "But even according to the new Constitution,  Nenets Okrug is part of Arkhangelsk Oblast as a constituent of a  single economic area. And our economic ties should not be  broken if we are really thinking about the good of the people  living on our territories."    However, this dispute about petrodollars has pushed Neneth  Okrug's leadership toward separatism. Initially, it was only  elections to the okrug parliament that were scheduled for 20  March. But now the referendum on the secession of Nenets Okrug  from Arkhangelsk Oblast has been urgently added.</p>

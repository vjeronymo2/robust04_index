In reply to a question by a correspondent for the JORDANIAN  NEWS AGENCY in Washington, the responsible U.S. source, which  requested anonymity, said His Majesty King Husayn's recent visit  to the United States and his talks with U.S. President Bill  Clinton were successful. The discussions addressed ways to  promote bilateral cooperation.    Addressing reporters from 17 countries -- who are visiting  the United States at the private invitation of the U.S.  Information Agency -- the source said President Clinton's  administration greatly appreciates Jordan's stands, its genuine  desire for peace, and its efforts to achieve it in accordance  with UN resolutions.    The source added that Jordanian-U.S. contacts are  continuing,  pointing out that so far no specific decision has been made on  the size and nature of U.S. aid to Jordan.    The source said the decision of the U.S. Administration and  its allies to give a warning to the Bosnian Serbs was in line  with the desire of the U.S. public to end the siege on Bosnian  Muslims in Sarajevo and the need to end the war in the Balkans.</p>

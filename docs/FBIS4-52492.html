			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Acer Group, a leading  Taiwanese personal computer maker, will boost its investments in  Japan, including tie-ups with Japanese firms, the group's head  said Monday [9 May].    Stan Shih, chairman of the Taipei-based group, told a press  conference that the increased interest in the Japanese market  reflects growing sales of its PCs here. He said possible  Japanese partners in the planned alliance will be trading houses.    The group posted 400 million yen in sales in the  January-March quarter this year in Japan, almost equivalent to  that for the whole year of 1993. For the current business year  ending in March 1995, the group expects 10,000 units of sales  worth 2 billion yen.    Established in 1991, the far-flung group has bases in Asia,  Europe and the United States. The Japanese unit was formed in  1988 to handle marketing.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet activist Andrei D. Sakharov, citing recent arrests in Armenia, said  repression has resumed in the Soviet Union, according to an interview in U.S.  News &amp; World Report. He objected to the arrest of 12 members of the  Karabakh Committee, a dissident group in Armenia, in December and earlier this  month. "These arrests were absolutely unnecessary," Sakharov said. "The  committee had been providing invaluable aid and assistance" following the Dec.  7 earthquake in Armenia. He said the arrests have led to a "return of prisoners  of conscience" in the Soviet Union. As result, he said, plans for a human  rights conference to be held in Moscow in 1991 should be suspended.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Exclusive report by Grzegorz Schmidt from Kiev: </F> "Poland-Ukraine; Talks on Participation in `Partnership for  Peace"]    [Text] On 9 and 10 June 1994 the second session of  the Experts' Commission for Security Policy at the Consultation  Committee of the Presidents of Poland and Ukraine was held in  Kiev. The subject of the talks were issues related to Poland's  and Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for Peace"  program and the implementation of the "Treaty on Conventional  Armed Forces in Europe." The talks were presided over by  Lieutenant Colonel Jerzy Milewski and Anton Buteyko, who are the  chairmen of the Consultation Committee. During the  consultations the participants stressed the need for closer  cooperation in the area of security policy of both states.    The "Partnership for Peace" program is supposed to become a  new important element of the all-European (Euro-Atlantic) system  of stability and security, which is being established. It  ensures all participants equal rights, as well as excludes the  possibility of obtaining special rights by any state. The  "Partnership for Peace" opens new possibilities for bilateral  cooperation of the countries that take part in the program.    Poland looks upon its participation in the "Partnership..."  as a step leading to full membership in NATO. Ukraine  approaches this striving of Poland with understanding. The  Ukrainian party sees in the "Partnership for Peace" a  possibility for forming national peacekeeping rapid deployment  forces that might better cooperate with the NATO forces and  forces of other states. They would, among others, conduct  peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the UN or the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.    The commission noted with satisfaction the cooperation of  our  countries during the preparation of the presentation documents  within the framework of the "Partnership for Peace."    The parties stressed that military relations between the  Polish Republic and Ukraine are developing on the basis of  mutual understanding, respect, and partnership-like cooperation.  This is confirmed in working contacts between the Defense  Ministries, General Staffs, commanders of the various types of  the Armed Forces and military districts.    The Experts' Commission recommended to the Consultation  Committee that further initiatives aimed at strengthening  contacts between our countries within the framework of the  "Partnership..." program be backed.    The session of the Experts' Commission for Security Policy  was another stage in the implementation of the decisions of the  Consultation Committee; it was also a phase for implementing the  direction, set by the presidents of the Polish Republic and  Ukraine, for intensifying and deepening the Polish-Ukrainian  political and military cooperation.</p>

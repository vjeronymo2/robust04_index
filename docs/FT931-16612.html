			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Crisis manager at the NY Fed: The career of Gerald Corrigan 'WHAT you see here is what you get. There is no hidden story, no hidden agenda. There are no problems, no policy disputes. I am in excellent health. . . I have no interest in any kind of appointment with the Clinton administration.' It was with this characteristic bluntness that Mr E. Gerald Corrigan, the 51-year-old president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, yesterday discussed his decision to step down next August from one of the most influential jobs in central banking. The burly Mr Corrigan, at times verging on the emotional, insisted at a press conference that the chief reason for his decision was 'a strong desire to pursue a career in the private sector' after spending 25 years working in the Federal Reserve system. Wall Street, where he is highly respected, was inclined to take him at his word. He will leave behind a reputation as one of the most important fighters in recent years, protecting both US and international banking from systemic risk and playing a key behind-the-scenes role in preventing the 1987 stock market crash threatening the entire US financial system. However, this big, abrasive man, with a booming voice and a penchant for keeping his cards close to his chest, also has his critics. Some congressional Democrats have criticised his handling of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, while in the wake of 1991's Treasury bond scandal at Salomon Brothers the New York Fed was attacked for failing adequately to supervise primary bond market dealers. He is not a great friend of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman who nevertheless yesterday hailed his 'extraordinary career in central banking and public service'. A protege and close friend of Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr Corrigan said the timing of his announcement was predicated on his belief 'that the economy and the financial system are clearly on the mend in a setting in which the progress that has been made in winding down inflation is plain for all to see'. He admitted he intended to 'strap on my waders' and spend much of next summer fishing in the Madison River near 'a little place I bought out in Montana'. Asked to list his successes and failures, Mr Corrigan noted that he had helped to put 'the inflation genie back in the bottle'. He also claimed credit for getting financial institutions and market practitioners to focus on what he called 'the plumbing' of finance. And with a wry smile Mr Corrigan, a harsh critic of America's 1980s borrowing spree, also noted that 'debt is now a four-letter word again'. Looking back he admitted the 1987 stock market crash on Wall Street was 'a tough one'. He bemoaned the fact that the US budget deficit was so large and that 'we have been unable to develop a framework or the political will to modernise our banking system'. Mr Corrigan has also played an important international role as chairman since July 1991 of the Basle committee on banking supervision. He plans to continue for the forseeable future his work as co-chairman of the recently launched Russian American Bankers Forum, which is aimed at helping Moscow develop its banking system.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers publish  editorials and articles on 20 May in reaction to recent reports  on North Korea's food shortage and economic difficulties.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "North Korea is Hungry." The editorial  writes North Korea's economic crisis is becoming more apparent  citing the defection of the Yo Man-chol family and North Korean  loggers from Russia, Kim Il-song's request to an Indian  provincial governor for emergency food aid, and the news that  North Korea is not participating in the Hiroshima Asian Games.    The editorial comments that "although South Koreans  undoubtedly want to help compatriots when they even send aid to  Somalia, some people are concerned that the aid may only help  the Kim Il-song regime." Therefore, the editorial asserts that  "North Korea should convince the South that economic support  will benefit the people, not the party or the Army, by resolving  the nuclear issue as soon as possible."    Stressing that chaos in North Korea is not desired either by  the South, the editorial urges the North to withdraw the  confrontation policy and reconstruct the economy.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word  article by reporter Yu Sung-u analyzing the background of Kim  Il-song's request of food aid to India. Recapitulating North  Korea's decreased crops since the eighties, the article stresses  that the question is whether North Korea's system can endure the  food shortage.    The article cites an intelligence report stating that "North  Korea began to release reserve grain" and a contrasting analysis  that "North Korea is trying to secure enough food to prepare for  international and UN economic sanctions." The analysis notes  the fact that North Korea recently purchased low-quality rice  from Thailand but resold it to European countries and thus, the  food shortage is not so serious as to bring about a collapse of  North Korea's establishment.    Noting that the critical period will be before the corn  harvest in July and August this year, the article concludes that  we still have to wait and see if the slogan "Rice is communism"  will be paradoxically proven by the collapse of the system due  to food shortage.    HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial  entitled "Grievous Situation of North Korea." Listing the  series of recent incidents proving the economic difficulties,  the editorial deplores that Kim Il-song and his son are still  playing the nuclear game.    The editorial warns that if the diversion of nuclear  material  is proven by the International Atomic Energy Agency's ongoing  inspection, the UN Security Council will impose economic  sanctions worsening the situation. The editorial ends by urging  Kim Il-song to provide nuclear transparency as soon as possible  to save his establishment as well as his people.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "The North Korean Nuclear Issue and  its Food Crisis." Referring to North Korea's food shortage as a  result of North Korea's own style socialists economic system  and to North Korean defectors' remarks on the food crisis there,  the editorial says, "North Korean President Kim Il-song's  request for food aid and medicine from India shows that the  North Korean food situation has reached a serious point."    Referring to North Korea's decreased crops since the  nineties  and to South Korea's data on its worse crop production last  year, the editorial says, "North Korea says its food shortage is  due to cold weather and harmful insects, but the major factor is  its collective farming method. It is certain that if North Korea  continues to maintain the collective system, its agricultural  production will not be increased any more in the future."    Noting the North Korean Government's commitment that it will  make its people eat rice with meat soup, the editorial says that  if North Korea really wants to resolve the issue, it must remove  a wall of closure and join the international community to seek a  way for coexistence with others.    Referring to North Korea's decision not to participate in  the  Hiroshima Asian Games, the editorial says that "this clearly  shows that North Korea faces serious food shortage problems."  Also, the editorial says, "if North Korea abandons its nuclear  program and accepts the denuclerization on the Korean peninsula,  it can receive food and economic aid from South Korea and other  Western countries. North Korea should no longer adhere to the  nuclear development program, but return to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. Also it should solve the people's  clothing, food, and house problems first."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word  entitled "North Korea's Increasing Food Shortage Problems Show  an Ominous Sign." Referring to North Korea's serious current  situation caused by its food shortage and lack of foreign  currency, the editorial says, "South Korea must be prudent in  dealing with North Korea's situation, while making efforts to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue."    Referring to the major background of North Korea's failure  in  its agricultural policy and to its lack of foreign currency, the  editorial says that South Korea can provide grain aid to North  Korea if the nuclear issue is resolved as was done in 1991.  Predicting the bleak prospect of North Korea's grain production  for next year and noting the need for the ROK Government to  consider providing food aid to North Korea in the future when  North Korea abandons its nuclear development program, the  editorial then added, "the food shortage situation is not only  serious to the North Korean Government, but also to us. It is  highly possible that whether we want or not, North Korea may  collapse suddenly. Therefore, we must be thoroughly alert to  North Korea's possible provocation to plunder rice and oil from  Seoul.</p>

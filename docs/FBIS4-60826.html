			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Oleynik] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev has again called for the earliest possible meeting on  Bosnia with the participation of Russia, the United States, the  European Union [EU], and the United Nations. Such a meeting  "would help to consolidate the approaches" of the interested  sides, he said at a news conference following talks here with  Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. A. Kozyrev stressed  the role of the EU in settling the Bosnian conflict, which he  described as "a key factor."    As a representative of an EU member country, the Irish  minister supported the proposal to urgently sit down at the  negotiating table. "Once we get down to directly discussing the  problem it won't be so difficult to reach a common international  position," D. Spring noted, replying to an ITAR-TASS  correspondent's question on the closeness of the approaches of  Russia and the EU to this regional conflict.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Democratic Party, Panade, has accused  the Manica Province government of allowing foreigners to  register for the elections and then vote for the Mozambique  Liberation Front [Frelimo]. Cardoso Saide, Panade's deputy  national coordinator, says foreigners are being brought from  neighboring countries for registration in Mossurize, Manica, and  Barue Districts. In a communique sent to our Chimoio  correspondent, Saide said before the registration began,  Mossurize District had about 31,000 inhabitants, but now the  figure has risen to 98,000, most of them having come from  Zimbabwe. Panade urged all unarmed political parties, UN  Operations in Mozambique observers, and monitoring and  registration teams to be vigilant and report cases of that  nature, as these are likely to create serious problems during  the October elections. Saide said this is yet another delaying  tactic by the Frelimo government to prevent the upcoming  multiparty general elections from being free and fair. It has  not been possible to get comment from acting Manica Provincial  Governor Carlos Falcao and Henrique Munguambe, chairman of the  provincial National Elections Commission.</p>

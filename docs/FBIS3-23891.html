			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> Article by Vladimir Gubarev: "Dagestan; `Dead Season' in the </F> Republic"]    [Text] Dagestan beats everyone in Russia in the  number of proceedings instituted under Article 66--"terror"--of  the Criminal Code. The sum total in the last two years was more  than 50 terrorist acts.    Daring crimes are committed in Dagestan frequently, asserts  Colonel of Justice Gamid Dzharlayev, chief of the investigative  directorate of the former MB RD [Ministry of Security of the  Republic of Dagestan]. But attempts on the lives of prominent  figures--Magomed Suleymanov, a doctor; Abdurazak Mirzabekov, the  chairman of the Council of Ministers; Said Armirov, his deputy;  Gadiz Gadzhiyev, a member of the Constitutional Court; and the  murder of Toturbiy Toturbiyev, the chief of Glavdagenstroy, and  Arsen Bayramov and Bagautdin Gadzhiyev, candidates for the  Federal Assembly--are another matter. I connect these crimes to  the contradictions in the upper echelons of authority.  <H5>  Selection of Targets </H5>   Bagautdin Gadzhiyev was shot with an assault rifle in  Makhachkala on the eve of the elections. Toturbiy Toturbiyev was  brutally knifed in a room of the Hotel Moscow in the capital.    Arsen Bayramov, a Lezgin and a candidate for the Federal  Assembly, was also shot on the eve of the elections. The  circumstances of the death of his presumed murderer are very  questionable. He was arrested quickly, but, according to the  official version, he blew himself up with a grenade. What is  most curious is that he was able to contrive to do this, if you  believe the militia, sitting in a motor vehicle between two  employees of the law enforcement organs. In addition, he was the  only one to suffer in the motor vehicle.    Vasiliy Baronchuk, the deputy chairman of the presidium of  the Democratic Dagestan movement, himself a militia worker in  the past, thinks that these crimes are doomed to remain unsolved.    The KGB was notified of the preparation of the first attempt  on Bagautdin Gadzhiyev, then former minister of trade of the  republic, but it did nothing to prevent it. Five persons,  including Gadzhiyev, sustained injuries in a grenade explosion.  These and other terrorist acts were prepared professionally.  Their exposure could shed light on corruption in the higher  echelons.  <H5>  When the Upper Echelons Cannot Share the Spoils </H5>   "Even a simple road transport accident under conditions in  the Caucasus can be raised to the level of a national conflict,"  says Valeriy Beyev, the first deputy minister of Internal  Affairs of the Republic of Dagestan. "I am not an advocate of  emotional estimates, but in a majority of these cases we also  examine the political version of the murders. In the final  analysis, just what is authority? It is money, it is  positions...."    In 1992-1993, Dagestan received federal credits of more than  50 billion rubles [R] for the development of farming and  agriculture. They were distributed by the Supreme Soviet and the  Council of Ministers. Practically the entire leadership of the  republic had a bearing on this. As a result, the money went to  commercial structures--for the purchase of wine-vodka articles  and imported commodities.    The billions in credits that came from Moscow went to firms  that did not exist in nature. In the Khasavyurtovskiy branch of  the Agricultural Bank alone the negative balance was R30  billion. The secret of secrets in Dagestan is the credit chart.    "As for the connection between the recent murders and the  distribution of credits, there is a lot that is not clear here,"  asserts Valeriy Beyev. "What is bad is that even when we know of  the improper use of these credits, it is difficult to apply  sanctions. After all, there is no case of theft--the credit is  returned, and it is practically impossible to prove bribery.  Even when someone is caught red-handed, charges of provocation  can be made in court, and then the entire foundation of proof  breaks down."  <H5>  Witnesses Want To Live, the Victims--To Get Revenge </H5>   The problem of proof is also aggravated by the fact that  witnesses fear for their fate, but a mechanism for their  protection is lacking. Today, not one legislative act has been  adopted for the protection of a victim, a witness, or a worker  in law enforcement organs.    As a result of quick and effective measures, the MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in 1993 in Dagestan eliminated 22  armed groups that were engaged in plundering and highway  robberies. During the arrest of the latest band of this kind,  consisting of five persons, two assault rifles, three pistols,  and 14 hand grenades were confiscated. Both the local production  of arms as well as the transit trade is developing--the  proximity of the belligerent territories is having an effect.  But with respect to peaceful Chechnya, assault rifles can be  bought openly in the market two kilometers from the border.    [Begin boxed item]  <H5>  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI Dossier </H5>   Statistics on premeditated murders for Dagestan. 1992: Out  of  154 murders, 67 were solved; in 1993, out of 229, 140 were  solved. According to unofficial data, the number of those  murdered in the past year was about 500 persons.    [End boxed item]    According to data of the Dagestan MVD, some of the armed  groups that were disarmed in the Khasavyurtovskiy Rayon were  previously in the Avar People's Front imeni Imam Shamil, and  later they engaged in robberies. The local courts employed  sanctions only in 24 percent of the examined cases concerning  incidents of storing or employing arms.    The victims themselves frequently do not give true  testimony,  either out of fear or from a desire to take revenge  independently, believes Colonel Dzharlayev.  <H5>  Three Sources of Gunfire </H5>   More than 30 nations live in Dagestan. All of them are  natives, but the Avars and the Dargins are in the majority. This  situation was recorded in the past elections: Representation in  the new Russian parliament was acquired by the Avars (four  seats) and the Dargins (two seats). One seat each, owing to  party lists, was acquired by a Lak--the famous musician Murad  Kazhlayev (PRES) [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], and a  Russian--Semen Reshulskiy (Communist Party of Russia).    Besides the problems of representation in the local and  federal organs of authority, another question is acute in  Dagestan--land. There is not much land in Dagestan, and the  fight over it has always been distinguished by its ferocity. The  "free," that is, the flat lands that are suitable for settlement  are only "Kumyk" in Dagestan--in accordance with an unofficial  cadastre. But the more numerous Avar and Dargin populations are  counting on them, and also the Laks, who are leaving the lands  of the Chechen-Aukhovs [chechentsy-aukhovtsy] that they occupy.  And today's calm will not last long--until the spring sowing  campaign.    What strikes the eye is that the terror has been directed  against politicians who represent the small nations of the  republic. Gadiz Gadzhiyev is a Lak, Toturbiyev and Bagautdin  Gadzhiyev are Kumyks, Said Amirov is a Dargin, and Arsen  Bayramov is a Lezgin. Abdurazak Mirzabekov, the chairman of the  Council of Ministers of the republic, is a Kumyk. (The last  refused to run for the Federation Council. Did he behave  reasonably?)    In recent years, the "conflict of generations" was added to  the traditional contradictions. The key posts in the leadership  of the republic are occupied by those who come from the  nomenklatura or their successors. Relying on the strength of the  state apparatus, they successfully rivaled their competitors,  who accommodated themselves to market relations better than  they. The "new people," probably bet on Moscow, uniting around  Ramazan Abdulatipov. It seems that this party would like to lean  on the capital in the fight against local opponents. It is  precisely this way that the republic perceived Abdulatipov's  statement that the two candidates to the Federal Assembly were  shot for criticizing higher Dagestan officials.    In recent years, journalists and specialists have not ceased  to be amazed: All of the prerequisites for a conflict in  Dagestan are present: ethnic diversity, shortage of land, and a  low standard of living, but there is no serious bloodshed. The  people of the republic, where any conflict will inevitably be  transformed into a war of everyone against everyone, it appears,  are retaining the instinct for self-preservation. Apparently,  nothing can restrain the politicians from "sorting things out."  The forthcoming parliamentary elections in Dagestan in June will  show whether they are in a condition to stop.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 21 Mar -- UNIAN has reported that Ukrainian  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko on 21 March began his visit to  the Republic of Poland. On the same day he had a tete-a-tete  conversation with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski.  According to some information, they discussed the two sides'  views on the Partnership for Peace program joined by the two  states. After this, the foreign ministers signed a declaration  on the principles of forming Ukrainian-Polish partnership and an  agreement on protecting the graves and places in memory of  victims of war and reprisals.    Commenting on the results of the Ukrainian-Polish  negotiations and the agreement signed, Ukrainian Ambassador to  Poland Hennadiy Udovenko stated to a UNIAN correspondent that  the documents signed did not signify a union between Ukraine and  Poland. They did, however, make the declaration of strategic  partnership more specific. The ambassador's view is that  "Ukrainian-Polish relations are at a stage of stagnation and are  in need of a fresh impetus," in view of which he categorically  opposed the opinion of some of the Polish mass media that the  minister's visit was inexpedient ahead of the elections to  Ukraine's parliament. He considers the visit very topical  indeed.    Answering the UNIAN correspondent's question on whether the  issue of Ukraine possibly joining the France-Germany-Poland  geopolitical axis was discussed at the meeting, the ambassador  stated Ukraine was interested in this issue but Poland had not  decided yet.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Suharto criticised over rights PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday warned President Suharto of Indonesia that Washington was concerned about alleged human rights abuses in East Timor, which was annexed by Indonesia in 1976. The criticisms came despite the fact that Mr Suharto, in Tokyo as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, had requested that leaders at the Group of Seven summit should not link economic assistance to the human rights issue. Mr Suharto said his government would welcome an international fact-finding mission to East Timor, where there have been clashes between Indonesian troops and a pro-independence movement. The Indonesian leader has had a mixed time in Tokyo. On the one hand, attention has been drawn to the East Timor issue. However, Mr Suharto has also been congratulated for his 'moderate' leadership of the 108-member Non-Aligned Movement. Mr Suharto had hoped to address the G7 summit but had to be content with meeting individual leaders, including Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, who has agreed formally to convey the movement's concerns to the summit. Mr Suharto told US and Japanese officials that developing nations did not want to be left out of trade agreements fashioned by the leading industrialised nations. He also requested increased assistance from developed countries, particularly for environmental protection in countries experiencing rapid economic growth and accompanying severe pollution.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar sinks in chaotic market The dollar dropped on the foreign exchanges yesterday, in what some traders called the most volatile day for the US currency in many months, writes James Blitz. It slipped below DM1.50 for the first time in 17 months - a victim to heavy selling - after Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, said at the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich that he was unconcerned if the dollar went below that figure. That comment triggered heavy selling on Tuesday night and yesterday morning, with the dollar closing at DM1.4750 against the German currency in London trading. In the afternoon, the dollar recovered ground after Mr Brady retracted his comment, telling the Reuters news agency that 'we are not seeking to depreciate the dollar.' Other dealers said that the dollar's recovery may have been boosted by technical factors, with many traders suddenly finding themselves too short of the US currency. By the day's end in London, the dollar was at DM1.496 compared to a previous close of DM1.4980. But traders pointed out that it had oscillated through nearly three pfennigs in the previous 24 hours. In late American trading, the US currency was again weakening at around DM1.4935. Many dealers believe that the dollar will continue to encounter highly volatile trading in forthcoming days, with every chance that it will sink to its all-time low against the D-Mark of DM1.4430. Other analysts recall that the kind of volatility seen yesterday can sometimes herald a considerable change in a currency's fortunes, and at least one analyst remained bullish about the dollar. However, the overwhelming feeling towards the dollar in the market was bearish. Mr Christian Dunis, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London said: 'The problem of the day is to get the US economic recovery going. 'If that is at the cost of a weaker dollar, then so be it.' The other important action was in sterling/D-Mark trading, with the pound finishing the day over 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the previous night's close at DM2.8720. Sterling's losses were partly a product of the D-Mark's huge gains against the dollar. But many traders explained the pound's fall by uncertainty over the Bank of England's intentions on interest rates. Last Friday, the Bank shaved the rates at which it deals in longer-dated money. The expectation was that the Bank would signal a cut in base rates later. But this has not materialised, and one London-based analyst said that the Bank had left dealers trying to guess whether a cut was in the offing or not.</p>

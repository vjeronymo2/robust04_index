			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] On the political scene in Nigeria, the SKETCH  reports that the meeting of the Northern Elders Forum scheduled  to take place tomorrow, Saturday, in Jos, Plateau State of  Nigeria, may not see the light of day because the police have  been urged to stop such political meetings in all parts of  Nigeria. It notes that the Federal Government is taking this  measure because all political groupings remain banned in the  country for the time being. The paper however reports that the  police and the security agents are still searching for Chief  M.K.O. Abiola, who is declared wanted by the police for  allegedly declaring himself president last week.    This time, the DAILY TIMES and the TRIBUNE report that  Abiola  has escaped arrest again. The two papers say an informant told  the police that Chief Abiola was having a meeting with his aides  in the Surelele area of Lagos but on getting there they were  informed that he had left for an unknown destination 30 minutes  before the security operatives arrived at the meeting venue.    In another story, the TIMES reports that General Sani Abacha  has restated his regime's efforts to bequeath a new democratic  system to the nation through the Constitutional Conference,  which will begin on June 27. The paper says the Nigerian leader  has urged the organized private sector to solicit the support of  the international community to enable the government achieve its  objective towards a new democratic and economic order in Nigeria.    The GUARDIAN, reporting in the same vein, says Gen. Abacha  may have meetings with various interest groups next week to  discuss the political situation in the country and find a means  of resolving it through dialogue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 1 Jun (EFE) -- The Manuel Rodriguez  Patriotic Movement (MPMR), which abandoned the armed struggle in  1990, has asked the government of President Eduardo Frei for a  draft law to allow 300 of its militants to be exempt from  judicial proceedings.    MPMR leaders announced they will create an Orientation  Office  to gather information on "the situation of the militants living  clandestinely."    The announcement was made through a document released today  entitled "For the Normalization of the Life of Militants Who  Fought Against the Dictatorship" which is signed by leaders  Leandro Torchio, Cesar Quiroz, and Marcos Riquelme.    The document says that 34 MPMR of a total of 50 militants  who  escaped from jail under the Pinochet regime are living  clandestinely and that another 270 are wanted by the law.    "There are about 300 militants who did not go through  Pinochet's jails and who are being persecuted" said the leaders  of the MPMR--which is a splinter group of the Manuel Rodriguez  Patriotic Front (FPMR)--who in 1990 decided to join the  democratic life.    The FPMR, which was created in 1984, decided to continue the  armed struggle during the democratic government of Patricio  Aylwin (1990-1994) who was accused of continuing the military  policy.    The MPMR leaders believe it is necessary to legislate on the  situation of those who struggled against the military regime and  to establish the provisional release of those who have appeared  in court to resolve their situation.    They also recalled that the militants fought against a  regime  that was condemned for 17 years by the United Nations for  serious human right violations. They added that these people  only committed the crime of "not yielding in their struggle for  democracy."    The MPMR confirmed that Sergio Buschmann, actor and fugitive  from justice who escaped from a Chilean jail in 1987, will  return to Chile on 15 June accompanied by a U.S. lawyer.    Buschmann was arrested by the military regime for running a  covert operation to introduce an arms shipment in Chile in 1976.    Buschmann lives in Nicaragua and has decided to return to  Chile to face a trial which he hopes will create awareness over  the situation of the so-called former members of the resistance  against the dictatorship.</p>

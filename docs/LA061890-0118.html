			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 LIVE CREW IS SUED OVER 'PRETTY WOMAN'  </P> <P> The controversial rap group 2 Live Crew made an unauthorized derivative  recording of Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman," a lawsuit contends.  </P> <P> Acuff-Rose, a Nashville music publishing firm, said today it refused permission  to allow 2 Live Crew to record the song but a derivative version appeared on  the group's album, "As Clean As They Want To Be," the sanitized version of "As  Nasty As They Want To Be."  </P> <P> "It's not about talking dirty," said Acuff-Rose attorney Eddie Wayland,  referring to the suit. "It's about copyright infringement."  </P> <P> Named as defendants in the suit, filed in federal court, were band leader  Luther Campbell and band member Christopher (Fresh Kid Ice) Wongwon. The two  were also arrested in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., on obscenity charges last week.  </P> <P> Also named as defendants were band members Mark (Brother Marquis) Ross and  David (Mr. Mixx) Hobbs.  </P> <P> Acuff-Rose said it holds the copyright to "Oh, Pretty Woman" -- the song's full  title -- which was a major hit for Orbison, co-written by the late singer and  William Dees in 1964.  </P> <P> The 2 Live Crew album credits Acuff-Rose and the composers.  </P> <P> The Nashville publishing firm asked for unspecified damages and for the  forfeiture of all copies of the album.  </P></p>

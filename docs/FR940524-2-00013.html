These two hydropower projects are located on the Platte River in Nebraska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a motion filed by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI), and supported by other parties to the relicensing proceedings, FERC staff will host a two-day technical workshop on the hydrological model used in the RDEIS. Additionally, FERC staff will conduct two public meetings in conjunction with the staff's preparation of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The workshop and meetings are scheduled from June 8 through June 10, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FERC is also extending the comment period on the RDEIS until July 25, 1994, which is 45 days after the completion of the two-day technical workshop. This extension is also in response to the motion filed by the USDI, and supported by other parties to the proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Meetings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commission staff will conduct two public meetings for the Platte River Projects. The purpose of the meetings is to solicit public comment on alternatives to be addressed in the FEIS. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend the meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first public meeting for the Platte River Projects will be conducted on Wednesday evening, June 8, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the auditorium of the North Platte High School at 1000 West 2nd Street in North Platte.

Thursday's session will provide an opportunity for reviewers to fully understand the hydrology analysis but will not serve as a forum to debate the merits of the RDEIS. To enhance the productivity of the first day of the workshop, the Commission requests that any questions on the model the parties would like addressed be sent to our office via facsimile. The cover sheet of the facsimile should be addressed to Frankie Green at (202) 219&hyph;0125 or Mark Killgore at (206) 451&hyph;4980. Copies of all questions received will be made available at the workshop. If we complete discussion on the parties' questions on the hydrological model, we will begin discussing items scheduled for Friday. The meeting will still adjourn at 4 p.m.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second day of the workshop will be on Friday June 10, 1994, from 7:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. Friday's session will allow parties to clarify technical matters discussed in the RDEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Meeting Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of the meetings will be recorded by a stenographer, and all meeting statements (oral and written) will become part of the Commission's public record of this proceeding.

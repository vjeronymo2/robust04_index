			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UN orders tight Haiti blockade The United Nations Security Council yesterday unanimously ordered a near-total blockade of Haiti in a renewed bid to oust the country's military leaders and restore president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, Michael Littlejohns reports from the United Nations in New York. But the Council also gave members of the junta 15 days to avoid the measures by observing last summer's Governors' Island Agreement, on which they reneged. Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras had agreed to step down as commander-in-chief last October 15 in preparation for Mr Aristide's return. The new embargo would extend an existing ban on oil and arms shipments to include all trade except food and medicines. It would also freeze Haitian assets abroad.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: IBM plunges Dollars 2.8bn into red INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday unveiled its worst ever annual result. The world's largest computer manufacturer reported a Dollars 2.8bn loss for the year to the end of December, after huge restructuring and retirement benefit charges, and its first annual revenue decline since the end of the Second World War. Worldwide revenue for the year was Dollars 64.8bn, down 6.1 per cent from Dollars 69bn in 1990. IBM's net losses of Dollars 2.8bn included a restructuring charge of Dollars 3.4bn and an additional charge of Dollars 2.3bn for the future cost of health care benefits for IBM pensioners. In 1990 IBM made net profits of Dollars 6.02bn. The net loss per share was Dollars 4.95, after charges, compared with net earnings of Dollars 10.51 per share in 1990. The dismal results from one of the world's top manufacturing companies, reflect weak economic conditions and a major transition in computer technology that has taken a heavy toll on all of the industry's established leaders. Earlier this week Digital Equipment, the second largest computer maker, also reported heavy losses. '1991 was a disappointing year,' acknowledged Mr John Akers, IBM chairman. 'We were adversely affected by protracted worldwide economic weakness, competitive pressures and transitions within our product lines.' IBM's fourth-quarter results were even worse than Wall Street's pessimistic forecasts. Worldwide revenues of Dollars 22.1bn fell by 4.2 per cent from the previous year's Dollars 23.1bn. After a Dollars 3.4bn restructuring charge, which was higher than expected, there was a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.42 a share, compared with net earnings of Dollars 2.5bn, or Dollars 4.38 in the last quarter of 1990. IBM reduced its workforce by about 29,000 people last year, primarily through voluntary redundancies and early retirement programmes, Mr Akers said. This year it plans to continue to cut jobs at a similar pace. In December, IBM announced a broad restructuring of its worldwide operations that will give individual business units greater autonomy and accountability. However, it will be some time before IBM can realise any benefits from these changes, analysts said. Although it was difficult to find much good news in IBM's 1991 results, Mr Akers noted that the company's service business grew by 35 per cent. 'That portion of our revenue that is less subject to year-to-year fluctuations - services, software, rentals and financing - is 43 per cent of our 1991 revenue. IBM's computer equipment sales declined by over 11 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 13.7bn. Software revenues rose 8.5 per cent to Dollars 3.4bn. Revenues from maintenance agreements, rentals and financing were relatively flat. IBM told analysts it expected improved performance in 1992, with revenue growth 'in the mid-single digits'. Operating expenses and capital spending would decline from 1991 levels . 'Assuming some improvement in the current difficult and uncertain economic environment, we expect to increase revenue and improve cash flow and returns as the year goes on,' said Mr Akers. IBM's stock price fluctuated wildly on news of the results, plunging to a low of Dollars 92 5/8 from Thursday's close of Dollars 95 1/2 , rebounding to Dollars 98 1/8 and closing at Dollars 96 3/4 .</p>

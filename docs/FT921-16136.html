			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Monday Interview: Militant beneath the bourgeois - Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the Front National, speaks to Ian Davidson and William Dawkins A large pair of blackamoor figures, bearing candelabra lampstands, take pride of place in the sitting room of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the one-eyed ex-paratrooper who runs France's Front National (FN). They strike an ironic note, given the anti-immigrant policies of Mr Le Pen, president of Europe's largest extreme right-wing political party. But then everything about Mr Le Pen's comfortably bourgeois image, from his dark suits to his smoothly persuasive speech, contrasts with the content of his policies, which were condemned recently as an 'enemy of democracy' by Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister. Mr Le Pen runs his party - which he denies is extreme right wing - from a large and rambling second empire villa in an exclusive suburban enclave on the hills of St Cloud, looking out on a fine north-easterly view of Paris. Mr Le Pen did unexpectedly well in the 1988 presidential elections, with more than 14 per cent of the vote. His party - especially strong in the south-east of France and in areas with a large migrant population - looks like doing even better in next March's regional election, in which Mr Le Pen claims that the FN will secure more than 20 per cent of the vote. 'If the establishment had solved the problems facing the people, the people would feel content and would vote for the establishment,' he says. Indeed, Mr Le Pen seems to be so successful in his campaign to mobilise both the anti-immigrant and protest votes, that the traditional conservative parties have started to move sharply to the right in his wake. Central to his platform are anti-immigrant themes, similar to those pushed by like minded parties across Europe, such as Vlaams Blok, the Flemish nationalist party in Belgium and the neo-Nazi movement in Germany. Yet Mr Le Pen denies being a racist or xenophobe. Mr Le Pen is a large, fair-haired man, who was born in Britanny, where his father was a fishing skipper. Upstairs, in Mr Le Pen's comfortable study, reminders of his Breton origins are everywhere. The bookshelves are crowded with naval memorabilia, including models of a three-masted sailing ship and an Arab dhow. There is an outsize pair of coastguard binoculars on a tripod, which could be pointing in the direction of the presidential Elysee palace. On the mantlepiece are two handbound red volumes recording the many libel suits Mr Le Pen has fought and won. He has also lost some, and last year paid FFr1.4m (Pounds 143,000) damages and costs - a record in France - to groups representing concentration camp survivors and descendants, for having publicly dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as 'a detail of history'. In the rough and tumble of his early political career, which started in the 1950s with the Poujadists, the populist shopkeepers' party founded by Pierre Poujade, Mr Le Pen used to sport a black eye patch and khaki fatigues. Today, the military look has been discarded and Mr Le Pen projects an image of comfortable civilian respectability. Discoursing easily, with grandiose Gallic gestures, he attributes the FN's appeal to the crises of joblessness, industrial decline and urban violence, but above all to immigration. Mainstream parties have failed to tackle France's ills, he argues. 'Objectively, things are not all right in a country where you have 4m real unemployed, for to the 2.9m officially unemployed, you must add 1.1m who find themselves without productive work, in various traineeships, passing from an apprenticeship in knitting to an apprenticeship in English. 'Four million immigrants, 6m, no-one knows within a million. Their presence is felt in a negative way by the French because it is one of the causes of unemployment, but also of insecurity and more generally, of urban overpopulation, of the Babelisation of schools, and of the social security deficit.' He puts the cost of immigration at FFr250bn and the cost of unemployment at FFr300bn, without indicating where these figures come from or what they mean. Mr Le Pen's argument rambles on hypnotically, taking emotional rather than logical turns. The immigration burden has contributed to an economic decline, he repeats. 'One sees clearly that whole sectors of the economy have collapsed in our country; factories have been closed one after the other; the mines, steel, metal working, shipyards, the merchant navy, port traffic have all disappeared. Now electronics and office equipment are in collapse; tomorrow cars and aerospace will be under threat. The building industry is in trouble. 'The Socialist government has said for several years: 'don't worry, the recovery will come from the US'. Well and good, let's wait. Then it doesn't come - and it won't come, at least not tomorrow. What is going well, and advancing with giant strides, is the most terrible scourge of all time: Aids. Your compatriot, Jimmy Goldsmith, by the way shares my conviction that this is the most important phenomenon of the millennium  - so important that perhaps there will not be another. There is also the exponential growth of drugs.' He returns to immigration - Mr Le Pen's main stock in trade. 'We do not want to allow ourselves to be submerged by foreign immigration. It is clear that France is not a country of immigration,' he argues, meaning that France has never been accustomed to accept large numbers of arrivals. He goes on: 'We will undertake before the people to reverse the flow of immigration. That is to say we will organise the return to their own countries, in the most positive manner possible, those foreigners whom France neither needs nor wants.' In another proposal to reverse the immigrant flow, Mr Le Pen would tighten France's nationality laws, so that citizenship could only be inherited from a French parent, or acquired by naturalisation. This would have to be 'asked for, earned and granted'. He would thus revoke the right to citizenship which comes from being born in France. It is a mark of the way in which the respectable French right has swung behind the FN on immigration that former President Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now leader of the centre-right UDF group, advocates a policy on French nationality law - both on parentage and naturalisation - similar to that of Mr Le Pen. Mr Le Pen's claim that France is not a country of immigration does not square with the historical facts. The proportion of immigrants to the whole population - roughly 6 per cent - is broadly what it was between the wars and at the end of the last century; many of these earlier generations of immigrants became French. As a result, according to a recent calculation by Insee, the national statistical office, there are probably about 14m people in France who are either immigrants or have immigrant parents or grandparents; and 10m of them have French nationality. Whatever the actual number, Mr Le Pen claims that most of the immigrants in France have no right to stay because they entered the country illegally as a result of the laxity or complicity of successive governments over the years. There are 4.1m immigrants in France, of whom 1.3m have French nationality, say the latest official estimates. There are also believed to be significant numbers of illegal immigrants, for which there are, of course, no official statistics; a recent estimate puts the number in the Paris region at 200,000. Mr Le Pen's other stock in trade is defence of national sovereignty against the growing integration of the European Community. He lost his seat in the French national assembly in 1988, but has kept his seat in the European Parliament, as leader of the ultra-nationalist European Rights Group. He indignantly rejects President Francois Mitterrand's aspirations for a federal future in Europe, and in the name of the nation state denounces the agreements recently concluded in Maastricht. 'For me, the Socialist federal Europe, which I call the Europe of federasts, is a double perversity. 'The federal Europe which Maastricht is preparing for us in a sly and undemocratic manner, would perhaps have been a good idea in the middle of the 19th century. Today it is an undertaking which is obviously obsolete and absurd, since the two big world empires are in the process of breaking up.' He argues that it is easier to join a federation than to leave, and cites the case of Yugoslavia. 'The Europeans are obviously in disagreement over any issue of foreign policy,' says Mr Le Pen, 'and their divergences can only get worse'. On a recent visit to London he was heckled by left-wing demonstrators. But Mr Le Pen claims that he encountered many expressions of sympathy - and fellow feeling - from the British. He thought that a party like his would do well there, if it were not for the 'castrating' electoral system in Britain; and he confesses to feeling quite close to Mrs Thatcher.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1928 Born in La Trinite-sur-Mer, Brittany.

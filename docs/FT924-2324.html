			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Private View: Patriotism by another name - Sir Ronald Grierson is a European and a sceptic, but not a Eurosceptic THREE-QUARTERS of the British people, we hear, want a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Yet, according to another opinion poll before the Edinburgh summit which ends today, an astonishing 48 per cent of them don't know which way they would vote. The public senses that the EC summiteers are struggling up to a political watershed, yet is baffled. It seemed a good week, therefore, in which to buttonhole that urbane and cosmopolitan banker and captain of industry, Sir Ronald Grierson, before he took off for a little pheasant shooting in Scotland. For Grierson, as well as being a member of the intellectual jet-set - he is a former chairman of London's South Bank arts complex - was once himself a top Eurocrat, running the industry directorate in Brussels. He is thoroughly British: a lieutenant-colonel in the Black Watch, an SAS paratrooper, a well-connected Conservative of the old school - and he is German. He was born Griessmann in Nuremberg, Bavaria, (a fact he is not ashamed to record in Who's Who) where his Jewish grandfather owned a large paper mill. He went to the local gymnasium, to a lycee in Paris, to London and to Oxford. Over dinner at the Berkeley Hotel in 1943, with the help of an attractive girl and a telephone directory, he changed his name. He became a British citizen in 1946. He had been imprisoned by both sides during the war. Interned by the British at the start, he fell into German hands at the end after being badly wounded behind the lines. (He was rescued by his SAS commander.) He has lived in Italy, France, Switzerland and the US, as well as London. The day I interviewed him, he had just flown back from hearing Pavarotti at La Scala. If anyone could tell me what a good European should do, it was he. But first I asked him why he had kept his German passport. 'Some people think it's an affectation. It isn't. I just happen to believe that while you can change your passport, you can't change your nationality. I am German. I can't do anything about it. That doesn't alter the fact that all my grown-up life I have had only one loyalty, to Britain.' What does it mean to say you are German? 'I'm German in the ethnic sense,' he replied. 'It's not a thing I have always been very proud of. There have have been moments when it has embarrassed me, although at the moment it doesn't. Whatever the Germans are blamed for, I feel I must take some of that blame, even if it is very little.' He laughed. Did the reunification of Germany mean anything to you? 'I was not emotionally involved at all.' Are you embarrassed when you read about the rampaging of the neo-Nazis? 'One never likes one's fellow citizens to behave like louts. I feel exactly the same way when such things happen in this country. Germany is not the only country where it has happened, but one judges a revival of Nazi salutes and swastikas there much more harshly than one would in a country which had not had the same history. I think the jury is out. Everything depends on how the German government handles it - and I am impressed on the whole by how their governments have behaved since the war.' What do you say to the view that a powerful Germany can never be trusted again? 'I think the jury is out on that as well. I believe the German government has behaved extremely well so far - impeccably. As to what the future holds, who knows? But the EC is not necessarily the big bulwark in case of trouble.' Is there such a thing as national character? Sir Ronald would not be drawn. 'It is a term I have always been chary of using because it is an oversimplification. Very often, when one talks of national characteristics, one is really thinking of caricatures. 'But there are certain things which are quite peculiarly British, such as the anxiety which I think is bred into people at their public schools never to cause embarrassment. It is a very nice characteristic, but of course it can sometimes make you avoid important decisions.' He has described the establishment, by which he means the civil service mandarins, as an 'intimidating mafia'. Yet it is difficult to see him as the outsider he describes in his recent short book of memoirs, A Truant Disposition. Tall, elegant, courteous - he addresses you as 'Mr' - Grierson has a mandarin fondness for the qualifying phrase which clarifies his views but hides his feelings. His business career, beginning with SG Warburg and ending with GEC, included spectacular resignations from Harold Wilson's Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and from Brussels (he never believed in 'picking winners'). It was peppered with disputes with Whitehall because he refused 'to work the system'. Does being German give you an excuse for not conforming to standard upper middle-class norms? 'I have never thought of that and I have certainly never used it as an excuse.' Grierson describes himself as cynical and not easily provoked. I had heard otherwise. Do you simulate anger to secure objectives? Grierson was delighted. 'The answer, I'm afraid, is yes, unashamedly. It is what General de Gaulle used to describe as 'la susceptibilite payante'. The secret of Grierson's insouciance seems to be his inheritance from the sale of the family paper mill - and the complicity of his wife, Heather, formerly Viscountess Bearsted. They have allowed him to switch back and forth between careers with the result - though he says it causes him no regret - that he never reached the top job once forecast for him. I asked him what kind of Europe he would settle for. 'I would settle for a Europe of fatherlands, the Europe des patries of General de Gaulle,' he said. There were only two objectives for the EC: economic prosperity and peace. The common market was an attempt to create the prosperity, but peace would depend on the Franco-German alliance, which he considered the principal achievement of the Community, and the Nato umbrella. But isn't economic interdependence itself supposed to be a guarantee of peace? 'Its importance can be over-rated. There are still big differences of approach which are usually papered over by some rather expensive and fairly sordid compromises - and that, no doubt, is what's going to happen at Edinburgh this weekend.' The Europeans were not ready for political union, he said. 'My friends who disagree say Europe is in a mess. But if you are in a mess, you don't necessarily jettison the existing political system and opt for one that has not been tried. I think co-operation between politically sovereign countries still works very effectively. I do not see why we have to have new institutions to adopt a common foreign policy. What is wrong with Europe remaining a group of nation states, co-ordinating their foreign and defence policy in the same way as is done at the UN and in Nato?' Is your objection to political union pragmatic, or are you afraid it will destroy something you value? 'No, it is largely practical. If I woke up tomorrow and found an extremely effective European government had come into power by some miracle, I do not think I would be emotionally disturbed. But I do not see how we are going to get there in the foreseeable future.' It should be said that Grierson is a committed 'Atlanticist'. The anti-Americanism he found in Brussels was one reason for his quitting the Commission. He has served on a number of US boards and was briefly a gentleman peanut farmer in Georgia, not far from Jimmy Carter's estate. 'You see, the thing that is missing in all this is European patriotism; and I do not see us finding one to co-exist with our national patriotisms. It will certainly not happen as a result of organising a European arts festival to celebrate the British presidency in Edinburgh] It is from history, from looking back at battles fought and won - or fought and lost - that people have obtained this feeling.' You say that, I objected, but you carry two banners yourself. 'I told you at the beginning. My entire loyalty is to Britain. I happen to be a German who is loyal to Britain. I admire the German government but I have no loyalty to it. I want to make that clear.' If there were a referendum on Maastricht, how would you vote? The question seemed to catch him unawares; it looked as if I had found a high-ranking Don't Know. Grierson mused a while, and said: 'Well, I would want to help the government. Then there are people in the anti-camp with whom I would not want to be photographed, so to speak - though, of course, it is always an honour to be photographed with Margaret Thatcher,' he added hastily. 'So I would probably, with great reluctance, with my fists clenched as it were, vote Yes.'</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Multitone shares dip on losses warning Multitone Electronics blamed delays in a distribution agreement taking full effect and the introduction of a new product for the expectation that it will report a small loss for the six months to October 30. Shares in the communication systems company fell 18p to 105p. The market had been expecting profits of Pounds 1.7m for the year to April 30 1994. However, with the company predicting second half profits comparable to the same period last year it is thought that there should be a small overall profit.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Ontario ends interest in Suncor THE PROVINCE of Ontario has ended a controversial and costly 12-year foray into the energy industry by unloading its remaining 14 per cent stake in Suncor, a large Canadian oil and gas producer. Ontario Energy Corporation, a provincial agency, yesterday sold its 7.6m Suncor shares to two securities firms, RBC Dominion Securities and ScotiaMcLeod, at CDollars 25.25 (USDollars 20) per share. Total proceeds are about CDollars 190m. The shares are being re-sold to institutional and retail investors. Suncor's controlling shareholder is Sun Co, the Pennsylvania-based energy producer, with a 67.6 per cent stake. Ontario's involvement with Suncor dates back to the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the province paid about CDollars 650m for a 25 per cent stake. As a net consumer of oil and gas, Ontario was eager to have a window on the production side of the business centred in western Canada. But the subsequent fall in oil prices, coupled with mediocre management, have badly dented the value of Ontario's investment. Suncor suffered a CDollars 228m loss last year, largely as the result of a CDollars 360m restructuring charge. The province's eagerness to realise whatever value it can from Suncor has been compounded by a yawning budget deficit. Ontario last year cut its stake in Suncor from 25 per cent to 14 per cent as part of the wider effort to contain the budget shortfall by selling assets. Suncor is an integrated company, with businesses ranging from a tar-sands oil recovery plant in Alberta to a chain of filling stations.</p>

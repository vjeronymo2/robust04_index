			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 26 (AFP) -- Russia is not setting any  conditions for its membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace  (PFP) programme, but will still await the alliance's response to  its proposals for cooperation before signing up, Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev said Thursday [26 May].    He presented a set of propositions to the North Atlantic  Treaty Alliance Wednesday on cooperation, notably on creating a  mechanism for consultation on security in Europe and throughout  the world, and on increased military and political cooperation.    A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that the Russian  minister proposed levels of participation proportional to  Moscow's military weight, indicating an enthusiasm exceeding all  expectations.    "We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in  the PFP, but Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the  NATO source said.    But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations  between Moscow and NATO on European and world security.    He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic  meetings with NATO at all political and military levels.    The Atlantic alliance is resisting any formal commitment to  such consultations.    "NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard  (right of influence) or even worse a veto over its activities,"  NATO deputy secretary general Sergio Balanzino told a press  conference Wednesday.    Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested  that NATO was willing to accept the evolution of a "constructive  and substantial dialogue" if Russia embraced the military  partnership.    But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations  with Russia, although it did not rule out a less formal  declaration when Moscow signs the PFP.</p>

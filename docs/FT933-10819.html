			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / People: Barclays refocuses on Far East Despite the recent losses suffered by investment banks trading in Japanese equities, Barclays has reinforced its commitment to the Far East - and the links between operations of its BZW investment banking arm in London and Tokyo - with a series of appointments in Britain and Japan. The most senior move is the appointment of Ben Grigsby, the group's country manager for Japan, to the new post of deputy chief executive for the BZW markets division responsible for sales and distribution of BZW services. He is being rewarded for managing Japan through a difficult trading climate. Grigsby will be joined in London by Saburo Shinoda, the president of Barclays Trust and Banking in Japan, who will become a director of BZW and lead a team trying to improve BZW's services to Japanese corporate and institutional customers. The moves will take place from September 1. In Japan, Callum McCarthy will become group country manager in addition to his role as chief executive of Japan Barclays Bank. Peter Fenichel, managing director in BZW's debt capital markets unit in London, will move to Japan as president of BZW Securities there, and still run global private placements. The interlinking of operations between London and Tokyo might surprise competitors such as National Westminster, which has withdrawn from Japanese equities after suffering losses. But McCarthy says BZW has a big enough spread of securities businesses to balance equities losses last year. McCarthy says BZW - which has overall responsibility for Barclays operations in Japan - 'looked carefully' at its operations there before reinforcing the links. It thinks the combination of strong trade flows and a high personal savings ratio will provide plenty of business opportunities.</p>

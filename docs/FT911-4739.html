			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Tippett's Byzantium - Carnegie Hall, New York Sir Georg Solti ends his 22 seasons as conductor of Chicago Symphony with a concert Otello (Pavarotti singing the title role for the first time) and with the premiere of Michael Tippett's Byzantium, commissioned jointly by Carnegie Hall and the Chicago orchestra to mark their centenaries. After Chicago performances, both bills have come to New York (where both will be recorded), for two performances each. Byzantium had its Carnegie premiere on Monday. Yeats's poem, five stanzas of chiselled, charged imagery, is generally read as a parable of artistic creation; in a preface to the score, Tippett writes of 'artefacts enshrining values that can be set against the impermanence of the everyday world and the complexities of the human beating heart.' Other readings in other lights are possible; in one of them, Nietzsche seems uncomfortably close. Familiar Yeats images reappear: the Emperor; the Tower; the bird from Sailing to Byzantium, 'of hammered gold and gold enamelling,' singing now a more terrible song; the purging fire, 'flames begotten of flame'; finally 'that dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea'. Tippett's piece, which lasted 27 minutes, is not so much a 'setting' of the poem as a tone-poem, for soprano and large orchestra, based upon it. The score follows the five-stanza structure, dividing them with instrumental passages. Words, lines, isolated syllables are freely repeated; the bird 'planted on the star-lit golden bough,' which 'can like the cocks of Hades crow,' breaks into a page of unaccompanied 'cocorico]' Tippett writes of the 'challenge in setting the verbal imagery to music' but also finds licence in Yeats's lines 'Those images that yet/Fresh images beget' to let his own musical imagination fly free and create abundantly. As in the poem, familiar images reappear: deep, complicated, pregnant chords recurring as punctuation; little tonal fanfares bright against alien harmony; episodes of linear scurry and flurry; near-reckless cantilena. I'd like to say that they are used with a precision, economy, and discipline to match the poet's. After one performance, I feel unsure. The piece sounded different from what the printed score had led me to expect: more constantly loud, insistent, and busy, without the episodes of gentleness suggested by pages of two-part invention, or merriment in episodes marked 'light, dancing'. Well, the performance may have had much to do with that. Sir Georg was an eager, insistent conductor - unrelaxed, never playful - and the Chicago Symphony is a tense, high-powered precision instrument. The vocal writing calls for a Flagstad - a soprano who combines amplitude and majesty with the bright swiftness that Flagstad brought to Grieg's Haugtussa cycle. It was composed for Jessye Norman's voice and lies mostly on the staff, with A-flat or A as the high-climax notes, just two passing B-flats, and eloquent recourse to the lower register that is Miss Norman's special glory. But ('for personal reasons', the announcement said) Miss Norman withdrew, and Faye Robinson - who is billed for the Prom premiere of Byzantium, in September - took over. She is a conscientious and attentive interpreter, and a 'creator' in The Mask of Time. She is not yet 50. But her soprano is an imperfect instrument - not full, ample and shining in its flow, but weak in the lower reaches, and under stress pushed, unsolid and impure. And in Carnegie scarcely a word that she sang could be caught. So this can be only a guarded, not a 'rave', review. But that Tippett's invention is still afire, that the poem has stirred him to create 'images of abounding, generous, beauty', is not in doubt. And that, of course, is enough, and more than enough. Later performances, more refined and various, less unrelentingly emphatic, will reveal whether Byzantium is, as I think it may be, more than confirmation and consolidation of its composer's unfailing creativity: a late masterpiece that, like Schutz's and Verdi's late masterpieces, breaks new ground.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Russian power sale proposed RAO, the Russian state-controlled electricity company, would be split up and its power stations restructured into a series of competing companies under proposals being considered by the Russian government. KPMG Management Consulting of the UK, which drew up the proposals as part of a European Union sponsored study, acknowledges the system would lead to price rises for consumers. This is in part because it would enable subsidies to be eliminated. However, the proposed structure would help reduce costs and stimulate investment needed as power demand increases later in the decade, it says. It could also provide a framework for the industry's full privatisation, although KPMG believes that is not essential. So far about 20 per cent of RAO's shares have been offered to workers and private individuals. The country's 72 local distribution companies which also generate some power themselves, have been established as joint stock companies with some shares distributed to the private sector. However, RAO still owns majority stakes in most of them. RAO also runs the country's largest power stations. KPMG's system, which draws heavily on the UK electricity industry structure, says RAO's large power stations should be formed into independent generating companies.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;  </P> <P> FORMAL, SENSUAL MOODS PERVADE IN MALE NUDE PHOTOS  </P> <P> Ah, the male nude.  </P> <P> From the classic proportions of Greek sculpture, to the gathering power of  Michelangelo's "David," to the amputees and dwarfs by contemporary photographer  George Dureau, the male figure has been portrayed variously by artists  throughout history.  </P> <P> At the Photowest Gallery downtown, the more decorative aspects of form prevail  in an exhibit of 42 images by San Diego photographers David Eliot and Jeff  Palmer. Called "Interpretations of the Male Nude," the exhibit of black and  white photographs might also be titled "Formal and Sensuous" or "Warm and  Cool."  </P> <P> Eliot takes a cooler, more formal, tack, while Palmer approaches his subject as  an object of sensuousness.  </P> <P> Palmer applies light and shadow to draw attention to well-muscled physiques or  to portray a mood. Torsos ripple with sharply defined muscles. Tousled heads  abound. Most of the moods are reflective.  </P> <P> In one print, a row of thin, vertical shadows stripe the chest and face of a  model, lending a feminine quality and a pensive mood. Soft lighting bathes  another reclining model, his back arched before a black background, with the  head thrown back perhaps in ecstasy.  </P> <P> Most of Palmer's work is attractive without being compelling. In one case an  image works better upside down.  </P> <P> A supine model lies in darkness with his head nearest the lens and feet  farthest away. The arms are outstretched. Oddly enough, the picture, which had  been hung upside down, has more power when inverted. When viewed upside down,  it calls to mind Icarus flying through the dark.  </P> <P> The least interesting pieces by Palmer, such as one in which hazy daylight from  a window washes a man deep in thought, resemble saccharine gift cards.  </P> <P> Palmer's strongest image is of a man standing by a French door. The unforgiving  rectangular patterns of windows and the hard glass make a sharp contrast with  the vulnerable, naked body.  </P> <P> By comparison, Eliot takes a more formal approach in his nude studies. He  positions his camera and crops his photographs primarily to focus on the body's  various lines and shapes.  </P> <P> A portrait taken from a low angle suggests a Greek statue. His close-up of a  torso is an intimate study of the curving lines of chest, biceps and haunch.  </P> <P> One full-frontal image of a black man is at odds with most of Eliot' work. The  model radiates power and tension from the crossed arms to his flexed shoulder  muscles and broad thighs.  </P> <P> Positioning the camera slightly above another model's hips, Eliot's portrait is  a study in the symmetry of a sturdy back, the hips and upper thighs.  </P> <P> "Interpretations of the Male Nude" continues at the Photowest Gallery, 744G  Street, Suite 205, through June 30.  </P></p>

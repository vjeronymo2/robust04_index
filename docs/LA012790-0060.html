			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INJURED SMUGGLER BETRAYED BY TELL-TALE X-RAY  </P> <P> The stocky Colombian man of about 30 did not look much different from the other  air crash victims at North Shore University Hospital as Dr. Robert J. Ward  prepared to operate on him early Friday morning.  </P> <P> Like other passengers of Avianca Flight 52, the man had suffered severe  internal bleeding and numerous broken bones. But as the surgeon prepared to  treat the intestinal wounds, he discovered round shadows shaped like  suppositories on X-rays of the man's digestive system.  </P> <P> Before operating, Ward asked the still conscious man about the contents of the  what seemed to be small packages. The man confirmed what Ward already suspected  -- the packages were actually neatly tied latex condoms that contained cocaine.  </P> <P> "We noticed that his intestines were filled with golf-ball sized packages, from  his large intestine to his rectum." Ward said. "We asked him what it was  because it could possibly contaminate his system. He told us it was cocaine."  </P> <P> Eventually, Ward would pull four condoms from the unidentified man's rectum. As  of late Friday, about 10 more condoms remained inside the man's intestines. In  all, Ward estimated that the man carried more than a pound of the white powdery  substance in his digestive tract.  </P> <P> (According to the Los Angeles Police Department, a pound of cocaine would have  a street value of about $170,000.)  </P> <P> Ward said that the remaining condoms were not removed to "let nature pass its  course." Because of the effects of the operation, the condoms may not pass  through his digestive tract for weeks, Ward said. If one of the packets leaks  or bursts during that period the patient would be in serious danger of dying  from cocaine poisoning. However, it was considered too dangerous to remove the  packets now.  </P> <P> Hospital officials said the air crash victim likely ingested the cocaine-filled  condoms before boarding the Avianca flight in Colombia. "They were fairly  professionally packaged," Ward said, adding that the man probably used enemas  to clean out his colon before swallowing the condoms.  </P> <P> The man was out of surgery late Friday afternoon and was expected to live,  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The four packages were handed over to Nassau County police, hospital officials  said.  </P> <P> Drug Enforcement Administration officials confirmed that the white substance  found in the condoms was cocaine. They also said that earlier reports claiming  two other passengers who died in the crash were also smuggling cocaine were  incorrect.  </P> <P> DEA spokeswoman Mary Cooper said drug smugglers often try to conceal up to a  pound of cocaine in condoms, by swallowing and then excreting it, or concealing  it in body orifices.  </P> <P> "There have been instances where we have arrested people and then waited at a  hospital for them to excrete (the bags)," Cooper said.  </P></p>

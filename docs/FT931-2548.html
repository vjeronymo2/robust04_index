			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Australian growth at 2.5% The Australian economy grew by 2.5 per cent in the 12 months to the end of December, bearing out campaign claims by the re-elected Labor government that a steady recovery is under way, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. The independent statistical service said its average measure of gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter. It also revised GDP growth in the September quarter to 0.8 per cent from 0.5 per cent. The figures mark Australia's fifth successive quarter of growth since the end of the 1990-91 recession. However, the annualised growth rate was only slightly higher than the 2.4 per cent recorded in the 12 months to September.</p>

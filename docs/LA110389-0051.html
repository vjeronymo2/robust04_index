			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CALARTS MUSIC FESTIVAL TO BRING AUDIENCES EAR-TO-EAR WITH THE UNEXPECTED  </P> <P> Musicians will seat themselves before contraptions with names such as the  Roland D-10 Digital Sampler and the Akai S 700 MIDI. Electronic sounds will  fill the air, mixed with carefully timed recordings of cars honking and crowd  noises.  </P> <P> If this sounds like music for Future Shock, it is.  </P> <P> The fourth annual SCREAM Festival at CalArts on Saturday will be a rare forum  for electroacoustic composers who write new types of music both for traditional  instruments and burgeoning electronic technology such as computers and MIDI  keyboards.  </P> <P> Theirs is a largely ignored world of composition that lies someplace beyond the  environs of the Hollywood Bowl and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> "People are used to certain kinds of expectations, both in terms of the  performance situation and the music they're hearing. All of us grow comfortable  with the norm," said Barry Schrader, a professor at CalArts in Valencia and  director of this year's daylong festival. "When you're dealing with things in  contemporary electroacoustic music, you very well might come face-to-face with  the unexpected.  </P> <P> "I think that's part of the adventure of art."  </P> <P> Schrader founded SCREAM (Southern California Resource for Electro-Acoustic  Music) four years ago because he wanted some sort of organization for  contemporary composers who don't have many outlets for their talents.  </P> <P> He rounded up professors from USC, UCLA, Harbor College and Cal State Dominguez  Hills and Cal State Northridge. In 1986, the groups began presenting an annual  festival at various sites to coincide with American Music Week.  </P> <P> This year's gathering at CalArts will offer prerecorded, pre-programmed music  and live performances. Also -- in keeping with CalArts' eclectic tradition --  the festival will include dance performances, video presentations and an  installation artwork.  </P> <P> "I thought I'd take advantage of the people and facilities that are here,"  Schrader said.  </P> <P> The music will range from Roger Bourland's "Portable Concerto No. 2 for Flute  and Tape," a more traditional piece, to Craig Naylor's "Hokshichankiya," a  tribute to the Sioux Indians that is composed entirely of recorded animal  noises -- wolves, coyotes, various owls, crickets and red-tailed hawks.  </P> <P> Acclaimed pianist Dolores Stevens will perform, as will the California E.A.R.  Unit, one of the most recognized new-music ensembles in the country.  </P> <P> Four dance performances will be set to new forms of music, as will several of  the video presentations. Among the videos will be Reynold Weidenaar's sound and  video tribute to the "heavy stone architecture" and "spidery structural steel'  of the Brooklyn Bridge.  </P> <P> "Some of this will be enormously different from what most people are used to .  . . probably a lot of it will be enormously different," Schrader said. "The  reason I started this festival was to put the spotlight on people who have been  lost in the shuffle of traditional performances."  </P> <P>  The SCREAM Festival will be held from 1 to 7 p.m. Saturday at CalArts, 24700  McBean Parkway, Valencia. The installation art and some music performances are  free. Tickets for other performances are $6 and $3 for students and seniors.  All-day passes cost $15, $7.50 for students and seniors. For information or  reservations, call (805) 253-7800.  </P></p>

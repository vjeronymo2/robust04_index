The fighting is between the movement's two main ethnic  groups, the Mandingos, who support ULIMO leader Alhaji Koromah,  and the Krahns, who are loyal to Gen. Johnson.    Gen. Johnson and his supporters launched a dawn attack on 25  March on Tubmanburg, the ULIMO headquarters, which he claims he  has taken control of.    "We have total control over Tubmanburg and are currently  dislodging the remnants of the Mandingo fighters who are still  hiding there," Gen. Johnson stated.    According to him, the attack launched on Tubmanburg at dawn  on 25 March aimed at preventing the Mandingos, Alhaji Koromah's  supporters, from killing Krahns and other tribal group members.    These accusations were denied today by Major Sekou Kromah, a  close associate of Alhaji Koromah. He also denied that Johnson  has taken control of Tubmanburg and stated that "fighting is  continuing there."    At the beginning of March, a series of clashes between the  Krahns and Mandingos led to the death of about 200 ULIMO troops.</p>

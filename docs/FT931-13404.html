			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firm but below the day's best REKINDLED hopes for an early cut in UK interest rates continued to flourish in the London stock market yesterday but shares lost heart towards the close as government bonds shaded lower. At the high point of the day, the FT-SE Index came within six points of regaining the 2,800 mark. By the close, however, the gain had been cut to 7.9 for a final reading of 2,781.2. The final hour of trading saw sharp reversals in some share prices on what some analysts regarded as uncertain investment grounds. The underlying tone of the stock market remained relatively confident, underpinned by good turnover volume. A return of investor attention towards the second line issues was reflected in a gain of 9.8 on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index for a close of 2,909.0. Retail, or customer, interest in equities has remained high this week; Thursday's retail business touched recent daily average highs at a total of Pounds 1.49bn. The week has seen share prices moving nervously against a troubled background of Middle East hostilities and domestic economic uncertainties. The stock market turned higher at the end of the week as the announcement that UK unemployment had risen to nearly 3m, together with doubts on Christmas retail sales and falling industrial output, alarmed the City and inspired hopes that base rates may be cut in the near future, rather than in the March budget. Share price gains on Thursday and yesterday have left the FT-SE Index 16.1 points up on the week. Equity strategists were in two minds yesterday. A cut in base rates would be good for equities and also strengthen hopes for an economic revival. But an early reduction would smack of economic desperation, as well as storing up trouble in terms of inflation, as well as for the impending funding in government bonds. UK gilts were down by about one quarter of a point throughout yesterday's session, with trading fairly subdued as traders weighed the outlook for sterling as it extended the loss of the previous session. Sharelink, the execution-only broker which claims the lion's share of UK private investor business, said yesterday that its clients had remained buyers of UK equities this week, as they have been since December. Store and retail issues remained subdued yesterday as sector strategists assessed the implications of this week's news on Christmas sales. Banks conventionally immediate beneficiaries from interest rate cuts, moved ahead.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alla Prozorova, kray administration press </F> service: "Are the New Power Rates That Terrible?"]    [Text] Contrary to the opinion that has set in--not  without help from the mass media--the Maritime Kray economy is  currently being strangled by factors other than electric power  rates. This thesis was advanced yesterday by kray Vice Governor  Sergey Demin in response to rumors circulating in the kray  regarding the expected increase in electric power and heat rates.    As proof he showed the percentage of January-March  expenditures on electric power in the totality of components  comprising the production cost at major kray enterprises. The  Bor Association--7.7- 8.5 percent. The Khrustalninsk Tin  Production Joint-Stock Company-- 5.9-9.5 percent. The  Slavyanskiy Ship-Repair Plant--3.6-9.6 percent. The Ussuri  Locomotive Repair Plant--1.72-1.38 percent. The figures show  eloquently, said the vice governor, that what is ruining the  economy is the other "flank." That is, first, high taxes--most  of them federal, as the president of the Russian Federation said  in his message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the  Russian State." Second, the wages paid by an enterprise that  respects its workers. Since the mandatory minimum wage of 14,632  rubles [R] cannot be qualified as respect for labor (and this is  the figure built into the labor remuneration fund), the  enterprises are compelled to take the necessary extra  remuneration out of the profit part, which is subject to  additional tax on profit. And third, rail transportation rates  that are too high.    In the latter case, a closed-loop circle of financial  problems analogous to that in other sectors is at work.  Therefore, the most likely solution lies in reducing the tax  burden imposed by the government on producer enterprises, and  correspondingly, increasing output.    "So far, I have not seen," said Sergey Demin, "any  government  documents on the subject of repealing a certain decree, No.  1001. There is a document on procedures for forming rates, which  gives the regions the right to set them. The kray administration  will do its best the keep down as much as possible electric  power rate increases. But objectively, as in the rest of the  world, this is very difficult to achieve, since prices for  components--fuel, materials, and transportation--change."    Elaborating on the trends, Sergey Demin recalled that in  keeping with Decree No. 1001, subsidies for Maritime Kray to  deal with the energy problems were set at R17 billion in 1993.  Over the winter the kray managed to add to this amount another  R111 billion (a total of R128 billion). This money permitted us  to "survive" until spring. Because Maritime Kray enterprises owe  the energy sector more than R200 billion for electric power and  more than R100 billion for heat. So, despite the share of  electric power costs not exceeding 6-12 percent of production  costs, enterprises do not pay energy suppliers for months. This  situation will lead to a catastrophe within the next five-six  months: The kray will not be ready to ensure the supply of heat  for itself by the 1994-95 winter season.</p>

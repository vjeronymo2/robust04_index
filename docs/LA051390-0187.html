			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONCE FEARFUL, U.S. RETAILERS HEAD OVERSEAS IN SEARCH OF GROWTH;  </P> <P> RETAILING: DOMESTIC COMPETITION IS DRIVING THE NEW GLOBAL STRATEGY, BUT  LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS CAN BE HURDLES.  </P> <P> Starved for a burger in Malaysia? Try the local McDonald's. Want a carton of  milk or a rice ball in Japan? Stop by 7-Eleven. Looking for a Barbie doll in  West Germany? Head for Toys R Us.  </P> <P> A handful of big-name American retailers have, for years, pushed their  well-known trademarks into promising overseas markets. For just as long,  though, most U.S. merchants were cool to the idea, partly because there was so  much business on American soil.  </P> <P> Now the migration abroad is gaining momentum. More American retailers, less  fearful of the daunting hazards of international business, are expanding,  launching or at least considering outlets abroad, particularly in  English-speaking countries and Japan.  </P> <P> Two key reasons, experts say, are stiff competition and the dwindling number of  good locations for new stores in this country. Slow population growth in parts  of the United States also plays a role.  </P> <P> "For many retailers to grow, they're going to have to go off-shore," said Clark  A. Johnson, chairman of the Pier 1 Imports chain.  </P> <P> Added McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling: "The growth potential outside the  U.S. is almost infinite."  </P> <P> American firms with international cachet are also being drawn abroad by foreign  investors. Among them are such upscale clothiers as New York's Barneys and  Charivari, which have teamed with Japanese partners. And Saks Fifth Avenue was  auctioned last month to a Mideast investment group that said it wants to expand  the chain internationally.  </P> <P> Much more of the increased foreign activity involves U.S. franchising  companies. While giants such as McDonald's continue to expand aggressively,  their ranks overseas are being joined by smaller franchisers including Woodland  Hills-based California Closet Co. and Irvine-based Mr. Miniblind.  </P> <P> Still, the flow of U.S. stores into foreign markets is more of a trickle than a  flood. For instance, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the  International Franchise Assn., only 374 of the estimated 2,500 to 3,000 U.S.  franchising companies have ventured outside this country. Many merchants are  wary of the considerable risks and mindful of how Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and  J.C. Penney encountered problems and sold off some European and Latin American  stores in the 1970s and 1980s.  </P> <P> Consumer products companies such as Coca-Cola have been way ahead of U.S.  retailers in going overseas, mainly because they deal with the public through  distributors and other intermediaries who are familiar with local customs and  tastes. Retailers face the trickier task of dealing directly with fickle  consumers.  </P> <P> "It's easier to export an individual product than a whole ball game," said  Michael Gould, president of the fragrance maker and retailer Giorgio Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> Apparently for similar reasons, not many foreign retailers have come to these  shores, aside from such notable exceptions as Benetton, which sells apparel,  and Gucci, the luxury goods firm.  </P> <P> "The Europeans haven't made major inroads. It's just little boutiques," said  Neil Thall, an executive with the consultants Kurt Salmon Associates.  </P> <P> Like many other U.S. retailers, Johnson, who directed the Wickes home  improvement stores in Western Europe in the early 1970s, said he isn't  interested in taking Pier 1 overseas until the home furnishings company  exhausts its opportunities domestically.  </P> <P> There are good reasons for that posture: U.S. merchants face formidable  obstacles overseas. Many worry about restrictions on exchanging currency and  pulling out profits, along with foreign taxes.  </P> <P> Clothing retailers must adjust to foreign sizes, styles and quality  preferences. In Western Europe, for example, dry cleaning is very expensive, so  shoppers tend to buy goods that require less care. J.C. Penney bombed in  Belgium because it relied on American merchandise, said Walter Loeb, a New York  retailing consultant.  </P> <P> Store owners sometimes are hard-pressed to acquire good locations because of  high real estate costs. In addition, companies accustomed to big U.S. stores  that attract customers who drive from miles away can be stymied overseas by bad  roads and the lack of freeways.  </P> <P> Retailers who need to buy supplies in their new overseas markets often must  deal with multi-tiered, old-boy distribution networks. "It's the biggest shock  that American retailers have when they go overseas," said Pier 1's Johnson.  </P> <P> These distribution networks are a particularly stiff barrier for supermarket  operators and discounters, which operate on low profit margins and need to buy  supplies as cheaply as possible.  </P> <P> Retailers are hampered by other restrictions that generally don't exist here.  In West Germany, shops generally close for the weekend on Saturday afternoon.  Japan has locked out Toys R Us, one of the most successful international  retailers, with a law giving local retail councils veto power over big new  stores. Partly as a result of last month's U.S.-Japan trade accord, the  Paramus, N.J.,-based company hopes it can enter the Japanese market next year.  </P> <P> "In every country we've entered, we have had some degree of resistance," said  Robert C. Nakasone, a Toys R Us vice chairman.  </P> <P> By far the biggest barrier, however, is language. During negotiations with  foreign partners, misunderstandings often arise, even in places where English  is widely spoken.  </P> <P> An executive with Southland Corp., parent of the 7-Eleven chain, said he was  surprised by the puzzled looks he drew from a group of English-speaking  investors in Hong Kong when he touted the importance of providing convenience  for customers.  </P> <P> Only later did he learn that, to his hosts, a "convenience" meant a restroom.  (Ironically, Southland's Japanese partner has made an offer to buy the slumping  Dallas company.)  </P> <P> Some experts worry that too many U.S. firms, particularly budding franchise  companies, are getting into the international arena without enough research.  </P> <P> "It's not a matter of what works in the United States works everywhere else,"  said Edward Kushell, a Los Angeles consultant and past president of the  International Franchise Assn.  </P> <P> Even big, successful franchisers have failed in foreign ventures. The  expansion-minded Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppes chain saw its batter-fried  codfish flop with the fish-loving Japanese. ("Too much of a greasy taste,"  explained a company spokesman.)  </P> <P> Kushell said that all too often, franchise companies are prematurely drawn into  overseas deals by foreign investors who offer up-front cash. The problems, he  said, crop up later when the foreigners discover that the U.S. franchisers lack  the training and operating know-how to support a big expansion in an unfamiliar  market, raising the prospect of costly lawsuits.  </P> <P> In one respect, however, franchise companies are well-suited for international  business. Accustomed to working with franchisees with ties to their individual  markets, these companies are sometimes more flexible marketers.  </P> <P> McDonald's, which has built its international reputation by serving Big Macs  and french fries worldwide, also offers pasta salads in Italy, wine in France  and McSpaghetti noodles in the Philippines, which resembles a popular local  dish.  </P> <P> Non-franchise retailers usually team with local partners or with licensees that  run the operations but make royalty payments to U.S. firms. Almost universally,  native managers are hired to run the stores, although American advisers may be  used in the early stages.  </P> <P> Loeb, the retailing consultant, predicts that improved computer systems that  enable retailers to track sales closely at far-flung stores will encourage more  companies to test overseas markets.  </P> <P> Still, even the U.S. retailers that are among the most experienced in foreign  markets find it difficult to get started in a new country, largely because of  language barriers and regulatory demands.  </P> <P> "It's going to take you three or four times longer than you thought it would. .  . . It takes a lot more patience than many U.S. businesses have," said Lewis P.  Maddox, a new area development manager for Southland.  </P> <P> Retailing experts say the companies that fare best abroad tend to have a  special approach, product line or international cachet. A case in point is the  jeweler Tiffany &amp; Co., which has stores in London, Zurich, Munich and Hong  Kong, along with 10 domestic outlets.  </P> <P> Another widely cited example is Toys R Us, which has thrived overseas largely  because of its vast selection of playthings, competitive prices and its focus  on one line of business, Nakasone said.  </P> <P> Units, an innovative women's- and children's-apparel chain, recently cut a  partnership deal to enter Japan. Said company President Milt Schulle: "You have  to have something special to sell."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SELECTED U.S. RETAILERS IN FOREIGN MARKETS  </P> <P> Store: Southland (7-Eleven parent)  </P> <P>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'OUTPLACEMENT' COUNSELORS;  </P> <P> HELPING SOFTEN THE BLOW OF HITTING THE PAVEMENT  </P> <P> After Jim Easton was told last year that his services as president and chief  executive officer of a ceramics firm were no longer needed, his company hooked  him up with an "outplacement" counselor to soften the blow and help him find  another job.  </P> <P> The counselor, from Irvine-based Executive Horizons, helped him feel "less  fearful of what's going on in the outside world. He gave me a road map, a  helping hand," said Easton, now an entrepreneur with his own business in San  Diego.  </P> <P> Easton is grateful that his former employer gave him someone to talk to.  </P> <P> "Usually you're in a situation where you're being dumped, and it doesn't feel  good," said Easton, who asked that his real name not be used.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increasingly Popular  </P> <P> Outplacement companies such as Executive Horizons, which also has offices in La  Jolla and Los Angeles, number at least 200 throughout the country and are  becoming increasingly popular among both employers and employees, according to  personnel service experts.  </P> <P> Companies may not be responsible for finding new jobs for the people they fire,  said Charles D. Bearden, Executive Horizons' president and founder, but "they  feel it's a good move, it promotes good feeling in the existing employees . . .  and it minimizes the risk for legal action that is so prevalent in California."  </P> <P> People sue employers for wrongful termination for hundreds of reasons, said  William K. Ellermeyer, president of the Ellermeyer Co., a career development  and outplacement firm recently acquired by Lee Hecht Harrison of New York.  "They sue because of age discrimination, or sometimes it's sex discrimination:  'You fired me and you hired a woman.' "  </P> <P> An argument may not always hold legal water, Ellermeyer said, but often it will  get the sympathy of a jury.  </P> <P> "I think people very often sue when they're angry, when they think no one  cares," said Rex Olsen, an Executive Horizons vice president. He said his  company's services reduce an employee's anger, fear and anxiety.  </P> <P> Increased litigation costs were also cited by Jan Thompson, senior vice  president at Drake Beam Morin, a New York-based career management and  outplacement company that is widely regarded as one of the founders of the  industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Half a Million for Jury Case  </P> <P> "One local law firm that I work with here (in San Diego) tells me that an  average settlement out of court for a wrongful termination lawsuit is $100,000,  and that doesn't include the cost of depositions. If it gets to jury it's  almost half a million dollars," Thompson said.  </P> <P> Most common are lawsuits in which an employee claims the company failed to  honor an employment contract, said San Diego labor attorney Rich Paul.  </P> <P> "I think the most common mistake that employers make is that they do not sit  down in advance and prepare the case against (themselves). . . . How is the  employee going to claim he or she was mistreated? Can we say with confidence  that we have gathered all the facts . . . and that they really warrant this  discharge?  </P> <P> "Many wrongful discharge cases are filed not so much challenging the grounds  for termination as challenging the way in which it was accomplished," Paul  said. "The very big dollars in wrongful discharge cases have come where the  jury finds some kind of . . . abusive conduct and the jury literally gets mad  and awards substantial punitive damages."  </P> <P> The increasing number of mergers and acquisitions has helped improve the  visibility of outplacement in the past five years, said Bill Stone, president  of SoCal Personnel Services in Kearny Mesa and president of the California  Assn. of Personnel Consultants. "Obviously, when one (company) acquires the  other, there's going to be positions that no longer fit, there's going to be  duplication."  </P> <P> "They're popping up all over," said Lee Rollins, manager of employee and  organization development at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. "I'm contacted on a  regular basis by outplacement firms wanting to do business with us."  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E maintains that few people will lose their jobs in the utility's  proposed merger with Southern California Edison, but outplacement in some form  will be offered to those who do.  </P> <P> Jerry Smith, vice president of personnel for Computer &amp; Communications  Technology in Kearny Mesa, a manufacturer of recording heads for computer disk  drives that recently laid off many employees, said a valuable aspect of  outplacement is that it provides technical advice on how to get the next job.  </P> <P> "In general, I find that many people don't understand . . . that securing  another job is a job in itself," he said.  </P> <P> Outplacement gives flexibility to firms wishing to make staff changes and sends  a positive message not only to remaining employees but also to prospective  employees. It can also help salve management's conscience.  </P> <P> For the employee, outplacement often boosts his or her damaged self-esteem.  Executive Horizons starts by reviewing a person's case with company management  to make sure the employer will "protect the dignity of the client as much as  possible," Bearden said.  </P> <P> "Where will the termination take place? Have all of the facts been gathered?  What will the termination pay be? Will his benefits continue and for how long?  What will the individual be told and who will do the telling? We want to make  sure that the employer has covered all of the necessary bases and that they are  going to conduct this in as dignified an environment as possible."  </P> <P> Employees are asked to complete a written assessment of themselves,  concentrating on successes in their career and work-related preferences. The  next step is a three-day workshop in which an Executive Horizon counselor helps  the employee clarify or focus his objective.  </P> <P> Resume preparation and extensive interview training are also included, as are  lessons on telephone interviewing, using time effectively, keeping records and  how to construct a network of business contacts for job hunting.  </P> <P> For its services, Executive Horizons charges 10% of an employee's annual  salary. For example, to terminate an employee who earns $50,000 a year could  cost the company $5,000.  </P> <P> Thompson, of DBM, said her company also helps identify trouble spots in the  layoff process. For example, some people deal with termination by "crying in  their beer and telling others what an SOB their company is and blowing their  references," she said. A company can also use the wrong words when terminating  someone and wind up facing a lawsuit.  </P> <P> "You will have every level of emotion, the full spectrum, from the very stoic  person who expected it to happen to the person who expresses surprise and  breaks down," Bearden said. "It's important that the terminated person . . .  understands that he or she is not in a unique situation but that this happens  to many people and there is life after his current employment."  </P> <P> Most companies offer outplacement services only to upper managers, Bearden  said.  </P> <P> "Not everyone who is terminated is a bad employee," said Rollins of SDG&amp;E.  "There are various reasons an individual is 'downsized,' " a term Rollins used  to describe an employee laid off because of corporate cutbacks. "The  probability of using outplacement is slim or none for someone we outright  fired."  </P> <P> Rollins said outplacement counselors from a series of firms are brought in to  give customized help to terminated SDG&amp;E executives and high-level managers  earning $75,000 or more a year. Those managers earning less are told they can  go to an outside outplacement firm for help -- usually a two-day seminar on  job-hunting tips -- at SDG&amp;E's expense.  </P> <P> For people who are "way below that, we still provide them with some kind of  outplacement counseling, but instead of one-on-one, we do it in a group,"  Rollins said.  </P></p>

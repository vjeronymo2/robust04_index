He said that "the aim of his  visit was further consolidation of cooperation and friendship of  Albania with Malaysia and Brunei. Albania and Malaysia,  although geographically far from each other, have similarities  that unite them spiritually. Both countries have a religious  pluralism. The different religions in Malaysia and Albania have  in full harmony among them. The two countries have had a  difficult past and backwardness. Malaysia has successfully  overcome this period and is one of the countries which is  considered a miracle for Southeast Asia with regard to  development." Mr. Berisha said that "the secret of development  of Malaysia is not in its great resources, but in the wisdom of  the people of Malaysia, their untiring work, their discipline  and determination to develop a market economy." Mr. Berisha  added that they had signed several agreements, that on economic,  cultural and technical cooperation with Malaysia, an agreement  to lift double taxation, another for payments and the guarantee  of investments. "I think that the agreements signed between  Albania and Malaysia create a sound basis for a powerful  cooperation between the two countries. Malaysia voiced its  readiness to help Albania in the field of construction,  telecommunications and infrastructure.    Malaysia has a great interest in the business with Albania  with the aim of making investments in this country. About 50  Albanian students are studying in Malaysia and some of them were  going on very well with their studies in the university," Mr.  Berisha continued.    Regarding the visit to Brunei, Mr. Berisha said that "it was  a short working visit, during which we discussed development of  relations between our two countries. I may say that His  Majesty, the sultan, and the ministers whom we met, showed great  interest in various projects, especially in communication and  infrastructure. We presented there a number of projects which  will be studied by the Investments Agency in Brunei and later, a  decision will be adopted on respective investments. Albania and  Brunei are two small countries but with great possibilities of  cooperation."</p>

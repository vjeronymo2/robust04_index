			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Observer: Up the poll Is Bob Worcester, ubiquitous chairman of pollsters MORI, taking refuge in an ivory tower so as to ponder the lamentable failure of his 'science'? Hard on the heels of the polling industry's election reversal, the London School of Economics is making Worcester visiting professor of government - his contribution will be a year's worth of lectures on public opinion. 'He was very keen to come,' says an LSE spokesman, adding that the institution's social scientists might have some valuable input into his line of market research. Many a political scholar would be quicker to acknowledge Worcester's business skills than his academic talents. Honorary visiting professor of journalism at the City University (since 1990) is one thing, they sniff. But visiting professor of government . . . His students will eagerly await his considered conclusions on the lesson of April 1992 - a rather more honest assessment, it is to be hoped, than the version so far doled out to the country at large.</p>

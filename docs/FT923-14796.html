			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Crawling back to the future If we are now watching a replay of the 1930s, as fashionable pessimism has it - and I find it strangely uncomfortable to be in tune with the fashion - it is a replay in slow motion. The great bull market is over, but it is a sag rather than a collapse; unemployment is rising, but it is only a third of the way up to its peaks 60 years ago; the financial markets are shrinking, but there are no falling bodies. The question now is whether a dispirited system will retrace the paths first hacked out by the survivors of complete demoralisation. These led to protectionism to preserve jobs; to officially encouraged cartelisation; and to tight financial regulation, eagerly embraced by an industry desperate to re-establish its respectability. The idea that such unfashionable ideas should become official policy may still seem unthinkable, but the preconditions do not look so implausible. They are first, that job protection should become the dominant political issue - as it already is for French lorry-drivers and farmers, and for the new populists in Germany and Italy. Second, the pains of competition must seem greater than its rewards, a view already reflected in stock market valuations. The politicians are still involved in the agenda of the 1980s, seeking freer markets and lower inflation, but the voters are making it ever harder to persist. For the financial markets, the issue is simpler. Once they are seen to be unable to raise primary capital, as they were in New York after the 1929 crash, reform becomes a necessity. This is already the case in Tokyo, where the scandals which have frightened outsiders away are still multiplying. It seems, more puzzlingly, to be happening in London, though on the face of it more from distrust of present price levels than of the institutions which set the prices. Across the Channel, and in New York, where the bulls looked convincing until last week, the picture is not yet nearly so bad. All the same it is difficult for a Londoner to believe that the drift - call it the long cycle, if that is the way your mind works - is indeed back towards the past. The economic situation argues for it: it is hard to imagine a plausible recovery strong enough to banish disillusion. The state of the City points the same way. The parade of scandals might be dismissed as the ugly jetsam which is left behind by every falling financial tide, were it not for the damage they have done and continue to do to the prestige of the whole system, and to any surviving faith in self-regulation. To start at the top, the Bank of England's dithering over BCCI, the DTI's attempted evasions over Barlow Clowes, and now the PM's censoring of the Bingham report look like wise-monkey strategy, not so much a cover-up as a belief in least said, soonest mended. It leaves the authorities looking weak and evasive. The clearing banks look not so much weak as weak-minded after their eager pursuit of bad loans. City 'experts' can plead that their fatuous optimism about the outlook for the economy and for profits was officially inspired, but not for errors like Polly Peck. It is a vista of incompetence, or worse. There is incompetence and worse in the insurance market. The troubles of Lloyd's make good popular reading, like a Royal marriage; but the society's sauve-qui-peut response to the crisis looks like old yuppy greed gone stale. And now, as new premium demands drop through ordinary letterboxes, people will realise that you do not have to be a name to suffer from bad underwriting judgment. The picture presented outside is not of criminality, as in Tokyo, but of over-paid, under-regulated and gutless foolishness, which may be even more damaging in the long run. And we are only at the beginning. The press has turned investigative instead of fawning. When the true cost of life, household and car insurance is more widely known, and if savings and pensions are eroded by slow-footed investment management, the last defences will be down. Whatever happens to the economy, the City is likely to need a self-defensive clean-up.</p>

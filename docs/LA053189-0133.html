			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FACTORY ORDERS POST INCREASE OF 2.7% IN APRIL  </P> <P> Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods rose 2.7% in April, the best  showing in four months, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable goods climbed  to a seasonally adjusted $239.4 billion last month after rising 0.7% in March  and dropping during the first two months of the year.  </P> <P> April's increase reflected higher demand in a variety of industry categories,  and would have been even stronger were it not for a 15.8% drop in defense  orders, which are subject to wide swings depending on when big contracts are  signed.  </P> <P> Excluding defense, all other orders were up 3.6% in April after falling 0.3% in  March and 2.7% in February.  </P> <P> April's upturn in factory orders was in line with other recent reports on the  economy's performance which analysts say suggest that while growth is slowing,  a recession is not imminent.  </P> <P> It was the strongest gain since a 4.7% increase in orders last December.  </P> <P> In the volatile transportation category, orders rose 1.4% in April after  jumping 11% in March and falling 7.6% in February.  </P> <P> Excluding transportation, all other orders were up 3% last month after falling  during the previous two months.  </P> <P> Orders for non-defense capital goods, meanwhile, posted a strong 6.1% gain in  April after rising 2.5% in March. That category is considered a good barometer  of business investment plans.  </P></p>

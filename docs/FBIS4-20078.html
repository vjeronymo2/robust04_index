			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by K. I. Angelopoulos: "Will Mr. Papandreou Accept </F> the `Offers' From the United States?"]    [Text] As was expected, in Washington the other day U.S.  President Bill Clinton asked Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  to cooperate with the Turkish leaders on the "solution of  disputes" between the two countries. "This is the most suitable  time" for this the U.S. President said and, of course, he did  not fail to mention the Cyprus issue along with Greek-Turkish  affairs.    The way in which Mr. Clinton linked these issues merely  confirms formally that Turkey has now raised the question of an  Aegean-Cyprus "package" and that the U.S. leaders have clearly  accepted this with the consent of the State Department and the  Pentagon.    Although he was extremely careful with his words at the  joint  news conference, Mr. Clinton let it be known that, according to  Washington, normality in the Greek-Turkish relations is  necessary because Turkey is now faced with a most acute economic  and political problem. The U.S. President asked the Greek side  not only to proceed with a dialogue with Ankara ("in return" for  some concession by Turkey on the "confidence-building measures"  in the Cyprus issue) but he also asked his interlocutor that  Turkey be helped to develop its ties with Europe. In short,  yesterday the White House and U.S. diplomats asked Greece to  participate in the "rescue operation" for faltering Turkey.    According to what is being said behind the scenes, Mr.  Clinton linked Greek-Turkish affairs directly to Balkan issues  that are of interest to Greece, particularly to the increased  role Greece could play in this region from now on in cooperation  with the United States. The U.S. President let it be known  that, in Washington's opinion, the "open wounds" our country now  has in the region do not "favor" the development of this role,  which cannot be undertaken unless Athens is a trustworthy  interlocutor with its neighboring countries....    So, for the United States the normalization of Athens'  relations with Ankara is somehow the "key" to opening the gate  of the Balkans to Greece under U.S. guarantees.    If Greece wants to have a good political and economic  position in the southern Balkans without any problems on its  northern borders it should--in the U.S. view--certainly agree to  discuss the Aegean "problems" with Ankara, open the road to the  European Union for Turkey and, of course, accept a "solution" to  the Cyprus issue in the spirit of "political equality"--which is  an Ankara-Denktas demand--so that the path to the indirect  recognition of the pseudostate in occupied north Cyprus will be  open.    There has been no answer by Mr. Andreas Papandreou to what  Mr. Bill Clinton said publicly the other day about Greek-Turkish  affairs. The prime minister merely listened to what the U.S.  President said.    What does this silence mean? Is it that Mr. Papandreou did  not accept the logic of his interlocutor about Greek-Turkish  affairs? Or is he discussing this argument without having  decided yet? Only on the Cyprus issue did Mr. Papandreou have  something to say:    He agreed that the acceptance of the "confidence-building  measures" by the Turkish Cypriot side would be a very happy  event in the search for a solution to the problem. However,  what will happen to the "package?" Mr. Clinton did not conceal  the fact that the Aegean-Cyprus issues were discussed with  [Turkish] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who visited him in  Washington with careful timing a few days ago. As we already  noted, the U.S. President does not conceal the fact that he now  agrees with the view that Turkey must "be saved" (which of  course is also the view shared by Greece's strong partners in  the European Union).    How the Andreas Papandreou government will react to these  most critical issues will soon be evident in both the Cyprus  developments and in the level of (whatever) "communication"  there is with Ankara. Mr. A. Papandreou knows very well since  the other day what Mr. Clinton's "offers" are and what Mr.  Clinton demands "in return." The bad thing for the Greek side is  that the U.S. "offers" are not in the field of the Greek-Turkish  relations, where only Greek concessions are demanded. On paper  at least, Mr. Clinton is offering Greece a good Balkan position  (Washington also needs this to succeed in building a strong  Balkan "corridor" to separate Germany and Turkey).    However, this position is impossible without Greek  "sacrifices" in Greek-Turkish affairs. At the same time, Mr.  Clinton can maintain in his discussions with the Greeks that  Washington is treating Athens politically better than the  European Union does, since it counts on Greece in the Balkan  issues. He may also maintain that Turkey's situation now is so  bad at all levels that the opening of an Athens-Ankara dialogue  would not necessarily mean immediate Greek concessions on major  points of "dispute" in the Aegean....    U.S. diplomacy appears to expect some "spectacular" movement  in the next few days by the Turkish Cypriot leaders on the  Cyprus issue, assessing that something like this would give Mr.  A. Papandreou an "alibi" for ending Greek objections to a  Greek-Turkish dialogue. A close associate of Mrs. Ciller  already went to Nicosia yesterday to confer with Rauf Denktas.  The next few weeks or days might see a lot of things. After  his visit to the United States, Mr. A. Papandreou is obliged to  proceed with significant decisions for the country.</p>

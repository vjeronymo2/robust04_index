			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: German stores see earnings decline Two of Germany's leading retail groups yesterday forecast lower profits this year, blaming falling disposable incomes and hot summer weather for the setback. Earnings in Karstadt's shops and department stores deteriorated in the first half, although its NUR travel bureau business saw bookings and turnover rise more than 20 per cent. Kaufhof said sales on a like-for-like basis were lower than forecast and down on last year. Neither group provided earnings details in interim reports issued yesterday. Turnover in Karstadt's shops and department stores fell 5 per cent after adjustment for increased selling space, while its travel business rose 16 per cent. Mail order sales at the Neckermann subsidiary slipped almost 4 per cent. However, group turnover rose 28 per cent to DM12.3bn (Dollars 7.7bn) due to the first-time inclusion of the Hertie concern. Average prices within the group were 1.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Kaufhof, which has expanded vigorously, yesterday announced it was to shuffle the management teams at the holding company and Kaufhof Warenhaus, its department stores subsidiary.</p>

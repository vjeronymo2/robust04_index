			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak announced on a visit  to Krakow that the present wave of strikes was an added argument  for the government against abolishing the tax on the planned  growth of wages.    [Begin Pawlak recording] If we are talking about abolishing  wage controls, then, in a situation in which we have seen such a  widespread strike action, those in favor of such a step being  taken quickly and without any further safeguards are left  without arguments.    We respect all trade unions in an equal manner. We do not  intend to single out any of them, and we are keen to resolve  problems.    Yesterday was a good day and a good example. These talks  were undertaken with the participation of all important trade  unions, which are cooperating within the framework of the  tripartite commission. It has turned out that, when very varied  milieux are represented in these direct talks, those that are  very involved in traditional industries, those that are financed  from the state budget, the teachers and the health service  employees, then the exchange of opinions within the trade unions  themselves makes it possible to understand the situation better  and to find solutions.    It also turns out that the government is not the only party  that should take all of the actions that are required. The  tripartite commission, attended by Solidarity and other trade  unions, accepted that, as a first step, on 4 May, three matters  would be discussed: the law on wage control, initial income tax  installments, and a timetable for introducing laws concerning  the pact on enterprises.    The protests are not justified on such a large scale, nor is  the dramatic involvement of the planning departments of our  industry. All the same, however, they show very clearly how  great the people's impatience is that these difficult matters be  resolved. This is a sign for us. I believe that we need a  sincere dialogue. [end recording]    This was an excerpt from a statement by the prime minister,  who was in Krakow today and took part in a meeting of the  management from the national fire service and voluntary fire  brigades.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Degtyarev: "Three Misfortunes in Russia: </F> Fools, Roads, and Taxes"]    [Text] The chief misfortunes in present-day Russia  are three: fools, roads, and taxes. Taxes, moreover, are looked  on as a misfortune not only by the economy, which has been  assessed to the max, but also by the government, which has been  utterly unable to collect them and so keeps coming up with new  ones.    The three misfortunes seem primordially given us. Let us  turn, for example, to the era of Ivan the Terrible, since just  like our blessed perestroyka, it developed smoothly into a great  Time of Troubles.    Over the third quarter of the sixteenth century, sovereign  assessments increased by a factor of 10. The peasantry answered  this increase with a massive curtailment of taxable  landholdings, moves, and wholesale flight to the south--to the  frontier. The government parried the popular challenge with  edicts on enserfment and a new increase in collections. By the  beginning of the seventeenth century, the situation had become  absurd. A landholding that had been worked for half a century  before by a single peasant now came to accommodate 150  households. Not that each of them began to till less; the tilled  fields simply became secret, and so not subject to the heavy  tsarist assessment. To put it in modern terms, the economy  became substantially a shadow economy. As a result, many fewer  taxes now reached the treasury. And the government, in the  person of the expanded departmental apparatus, never tired of  devising more and more new assessments. All kinds of money was  collected: from the Strelets special military corps, from  colonists, from town dwellers, from convicts, gross taxes, road  taxes, and so on and so forth.    The state just couldn't get rich, though! Because collecting  taxes from a shadow economy, as we well know today, is  impossible in principle. At the time the clerks of the Boyars  Council, the glorious Gaydars of those times long past, decided  to replace the land tax with a household tax. The unexpected  result was not an increase in taxes collected but a sharp  increase in household size. Within a few years there were 20-30  huts behind a single gate, with tens of families living in each  hut. But it was a single household! The same taxes were paid as  on a single household.    The keen struggle between state and subjects continued for a  hundred years--until the Great Transformer introduced the per  capita tax, which functions in the form of an income tax even  now.    However, it is not enough to introduce a tax. You have to  know how to collect it. The methods Petr I used to collect them  in our homeland are remembered to this day. One way or another,  though, taxes began to flow into the treasury, and the state was  even able to carry out a few investment programs--for instance,  to build our nation's supremely powerful navy, whose three  hundredth anniversary we are about to celebrate.    The current rulers are a long way from achieving an  effectiveness of tax policy on Petr's level. They seem to be  somewhere in the early seventeenth century, for their actions  (like taxpayers' answering measures) are stunningly reminiscent  of the situation sketched out above.    The situation that arose around the drafting and approval of  the 1994 budget convinces us without a doubt that the mentality  of the present-day Russian government has not advanced very far  from the experience of previous centuries. I will cite merely  the latest observation of parliament economic figures, published  last Thursday in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. The tax burden is  increasing notably, they state gloomily, after studying the  draft budget. The profit tax has been increased to 6 percent, a  3-percent "special tax" has been introduced, property tax has  been raised to 2 percent, a 1-percent transportation tax has  been introduced, and duties have been raised on imports.    But to promulgate an edict about raising taxes is by no  means  the same as increasing the income to the budget. The same  parliamentary authors state with a heavy sigh that even with an  increase in the total tax burden, the government is too weak to  pass specific and real measures to increase the income to the  budget. Or, to speak in ordinary language, they don't have what  it takes to collect the taxes. They write up a resolution  increasing them with one hand, and with the other pass out (or  cannot cancel) various tax privileges, "tax breaks" for giant  bankrupts, and so on. Finally, the state lacks effective means  for influencing the shadow economy with the goal of its speedy  emergence under the bright spotlight of the tax department.    Collecting taxes even close to in full is a task that is far  from resolved. The gloomiest skeptic-observers say that only  10-20 percent of taxes are actually collected. The rest--by  various legal but primarily illegal methods--are hidden from the  state. In other words, the greater part of the contemporary  economy is essentially a shadow economy, that is, concealed from  the state. Let me emphasize that we are not talking about the  criminal economy--the drug business, or traffic in arms or  children. We are talking about the Snickers trade and the  production of stockings, about unregistered transportation,  unreported services, and the uncontrolled traffic in securities.  For a year and a half, for example, a voucher bacchanalia has  been raging in the country; 150 million vouchers have changed  hands several times each already. The count of operations with  these securities is going into the several billions, but what  profit has the treasury gained from this traffic? A big  fat--nothing.    And so it goes in any sphere of economic life you like.  Compare two figures. Over the last three years, production has  been cut by a half, and energy consumption only by 13 percent.  How is this paradox to be interpreted? In my opinion, it speaks  to the fact that at least one-fourth of production has gone into  the economic "shadow," hidden away from state statistics and tax  assessment.    This is the problem to end all problems. But cabinet members  and the gigantic apparatus of the executive power are involved  in everything--the creation of political parties, trips to  international fora, excursions to halted factories, fruitless  clashing with deputies and journalists--except the main thing  they are up against: the provision of vital activity to the  state organism, which is impossible without an efficient system  for tax collection. There isn't one today. And the paralysis of  the state budget everyone has observed is engendered not by  disagreements over the size of its articles. The matter is both  simpler and more tragic. That which the authorities have been  able to collect from subjects in principle cannot be enough even  for the most essential state expenditures, to say nothing of  investments in forward-looking branches, subsidy support, and so  on.    It cannot be said that nothing is being done about creating  a  system for collecting taxes. No, money is going to this and is  being spent successfully by numerous budgetary mouths. Lobbying  groups are attempting with varying degrees of success to pull  strings for their foreign developers--some for Americans, some  for Taiwanese, some for Siemens, some for somebody else. As  usually happens in Russia, the authorities as yet have paid no  attention to our own prophets, which, as always happens in  Russia, we have. Well known, for example, is the so-called  Kemerov Task, a program that can help increase significantly the  efficiency of mid-level tax departments. Promised developments  connected with the problem of coordinating tax and investment  policy have been carried out at the initiative of the State  Committee for Industrial Policy.    However, one of the most effective automated information  systems for a territorial-level tax service has been developed  not with state money but in the private sector. About five years  ago, a group of economists, graduates of TsEMI, other  institutes, and state structures, joining together into the  Bureau of Information Technologies, addressed the problem of  resolving this task given the special prose of Russian economic  life. Today a system has been created with the Bureau's funds  and introduced in several tax inspectorates. The developers were  counting on their product finding a relatively quick demand,  given the market reforms, and the costs being paid off. So far  this hasn't happened, and when it will is unclear; in the  Russian market its own special laws are operative.    The Sprut [Octopus] system that the Bureau people worked out  truly does correspond to its name. According to the testimony of  the head of the Moscow Thirtieth State Tax Inspectorate, L. N.  Grin, introduction of the system made it possible to increase  additional payments to the budget by a factor of eight in a  single quarter.    It takes only a few months to pay off the costs of  introducing Sprut, and for a few tasks--for example, exaction of  fines--just two or three weeks.    For those who are looking for a tax-collecting body  overseas,  let me cite the testimony of a foreign authority, the kind  people so love to cite nowadays. Specialists from the U.S.  federal tax department, under the leadership of the director of  the tax service's programming department, F. Konrad, having  acquainted themselves with Sprut, gave the following written  testimony: "The computer program shown to us is well elaborated,  and we think that it is a solid basis for further work." The  conclusion is dry enough, of course, and short on ecstasy, but  it was made by people who know how to collect taxes like no one  else in the world.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Nadir deceived PPI auditors MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, illegally deceived the auditors to Polly Peck International about his interest in a Turkish bank and failed to disclose his holding in the 1989 PPI accounts. The 1988 accounts of PPI show that Mr Nadir had an interest in both Impexbank, based in Istanbul, and the Industrial Bank of Cyprus (IBK). The 1989 accounts refer only to IBK. Mr Nadir continued to hold Impexbank shares  -allegedly bought with Polly Peck money - until he sold his interest in 1991. He deceived the auditors, Stoy Hayward, by stating categorically that he did not hold shares in Impexbank, in contravention of the 1985 Companies Act. The act requires disclosure of any transactions related to directors of a company and makes deceiving the auditors an offence. Impexbank was used to channel at least Pounds 158m of the Pounds 371m Mr Nadir allegedly removed from PPI between 1987 and 1990. The details are contained in a letter from Mr Nadir to his auditors and believed to be in the possession of the Serious Fraud Office. In response to a specific request from a senior audit partner, Mr Nadir signed a letter on PPI notepaper in April 1990 - six months before PPI went into administration - stating that he had no beneficial interest in the shares of Impexbank during 1989. He also said he had no beneficial interest in the shares of AN Graphics, the Turkish printing and publishing company that has stakes in many of the PPI Turkish businesses. Mr Nadir attempted to gain control of AN Graphics shares just four days before PPI went into administration. Last week PPI administrators won a ruling in the Manx courts that the transfer of shares from Voyager, a PPI subsidiary, to Mr Nadir was illegal. The shares were apparently transferred in exchange Pounds 8m from Mr Nadir, which the administrators say was never received by PPI.</p>

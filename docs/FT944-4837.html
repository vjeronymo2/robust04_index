			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Iberia pilots force crisis showdown The crisis at Iberia, the Spanish state airline, deepened yesterday after Mr Javier Salas, the company's chairman, failed to convince the powerful pilots' union to support a rescue plan for the financially crippled flag carrier. The breakdown of what was viewed as a final negotiating round with the pilots is now likely to force the government to intervene directly in the dispute. Madrid will want to avert a resumption of strike action over the peak Christmas period following last week's stoppages. Mr Salas said the failure to obtain an agreement with the pilots, after the viability plan had obtained preliminary acceptance by ground staff unions, meant he would now press ahead with a controversial restructuring programme that involves cutting some 5,000 jobs, 20 per cent of Iberia's labour force, and the sale of subsidiaries in order to stave off the company's threatened bankruptcy. Last week the embattled Mr Salas shelved the drastic streamlining project after wildcat action by ground staff closed down domestic airports. He subsequently gained initial backing from the company's main unions to a scaled-down cost-cutting plan that placed the burden of wage reductions on Iberia's 1,100 highly-paid pilots. The pilots yesterday rejected allegations by Mr Salas that they had refused to accept nominal pays cuts of 15 per cent. They said they were willing to reduce salaries by as much as 40 per cent in real terms after wage freezes had been factored in - but only if Mr Salas and other senior Iberia executives were replaced. There could now be a showdown between the government and the Instituto Nacional de Industria, INI, the loss-making public sector conglomerate run by Mr Salas and of which Iberia is part. The pilots, and also the company's middle management, blame INI executives, who occupy top positions in Iberia, for a series of bad decisions, ranging from costly investments in Latin America to a badly-judged fleet renewal programme, that lie at the root of the airline's problems. Iberia has debts of Pta424bn (Pounds 1.95bn), half of them short-term. The airline has written off accumulated losses of Pta144bn, reducing its capital and reserves to a mere Pta69bn, and is on course to lose Pta44bn this year.</p>

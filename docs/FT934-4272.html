			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Umeco advances to Pounds 154,000 at midway Umeco, the USM-quoted aerospace components distributor and maker of aircraft refuellers, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 154,000 for the six months to September 25. The improvement was achieved on turnover up by Pounds 451,000 to Pounds 6.01m. The directors said that the raising of Pounds 1.04m earlier in the year had left the group with net assets of Pounds 3.5m and net cash of Pounds 500,000 after a term loan of Pounds 375,000 at the end of the half. As a result Umeco had interest receivable of Pounds 5,000 in the period (Pounds 54,000 charge). Earnings per share came out at 1.1p (0.6p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p.</p>

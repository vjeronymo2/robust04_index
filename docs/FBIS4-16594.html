			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Recorded excerpt from an interview with Russian Foreign </F> Minister Andrey Kozyrev given at the Russian Foreign Ministry on  16 April; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Kozyrev] So what happened? What happened was that  air strikes were delivered without consultations with us. As a  result, the situation aggravated sharply. Why? Because the  party of war on both sides was probably just waiting for those  air strikes. Our Western partners do not realize that they do  not know the situation. I have to say that at present the  situation is literally at a crossroads. There is a chance for a  breakthrough toward ending hostilities, to be followed by  separation of the sides, sending in peacekeeping forces there,  and later a comprehensive political settlement, and naturally  some steps in the Serbs' favor, with regard to sanctions.    The second option is a rampage of the party of war inside  Bosnia, the continuation of bloodbath, shelling, possibly even  seizure of hostages from among the UN forces, possibly further  air strikes. But of course all this will grow like an avalanche,  the tragedy of a conflagration of war. Unfortunately, I cannot  as yet say with complete confidence whether we can secure the  first option and avert the second.    [Announcer Sergey Medvedev] The Russian minister gave this  interview to our program this afternoon. Two hours ago he flew  to Belgrade to back Churkin's peace efforts.</p>

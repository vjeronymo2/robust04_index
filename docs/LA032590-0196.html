			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUNDATION BOLTS  </P> <P> This letter is a belated response to a question discussed in the Handyman  Q&amp;A "Bolt Mudsills as Quake Precaution" (Jan. 21) on fastening of houses  for earthquakes. I feel that I am somewhat of an expert in this field, being  part-owner of a company that has been specializing almost exclusively in this  area for the past seven years.  </P> <P> Following are what I consider to be key points regarding retrofit fastening of  wood-frame structures to their foundations:  </P> <P>  -- You can never make a house worse by fastening it to its foundation.  </P> <P>  -- An engineer must be involved to determine what needs to be fastened and  strengthened, location of strengthening elements, size of hardware, etc.  </P> <P>  -- The actual mechanics of installing bolts and other strengthening components  is difficult and tedious work that often must be done in areas of very limited  access.  </P> <P>  -- The work can generally be performed almost entirely from underneath the  house; some cases may require that part of the work be done from the outside,  which then requires refinishing of areas of the exterior.  </P> <P>  -- The work is extremely cost-effective (compared to potential reduction in  damage to the structure). Moreover, many insurance companies and some lenders  now require (or strongly urge) fastening of older homes.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS SILVER  </P> <P> Reseda  </P> <P>  Silver is a registered structural engineer.  </P></p>

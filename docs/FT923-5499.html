			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Grade attacks BBC management style MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4, made a strong attack on the governors and senior management of the BBC at the 17th Edinburgh Television festival last night. Mr Grade, a former controller of BBC 1, accused the BBC of adopting 'a pseudo-Leninist style of management' which relied on central control to the detriment of programme planning and production values. He singled out the funding of the corporation as the most important issue facing it. The government funds the BBC by means of a compulsory licence fee  -Pounds 80 annually for a colour television. The corporation's charter and licence to broadcast, granted by the government, comes up for renewal at the end of 1996. Mr Howell James, BBC director of corporate affairs, described Mr Grade's remarks as 'spirited and stimulating' but wrong. Mr Grade did not recognise the considerable changes in broadcasting since the current BBC charter was issued in 1981 - 'changes which will accelerate in the coming year,' Mr James said.</p>

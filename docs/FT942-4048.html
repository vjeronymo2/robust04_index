			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Midland Bank stops taking smaller rivals' cash cards Midland Bank has dealt a blow to some of its smaller competitors in the Visa credit card market by blocking the use of their customers' cards in its cash machine network. None of the issuers affected - Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper, MBNA, and HFC Bank, which runs the GM Card for Vauxhall - has its own cash machines. HFC Bank said it had been given some warning that access to cashpoints was going to be withdrawn, but neither Robert Fleming nor MBNA had been notified. Midland said the decision was 'purely commercial'. It had not notified all the banks affected because they had not formally applied to join the network. The move could be seen as a direct attack on some of Midland's most serious rivals in the increasingly competitive UK credit card market. All three issuers involved have been attracting much new business recently by offering a range of incentives. Robert Fleming is the worst affected bank, because the Visa network is used not only by its credit card holders but also its current-account customers, who use Visa cards as debit cards to access their accounts. A Robert Fleming representative said the company was particularly upset that it had not been informed of the decision, even after it came into effect, and would be taking the issue up with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, owners of Midland. HFC Bank said it was not unduly concerned at the change as cash withdrawals were only a peripheral part of its credit card facilities and not used by the majority of customers. Visa said that although all banks in the Visa network were obliged to accept foreign-issued cards in their machines, they were entitled to reject cards issued by local competitors if they chose, and if this was made clear on the machines. Midland has not yet changed the logo on its machines to indicate that not all Visa cards are accepted. NatWest has never accepted Visa cards issued by anyone except itself, Midland, TSB and foreign banks. Lloyds accepts all cards bearing the Visa logo, and Barclays accepts all cards except the GM Card.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Socialists urge Japanese poll Japan's opposition Social Democratic party yesterday called for an early general election, as the only way to achieve a stable government. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, party chairman, suggested the minority five-party coalition and opposition parties should agree to an early poll under the current multi-seat constituency electoral system. This is the clearest sign yet the socialists want to bring down the government before the establishment, possibly by late autumn, of the new electoral system, a mixture of single-seat districts and proportional representation. The SDP's move came as the Bank of Japan also called for the new government to show leadership, a reflection of anxiety that political turmoil of the past few months might spill into the economy. 'We want the government to show leadership in tackling domestic and international economic issues confronting the Japanese economy, such as deregulation and market-opening measures,' Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor, said. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new prime minister, rebuffed the demands: 'There are undoubtedly people who don't really want to see political reform. The coalition government is still in place and it's not the time to dissolve the house.' However, the Liberal Democratic party, the largest opposition group, yesterday showed it was also preparing for an early poll by opening a campaign headquarters. Demand for credit continues to weaken, according to the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan. It reported yesterday that outstanding loans by the the 11 top commercial banks fell 0.4 per cent in the year to April, the fourth month of decline.</p>

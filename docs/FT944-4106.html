			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson steps into private arena - The flotation paves the way for further injections SGS-Thomson, the Franco- Italian semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday launched an offer of up to 19 per cent of its shares on the New York and Paris stock markets, and took its first step out of state ownership. It seems a far cry from 1987 when two state-owned companies - Thomson Semiconductors of France and SGS Microelectronics of Italy - decided to pool their resources in an attempt to fight back against US and Japanese competition, and pull themselves out of a trough of financial problems and declining market share. At the time, the challenge of making the joint venture work seemed a particularly tough one. As one analyst puts it: 'If you can't turn a semiconductor company round in five years, you're lost.' However, seven years on, SGS-Thomson is nearing the top 10 in the semiconductor sector. Mr Bill McClean, vice-president of Integrated Circuit Engineering, the Arizona-based industry research and consultancy group, forecasts sales growth of about 30 per cent this year - from Dollars 2.04bn in 1993 - which makes the company the 11th or 12th biggest company in the industry. 'They are definitely regarded as a serious competitor by the dominant US and Japanese groups,' according to Mr McClean. Helped by the recent upswing in the cyclical semiconductor industry, SGS-Thomson has seen profits jump to Dollars 253.3m for the first nine months of this year, nearly double the figure for the same period in 1993. Investment in new plant and fast-growing technologies, diversity of products and geographical spread have improved the group's medium-term prospects. For example, SGS-Thomson produces mixed signal devices - which combine analog and digital systems and whose uses range from cars to telecoms - Eproms and Flash memories. The company is the world's biggest producer of Eproms, non-volatile semiconductors in which memory is retained once the power source has been removed, and has pushed ahead with the development of the next generation Flash products, helped by its pre-eminence in Eproms. The group is taking an aggressive step in the microprocessor market. In April, it announced it was collaborating with Cyrix of the US to produce microprocessors. The project faces potential legal hurdles because of court battles between Cyrix and Intel, the dominant microprocessor manufacturer, which is seeking to protect its patent rights. However, most observers believe it is a significant strategic move for SGS-Thomson. 'They have the capacity in place at their Phoenix plant and they should be up and running pretty quickly,' says one Paris-based analyst. 'This is critical because the timing will be vital in winning market share.' As for geographical spread, 'unlike Phillips and Siemens, which are still fairly reliant on Europe, they have a pretty well-balanced exposure,' says one electronics analyst at a French merchant bank. Like its European counterparts SGS-Thomson still faces a problem of size. Mr Mike Glennon, semiconductor analyst at Dataquest, the UK technology research consultancy, says there are three fundamental elements to success in the microprocessor market: produce an industry-standard product; sort out patent issues with Intel; and make sure you have the ability to produce to meet market demand. 'You need to be able to invest millions of dollars because manufacturing plant costs in the region of Dollars 1bn,' he says. 'The 'in between' position is going to be tough,' adds Mr McClean, who believes SGS-Thomson needs to 'get big, and keep rolling'. Mr Pasquale Pistorio, the company's Italian chairman, sketches a scenario in which the financial and technological requirements of the sector will divide it into two broad categories - general, broad-range semiconductor suppliers and small specialist producers. The dividing line, he believes, will be determined by market share and the crucial level will be about 5 per cent, a few points higher than his company's present slice of the market. To lift the company out of what he describes as 'the grey zone', Mr Pistorio has pursued a policy of expansion. This has meant strengthening the group's capital base. Last year, SGS-Thomson received two capital injections of each from its state shareholders, reducing debts to about Dollars 275.5m at the beginning of this year, compared with a peak of about Dollars 904m at the end of 1991. Such financing has prompted criticism from US rivals, who oppose the state financing of their European competitor, but it is no longer an option because of budget pressures on both the Italian and French governments. Hence the move to the market. The initial offering of shares - 16.3 per cent of the total number - should net receipts of about Dollars 470m. More importantly, it prepares the path for further capital injections from private shareholders and an eventual move from public sector control. The French industry ministry describes such a scenario as premature. However, the Italian and French governments are both enacting an ambitious programme of privatisation aimed at easing the financial burden of the state's involvement in industry. In many cases flotation is followed by privatisation. The capital requirements of SGS-Thomson and the industry in which it is competing, suggest it may follow a similar course.</p>

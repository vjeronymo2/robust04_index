			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Thomson sells white-goods arm to Italian-led group THOMSON, France's state-controlled electronics group, is selling Thomson Electromenager (TEM), its profitable white-goods subsidiary, to a consortium led by Elettrofinanziaria (Elfi), the Italian electronics concern, for an unspecified sum. The sale, which will turn Elfi into Europe's fourth-largest white goods group, was triggered by the loss-making Thomson's need to reduce its FFr10bn (Dollars 1.85bn) debt. The combination of TEM and Elfi will also help them to achieve the necessary size to compete against the huge groups, notably Philips-Whirlpool and Bosch-Siemens of Germany, that dominate the white goods market. The Italian group is to acquire 66 per cent of TEM with its consortium partner, Credit National, the French bank, taking 34 per cent. TEM, which includes the Vedette and Thomson brands as well as the recently-acquired De Dietrich, is an established force in European white-goods. It employs 7,000 people and was profitable - it does not disclose the actual level - on sales of FFr6bn last year. However, Thomson has been concerned about TEM's long-term prospects in the intensely aggressive white-goods sector and its ability to match the vast marketing and research resources of its larger counterparts. There has been long-running speculation it might be forced to sell TEM. Mr Henri Lagarde, TEM's chairman, who was said to have opposed any earlier suggestions of a sale, led the negotiations with Elfi. Elfi has some French interests in boilers and refrigeration. It said yesterday that Ocean, its white-goods business (which last year provided FFr3bn of its FFr7bn turnover) was completely complementary to TEM. Elfi estimated that Ocean and TEM would command 10 per cent of the European white goods market. Ciments Francais, the French cement group, and Paribas, the French bank, have been forced to raise their offer for Guintoli, the building company embroiled in the Ciments scandal, from FFr890 to FFr956 a share at the request of the Paris stock market authorities. This raises the value of the offer for the 67.1 per cent they do not already own from FFr313m to FFr336m.</p>

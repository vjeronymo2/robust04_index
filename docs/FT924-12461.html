			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: New chip from Intel to carry name not number INTEL'S fifth generation of microprocessor chips, to be launched early next year, will carry a new name instead of a number. The US company has registered the name 'Pentium' as a trademark to prevent competitors using it. Intel's current products are called the 386 and the 486, following a numbering convention the company has developed over the course of several years. 'The natural course would be to call this chip the 586,' said Mr Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executive. 'Unfortunately, we may not able to trademark those numbers.' Intel lost a legal battle with rival Advanced Micro Devices last year to protect its numbering system. 'That means that any company might call any chip a 586, even if it doesn't measure up to the real thing.' Pentium will be the 'brains' of the next generation of personal computers. 'It represents the next advance in performance - running software two to three times faster than today's 486 PCs,' said Mr Grove.</p>

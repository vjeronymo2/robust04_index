			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: India The Bombay stock exchange tomorrow launches a broadly based 200-share index, as a first step towards index-based futures trading to replace the banned carry-forward system, Reuter reports. The index is expected eventually to replace the BSE 30-share index which, critics say, is unfairly weighted in favour of a few blue chips. The BSE is also introducing a dollar-based index, to help foreign investors measure their returns on Indian bourses. Mr Asit Mehta of Nucleus Financial Services, who proposed the system, said that index-based futures trading would solve the bourses' problems of illiquidity, inadequate hedging opportunities and a cumbersome settlement mechanism. India's 22 bourses have been seeking a replacement to the badla, or carry-forward trading, since it was banned six months ago on the grounds that it caused excessive speculation. Analysts say that index-based futures, though not the ideal solution, were the only viable alternative.</p>

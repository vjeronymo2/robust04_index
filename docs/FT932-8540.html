			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Euro-sceptics vow to carry on fight MR JOHN MAJOR last night seized on Denmark's apparent endorsement of Maastricht to signal that Britain would now press ahead quickly with ratification of a treaty which has come close to splitting the Conservative party. But while his party's Euro-sceptics acknowledged that the forecast Danish result had severely dented their hopes of wrecking the agreement, they vowed to continue to fight British ratification in the House of Lords and in the courts. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit will lead another rebellion against the bill in the Lords but Mr Major is confident they will be unsuccessful. The prime minister also expects to defeat a legal challenge from the Tory Euro-sceptics over Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. Amid jubilation in Whitehall, ministers said the government now hoped to complete the tortuous and bitter ratification process before the summer parliamentary recess at the end of July. The prime minister, who has seen his government's authority drained by the bitter struggle over the treaty, voiced the hope that the Tory party would now put its differences behind it. Speaking to businessmen, Mr Major said the the ending of the uncertainty surrounding Maastricht would provide a boost to economic recovery in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. The Community could now go forward as 12 into the next intergovernmental conference in 1996. The Maastricht bill will complete its passage through the House of Commons tomorrow. Despite the threat of a rebellion by 40 or more Conservative Euro-sceptics, the bill's passage to the House of Lords is guaranteed because of the Labour party's decision to abstain on the crucial third reading vote. Senior ministers acknowledged last night that the wounds in the Tory party from the bitter struggle over the treaty will take years to heal. The government has already been warned by its supporters that any move to take sterling back into the European exchange rate mechanism - as required under the Maastricht treaty - would trigger an even bigger revolt among its supporters. Even if Mr Major manages to complete the ratification process by the end of July, Britain now looks likely to be the last of the 12 formally to endorse the treaty. But colleagues were claiming last night that without the concessions for Denmark negotiated by the prime minister at last December's Edinburgh summit, Maastricht would have collapsed entirely.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Scottish Nuclear warms to sell-off Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned company which runs Scotland's nuclear power stations, indicated yesterday that it now favours the idea of being privatised. The company has been less enthusiastic than Nuclear Electric, its counterpart in England and Wales. Mr James Hann, chairman, criticised the government yesterday for slowing its progress towards becoming a commercial company by the 'totally unnecessary' delay to its plans to store nuclear waste at its power stations. He said: 'It really does seem that every time our industry tries to move forward it is being halted in its tracks as a result of operating in the public sector. 'If remaining in the public sector is going to seriously hinder our progress and potentially thwart our attempts to find the finance for new plants in the future, then partial or even full privatisation may indeed be the way forward.' SNL cooled towards privatisation last autumn after its merchant bank warned of flotation and trade-sale difficulties. Last month Mr Hann told the Scotland on Sunday newspaper that outright privatisation would 'wreck the UK nuclear industry as it stands'. He feared that private investors would be unwilling to fund new nuclear plants. Mr Hann's change of heart follows last month's decision by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, to defer a decision on construction of a dry store for spent fuel at the Torness power station in East Lothian. Mr Lang is to wait until the environment department finishes its own review of radioactive-waste strategy, which will consider whether Britain should have a single dry store for nuclear waste, or stores at individual plants. SNL is particularly aggrieved over the delay because it thought it was doing what the government wanted in reducing its operating costs. SNL announced a 9 per cent increase in net profit to Pounds 72m in the year to March 31 compared with Pounds 66m in 1992-93. Turnover rose from Pounds 524m to Pounds 537m. Output fell from 14.3m to 14.2m terawatt hours because of engineering work to extend the life of its plants.</p>

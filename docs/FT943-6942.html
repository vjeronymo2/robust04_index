			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Brussels targets late-payers The European Commission is set to recommend the introduction of automatic interest charges on bills that are paid late. The aim is to curb a lengthening of payment periods, which it concludes is hampering both the internal market and cross-border trade. In a draft report, the Commission points to a deterioration in payment discipline, which saw the time between the delivery of goods and payments rise to an average of 66 days in Europe in 1993. More than a quarter of businesses have to wait more than 90 days for payment; 8 per cent wait for 120 days. The Commission also recommends the introduction of compulsory reporting by companies of their own payments records, together with statements of how they tend to improve their performance. The report is likely to come as something of an embarrassment to the British government, which just three months ago, in its white paper on competitiveness, announced its decision not to introduce legislation to give companies a statutory right to interest on overdue debts. The UK argued there was no clear mandate from the business community for such a measure. The Commission argues that late payments are proving so damaging to European businesses that action needs to be taken.</p>

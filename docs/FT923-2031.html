			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Ecuador threatens to withdraw from Opec ECUADOR yesterday threatened to become the first member to leave the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel since its founding in 1960, Neil Buckley writes from Geneva. The second-smallest producer in Opec, it has fallen out with the organisation over its desire to raise output and increase its revenues to help pay off its Dollars 13bn (Pounds 7.3bn) debt. Ecuador, which joined Opec in 1973, said it intended to withdraw at the cartel's next meeting in November. Ecuador's statement was a second blow to the organisation, after Mr Gholamresa Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, said Iran did not accept Opec's communique issued late on Thursday. Opec's ministerial monitoring committee pledged to freeze total production at 24.2m b/d for the fourth quarter, although Kuwait was allowed to continue raising output as it rebuilt its oil industry after the Gulf war. Iran had been pressing for a cut in production, and said an opportunity had been missed to drive oil prices up to the target of Dollars 21 a barrel for the Opec basket of crudes. Mr Aghazadeh said Iran would now adjust its production according to world demand, but did not intend to disrupt the oil market by substantially raising output, as had been rumoured.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S HAPPIER?;  </P> <P> A CLOSE LOOK AT SIX FAMILIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE COUNTY  </P> <P> Could it be that life in Orange County is more satisfying south of the Costa  Mesa Freeway? Seventy-two percent of South County residents rate their  community "very favorable," compared to 52% in the North County who feel the  same way, according to The Times Orange County Poll. South County residents  laud their communities' appearance, climate, parks and beaches. Those in the  north highly rate their neighborhoods' convenience and shopping opportunities.  South County residents, however, are more likely to say their communities are  congested and boring, while more of those in the north believe that their area  is not lacking anything. To find out how these feelings translated into  everyday life, The Times selected six residents -- three each from North County  and South County -- from among the 800 people polled to discuss their  neighborhoods, life styles, likes and dislikes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NORTH  </P> <P> RUSTY GUINTHER  </P> <P> Age: 43  </P> <P> City: Costa Mesa  </P> <P> Occupation: Real estate investments.  </P> <P> Household: Two daughters -- Heather Ann, 11, and Leslie Ann, 3.  </P> <P> Household income: $70,000-plus.  </P> <P> Workweek: 55 hours.  </P> <P> Recreation: Four hours weekly. "Anything from playing golf once a week to  taking a long walk with my children."  </P> <P> Last shopping trip: "We went yesterday for birthday presents for my 3-year-old.  I probably go once a week."  </P> <P> Last saw a movie: "Probably twice a month, generally for the kids. We went  (four days ago) to see 'Peter Pan.' "  </P> <P> Last dined out: Seven days ago. "We go out about twice a month, maybe a little  bit more."  </P> <P> Last trip to beach: Eight days ago. "I get there about three times a year,  though it's two miles from home."  </P> <P> Last trip to park: "Probably three weeks ago. I try to do that at least once a  month with my 3-year-old."  </P> <P> Travel to work: About one mile by car.  </P> <P> Victim of Crime? No.  </P> <P> Life style: "I'm very satisfied. I'm close to work. I live on the east side of  Costa Mesa. I'm in a rather rural setting. I'm a hop, skip and jump from South  Coast Plaza. If I want to go to the beach, I'm not that far away. I think the  northern part of Orange County is more established with single-family homes and  more of an older tract with a little more space. You go farther south and it  becomes real high, high density -- row after row after row of same-looking  structures. . . . I couldn't live down there . . . too many people and too many  cars."  </P> <P> MATTHEW LOYOLA VOGE  </P> <P> Age: 27  </P> <P> City: Orange  </P> <P> Occupation: Physical therapy student at Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> Household: Lives with his parents, Lyle, a physician, and Margaret Voge, both  60, and sister, Camille, 23.  </P> <P> Household income: $70,000-plus.  </P> <P> Workweek: 30 hours during the summer in a physical therapy clinic.  </P> <P> Recreation: Four to 12 hours weekly, working out, playing tennis and golf,  walking and bike riding.  </P> <P> Last shopping trip: "We went to the hardware store this morning." Average three  times a month.  </P> <P> Last saw a movie: "A week ago. We go about twice or three times a month."  </P> <P> Last dined out: "Within the week. We go about once a week."  </P> <P> Last trip to beach: "It's been a couple weeks. I'm going today."  </P> <P> Last trip to park: "A couple months ago. We don't go to parks that much, maybe  a couple times a year."  </P> <P> Travel to work: 10 miles by car.  </P> <P> Victim of crime? "Our cars have been broken into several times."  </P> <P> Life style: "The city of Orange has got some charm and character that other  cities don't; a centralized downtown. I like the fact it's close to the  foothills. It's a central location, not that far from the beach. . . . It's not  as smoggy as some parts of the county, like Yorba Linda. The biggest thing is  -- it's got a small-town feel to it. The newer (South County) developments are  pretty sterile. . . . The type of family there is very competitive, very  yuppie-ish. I like the old parts, like San Clemente. . . . The new developments  are real sterile, the clone homes."  </P> <P> MARYJANE BROOKS  </P> <P> Age: 35  </P> <P> City: Anaheim  </P> <P> Occupation: Mortgage loan underwriter  </P> <P> Household: Husband, 36; twin sons, 8, and son, 3  </P> <P> Household income: $70,000-plus  </P> <P> Workweek: 40 hours  </P> <P> Recreation: Three hours weekly, running mostly.  </P> <P> Last shopping trip: "Yesterday. I bought a bedroom set for the children."  Averages two or three trips a week.  </P> <P> Last saw a movie: "Probably five years ago. We rent videos."  </P> <P> Last dined out: "About two weeks ago."  </P> <P> Last trip to beach: "Probably 12 years. The kids went last week."  </P> <P> Last trip to park: "A week ago."  </P> <P> Travel to work: 12 miles to her office in Sante Fe Springs.  </P> <P> Victim of crime? "No. We've been really lucky."  </P> <P> Life style: "Anaheim doesn't spend its money properly. Our parks are full of  homeless people, drunks. It's pretty sad. . . . When I have to drive outside my  little area here, it's depressing. They've had some very bad planning downtown.  . . .We don't frequent the parks in our neighborhood."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTH  </P> <P> AMY TUCKER  </P> <P> Age: 32  </P> <P> City: Laguna Niguel  </P> <P> Occupation: Social worker  </P> <P> Household: Roommate, Pascale Scoggins, 30  </P> <P> Household income: $40,000 to $50,000  </P> <P> Workweek: 40 hours-plus  </P> <P> Recreation: Six hours weekly going to movies, beach, concerts, walks  </P> <P> Last shopping trip: Two days ago.

I wouldn't mind having a private yard and all of that. .  . . I think people down here are snobbier. . . . You can see a definite  difference. . . . People down here are more yuppie. . . . If I could live in  Laguna Beach, I'd be happy."  </P> <P> DENNIS MORALES  </P> <P> Age: 38  </P> <P> City: San Clemente  </P> <P> Occupation: Engineer  </P> <P> Household: Morales lives with his friend, Marie Tarango, 40; her son, Ian, 15,  and her daughter, Maile, 16.  </P> <P> Household income: $80,000  </P> <P> Workweek: 45 to 50 hours  </P> <P> Recreation: 20 hours weekly at softball and household outings  </P> <P> Last shopping trip: Week ago.

The  mayor lives right around the corner. . . . Lived in the northern part of Orange  County for 10-12 years before I moved down here. I can take my four-wheel-drive  from here in about 20 minutes to use it. In the North County, you have to fight  the congestion for so long."  </P> <P> ALNOS ELEKES  </P> <P> Age: 27.  </P> <P> City: Irvine.  </P> <P> Occupation: Physicist.  </P> <P> Household: Lives alone.  </P> <P> Household income: $40,000.  </P> <P> Workweek: 50 hours.  </P> <P> Recreation: 15 hours weekly at soccer, tennis and skin diving.  </P> <P> Last shopping trip: 10 days ago.

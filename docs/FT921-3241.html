			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / UN representative sounds Cambodia warning THE head of a 22,000-strong United Nations task force said yesterday he was worried about the lack of effectiveness of Cambodia's national reconciliation body, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. Mr Yasushi Akashi of Japan also expressed concern over violations of the Paris peace agreement signed by the country's four main factions last year. He said further acts would not be tolerated. 'If there are any persistent or clear-cut violations, I'm sure the Security Council will be in a position to take a clear-cut decision of enforcement,' Mr Akashi said on his arrival in Phnom Penh. Mr Akashi said he was concerned about the 'ineffectiveness' of Cambodia's Supreme National Council which is 'supposed to be a very, very important instrument for national reconciliation to prepare for the steps of democracy in this country'. He added that he would work with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian head of state and SNC president, towards making a council which comes up to its 'promises and expectations.' The SNC holds Cambodian sovereignty ahead of UN-organised elections next year.</p>

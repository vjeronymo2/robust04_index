			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's message by President Nursultan Nazarbayev; place </F> and date not given; from the "Mir" broadcast -- recorded]    [Text] Despite the fact that people are experiencing the  hardships of the transitional period, as we call it, and that  these hardships still exist, well, as the saying goes, hope is  always the last thing to die. So I would like all Commonwealth  states to look to the future with optimism. Why? Because the  people who belong to the former Soviet Union have experienced  many hardships.    I should very much like 1994 to be, for all the peoples, a  year of insight, the year of the realization that only unity,  only the preservation of the friendship that did nevertheless,  exist in the former Soviet Union between the peoples, and [the  preservation] of the wisdom that has always existed in our  peoples -- that is what will lead to prosperity.    Be that as it may, life moves on. Whatever happens, we are  doing everything to improve people's lives in the future. So I  urge wisdom, prudence, calm, respect by every person for the  person next to him, respect by people for one another, and  respect by states for one another.    Today ultimata have to be removed from the vocabulary. Today  one must speak with the language of understanding, the language  of cooperation, and the language of mutually beneficial trade.    I wish everyone happiness and health. I hope that in every  family there is prosperity, and that 1994 brings every family at  least some small joy.</p>

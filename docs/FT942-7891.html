			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Bosnian Serbs remain defiant Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday failed to honour their pledge to withdraw 150 Serb fighters from the UN's 3km exclusion zone around Gorazde, the south-eastern Moslem enclave. Despite this breach of the UN-brokered agreement, Bosnian Serb leaders matched defiance on the battlefield with another diplomatic offensive, saying UN sanctions must be lifted before they would rejoin international peace talks on Bosnia. The Moslem-led Bosnian government has refused to return to the bargaining table before its Serb foes withdraw from the Gorazde exclusion zone. According to Major Rob Annink, UN spokesman in Sarajevo, Serb forces yesterday even improved their positions within the exclusion zone. Renewed Serb demands for the lifting of sanctions made the prospects for an all-party meeting even bleaker. Mr Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the self-styled Serb state which covers about 70 per cent of Bosnia, said: 'We will seek equal conditions. All kinds of pressures must be removed, including the lifting of sanctions.' In Paris, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic failed yesterday to win unqualified support from representatives of French political parties for an end to the arms embargo which he says ties his government's hands.</p>

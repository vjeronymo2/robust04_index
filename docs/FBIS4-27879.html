			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the government is actively  examining the possibility of compensating up to 90 percent of  the losses from the South-North cooperative fund, if ROK  companies that trade with North Korea suffer losses as a result  of economic sanctions against North Korea.    A high-ranking official of the National Unification Board  said on 4 June: "It is expected that companies that trade with  the North will suffer losses if trade between the South and  North, including processing on commission, and direct and  indirect trade, is entirely suspended. The government is  actively examining the possibility of compensating up to 90  percent of the losses according to Article 26, which stipulates  the regulations on operating and managing the South-North  cooperative fund."    The reason the government decided to actively examine this  matter is that the losses the companies will suffer will not be  due to mistakes in concluding contracts with the North Korean  companies or to negligence in its management, but due to a  special situation between the South and North.    In April 1991, the government enacted the "regulation on  operating and managing the South-North cooperative fund," and in  July of the same year, 5,000 tonnes of rice were exported to  North Korea. However, since our side did not receive the money  for it from the Chinji Trading Company, our side received  compensation for 1.268 billion won from the South-North exchange  cooperative fund for the losses suffered.    Currently there are 145 billion won in the South-North  exchange cooperative fund.    The official also said: "If we determine that the companies  that conduct trade with North Korea are not able to retrieve the  amount of loss or is impossible to retrieve it by the end of  this year, we will receive applications from the related  companies and examine whether the companies can receive  assistance according to the regulation on assistance to restore  national commonwealth (Chapter 9, Article 67) of the regulation  on operating and managing the fund."    The companies that may be able to receive compensation are  Samsung Products Company; Lucky-Gold Star Trading Company;  Daewoo; Kohap Trading Company; Hanil Synthetic Fiber Company;  and Hyosong Products Company that exported subsidiary raw  materials for processing on commission, and small-sized  companies that gave money in advance under the condition that  North Korea will bring in the goods.</p>

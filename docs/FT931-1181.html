			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK dividends Something of a rush seems to be developing to pay dividends before the lower tax credit comes into force on April 5. The dozen or so companies who are paying the final early in the form of a second interim are, though, engaging in little more than small beer tax avoidance. More disturbing is the example set by those like Rentokil and Unilever which are increasing dividends to compensate tax-free investors for the yield they have lost. Unilever's dual nationality gives it a particular excuse. Rentokil's increase may be an isolated act of bravado. Yet institutions are twisting arms behind the scenes, despite the chancellor's apparent desire to make tax-free investors pay some of the cost of boosting industry. UK companies already pay a high proportion of earnings in dividends. One must not overstate Mr Lamont's objectives, but the aim of improving corporate cash flow will be lost if the savings from unrelieved ACT are simply paid out in higher dividends. The reduced equity yields resulting from the tax changes may imply a fall in prices. But the market has already shed some 70 points since the Budget. Companies which give in to pressure to raise their payout when finances are weak will only have themselves to blame if they are short of working capital as the recovery gathers pace. Shareholders, too, might then come to regret their short-term greed.</p>

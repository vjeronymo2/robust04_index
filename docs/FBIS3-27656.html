			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten announced here this afternoon that his  government is to gazette the remaining part of the reform bill  tomorrow and introduce it to the Legislative Council on March 9.    The announcement was made by Governor Patten in a speech  delivered before the start of a debate on the Legislative  Council this afternoon.    The move was followed by the approval of the first part of  Patten's proposal for electoral reform at the Legislative  Council early this morning.    Patten's government also published a White Paper which  revealed contents of the 17 rounds of Sino-British talks on the  arrangements for the 1994-95 election in Hong Kong in disregard  of China's demand for publication through diplomatic channels.  Some 200,000 English and Chinese copies of the white paper were  distributed to the public here today.    The Chinese Government pointed out from the very beginning  that the political reform bill proposed by Chris Patten in  October 1992 violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  Basic Law of the future Special Administrative Region of Hong  Kong and the understandings and agreements already reached  between China and Britain.    However, the British Hong Kong authorities introduced parts  of the bill to the Legislative Council on December 15, 1993.  The move led to the termination of the Sino-British talks on  the arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong.    The Chinese side stated on many occasions China will accept  no bills passed by the Legislative Council before any agreement  is reached between the Governments of China and Britain.    China also urged the British side to face the fact that  without agreements with China, the three-tier councils, which  serve as parts of the political structure of the British Hong  Kong authorities, will be dismantled when the British rule over  Hong Kong terminates on July 30, 1997. However, the British  side has ignored all these advices from the Chinese side and  clung obstinately on its own course.    The escalation of the Sino-British confrontation over the  1994-95 electoral arrangement in Hong Kong added some  unfavorable elements to the already violent stock market,  dragging the Hang Seng index, the key indicator of the local  blue chips, down 331 points today with thin trading.</p>

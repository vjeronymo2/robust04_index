			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Commercial aircraft side deeper in loss THE REGIONAL aircraft business remains the Cinderella of British Aerospace. Both Sir Graham Day, BAe's interim chairman, and Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, conceded yesterday that the company's regional aircraft activities faced an extremely tough year in 1991 and that the company was currently talking with other regional aircraft manufacturers to try to rationalise the sector. BAe's commercial aircraft operations reported a trading deficit of Pounds 37m last year compared with a Pounds 14m surplus in 1990 in spite of achieving profits from its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus airliner programme and its corporate jet activities. Mr Evans said that in the regional aircraft market there were 'too many producers producing too wide a variety of aircraft types'. But he added there was now emerging a consensus among manufacturers to find a 'common ground' and a 'way forward' for the regional aircraft busi-ness. BAe produces the 146 regional jet, the Advanced Turbopropeller Aircraft and the smaller Jetstream turbopropeller commuter aircraft. These programmes have faced intense competition in a market which has suffered from the dire financial difficulties of smaller commuter and regional airlines. Sir Graham confirmed yesterday that BAe would no longer consider financing the development of a new commercial aircraft on its own. But although talks were continuing with other manufacturers, there had been no concrete indications so far of an imminent partnership deal between BAe's regional aircraft business and other manufacturers. However, Mr Evans said the decision of splitting BAe's commercial aircraft activities into three separate units - including its Airbus activities, regional aircraft and corporate jets - was expected to help the company negotiate a partnership deal in the regional aircraft sector. He also said there were no similar plans for the company's profitable corporate jet operations. 'Our executive jet business is not on the market', he insisted. BAe continues to see its stake in Airbus as providing the best prospects for its commercial aircraft activities. BAe produces all the wings for Airbus air-liners.</p>

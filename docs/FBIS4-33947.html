			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo  Frei today downplayed criticism of Army Commander Augusto  Pinochet's recent trip by stating that ties with the Chilean  Armed Forces are "extraordinarily positive."    Ever since his first speeches, Frei has noted the  "impersonality of power" as a government formula: "In this  case, there are no personal ties, only institutional ties.  Government ties with the Armed Forces and their commanders are  extraordinarily positive."    Frei stated that a discussion agenda has been drafted on  issues the government believes should be defense policy  guidelines.    He said: "General Pinochet made a trip at the institutional  level. I met with him before his trip and we will assess his  trip when he returns, as is done with all the Armed Forces  commanders."    Gen. Pinochet's visit to Europe caused protests among some  European associations, particulary during his stay in the Czech  Republic.</p>

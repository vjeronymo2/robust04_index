			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Developing the last great oil frontier - Western moves to exploit ex-Soviet reserves are gathering pace THE PROBLEMS and risks may still be legion, but moves by western companies to exploit oil reserves in the former Soviet Union are gathering pace. While the floodgates have yet to open, almost all major western companies have involvement of some kind - and a number of smaller companies have proved that they too can do deals with the former Soviet republics. Only this week, it was announced that a venture that is seeking to become the first integrated Russian oil company with a listing on the London stock exchange had been officially registered. The Siberian Oil Company (Sinco) has been formed by Eurosov Petroleum, a private company backed by US and Australian oil interests, together with 16 Russian shareholding enterprises. It has licences to exploit 20 fields in the Tyumen region with recoverable reserves estimated at 1.74bn barrels. Joint ventures with local producers remain the most popular means of entry into the former Soviet industry. The first was Yuganskfracmaster, made up of Canadian Fracmaster, Shell, and the west Siberian producer Yuganskneftegaz. This undertakes well treatment at fields in the Yugansk region and has managed to make satisfactory profits by exporting incremental oil production as payment for its work. The first US-Soviet venture to get approval to pump Siberian crude oil to the world, the much-trumpeted White Nights project, has had more variable fortunes. Formed in 1990 between US oil companies Phibro Energy and Anglo Suisse and the western Siberian producer Varyeganneftegaz, it began producing last year from the Tagrinskoye and West Varyegan fields near Raduzhny, 2,400 km (about 1,500 miles) north-east of Moscow. It was, however, hit hard by the high costs of employing expatriate workers and the effects of the Ecu26 a tonne (about Dollars 5 a barrel) export tariff imposed by the Russian government just before Christmas - from which it was only recently granted exemption. Undaunted, the White Nights partners are still preparing to embark on a bigger project, called Golden Mammoth, to develop four fields in western Siberia. Reserves are estimated at 400m barrels, and Mr Gil Labbe, president of Anglo-Suisse, recently said investment was planned of between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. The recent offer by the Russian government to exempt 'serious' foreign investors from the punitive export tariff may help take the brakes off investment. Other joint ventures to benefit from exemption are Conoco's Polar Lights project, a Dollars 3bn development of three oil basins in the autonomous republic of Komi, west of the Ural mountains and close to the Arctic Circle. The other is KomiArcticOil, for which Gulf Canada is the operator, with partners British Gas and local producer Komineft. This has been producing about 8,000 b/d from Komi's Vozey and Upper Vozey fields since last December. Komi has been a centre of interest for western companies that are beginning to go beyond production-boosting agreements, to sign new exploration and development deals. Total, the French oil group, signed a production-sharing contract with Komineft in May, to develop the 250m-barrel Khariaga field in Komi's Timan Pechora basin. The company expects to invest Dollars 400m over two and a half years to bring the field on stream, and a total of Dollars 1bn over the life of the field. Occidental Petroleum, the US major, had long-established links with the former Soviet Union through its founder, Mr Armand Hammer, once a friend of Lenin. The company announced in June that a subsidiary, Occidental of the Republic of Komi, would begin exploration activities as soon as possible on a 1.5m-acre (600,000-hectare) block in the Timan Pechora basin, after winning exclusive exploration and exploitation rights with local petroleum enterprise Ukhtaneftegasgeologia. Another US major, Texaco, is negotiating a significant production-sharing agreement in Timan Pechora. Several other joint ventures have been announced since the demise of the Soviet Union. Pennzoil, the Texas-based natural resources company, said in January that it was forming a joint enterprise with Agansk Geological, to be called the Siberian American Oil company. The venture will develop the 45m-barrel West Mogotlorsk field in the Tyumen region of western Siberia - Russia's biggest oil-producing area. In the transition towards competitive tendering for licences, however, some companies are running into problems. Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the UK independent, secured exclusive rights to study the Caspian Sea's 100m-barrel Inchke More field last October and hoped this would lead to a full development contract. Instead, a competitive tender has been called, although Premier remains confident that its early work will give it a competitive advantage. Premier is not the first western company to find the rug apparently pulled from under its feet. The so-called 3M group, consisting of US companies Marathon Oil and McDermott and Japan's Mitsui, carried out a feasibility study on developing oil and gas offshore of Sakhalin island in the Russian far east. This was superseded by a competitive tender, only to see 3M come out the winners. There is, apparently, no such threat to the deals reached by the French major Elf Aquitaine, which was the first western company to sign significant exploration deals with both Russia and Kazakhstan, after nearly three years of painstaking negotiation. Elf has two blocks of almost 20,000 sq km (7,700 square miles) between the cities of Saratov and Volgograd in Russia, and south-west of Aktyubinsk in Kazakhstan. The Russian deal was recently ratified by the Russian parliament, and Elf has said it expects up to 20 per cent of its reserves to lie in these regions by the end of the century. In the race to attract western investment, Kazakhstan has scooped up by far the biggest deals. Three months after the Elf deal, it reached a long-awaited agreement with Chevron, the fourth largest oil company in the US, to develop the huge Tengiz and Korolev fields with estimated recoverable reserves between 6bn and 9bn barrels. Less than two months later, British Gas and Agip, the Italian state-owned oil company beat off competition from British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil to win exclusive negotiating rights to develop the Karachaganak field. The field contains 20 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, and 2bn barrels of oil and condensate. Kazakhstan also has deals with Oman and with the privately-owned Turkish engineering company United BMB group, which signed a Dollars 1.7bn deal to exploit four oilfields and construct a gas-fired power station at Aktyubinsk. Moreover, Mobil, BP and Chevron are said to be negotiating with Kazakhstan on the Tesh-Tali in the Caspian Sea. Kazakhstan's southern neighbour Uzbekistan also recently reached agreement with the Stan Cornelius Consortium, a group of US investors, to develop its Mingbulak field, with estimated reserves of 800m barrels. Even before the break up of the Soviet Union, the Caucasian republic of Azerbaijan, which also has extensive reserves,selected US major Amoco, together with partners Unocal and McDermott, to develop the Azeri field in the Caspian Sea, together with local producer Kaspmorneftegaz. Most experts agree that it will be the end of the century or beyond before these new ventures start producing enough oil to influence world crude prices. But the development of the last great oil frontier is well under way. This is the final part of a series on the oil sector of the former Soviet Union. Earlier articles appeared on July 24 and 31. THE RUSSIAN government has exempted some joint ventures in the key oil and natural gas sector from tough export taxes, but western companies and energy advisers in Moscow said the new rules did not go far enough, reports Reuter from Moscow. The rules, applying to joint ventures set up before January 1, 1992, say firms will not have to pay the tax until they have fully recovered initial investments on energy projects. 'It is certainly better than nothing, but it means there is not much hope any more for ventures registered this year,' said Mr Richard Lewis of Ernst and Young Vneshaudit in Moscow. 'Newer joint ventures will still be looking for help,' said another Western adviser. 'It is prohibitive to conduct business here with export tariffs so high.'</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Thorntons It seems any excuse will do for Thorntons, which launched itself on the stock market with such high hopes four years ago. First, worries about a Labour election victory apparently stopped people buying chocolates for Mother's Day. Then, a Tory win suddenly stopped them buying Easter eggs for their children. Now, after a week or two of sunshine, the summer is too hot. All this may explain a likely profits fall of some 10 per cent in the current year. Another reason could be that the management was late in recognising that the recession would eventually hit confectionery too.</p>

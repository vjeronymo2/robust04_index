			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (17): In the doldrums - A look at banks and insurance ANDRE LEVY-LANG leaned back in his leather chair. 'This is a difficult time for all of us,' he said. 'The market is getting more and more competitive. Last year was tough and this year is not going to be easy.' A few weeks ago Mr Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, one of France's most prestigious investment banks, showed just how difficult last year had been when he announced that Paribas had made its first loss. The only source of solace for Paribas' chairman is that the other big French banks fared little better. Credit Lyonnais saw its profits fall after a sharp rise in client-risk provisions. Banque Indosuez suffered a slide in profits. Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale both returned to profits growth, but neither managed to return to 1989 levels. The big French insurers were in a similar position. Axa, the largest private sector insurer, saw its profits fall as did Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled company which is the biggest single player in French insurance. Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), the other state-controlled insurers, both reported static profits. The reasons for this litany of lacklustre results vary from company to company, but the broad picture is much the same. France's big banks and insurers have been hit by the effects of the economic slowdown on their fledgling international operations and on their property holdings in France. They are also still struggling to come to terms with life on lower margins in their increasingly competitive domestic market. Dispiriting though this scenario may seem, the performance of the French financial groups seems positively sparkling compared with that of their recession-struck competitors in the UK and, until recently, in the US. With the exception of Credit Lyonnais, which is now paying the price for its aggressive loans and expansion policy in the late 1980s, the French banking industry is seen by analysts as strong and stable. In spite of the rapid rise in provisions last year, charges as a proportion of total loans are still far lower for the French banks, including Credit Lyonnais, than for the British and American banks. Similarly, the French banks have made impressive progress at responding to growing competition by cutting costs and restructuring retail networks. The French insurers are also seen as solid, well-managed companies. They have been hit by the problems of the Paris property market and by ferocious competition on pricing - and profitability - in the non-life sector. But the life market is relatively healthy and seems set for further growth once the government's private pension plans come to fruition. Moreover, France's insurance groups have been remarkably successful at warding off foreign competition. This may be more difficult in the future, particularly if the French market follows the pattern set in the UK, by moving away from the old system whereby insurers sell through networks of exclusive agents, to direct sales, which may make it easier for new players. Both the banking and insurance industries face the prospect of fierce competition. The banks, for instance, are as concerned about the expansion plans of the French post office as by the threat of foreign competition. However, the past performance of banks and insurers at containing costs and re-orienting their operations suggests they are in reasonable shape to face their new competitors. These developments come at a time of broader changes in the role of France's financial institutions, specifically of their relationship with the state. Traditionally, the big banks and insurers have played a pivotal part in the French government's involvement in industry, directly as state-controlled institutions in their own right, and indirectly through the influence they exert as important investors in other companies. Times are changing. The days when the public sector banks, BNP and Credit Lyonnais, were at the beck and call of the French government are over. The marked difference between the measured policies adopted by BNP and Credit Lyonnais' aggressive expansion is testimony to the degree of autonomy they enjoy. From time to time both banks still take on large portions of other state-controlled companies. But BNP is believed to have argued for - and won  -more favourable terms from the government for its acquisition of a tranche of Air France shares last summer. This new, more distant relationship is influenced as much by the commercial constraints of operating in the modern banking industry - where BNP and Credit Lyonnais have to comply with international capital standards, whether or not it suits their largest shareholder - as by changes in government thinking. The relationship may become even more distant in the future, particularly if BNP and Credit Lyonnais follow Societe Generale by going into the private sector or if, like the insurance companies, they become part of the government's partial privatisation programme. President Mitterrand's announcement last summer that the government would sell off minority stakes in state-controlled companies in a series of partial privatisations, heralded a new phase of French industrial policy. The insurers - UAP, AGF and GAN - were named among the first candidates for partial privatisation. It is still not clear what form the share sales will take and whether the insurers themselves will be able to raise capital for their own use, but the government has already tabled legislation to allow it to reduce its holding to 51 per cent.</p>

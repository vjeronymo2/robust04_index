			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast; passages within quotation </F> marks recorded]    [Text] Socorro Diaz Palacios, deputy secretary for Civil  Protection and Social Prevention and Readaptation, released a  communique issued by the Government, National Defense, and  Social Development Secretariats and the Attorney General's  Office, clarifying that the attack by armed groups on four  Chiapas State municipalities is not an Indian uprising.    [Diaz] "This is not an Indian uprising. In the past few days  various Indian and peasant communities in the four  municipalities have rejected and taken action against this armed  group."    She said the armed group is comprised of two different  elements.    [Diaz] "There is a professional leadership, expert in  leading  violent and terrorist acts, well-educated, made up of both  Mexicans and foreigners. The leadership has high-powered  weapons and uses sophisticated communications equipment. The  others are Indians and peasants, many no older than 14 or 15,  with deficient education and training, armed with machetes,  shotguns, or small caliber weapons."    She explained that the four municipal capitals are now  secure, but the radical group continues harassing the Army.  This is why security measures are being reinforced.    [Diaz] "The government is making an enormous effort to  assure  that the effect on civilians of these attacks be an minimal as  possible."    She spoke of specific instructions for civilian defense.    [Diaz] "There will be no arbitrary actions or violations of  rights. Those who violate these principles will be punished  according to law."    Socorro Diaz explained that the government has publicly  accepted the call by the Chiapas bishops and the Evangelical  Church asking that the violence end and that human life be  respected.    [Diaz] "The armed aggressor group has said nothing; their  reply has been to continue the violence. The Army is fulfilling  its constitutional obligation of preserving peace, ensuring  domestic security, and protecting the population in their  villages."    Diaz reiterated the government's recognition of backward  conditions and a history of abuses and neglect in Chiapas. For  this reason the government was forced to be extremely prudenct.    [Diaz] "The government did all it could to avoid violence."    She said that in 1993 there were clashes between the Army  and  the radical group on three occasions, but the Army's preventive  measures were discontinued at the request of non-government  organizations. Increased dialogue was then pursued, as were  social and economic solutions for the area.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LAST HURRAH;  </P> <P> FOR ABDUL-JABBAR, A SEASON OF FAREWELLS WILL BE CAPPED TODAY  </P> <P> Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.  </P> <P>  -- Philosopher Soren Kierkegaard  </P> <P> Not known as a sentimentalist, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has mostly acted the part of  courteous house guest while being treated as a visiting dignitary during a  six-month farewell tour that has visited every sector of the country.  </P> <P> Protocol has been strictly observed. Gifts have been given the retiring Laker  center, platitudes exchanged, applause graciously accepted and, once in a  while, emotions revealed. Except for truly touching moments in New York, his  hometown, and Milwaukee, where he began his professional career, the tour has  all been so nice and polite, so businesslike and structured. But Abdul-Jabbar  is home now. The 24 tour stops are behind him. This afternoon, Abdul-Jabbar  will play his final regular-season game in the National Basketball Assn. when  the Lakers meet the Seattle SuperSonics at the Forum. Game time is 12:30, but  the ceremony honoring Abdul-Jabbar will begin at 11:45 a.m.  </P> <P> Maybe today, in a familiar and friendly setting, in front of fans who always  have embraced him, Abdul-Jabbar will reveal some of his previously undisplayed  feelings.  </P> <P> The Lakers have not announced details of today's ceremony. This being Los  Angeles, though, it certainly figures to be a spectacle. But just Abdul-Jabbar  and microphone at midcourt no doubt would be emotional and memorable.  </P> <P> Will his goggles get misty?  </P> <P> Will he be able make it through a speech that has taken him 20 seasons to  write?  </P> <P> Or will he, as usual, keep his emotions to himself? Abdul-Jabbar, quite  naturally, said he does not know how he will react. It is not something he  wants to predict or predetermine, he said.  </P> <P> "That's going to be a tough one," Abdul-Jabbar said, evenly, when questioned  about his farewell stop on the farewell tour. "Very tough. Probably, it will  (be emotional). I don't know.  </P> <P> "Most of (the acceptance speeches) have been extemporaneous. A few things come  into my mind before I get up to speak, things I can relate to the city. But (in  Los Angeles), I don't know. I'll probably write a few things down, just to  remember people to thank."  </P> <P> Teammate and friend Magic Johnson, however, said he will have a tough time  controlling his emotions. He said he cannot imagine what Abdul-Jabbar's  feelings will be.  </P> <P> "These people know him and really, truly are saying goodby and thank you from  their hearts," Johnson said. "Everybody else did it from their hearts, too, but  our fans know Kareem. It's going to be powerful and emotional."  </P> <P> This, of course, will not be his last game. The playoffs start this week and,  when Abdul-Jabbar actually does play his final professional game -- as soon as  early May or as late as June 20 -- it will be secondary to the Lakers' quest  for a third consecutive championship.  </P> <P> "I think that's the best course of events that I'd be comfortable with,"  Abdul-Jabbar said. "That's what this whole season is all about, trying to play  for the world championship. My last year is secondary."  </P> <P> A player of Abdul-Jabbar's caliber, the NBA's all-time leading scorer and  considered by some as its greatest player ever, should not be allowed to slip  into retirement unnoticed. That was the motivation behind the farewell tour,  proposed by the NBA office last summer and gladly accepted by Abdul-Jabbar.  </P> <P> Several themes have emerged in Abdul-Jabbar's 20th, and final, season. But,  essentially, the tour has fostered a better understanding between a 7-foot-2  enigma and a public that seemingly had been puzzling to Abdul-Jabbar.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar has been quoted nationwide more in the last year than perhaps in  his previous career, spanning from Power Memorial High School in New York to  UCLA to the NBA. Most certainly, he has never heard as many cheers and so few  heckles.  </P> <P> And, rather than consider it a chore, Abdul-Jabbar said he viewed the tour as  an opportunity to communicate. And, as a result, he will leave without rancor  and even with a measure of affection for the fans.  </P> <P> "My opinion (of the public) really hasn't changed that much from recent years,"  Abdul-Jabbar said. "There was just no vehicle by which I could express it  before. I was expecting problems (on the tour). I didn't think I'd have enough  time to do it. But it was always at a convenient time, and it hasn't been a  disruption to the team."  </P> <P> Along the way, Abdul-Jabbar also has acquired enough gifts to exceed a  game-show host's wildest dreams, enough special moments and encounters to fill  a book. Which, by the way, Abdul-Jabbar is writing.  </P> <P> He has been kissed by singer Whitney Houston and the ubiquitous Morganna,  serenaded by saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. and lauded by such diverse  dignitaries as Julius Erving, Red Auerbach and Jesse Jackson.  </P> <P> He has been given enough jazz compact discs to stock a record store, enough  portraits of himself to have his own showing on New York's East side, two  different modes of transportation -- a motorcycle and a sailboat -- and a wide  assortment of knickknacks. The farewell tour, however, did hit a few obstacles.  </P> <P> There was Abdul-Jabbar's poor play early in the season, during which two  prominent Los Angeles columnists called for his early retirement. Abdul-Jabbar  blamed it on poor off-season conditioning and an early-season knee injury, and  it almost prompted Coach Pat Riley to bench a legend.  </P> <P> There was the controversy over whether it was the right decision to add  Abdul-Jabbar to the All-Star game when Magic Johnson suffered a torn hamstring.  At about that same time, Denver Coach Doug Moe called Abdul-Jabbar a jerk and  questioned the purpose of a farewell tour in his honor.  </P> <P> There also was Abdul-Jabbar's conviction on two misdemeanor charges of assault  stemming from a shoving incident at a Phoenix shopping mall a year ago. On  sentencing day, half a dozen mini-cams taped Abdul-Jabbar's procession to and  from the courtroom. "I don't think any of those things affected it,"  Abdul-Jabbar said when asked to sum up his season. "I didn't expect things to  go without any bumps in the road. That's the way this game is."  </P> <P> The game, nearly all observers agree, will not be the same without him.  </P> <P> That is why, for the last six months, he has been honored from Charlotte to  Seattle, Boston to Phoenix, all leading to this afternoon's ceremony in  Inglewood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE LONG GOODBY  </P> <P>  Maybe this will be the last time we shake hands.  </P> <P>  Maybe this will be the last time we make plans.  </P> <P>  But whatever happens, Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  </P> <P>  -- Abdul-Jabbar, quoting James Brown to fans at Madison Square Garden  </P> <P> To Abdul-Jabbar, it sometimes must seem that the farewell tour has been the  closest thing to being at his own funeral, what with the praise from close  friends and admirers. Retirement, after all, has been called the little death  that awaits all athletes.  </P> <P> Viewed a different way, though, this also could be Abdul-Jabbar's graduation to  the outside world after 33 years of organized basketball. Thus, the farewell  tour has been his valediction.  </P> <P> The routine has gone like this:  </P> <P> The ceremonies have taken place either before the game's start or at halftime.  A microphone has been put at midcourt, along with the gifts and the lineup of  well-wishers. Newspaper photographers and television cameramen have formed a  half-circle around the make-shift stage. Abdul-Jabbar either has waited with  his Laker teammates until the kind words have been spoken and he has been  summoned, or he has joined the master of ceremonies at the start.  </P> <P> The requisite, yet not contrived, standing ovation usually has lasted about a  minute, with Abdul-Jabbar shyly bobbing his bald head and giving an open-handed  -- fingers spread out, thumb tucked in -- acknowledgement to the crowd. Then,  it is Abdul-Jabbar's turn to speak.  </P> <P> His speeches have had a distinct pattern. Abdul-Jabbar almost always has  thanked the host city for its support of the NBA and helping it grow into a  major sport. In sites where he has been particularly dominant figure, such as  New York, Boston and Philadelphia, Abdul-Jabbar invariably has referred to  himself as "the villain." In Utah, he used the cartoon variation, Snidely  Whiplash.  </P> <P> He has creatively found a way to personalize each stop. It is easier to  excavate memories in some cities than others. In two cases, expansion cities  Charlotte and Miami, there were no memories to relive.  </P> <P> Some of Abdul-Jabbar's referances are obscure and date him. Some are stretches.  But many are rare glimpses into Abdul-Jabbar's thoughts and feelings.  </P> <P> A few of the highlights:  </P> <P>  -- New York, Abdul-Jabbar's hometown, was the scene of the most emotional  ceremony. Abdul-Jabbar's parents, Al and Cora Alcindor, were present, as were  many friends and influences from Abdul-Jabbar's childhood.  </P> <P>  -- Philadelphia's 22-minute ceremony featured a nine-minute sax solo by  Washington, who fittingly chose to play Duke Ellington's "In A Sentimental  Mood." Julius Erving, a close friend of Abdul-Jabbar, served as master of  ceremonies and called Abdul-Jabbar "the greatest player in NBA history."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar thanked the fans by quoting Ellington: "I love you madly."  </P> <P>  -- In Milwaukee, a photograph for eternity: Abdul-Jabbar astride a champagne  gold motorcycle built at the Harley-Davidson plant there and presented to him  after a sentimental look back on his tenure as a Buck. He sat there for a few  moments, giving the OK sign to fan. Asked at every tour stop to name his  favorite gift, Abdul-Jabbar would smile and unhesitatingly say, "It's hard to  beat the Harley.  </P> <P> "Actually, I had a Harley for a couple of years when I lived in Milwaukee, but  when I went to L.A., I had to get rid of it. I was afraid I'd get killed riding  it on the freeways."  </P> <P>  -- The villain angle was never more apt than in Boston, where Abdul-Jabbar has  been lustily booed over the years. Red Auerbach served as emcee and actually  was civil to Abdul-Jabbar, whom Auerbach had criticized in one Boston paper  that morning.  </P> <P> "How can I get mad at him now?" Auerbach asked the crowd before presenting  Abdul-Jabbar a mounted slab of the Boston Garden's parquet court.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar, who said the Lakers' championship victory in Boston in 1985 is  his most memorable achievement, credited Auerbach and Bill Russell for his  development as a player. "I didn't know anything about this game," Abdul-Jabbar  told the crowd. "I used to watch the team wearing green and a guy on the team  wearing No. 6. He taught me how to play the game. And they had a guy who smoked  cigars. And I never would have learned how to play the game had it not been for  the Celtic teams of the '50s and '60s."  </P> <P>  -- Utah went with the Western theme. The Jazz gave Abdul-Jabbar an 1886  commemorative Winchester rifle, custom-made rattlesnake boots, a rattlesnake  belt with the state seal on the silver buckle, a leather jacket and made him an  honorary deputy sheriff of Salt Lake County.  </P> <P> A month later in Phoenix, he was sentenced for his misdemeanor convictions the  morning after his tour stop at the Veterans Coliseum.  </P> <P> Addressing the fans, Abdul-Jabbar looked around at his gifts and said: "I was  told there would be another gift here, a get-out-of-jail-free card."  </P> <P>  -- A look of genuine surprise crossed Abdul-Jabbar's face during the Golden  State Warriors' ceremony, when he was presented with a 24-foot sailboat, which  was lowered from the ceiling. It was christened, Cap's Sky Hook.  </P> <P> The most frequent gifts were jazz records. Abdul-Jabbar was literally given  wheelbarrows full of CDs. It got to the point that Lorin Pullman,  Abdul-Jabbar's personal publicist, discouraged teams from further supplementing  his overflowing collection. "After about the seventh city with CDs, I did  discourage it," she said. "Only because I think he has every CD in jazz ever  made to this point. . . . But we'd never look a gift horse in the mouth, so to  speak."  </P> <P> A gift horse is about the only thing Abdul-Jabbar has not received.  </P> <P> Gifts have appealed to Abdul-Jabbar as both the athlete and the aesthete. They  have ranged from an African sculpture of an elephant -- the symbol of dignity,  longevity and strength -- appraised at $10,000, to a portable telephone, to the  obligatory rocking chair. He also has received golf clubs and a fishing rod  with 10,000 hooks. As pastimes, golf and fishing rank with cleaning the rain  gutters at Abdul-Jabbar's Bel-Air home. He graciously accepted them, anyway.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar, through corporate sponsorship by L.A. Gear, has donated $1,000 in  each city to a charity of the host team's choice.  </P> <P> But, what has Abdul-Jabbar done with all the gifts?  </P> <P> "I've asked them to be shipped to our offices," Pullman said. "Or, if they are  too big, they go to the Forum (and then) to Kareem's house.  </P> <P> "The Harley is still at the dealership in L.A. The boat is in L.A., but it'll  go to Kareem's place in Hawaii. I don't know how it'll get there, exactly."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar says the gifts are not what he remembers most, though.  </P> <P> "The gifts have been great," he said. "The appreciation has been great. That's  really what it's all about. I really wasn't into getting all the gifts and  stuff like that. That really wasn't the emphasis. I think sharing the moment  with the fans and being able to share their appreciation one time. And I think  I've gotten my message across."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MUCH TO DECLARE  </P> <P>  Well, it's all right, Even if you're old and gray.  </P> <P>  Well, it's all right, You've still got something to say.  </P> <P>  -- The Traveling Wilburys  </P> <P> By Abdul-Jabbar's admission, his humanization began in 1983 with the  publication of his autobiography, "Giant Steps."  </P> <P> Since then, Abdul-Jabbar has opened up a bit. He has been candid and mostly  cooperative during news conferences in every NBA city.  </P> <P> Although sometimes he heads directly from the airport to a news conference at a  hotel without even dropping his suitcase, Abdul-Jabbar answers questions  thoughtfully, if not always enthusiastically.  </P> <P> He has shared opinions on such diverse subjects as:  </P> <P>  -- His public perception: "People resented me. I don't know why, but people  have their ways. I was never what you'd call a popular person because of the  fact I became a Muslim and I believed in black pride, and people seemed to  think I had a chip on my shoulder. I didn't, but sometimes what you think is  there can be a very formidable thing. I guess it soured my relationship with  the press and made it very easy for them to attach any significance to what I  was doing on the court."  </P> <P>  -- On retiring with dignity: "I remember being in New York and watching Willie  Mays at the end of his career, playing for the Mets. He wasn't playing well,  and it made me feel bad, because I idolized him."  </P> <P>  -- On the media: "I don't see strangers as attackers any longer, don't feel  they're out to tear down what I've accomplished."  </P> <P>  -- On living in Milwaukee: "I remember there was a window facing north in my  apartment. I came home one night and pulled the curtains, and that window was  just a solid sheet of ice. I said to myself, 'Oh, my goodness.' "  </P> <P>  -- On agreeing to a farewell tour: "Five years ago, I couldn't have imagined  doing this. I wasn't ready for it."  </P> <P>  -- On playing with Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson: "I was able to play with  three of the top five playmakers in NBA history. Oscar, Guy Rodgers and Magic.  I try to think of a good analogy for that -- like if you had a talent for  electronics and got a chance to work with Thomas Edison. That's the way I  feel."  </P> <P>  -- On reminders of his age: "Coach Don Chaney (of the Houston Rockets) is a  good friend of mine. His kids, I remember 12 years ago when he was with the  Lakers. Now, one's in college. My friend Greg Smith (a former teammate with the  Bucks), his son is the starting guard for Cal. And I'm still playing in the  NBA."  </P> <P>  -- On his most cherished memory as a professional: "Winning the world  championship in Boston in 1985. That we were able to go up there and beat them  in the Boston Garden was very special.  </P> <P> "The Lakers had a long history of them kicking sand in our faces, dating back  to the '50s. We'd won world championships, but we'd never beaten them. And we'd  been characterized as a bunch of West Coast pansy-types playing sissy kind of  basketball. . . . Winning that one, and being a key ingredient in doing that,  being able to raise our hands underneath all those banners, that's something  I'll always remember."  </P> <P>  -- On how he would like to be remembered: "I hope they remember my consistency  and the high level I played at. . . . I think people can now understand me and  what I'm about. They can see I'm more or less a regular person."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MEDIA MARRIAGE  </P> <P>  It was a marriage composed of spats, mutual disappointments, and, toward the  end, a mellowing hoard of shared memories. It fell into three stages, which may  be termed Youth, Maturity, and Age; Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis; or  Jason, Achilles, and Nestor.  </P> <P>  -- Author John Updike on Ted Williams' last game  </P> <P> Ted Williams, a baseball player Abdul-Jabbar followed while growing up, never  made his peace with the media. In fact, in his farewell appearance at Fenway  Park on Sept. 28, 1960, Williams began his speech by pointing to the press box  and saying, "In spite of all the terrible things that have been said about me  by the knights of the keyboard up there . . . "  </P> <P> Had Abdul-Jabbar retired five years ago, he might have given a similar speech,  providing he agreed to speak at all. He has battled long and fiercely with  sportswriters and, in his book, questioned their intelligence.  </P> <P> Gradually, though, he has built a trust. Now, his relationship can be described  as cordially professional. As Billie Jean King once said, "If you stay around  long enough, they'll start to like you."  </P> <P> Well, judging from the press clippings of the farewell tour, Abdul-Jabbar still  is drawing mixed reviews. His talent and longevity have been duly recognized,  his new openness praised.  </P> <P> But many columnists seemingly cannot forget his years as a sullen public  figure.  </P> <P> After Abdul-Jabbar had played his last regular-season game against the 76ers,  columnist Bill Conlin wrote in the Philadelphia Daily News:  </P> <P> "Abdul-Jabbar is making one of those magical mystery tours that have become  obligatory in sports when a legend comes limping down the homestretch. It is  good business, I suppose, but isn't there something a tad hypocritical about  giving a night to one of the guys we loved to hate above all others for two  decades?  </P> <P> "Grover Washington Jr. . . . saluted Abdul-Jabbar with a silky arrangement of  "In A Sentimental Mood." "Mood Indigo" might have been a better summary of  Kareem, however."  </P> <P> Conlin was not alone.  </P> <P> This from Buck Harvey of the San Antonio Light:  </P> <P> "There is a big lie being told about the Big Fella, and it's that we are  misty-eyed because he's hanging up his goggles. . . . Ask most fans, and they  wouldn't pitch in to buy him a going-away stick of gum. . . . He's been cordial  on the farewell tour, but that doesn't make up for two decades of being  America's tallest, coldest fish. He summed up everything wrong about the NBA in  the 1970s. He was too good, too big, too indifferent."  </P> <P> Mostly, though, Abdul-Jabbar has won over reporters, who have dutifully paid  tribute to his achievements and place in the game's history as well as noting  his change in attitude.  </P> <P> From Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post:  </P> <P> "Kareem's personality has changed, too. For so much of his career, the brief  eye contact he granted the public was remote and disdainful. He seems gentler,  more approachable, even friendly. . . . Vulnerability is the only way a great  center can be liked -- let alone loved."  </P> <P> From Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer: "Depending on your view, he is a  relic, an anachronism, an institution, too lazy, too slow, too bored, too tall,  too much. What he is, without question, is a certified geriatric marvel. . . .  He has elevated those around him to a higher plane."  </P> <P> So it seems that Abdul-Jabbar and the writers have reached a truce.  </P> <P> Or, at least, some have.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOUR STOP 18A  </P> <P>  I make my living off the evening news.  </P> <P>  Just give me something, something I can use.  </P> <P>  -- Don Henley  </P> <P> They lugged their mini-cams and microphones, note pads and zoom lenses, down  the courthouse steps and through a well-lighted corridor in search of Room 17,  Municipal Judge John L. Wiehn presiding.  </P> <P> It was just before 8 on a Wednesday morning in late March, and every media  outlet in Phoenix, plus a three-member crew from "Entertainment Tonight" and  several reporters from Los Angeles, had gathered at the Phoenix Municipal Court  for the sentencing phase of a trial that had drawn much attention in preceding  weeks.  </P> <P> This was not a controversial decision on a heinous crime. It was the People vs.  Abdul-Jabbar.  </P> <P> Earlier in the month, the defendant had been convicted on two misdemeanor  charges stemming from an altercation with an Italian tourist last April at a  Phoenix shopping mall. The man, Fernando Nicolia, had been taping  Abdul-Jabbar's movements with a home video camera when the Laker center knocked  it away. The man suffered a scratched ear, and the video camera had been  damaged.  </P> <P> Because Abdul-Jabbar is who he is, and because the night before he had been  honored by the Phoenix Suns as part of his farewell tour, this was a media  event, a photo opportunity not to be missed.  </P> <P> There were three entrances to Room 17, which would be closed to photographers  and the mini-cams, but not to reporters, during the sentencing. So, to ensure  maximum exposure of Abdul-Jabbar, who had not been present during the trial,  all sectors were covered and any sightings were to be relayed. It apparently  was an unspoken professional courtesy.  </P> <P> One TV cameraman was standing on a chair awaiting Abdul-Jabbar's arrival.  </P> <P> "If I'm on the floor, he's so tall, I have to shoot upward and all I'd get  would be his nostrils," the cameraman explained. "I don't want the nostril  shot."  </P> <P> Just before 8:30, when Abdul-Jabbar was scheduled to appear, the elevator doors  opened. Lights from the mini-cams and flashes from cameras illuminated not  Abdul-Jabbar and attorney but a court clerk carrying a file under her arm.  </P> <P> When Abdul-Jabbar and entourage finally appeared, it was through a side door,  not the elevator. At the first sighting, the shouts echoed through the hall,  reminiscent of a scene from "The Front Page."  </P> <P> Flanked by attorneys and escorted by two policemen, Abdul-Jabbar appeared in a  dark blue suit with matching sunglasses. The cameras followed his every move.  At one point, a backpedaling cameraman knocked over a metal trash can.  Abdul-Jabbar briefly turned to see what the commotion was about.  </P> <P> Once inside, Abdul-Jabbar removed his sunglasses. He rose when told to,  answered a few questions from Judge Wiehn with one-word acknowledgements and  approached the bench to sign a document after sentence was imposed.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar was fined $500 and told to pay $834.35 in restitution for the  damaged camera. It was over in six minutes, less time than the farewell  ceremony had taken at the Veterans Coliseum the previous evening.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar's exit from the courtroom to a waiting limousine was similar to  his entrance. Only this time, reporters shouted requests for comments from  Abdul-Jabbar, who ignored them.  </P> <P> Making sure Abdul-Jabbar was seated in the limousine, attorney Leonard Armato  spoke with the reporters. After a few minutes, the crowd had dispersed.  </P> <P> Said one local reporter, "I guess it wouldn't have been a good time to ask for  his autograph."  </P> <P> Asked three weeks later about the courthouse scene, Abdul-Jabbar softly said,  "There's nothing you can do about that."  </P> <P> THE AFTER-LIFE  </P> <P> If you make it to age 35 and your job still involves wearing a name tag, you've  probably made a serious vocational error.  </P> <P>  -- Comedian Dennis Miller  </P> <P> In the blink of an eye, Abdul-Jabbar will be out of our lives.  </P> <P> Sure, he still will be somewhat visible endorsing a shoe company. But, in terms  of public viewing, his last playoff game this season probably will be the last  time he will be seen for a while.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar has often talked about stretching out on a beach chair at his home  in Hawaii with a tall, cool drink and an engrossing book, soaking in the sun  and the restorative power of solitude.  </P> <P> It figures to be a time for both reflection on his just-completed career and  planning for the future.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar is vague about his plans.  </P> <P> He said he wants to resume his fledgling acting career -- "I'd like to star in  a movie with Meryl Streep; she is a fantastic actress," Abdul-Jabbar said --  and attempt to produce projects. He said he would like to do a film adaptation  of "Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans."  </P> <P> A book chronicling his final season, written with Mignon McCarthy, is scheduled  to be published by Random House in the fall.  </P> <P> And, Abdul-Jabbar said, he plans to work in public service to promote literacy  among youth, and also wants to spend more time with his children.  </P> <P> A career on the periphery of basketball apparently does not interest him at  all. He said we won't -- for a while, at least -- see him coaching, in the  broadcast booth and, definitely, not in old-timers' games.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar's lawsuit against Tom Collins, the former agent who Abdul-Jabbar  claims bilked him out of most of his assets, still is pending but  Abdul-Jabbar's advisers say he is solvent. Nancy Sarnoff, who handles  Abdul-Jabbar's endorsements and marketing, said he has as many endorsements as,  if not more than, most athletes. Plus, he earned $3 million from the Lakers  this season.  </P> <P> So, Abdul-Jabbar apparently will not be forced to exploit his fame to support  himself, something he detests.  </P> <P> "I've played organized basketball since I was in fourth grade," Abdul-Jabbar  said.

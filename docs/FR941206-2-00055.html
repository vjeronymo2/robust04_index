			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Assistance will be provided only to the March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation, White Plains, New York for this project. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation is the most appropriate and qualified institution to conduct the work under this grant for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Genetic Testing and Gene Therapy Survey, completed in 1992, was commissioned, managed, and disseminated by the March of Dimes. Based on 1,000 telephone interviews with a cross section of adults, the survey has been instrumental in the development of public policy and educational interventions since its release. The experience gained by the March of Dimes during the conduct of this national survey makes it the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  national volunteer organization with the level of expertise required to undertake and disseminate an analogous survey of reproductive-age women's awareness of folic acid and other pregnancy-related issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The history of success of the research efforts supported by the March of Dimes is incomparable. The March of Dimes has played a key role in significant advances in the understanding and prevention of birth defects since Dr. Jonas Salk, with funding from the March of Dimes, developed the vaccine that led to the conquest of polio in the 1950's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The March of Dimes is the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> volunteer organization which has as its primary goal the improvement of the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. This organizational goal parallels the CDC's health promotion and prevention goals outlined in ``Healthy People 2000.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. During the promotion of preventions such as Polio, Rubella and Rh vaccines, a remarkable climate of trust was established between the March of Dimes and women of childbearing age. The credibility and name recognition earned by the March of Dimes through these past efforts greatly increases the likelihood that women will participate in an assessment of the level of knowledge and behavior regarding the consumption of folic acid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is not subject to the Executive Order 12372 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Health System Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 93.283.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Human Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the proposed project involves research on human subjects, the applicant must comply with the Department of Health and Human Services Regulations, 45 CFR Part 46, regarding the protection of human subjects.

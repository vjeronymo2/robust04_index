			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney's Saudi rescuer may enlarge 9.65% holding Prince Al-Waleed, the Saudi financier who earlier this year rode to the rescue of the ailing Euro Disney leisure group in its emergency financial restructuring, has emerged with a 9.65 per cent stake in the company. The prince is expected to augment this holding, which is owned by United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB), one of his main investment vehicles, by triggering agreements to buy additional Euro Disney shares from Walt Disney, its US parent, and Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state-controlled French financial institution. Prince Al-Waleed, a member of the Saudi royal family and one of the Middle East's most aggressive investors, stunned the stock market in early June by unveiling plans to acquire up to 24.63 per cent of Euro Disney. He undertook to buy any shares left on the market after the FFr6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) rights issue which was a vital component of the restructuring. Ironically, the prince's arrival boosted investor confidence and the rights issue was more heavily subscribed than many observers had expected. As a result, Prince Al-Waleed is likely to raise his stake through his agreements to buy additional shares from Walt Disney and the Caisse. He can acquire up to 5.22 per cent of Euro Disney from the Caisse at the rights issue price of FFr10.00 per share, and is also able to buy more shares from Walt Disney, to take the USCB stake up to its 24.63 per cent ceiling. Euro Disney is struggling to improve its performance, and there has been speculation that attendance levels at the EuroDisneyland theme park have been poor in the current financial year.</p>

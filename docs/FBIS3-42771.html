			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Comments by Duma members recorded by N. Mikhaylov: "Our Men </F> in the Duma: Impressions, Opinions, and Assessments From  Deputies Expressed After the Opening of the Yeltsin Parliament"]    [Text]  <H5>  Aman Tuleyev, Deputy of the Federation Council </H5>   I did not want to go to the elections knowing that they were  illegal. But still they were elections in which the people had  the right to vote, and I entered my candidacy. Why? In order to  appear here again, in Moscow, and tell the executive power: You  drove me away with tanks but I returned. I returned not by my  own wish. The people sent me--80 percent of all the voters of  the Kuzbass. I represent their interests, and I ask that you not  consider me--policy must be corrected for them and at their  behest.    My word of honor, right up until the first session of the  Federation Council I thought the bureaucrats would look out from  the Kremlin and Old Square at me and others like me and declare:  We are beginning to adjust our political course. We respect the  will of the voters who voted for a multitude of candidates from  the opposition and we are making a commitment to cooperate with  them. Well, you cannot go on endlessly with the same old song  and dance, which nobody wants to hear either in Siberia or  outside the Moscow Ring! It turns out that they can.    The regulations had not even been worked out properly before  the democrat Chernichenko demanded from the main microphone: We  must elect a chairman of the Federation Council--the world is  waiting. And they began to elect one. Shumeyko's candidacy never  got off the ground. And that same Chernichenko was turning  himself inside out: The repeat vote had to be postponed. The  world immediately stopped waiting for the chairman to appear  because it was necessary to lobby the deputies so that they  would look more favorably on Shumeyko.    I did not see how they twisted the arms of the deputies who  were hanging from the administrative hook. But I heard many  times: After Shumeyko had received 81 votes, and Romanov 79,  there were endless negotiations and dinner parties with the  deputies whose positions depended on the president and the  government. And the next day 17 more votes were cast for  Shumeyko.    The executive power drew no conclusions from the results of  the elections. Yeltsin's people grabbed tightly onto the  steering wheel, they do not intend to let anyone else get near  it, and they do not wish to turn in the direction of common  sense. I place my hopes in just one thing: There are quite a few  intelligent people in the Federation Council, including those  who have been granted power in the regions. And perhaps, taking  advantage of their deputy mandates, they will at least change  something in the country.  <H5>  Anatoliy Lukyanov, Deputy of the State Duma </H5>   I can see how little power the Duma has. I know how many  people want to stand in the way of its work. But I do not feel  pessimistic. The Duma did not end up in anyone's pocket. Judging  from the first days, the authorities should not count on  subduing it. That is the first thing that consoles me. And the  second thing is that the Duma, while elected according to  principles of purely Western parliamentarianism, did not abandon  the traditions of domestic democracy.    I came to politics when Molotov was still alive and well.  Much of our history is stamped on my memory. I can say that not  everything in it was bad and not everything needs to be  repudiated. The Duma has preserved the merits of the Soviet  system--the connection between the deputies and the labor  collectives, the use of the voters' mandate, and the possibility  of interaction among the deputies regarding territorial and  branch interests. But at the same time the Duma is a completely  new institution of power for us, where group and party interests  "rule the roost." I will not try to predict whether or not this  peculiarity will play a favorable role. But I think it is absurd  to find fault with the Duma and revile it from its very first  steps, as the democratic press is doing. The Duma should be  allowed to stay and work peacefully.  <H5>  Yuriy Lodkin, Deputy of the Federation Council </H5>   I was dismissed from the position of head of administration  of Bryansk Oblast the night before the House of Soviets was  fired upon. Let me emphasize: I was dismissed by an edict from  Yeltsin even though he did not appoint me; I was elected by all  the population of Bryansk Oblast. Since then I have been unable  to get a minute of air time either on oblast radio or on  television. The elections gave me the opportunity to have a  rostrum--to speak on the air and to meet with people. And for me  there was no question as to whether or not to participate in the  elections.    But after becoming a deputy to the Federal Assembly I still  think that the Federation Council and the State Duma are  temporary parallel organs of representative power along with the  now banned Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet.  To forget about their existence and about the way they were  removed from the political scene would mean to legitimize  arbitrary rule.    I thought that the meetings of our chamber, like the  meetings  of the State Duma, would begin with a detailed report on the  results of the referendum on the new Constitution. The figures  from this referendum for the various regions have not been made  public yet and, consequently, it has not been confirmed that  there was no falsification when the votes were counted in the  Central Electoral Commission.    But we have not managed to raise the question of verifying  the referendum in the chamber. They immediately began dividing  up portfolios, and in an unpardonable way. Just look at the  attempt to count Galazov's telegram as a vote in favor of  Shumeyko.    The executive power has obtained the main post in the  Federation Council. But I do not think that it will control it  completely and therefore I expect that fairly soon a campaign  will begin to defame the new deputy corps. And actually it has  even already begun.    As I was riding to the first meeting I heard on the radio in  the bus: $500 million has been allotted for the construction of  a new parliament center. How wonderful! They have not yet  managed to find $60 million to build a medical rehabilitation  center for the eight oblasts that were contaminated with  radiation from the Chernobyl disaster. But for the parliament  center--help yourself.    Listen, you sick and dying residents of Bryansk, your Deputy  Lodkin will be living and working in comfort while you are  quietly dying. From the very first days the deputies have been  acting like parasites, eating up the people's money. But will  this continue?  <H5>  Yuriy Vlasov, Deputy of the State Duma </H5>   The authorities did not get the State Duma they planned to  get. And now it is becoming clear that they will try to bury the  Duma. From the first days it was clear: The government faction  Russia's Choice are not at all squeamish about dragging out,  artificially complicating, and stultifying the work of the  chamber. What next? The democratic deputies will go over the  structures of executive power and start eating away at the Duma.  It is now written in the draft regulation that the chamber's  decisions will be made by half of its members. And I hope that  the Duma will avoid the kind of legitimized depopulation that  befell the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies.    In my opinion there are many strong and intelligent people  in  the Duma. The opposition factions and the deputy groups are  fairly heterogeneous. But regarding the major issues their  interests converge, and the Duma can solve the problems facing  it. And, without ingratiating themselves to the now almighty  executive power, it is important to preserve and protect the  Duma, for its existence is our guarantee of freedom of speech  and protection from arbitrary behavior and theft by the new  democratic nomenklatura.  <H5>  Petr Romanov, Deputy of the Federation Council </H5>   During the first two days, when I was running for the post  of  chairman of the chamber, along with Shumeyko, I was frequently  asked whether, if elected, I would be in conflict with the  government. I answered: I am against confrontation with anybody.  I came to the Federation Council to fight "for"--for a normal  course of reforms. And I think I and other deputies of the  Federation Council still have a chance to do this, regardless of  who heads up the chamber.    I began my work biography as a laborer and became the  manager  of an extremely large combine, having climbed all the steps on  the career ladder at my enterprise. I did my work to the glory  of the great Russian weapon during the years of the so-called  stagnation, and I am doing it now as well. After the reduction  of the defense orders our combine mastered the production of  several kinds paints and industrial lighting items and created  large shops for producing furniture. On the territory of the  combine we have 37 bath houses and 10 swimming pools for the  workers, we have 40,000 rose bushes, and we breed sturgeon.    I am mentioning all this in order to say that it is not one  system or another that decides everything. The people and their  ability to work decide everything. Therefore I am against all  kinds of jumps and leaps and about-faces, which can create  nothing but interference with normal work.    I am confident that my viewpoint is shared by all who are  doing their work and answering for its results. And there are  quite a few of these people in the Federation Council. It has a  chance to do something so that we can stop trembling from shock  therapy and so that the responsible producer will be protected.  But a very great deal will depend on who is in charge of the  chamber's activity, who is sitting on both sides of the  chairman, and who occupies the chairs of the committee  leaders--theoreticians with rosy pie-in-the-sky ideas or  practical people with immense work experience. Everything is  being decided by the cadres now.  <H5>  Aleksandr Nevzorov, Deputy to the State Duma </H5>   There are more of our people in the Duma. Our people are  smarter and stronger. But those who oppose the opposition are  pure hooligans who see their role as subverting, talking to  death, and impeding all of the Duma's work. We can and should  stop and silence the members of Democratic Russia. And the main  thing is that we must make sure that the people know about  everything that is done in the Duma. In brief, we must have  television broadcasting from the Duma, for otherwise it will  become a puppet theater in some remote location.  <H5>  Vasiliy Starodubtsev, Deputy to the Federation Council </H5>   I came to the Federation Council for one purpose--to put a  stop to the insanity of the so-called reformers, to stop the  destruction, disintegration, and theft they are perpetrating. As  a peasant farmer who has already been severely burned by  politics, it is rather unpleasant for me to crawl back here. But  I cannot sit with my hands folded and be silent and watch how  our immense production potential accumulated over the decades is  being shattered and how thieves in the bureaucracy are making  off with public property bit by bit.    The composition of the Federation Council is fairly complex.  According to my extremely rough estimates, half of the deputies  are people who, as before, are hungering to destroy everything  and close their eyes to the thievery, and the other half are  those who are against both extremes and want normal reforms. The  former half are better organized. The election of the chairman  of the chamber showed that.    When Shumeyko was nominated to the post of chairman, I spoke  out and said: Arguments have been given here as to why Vladimir  Filippovich deserves to be chairman, including that he has an  excellent knowledge of the political kitchen. And there are not  many people like this in the Federation Council. In my view,  Shumeyko is not only an expert on this kitchen but is also one  of the most talented cooks in it, who will successfully prepare  a broth that will poison a large part of the country's  population.    After all, everyone can see the results of Shumeyko's  activity in the government. But they are making him the number  one man in the upper chamber of parliament. And now how can this  chamber demand answers from the government when it is headed by  one of the top government bureaucrats?    It seems to me that the future of the Federation Council is  fairly cloudy. I have no grounds for thinking that reason will  inevitably take the upper hand in the chamber, but one can still  hope for this. There are both experienced managers and talented  administrators in the Chamber and it is possible that their  patience and submissiveness will run out sooner or later.  <H5>  Sergey Baburin, Deputy of the State Duma </H5>   The spectrum of political forces in the Duma reflects fairly  precisely the attitudes of various social strata in society. The  number of supporters and opponents of the government in the  chamber in terms of percentages is approximately the same as it  was in the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies.  During the recesses between the sessions when I see the restored  building of the House of Soviets I ask myself: Why did Yeltsin  have to start shooting and spill the blood of hundreds of  people? Was it not so that the authorities could steal the  property of the Supreme Soviet and make money on repair  contracts?    The organization of the work in the Duma went much more  quickly than when the Supreme Soviet was established. The  experience in parliamentary procedure was in evidence here. The  disorder among representatives of various factions and deputy  groups, it seems to me, will soon come to an end. There will be  a consolidation according to interests and the position of the  majority of the Duma will be clearly demonstrated. In spite of  my expectations, the formation of the deputy group of patriots  called the Russian Way is proceeding fairly successfully now. As  of today it has more than 20 deputies, and I do not rule out the  possibility that this group in conjunction with representatives  of other groups and factions will make up the patriotic majority  of the Duma.  <H5>  Nikolay Gonchar, Deputy of the Federation Council </H5>   According to plan, the Federation Council should be an organ  of conciliation--conciliation between the executive power and  the Duma, whose laws it is supposed to ratify. But what have we  seen during the first days? Deputies of the Federation Council  are unable to reach an agreement on regulations and they were  split right down the middle in the election of the chairman.  What kind of conciliation can there be when they have to  approve, say, the principles of the tax policy? Here branch,  regional, and political interests immediately make themselves  known. And how can they adopt anything if each deputy votes only  according to his own scenario?    We need to learn the art of compromise. That is the main  condition without which the Federation Council cannot exist as  the upper chamber of parliament. And to learn to compromise is a  quite realistic task. But we must remember that compromise  requires talent and work.  <H5>  Mikhail Lapshin, Deputy of the State Duma </H5>   Even at the first session one could see the aggressiveness  and destructiveness of deputies from Russia's Choice, who took  the presidium literally by storm trying in spite of all rules of  decorum to dislodge the presiding elder of the Duma. The  aggressiveness of Russia's Choice shows its powerlessness.    The alignment of forces in the Duma was clearly not to the  advantage of the pro-government bloc, and the results of the  voting showed this. The Duma did not allow them to create a  multitude of small factions and it thwarted attempts to use all  kinds of regroupings to subject it to endless shakeups. By now  we have every possibility of working constructively and  fulfilling the promises we made to our constituents.  <H5>  Vitaliy Sevastyanov, Deputy of the State Duma </H5>   The Duma has many fewer rights than the former parliament of  the Russian Federation. In the Supreme Soviet and at the  Congress of People's Deputies it lost essentially everything it  could lose, and when it came to its senses it was back where it  started: All the levers of power had been seized by the  president and the government.    But now that the opposition has a clear idea of what it  needs  and what it does not need and organizationally it is completely  combat ready, even with modest authority it is quite capable of  having a real effect on politics.  <H5>  Gennadiy Zyuganov, Deputy of the State Duma </H5>   I dare say that three-fourths of our present deputy corps  are  people with common sense, who understand that the country has  reached the edge of a precipice and that it must be saved not  according to schemes from across the sea but taking into account  the real circumstances of our life.    During the past year Russian society has been experiencing a  difficult recovery of mental health and public opinion has  changed to the favor of state-patriotic forces. This is  confirmed both by the composition of the Duma and by the results  of the first votes in it.    Even in the Russia's Choice bloc, the bloc that was  conceived  and created in order to justify presidential policy regardless  of anything else, one can see quite healthy motives for  behavior. Russia's Choice did not succeed as a monolithic  pro-presidential faction. It contains people who are inclined to  reassess the values imposed on society, and it is possible to  cooperate with them.    I think the Duma's open opposition to the executive power  will soon be a fait accompli. Will it perhaps share the fate of  the disbanded Supreme Soviet? Quite possibly. But the Duma's  viability will depend only on itself. If during the first weeks  of its work it demonstrates fidelity to the will of the voters  and proves its ability to develop a policy of common sense,  there will not be another version of Edict No. 1400.    The authority of the Duma is with the people--this is the  only thing that can save parliamentarianism in Russia. Will we  win this authority?</p>

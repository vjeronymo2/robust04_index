			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Wembley Wembley's financial performance has been an action-packed game of two halves. Competent midfield performances from assets like US greyhound racing and Wembley stadium itself were cruelly undermined by the early own-goal of taking on debt for expansion. The long slide into the relegation zone has seen most of the company's supporters drift away. Now Wembley has been rocked by asset write-downs of almost Pounds 100m, putting the company in breach of its borrowing powers and, presumably, leaving its chairman ashen-faced. Shareholders are being asked to approve changed powers by post, perhaps for fear of trouble on the terraces if an extraordinary general meeting were held. Having disposed of sufficient assets to prevent the banks cutting the company's defence to ribbons before half-time, Wembley needs to use the interval to rethink tactics. It might be possible to stagger on with the traditional debt, preference, and ordinary share formation, but it offers little prospect of a sparkling earnings-filled second half. Nor would asking for more money from the few remaining fans be popular, given the management's poor record in the transfer market. A capital reconstruction with banks swapping debt for equity would allow everyone to benefit from future improved team performances. After the last few years, though, anyone still in there must be as sick as a parrot.</p>

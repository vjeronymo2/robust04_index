			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuous monitoring ensures that temperature fluctuations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C), if any, as a result of circumstances such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as heavy cooler loading, frequent cooler entry, or power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures, are quickly detected. The guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, in Appendix A, section 6, describes alternative ways to continuously monitor the temperature. A temperature-recording device can show both the high temperature and the length of time that refrigeration unit was operating at that temperature. Maximum-indicating thermometers and high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature alarms also show that the critical limit has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded but cannot show the duration of the deviation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, when a maximum-indicating thermometer or high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature alarm reveals a deviation, the processor will need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume loss of control since the last time that the measurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displayed by the instruments were checked, unless reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence exists to the contrary. The more frequent such checks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are made, the lower the risk to which the processor is exposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During periods when the refrigeration unit is not frequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entered and the load is constant, such as overnight, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable to reduce the frequency. However, during periods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy use and frequent entry, the frequency should be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(15) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor ensure that persons with sores or illnesses that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present an increased risk for product contamination are excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from those areas of processing where such contamination is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely. Employees can serve as a reservoir of foodborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diseases, such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, and hepatitis, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be passed on to the consumer through the fecal-oral route.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, open sores, boils, or infected wounds present the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for contamination of the food with such pathogenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Staphylococcus aureus.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employees with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspicious illnesses or sores can be effectively screened upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrival at the processing facility with minimal personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intrusion (Refs. 22, 74, and 84).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening, and documentation of the screening, take place daily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This frequency will ensure that changing health conditions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees are not missed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(a)(16), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor ensure that toilet facilities are available and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained in a sanitary condition and in good repair, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these facilities provide for proper disposal of the sewage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toilet facilities eliminate from the processing environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogenic microorganisms shed in fecal material. Where fecal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material is not properly conveyed from the processing plant to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable treatment facility, restroom floors and grounds around  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing facility can become contaminated with pathogens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foot traffic over the affected areas can introduce pathogens to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing room and cause product contamination. Insanitary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toilet facilities can also increase the potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination of employees' hands and, ultimately, the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Refs. 64 and 74).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(c) that the toilet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities be inspected, and the inspection be documented, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that they function properly and are in a sanitary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition at least every day. Ordinarily this inspection should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be performed before each day's operation to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is ready at the beginning of the day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(a)(17), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor ensure that no pests are present in the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. Pests, such as rodents, birds, and insects carry a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of human disease agents, which they can introduce to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing environment (Refs. 63, 64, 73, and 84). Additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their feces constitutes filth which can contaminate the food. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily inspection of the processing facility, as proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.10(c), serves to assess the effectiveness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor's pest control activities and redirect them where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(a)(18), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor ensure that the plant is designed to minimize risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of contamination of the food. Proper construction is essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the other sanitary measures that FDA is proposing to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are to be successful. It includes the isolation of incompatible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations, such as the handling of raw materials and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing of cooked products (Refs. 71, 74, 87, and 88). A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodic inspection of the facility for structural defects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product flow, and general building condition is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that these attributes do not pose an increased potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for product contamination. In &sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to require that such controls be performed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented with sufficient frequency to ensure control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Europe's gas supply lies in troubled hands  -The fears prompted by disputes between the former Soviet Republics A 50 per cent drop in gas supplies from Russia to western Europe last week has raised important questions about the security of Europe's supplies as it increases its reliance on natural gas. The temporary drop in supplies was because of a dispute over payments between Russia and Ukraine. Russia temporarily turned off supplies to Ukraine and Ukraine retaliated by taking gas from the export pipeline destined for western Europe. Gas analysts warn the incident may seriously damage European confidence in Russia's reliability as a supplier and prompt a rethink about where future gas supplies should come from. Europe's choices are limited. Changing attitudes to natural gas have brought a big increase in western European consumption. This is mainly because of environmental considerations and improved gas power technology. Consumption in western Europe last year was 287bn cubic metres, according to figures from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the international energy consultants. This is expected to increase by between 50 and 100 per cent by 2010. Until the middle of the decade, Europe is likely to depend on imports from four principal producers: Algeria, the Netherlands, Norway and the former Soviet Union, primarily Russia. Together these countries supply about 52 per cent of Europe's gas, but both Norway and the Netherlands have little spare gas in the short term. That makes Russia and Algeria the countries most likely to meet increases in demand. Russia already supplies more than 20 per cent of western Europe's gas needs. It has by far the world's largest reserves - some 53,000bn cubic metres, according to Mr Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of Gazprom, the gas industry operator. A recent report by Moscow energy specialists predicted that gas, even more than oil, would be the key to Russia's economic renaissance. But those assumptions have been challenged by the recent supply problems. One problem is that three big pipelines come together at Uzhgorod in the Ukraine, from where the main export pipeline runs into western Europe, giving Ukraine - which no longer enjoys the warmest of relations with neighbouring Russia - the power to turn off supplies. Analysts warn that any worsening of relations between the two countries  - for example, over the disputed territory of the Crimea - could result in Ukraine doing just that. However, Ukraine is unlikely to be able to hold Russia to ransom for long, since it is a net importer of gas and receives gas as payment in kind for transiting Russian gas. A potentially more thorny problem is that the former Soviet Union's pipeline network now spans 15 different republics, which have spent months locked in dispute over questions such as pipeline ownership, maintenance and carriage charges. Industrial action by any one of a number of republics or autonomous republics and regions within Russia could damage Russia's ability to export gas. While attempts are being made to retain Gazprom as a Union-wide monopoly, but as a joint-stock company in which almost all of the former Soviet republics are likely to be partners, these may not be successful. Mr James Ball, director of Gas Matters newsletter and a leading gas expert, warns that 'the uncertainty about who will control gas exports in the longer term may discourage foreign countries from signing new supply contracts.' This could have a knock-on effect, by deterring western companies from investing in Russia's upstream gas industry through fears they will be unable to get the gas out. With reserves of 3,300bn cubic metres, Algeria is in no position to challenge Russia's role as principal external supplier to western Europe, but last week's events might allow it to gain a somewhat larger share of the market. Two factors work to Algeria's advantage. The first is that its export routes go straight into European markets. The pipeline which carries 14bn cubic metres of gas annually to Italy, and whose capacity will double by 1995, crosses Tunisia, a politically stable country, while 18bn cubic metres travel by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ships. The second is that the country's well-run oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach, has already been through the process of deciding if and how foreign companies are to work with it. Algeria has been lucky. The growth in demand for its gas has exceeded Sonatrach's future capability, leading it to offer far more rewarding terms for oil and gas exploration. This change of heart in Algiers has led to the signing of a string of agreements with western companies such as Total, Arco, Phillips Petroleum, Mobil, BP, Agip and Cepsa. Current reserves figures are likely to prove conservative, given the prolonged absence of internationally experienced explorers. Meanwhile, the renovation and upgrading of existing LNG facilities is going ahead, which will provide Sonatrach with extra capacity of 10bn cubic metres at a cost of Dollars 2bn, which is substantially less than the cost of a similar-size greenfield LNG project. However, Sonatrach will still have a maximum annual export capacity of only 70bn cubic metres by 1997 and has indicated a desire to limit exports to 60bn cubic metres, 56bn of which is already sold. Strong market pressure could encourage Algeria to sell all 70bn cubic metres. There is another drawback: a political one. The Algerian government has been mired in bloody confrontation with religious fundamentalists since it cancelled last December's first ever multi-party elections. For Algeria's buyers, there remains a fear of sabotage.</p>

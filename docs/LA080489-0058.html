			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEEPING ECOLOGY INITIATIVE PROMISED BY VAN DE KAMP  </P> <P> John Van de Kamp pledged Thursday that a cornerstone of his campaign for  governor will be to present voters with one of the most sweeping environmental  ballot propositions in state history -- a measure to protect the coast from oil  spills, food from pesticides and the atmosphere from ozone-gobbling chemicals.  </P> <P> It was the second give-'em-hell ballot initiative that the 1990 Democratic  candidate for governor has proposed this summer, both part of a novel and  emerging strategy designed to give Californians the opportunity to vote for his  platform, not his promises. The first measure dealt with ethics in government  and terms of offices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favorite Targets  </P> <P> At news conferences around the state on Thursday, Van de Kamp said he hoped his  new initiative would rally environmentalists to join together and take on some  of their favorite targets: oil companies, pesticide manufacturers and those who  produce chemicals that break down ozone.  </P> <P> He borrowed from many diverse sources for elements of the plan -- everyone from  liberal Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) to the Bush Administration:  </P> <P> Major provisions that were outlined only in general terms:  </P> <P> * Establishment of a $500-million trust fund for oil spill prevention and  cleanup. Van de Kamp said there was a 94% probability of Southern California  enduring a "Valdez-class oil spill" in the next 30 years. The fund would be  established over a five-year period through a 25-cent-per-barrel "fee" on oil  moving through the state.  </P> <P> * Strict but thus-far unspecified "regulations to stop the discharge of  dangerous toxins into the ocean."  </P> <P> * A crash effort to make California the first state in the nation to formally  commit to the goal set internationally at a Helsinki conference earlier this  year -- the phasing out of all use of chemicals which destroy ozone by the year  2000.  </P> <P> * The phasing out of "the use of those pesticides that we already know to cause  cancer," and "more stringent regulation of pesticides in general."  </P> <P> * Institution of a new requirement for planting trees in conjunction with all  future development, and a $200-million bond issue for forest planting and  preservation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Environment Issue  </P> <P> Van de Kamp said the precise language of each provision would be drafted by his  campaign in consultation with environmental groups during the weeks ahead. The  measure will be submitted for signature gathering this fall and is aimed for  the November, 1990, general election ballot.  </P> <P> "The environment of this state has suffered tremendous damage during a decade  in which extraordinary growth has been accompanied by extraordinary neglect at  the highest levels in Washington and Sacramento," he said.  </P> <P> As an indicator of the power of the environment as an issue, Van de Kamp's  leading Republican rival in the far-off governor's race, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson,  did not object to the tax on oil and creation of a trust fund. Rather, Wilson  said Van de Kamp was being too modest.  </P> <P> "The Alaska spill has already cost $800 million. His fund would have been  depleted," said Wilson, who currently is backing $1-billion federal trust fund  legislation in the Senate.  </P> <P> Wilson went further and grumped about Van de Kamp's timing -- which indeed was  known to have been rushed. "He must have some pretty good intelligence about  what I'm up to," the senator said.  </P> <P> More critical was the campaign of Democratic rival Dianne Feinstein, former  mayor of San Francisco. Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers noted that Van de  Kamp has spent more than a full week denouncing still another initiative  because of what the attorney general said is a two-word flaw. She was referring  to the "Speedy Trials Initiative" sponsored by Wilson, which Van de Kamp says  contains a two-word constitutional change regarding privacy rights that could  inadvertently jeopardize a woman's ability to obtain an abortion.  </P> <P> "All we've seen of Van de Kamp's two initiatives are slick press releases  fashioned after public opinion polls. How do we know that his initiatives when  they are drafted won't contain the same kind of flaws?" she demanded.  </P> <P> But politicians are in an awkward spot in challenging ideas that have already  received wide discussion and support. Take another would-be candidate in the  field, for instance, Democratic state Controller Gray Davis. Davis is the  originator of the idea for the $500-million oil-spill trust fund. Van de Kamp  credited him for the proposal but did not consult with him.  </P> <P> Davis said he was "pleased" that Van de Kamp endorsed the idea, but said he  hoped the Legislature would enact the fund first.  </P> <P> As for the other elements? "I don't think the attorney general thought up any  of them. They represent the best thoughts of many groups," Davis said. Then  Davis added his own endorsement, "I support all of those individual concepts.  And I would be willing to support them as a package."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp said he had little faith that the Legislature could tackle such a  major reform as this. It was the same argument he used with his proposal last  month to limit terms of office for state officials and impose new ethics  standards. There is no choice because the Legislature is "paralyzed" by  special-interest money.  </P> <P> The merits of the two proposals aside, Van de Kamp's initiatives -- and his  pro-abortion attack on rival Wilson's initiative -- have accomplished two goals  that his campaign believes essential:  </P> <P> First, it has given Van de Kamp, the Establishment politician with the  patrician name and genteel breeding, a slight Populist cast. The initiatives  are supposed to say, Van de Kamp will fight against them for you.  </P> <P> Secondly, he has quieted those doubters, including friendly doubters, who  believed Van de Kamp deep in his bones is too cautious and pale for the  challenge. "For the first time this year, Van de Kamp has begun to engage  Wilson in a debate," said one Democrat who has been quietly critical of the  attorney general's campaign. "But these last couple of weeks give us  encouragement and dispel the myth that Wilson is the inevitable victor."  </P></p>

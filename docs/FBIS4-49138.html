			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What is Hidden Behind `Human Rights'? -- Third </F> Commentary on the Report by the British Parliamentary Foreign  Affairs Committee"]    [Text] The report by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  British Parliament attacked China's human rights status on their  own fabricated grounds, alleging that "Hong Kong's human rights  will probably deteriorate after 1997. It then proposed that the  Hong Kong Government set up a "human rights commission" and a  "human rights supervisory institution" and "guarantee that Hong  Kong will continue to enjoy basic human rights after the  transfer of sovereignty." The Foreign Affairs Committee  chairman even advocated exerting international pressure on China  on the question of human rights and asked the British Government  and the UN Human Rights Commission to "jointly supervise  progress in Hong Kong's human rights status after 1997."    It seems that Britain wishes to act as a "human rights  guard"  for Hong Kong!    Honestly speaking, the fact that Britain talks about human  rights and claims to be a "human rights guard" before China and  before the Hong Kong people will only add one more little joke  to the world.    Racism and colonialism are the opponents of human rights.  When a place is ruled by racism and colonialism, its human  rights are trampled on. This has been proved by numerous facts  around the world. Britain has exercised colonial rule in so  many countries and regions! It has deprived so many people of  their rights and civil liberties!    Britain used gunboats to seize Hong Kong from China 150  years  ago. Even today, it still rules this place with colonialist  practices and infringes upon the rights of the Hong Kong people.    In the 1880's and during the early part of this century,  Britain carried out two armed invasions of China's Tibet,  inflicting a very great loss on the Tibetan people. Moreover,  it instigated the reactionary elements of Tibet's upper level to  rebel and massacred the patriotic people.    This is Britain's human rights record. What a sordid tale!    Back home in Britain, different races have not achieved  equality either, as some Hong Kong people have pointed out, and  not all of the International Labor Agreements are observed. On  this basis alone, there is no way that we can say that Britain  has a good human rights record.    Isn't it ridiculous that Britain today has gone so far as to  vilify China -- which does not have a single soldier in another  country and which is making remarkable achievements in the  protection and improvement of human rights at home!    Hong Kong needs human rights. Its human rights can only be  really guaranteed after Britain pulls out, after colonial rule  ends, and when the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region --  which will be ruled by the Hong Kong people and which will have  a high degree of autonomy -- is established. The Basic Law has  detailed provisions regarding the rights and freedoms to be  enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong has reverted to  the motherland. In the Chapter on the Fundamental Rights and  Duties of the Residents alone, there are 11 articles which deal  with freedoms. The scope of rights is so wide and the degree of  freedom is so large that they are rarely seen in the world.    Taking advantage of the Wei Jingsheng and Xi Yang incidents,  which judicial organs have already dealt with in accordance with  the law, however, Britain has invented the lie that "Hong Kong's  human rights status will probably deteriorate after 1997" and  has invented Hong Kong people's "worries" over the future. If  Britain uses this as a basis for setting up a "human rights  commission" and a "human rights supervisory institute" before  1997, then people have reason to believe that the motive behind  Britain's advocacy for establishing such institutions is to  protect those people -- like those already sentenced by China --  who pry into and steal state military information and economic  secrets and endanger national security and national interests  and to build a shelter for a small number of anglophile and  anti-Chinese elements who are hostile to China and who are  creating confusion in Hong Kong.    Therefore, as the "proposal" was advanced, leaders of the  United Democrats -- Christine Loh Kung-wai, and the like -- were  immediately overjoyed. They claimed it "conforms to the overall  interests of the community" and "will enable Hong Kong people to  have more confidence in the future." They then urged the  government to set up human rights institutions as soon as  possible and "compile a report for the United Nations." They  and some others advocated drawing up an information freedom  regulations bill and a human rights and equal opportunity  commission regulations bill and urged the Hong Kong Government  to step up its revision of such laws and regulations as the  Press Freedom Regulations, the Official Secrets Act, and the  Public Security Regulations so that their restrictions can be  relaxed, thus offering legal protection to some who go against  China and create confusion and make trouble in Hong Kong.    Some people from the Hong Kong community pointed out:  Britain has never done anything to improve Hong Kong's human  rights status during its colonial rule for the past one and a  half centuries. Now Britain is playing "human rights politics"  when Hong Kong is about to revert to the motherland. They  argued that Britain is not doing this out of good intentions but  in order to set up new obstacles for Hong Kong's smooth  transition. Therefore, the Hong Kong people should be on guard  against this ploy and must never be taken in.    Everything that happens after 30 June 1997 will be China's  internal affairs, and no country can intervene. All major  issues involving and straddling 1997 should be negotiated  between China and Britain and must not be unilaterally decided  on by the British side. This is a question of principle. The  question of whether there is the need to formulate laws and set  up institutions for the protection of Hong Kong's post-1997  human rights in accordance with the Basic Law is the affair of  the future Hong Kong SAR, and the British side has no right to  intervene. If the British Hong Kong authorities want to "act  independently" again by setting up the so-called "human rights  commission" or "human rights supervisory institution," the  Chinese side will surely not acknowledge them as it does not  acknowledge the political system framework. As for  international pressure, China does not fear it, and no other  country is expected to follow Britain at its instigation.</p>

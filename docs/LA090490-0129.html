			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PERESTROIKA NEAR COLLAPSE, RUSSIANS TOLD  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program is "on the brink of collapse,"  a leader of the Communist Party's traditionalist wing told 2,500 delegates at a  Russian party congress in the Kremlin today.  </P> <P> Ivan K. Polozkov, first secretary of the Communist Party in the Russian  Republic, drew vigorous applause from the delegates, a group that includes many  generals and career party officials who are believed to harbor reservations  about Gorbachev's policies.  </P> <P> Gorbachev sat on the podium at the front of the hall, remaining virtually  silent through a day of speeches that often contained scathing criticism of his  leadership, though without mentioning him by name.  </P> <P> Some of the day's strongest applause went to Ivan Vtorushin, a worker from the  Siberian city of Tyumen who called for "returning the nation to 1985," the year  in which Gorbachev assumed power.  </P> <P> "No matter what slogans are used, a policy resulting in falling living  standards and bloodshed is against popular interests," Vtorushin said,  referring to the Soviet Union's accelerating economic problems and ethnic  strife.  </P> <P> The delegates are meeting this week to complete the process of creating a  separate Russian branch of the Communist Party.  </P> <P> In his hourlong keynote address, Polozkov urged delegates to counter the  "deliberate discrediting of the Communist Party and the socialist choice as a  whole."  </P> <P> He said the country's economic crisis, caused by the Soviet people's  psychological unpreparedness for a market-based system, "is, in the final  analysis, putting perestroika on the brink of collapse."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> CAT'S EYE GOUGED IN ATTACK WITH SPRAY PAINT  </P> <P> A Ventura woman told police that someone sprayed her 10-year-old cat with  fluorescent pink paint and gouged out an eye.  </P> <P> Michele Marie Galvan, 20, called the Ventura Police Department to report the  attack Saturday after she discovered the cat in the back yard of her house in  the 3300 block of San Pablo Street, according to a report filed by Officer Rod  Giles.  </P> <P> Galvan said she became concerned when Burba, an outdoor cat that usually stays  close to home, disappeared Thursday about 7 p.m.  </P> <P> She found him Saturday morning covered with paint. His eye was severely  damaged. Galvan took Burba to a veterinarian who removed the eye and washed off  the paint. The cat is recuperating.  </P> <P> "I don't think he'll ever want to leave the back yard, even to go out front,  because what happened to him was pretty traumatic," Galvan said.  </P> <P> Galvan said police told her that children in some neighborhoods have been using  pellet guns to shoot paint capsules.

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Bank set to publicise Nigeria finances THE WORLD BANK is to make public for the first time a detailed analysis of Nigeria's government finances after the two-week visit of experts which began on Tuesday. But talks on the medium-term economic programme leading to possible debt relief remain suspended until the government brings oil revenues and public spending under control. The team will present to Nigeria's interim government a post-mortem on the eight-year structural adjustment programme (SAP) and a proposed strategy to offset the fluctuating value of oil exports, which account for more than 80 per cent of its foreign exchange. New rules at the bank will allow publication of these reports by December. A 1991 report by the World Bank's Nigeria office exposed the lack of accountability in government finances but was not published. The SAP stalled half-way to a liberalisation of trade and industry but failed to boost non-oil exports, while the standard of living and the value of the naira plunged and inflation reached 70 per cent due to diversion of government oil revenue. The 1993 budget sought to cut Nigeria's debt service, which is equivalent to 30 per cent of earnings, and to produce a budget deficit of around Dollars 1.4bn. However, the drop in the oil price has worsened the balance of payments and the budget deficit was estimated at Dollars 1.5bn by the end of June. Arrears on payments to the Paris Club of creditors have risen to about Dollars 4bn and negotiations in April with the International Monetary Fund over a medium-term programme ended in failure. Mr Ernest Shonekan, the head of the new interim government, has pledged a new era of accountable government and a purge on corruption. However, since he took office there has been no more disclosure of public finances than under the former president, General Ibrahim Babangida, who retired at the end of August. Nigeria is no nearer to a deal with the official creditors than in January, when Mr Shonekan led the military regime's bid to reschedule its Dollars 27bn external debt.</p>

Chairman Abulaidi was interviewed by this reporter here.    Abulaidi was born to a Uygur nationality handicraft family  in  Yining, Xinjiang. After completing his secondary education, he  was admitted first to the University of Xinjiang to undertake a  professional course in industrial and civil architecture, and  later to Xinjiang Industrial College to undertake a professional  course in electrification and automation of industrial  enterprises. He graduated in 1965 and was assigned to work at  the Xinjiang Institute of Architectural and Surveying Design.    He was engaged in architectural and surveying design for 17  years. During this period, he acted successively as technician,  professional team leader, engineer, and vice president. In 1983  he was transferred to the regional planning commission and acted  successively as vice chairman and CPC committee secretary. He  was in charge of the work of capital construction  administration. In September 1991 he was elected vice chairman  of the autonomous region while remaining in charge of capital  construction work. Last November he succeeded Tomur Dawamat as  acting chairman of the autonomous region.    During his long career in capital construction work, he  began  to take part in concrete project design, then he played a part  in and was in charge of the work of supervising and coordinating  many large and medium-sized capital construction projects. He  left his footprints everywhere.    Abulaidi said: I feel a greater sense of responsibility  after being elected chairman of the autonomous region today. He  said frankly: Although Xinjiang is trying hard to catch up with  the accelerating pace of development throughout the country, the  overall level of development is still low. By the end of this  century the whole country will have marched to a relatively  comfortable standard of living, while Xinjiang can only match  that pace if its GNP increases by 800 percent. At present, the  gap between Xinjiang and the average national level is not  narrowing, but widening. The CPC Central Committee and the  State Council are very much concerned about it, and officials  and the common people of Xinjiang are even more anxious about  it. At this meeting, Xinjiang has set a "rapid and highly  effective" development path. In 1994, Xinjiang's GNP must reach  43.4 billion yuan, which is an increase of 11 percent over last  year; and the total output value of our industry and agriculture  must reach 56.5 billion yuan, which is an increase of 10.8  percent over last year. Otherwise, the door of a relatively  comfortable standard of living will be shut against Xinjiang.    Abulaidi is still confident of the large-scale development  of  Xinjiang. He said: Xinjiang has rich natural resources, and,  in particular, its achievements in prospecting for and  developing petroleum and nonferrous metals are spectacular.  Xinjiang has gathered bumper harvests in agriculture and animal  husbandry for 16 consecutive years and achieved social  stability, unity among nationalities, and a considerable scale  of economic construction. Now that the state is implementing the  policy of "opening up border areas," Xinjiang is in the  forefront. At present, Xinjiang is making more efforts to  improve the investment environment. The bottleneck which has  restricted the rapid development of Xinjiang-- the problem of  communications--will be fundamentally ended during the Eighth  and Ninth Five-Year Plans; post and telecommunications will  become a part of the global network of communications in August  1995; and a number of key power stations and hydropower stations  are being extended and constructed.    When talking about how Xinjiang maintains a stable  situation,  Abulaidi said that the measure taken by Xinjiang is to "do two  types of work simultaneously": The first is to develop the  economy, particularly the rural economy, in a rapid and highly  effective manner. Xinjiang is a minority-nationality region  with agriculture and animal husbandry at the core, which account  for a very high proportion. At present, 300,000 people in  Xinjiang still have not solved the problem of food and clothing.  Only when the rural economy develops can the people live and  work in peace and contentment. Hence, the key to maintaining  stability in Xinjiang is to promote massive economic  development, particularly massive rural development. The second  is to resolutely and thoroughly fight against divisive  activities among nationalities, which should never be tolerated.</p>

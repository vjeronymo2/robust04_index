			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance slips 4% to Pounds 23.7m BRITANNIC Assurance, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 4 per cent fall in total net profits for 1992 to Pounds 23.7m, from Pounds 24.7m in the preceding year. The shares dipped 40p to Pounds 13.03. If last year's except-ional transfer of Pounds 4.9m from the industrial branch is excluded, profits on life business increased from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 21.8m, helped by an increase in new premium income from single premium pensions from Pounds 43.1m to Pounds 73.3m. In the general branch, the group incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 205,000 (Pounds 2.3m). Mr Roman Cizdyn, life insurance analyst at Smith New Court, said that he felt the share price had been driven down thanks to over-enthusiastic buying of small stocks in the preceding weeks. The results were broadly in line with expectations, Mr Cizdyn said. Earnings per share fell from 39.59p to 37.91p, but the dividend for the year is increased by 13.6 per cent, to 33.5p, via a final of 23.35p. The group also proposed a 2-for-1 scrip issue. Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, said the unwieldy share price of more than Pounds 13 might deter private investors, although it would have little effect on institutions.</p>

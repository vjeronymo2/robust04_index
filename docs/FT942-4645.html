			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Hewlett Packard in chips link with Intel Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturer, is to collaborate with Hewlett-Packard, the second largest US computer company after IBM, to develop a new generation of very powerful microprocessors. The research and development partnership is aimed at creating microprocessor chips to be the 'brains' of 21st-century computers, the companies said. The chips will combine Intel's technology, which is at the heart of most personal computers, with HP's reduced instruction set computing technology, called PA-Risc - an advanced type of microprocessor that HP has pioneered as the base for a broad range of computers, from desktop workstations to mainframes. The joint research and development project will include the design of 64-bit microprocessors, advanced semiconductor processes and software. The companies expect to spend several hundred million dollars on the effort and to deliver the first jointly developed chips in the late 1990s. The new chips will be able to run existing personal computer and Unix software without modification, said Mr Richard Sevcik, HP group general manager. In addition, the 64-bit design will be well suited to future applications such as multimedia and three-dimensional graphics. By combining the speed and power of HP's Risc technology with Intel's high-volume manufacturing capabilities and the established software bases of both, Intel and HP's collaboration may reinforce the companies' strong market positions, analysts said. The outcome, however, will depend upon the ability of the companies to co-operate. HP and Intel are two of the most successful and established companies in Silicon Valley. However, they have different cultures and little history of joint projects. The partnership mirrors the microprocessor alliance formed in 1991 by IBM, Apple Computer and Motorola to develop PowerPC microprocessors, upon which Apple has based its latest Macintosh computersand which IBM plans to use in a broad range of products. PowerPC as well as Risc microprocessors from Digital Equipment and Sun Microsystems represent a challenge to Intel's domination of the microprocessor market. The partnership with HP is seen as Intel's move to address that. Competitors noted that Intel and HP do not expect to see finite results from their partnership until the end of the decade. 'We have a six-year lead on them,' said Willie Shih, vice-president of Digital Equipment, 'but we welcome the news that Intel and HP are endorsing our technology direction.' Digital has sold Dollars 1bn worth of computers based on its 64-bit Alpha microprocessor, he noted.</p>

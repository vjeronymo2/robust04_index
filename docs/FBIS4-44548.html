			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Song Ning: ``GEIS Teams Up to Explore Data </F> Networks'']    [Text] General Electric Information Services (GEIS) entered  [into] a partnership agreement yesterday with the Great Wall  Computer Group, marking a major step by the US company in  joining the Three Golden Projects, China's colossal information  network. GEIS, one of 12 subsidiaries of the General Electric  Company, authorized the Great Wall to become its sales arm in  China. The Beijing-based company, one of the largest computer  makers in China, had been service agent for the American firm's  China-based clients.    GEIS is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic  mail (E-mail) and electronic data interchange (EDI). It has 15  users based in China, including China National Chemicals Import  and Export Corporation (Sinochem) and China Ocean Shipping  Corporation (COSCO). ``By developing our cooperation with the  Great Wall, our products can be fully adapted to local  requirements,'' said Owen Chan, managing director of GEIS  operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.    The Three Golden Projects will link China's banking and  customs services and national information interchange through  huge information networks. Although the project has yet to  begin, foreign companies have been lobbying hard to get  contracts.    Many of the projects are attracting overseas investors  despite the heavy input they require. Hellene S. Runtagh,  president of GEIS, said: ``Having an impressive local partner  like the Great Wall will help us come to meet the Chinese  requirements for the information highway. Competition will be  less with such a partnership.'' She said her company hopes to  win bids in the Golden Customs and Golden Card Projects since  GEIS has more than 20 years of experience in handling EDI  trading and credit card services.    GEIS has a joint venture in the United States with  Ameritech,  which has long been in the credit card sector. Quentin P.  Gallivan, vice-president of GEIS, said he is interested in  technology transfer with Chinese partners. ``We want to have  the technology operating in the US brought to China and work  with companies like the Great Wall to meet Chinese needs,'' he  said. ``We're not only concerned with giving EDI software, we  want to teach the Chinese how to set up an EDI service and how  to make it successful.''</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (13): Farewell to underwater phones - New equipment application / Sonar modems Sonar modems that transmit text and graphics underwater are speeding up the work of divers. Since July, US defence agencies have been testing 'wet' portable computers that use sonar to maintain continuous contact with the surface. The hand-held computers mean that divers can dispense with a lot of their conventional clutter such as plastic writing slates, depth gauges and ropes. The built-in sonar modem allows the surface crew to monitor the progress of the dive, to receive data from the diver and to relay messages that increase the diver's safety. 'Underwater telephones can distort your speech and be hard to understand,' says Marco Flagg, whose Desert Star Systems, California, designed the DiveTracker computer. 'They can also need extra cables. Our system overcomes these problems and it can also store all the data from a dive, including logging the diver's movements.' The DiveTracker is a box a little larger than a mobile phone, machined out of portable aluminium to withstand the pressure 1,000 feet down. It includes the standard depth and tank pressure gauges which are integrated with the computer. It has a micro controller with 538 kilobytes of memory holding the operating system and bespoke applications software. There is a back-lit graphic LCD display of 64 by 128 pixels and a solid-state 16-key pad operated with a magnetic pointer. It is powered by an internal rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery that is said to last up to eight hours if the modem is used only 'moderately.' If used continuously, the battery runs flat in two hours. Once back on board ship, there is an RS-232C serial port for downloading data to an IBM-compatible personal computer. Software for DiveTracker is written in the 'C' programming language and the first package covers the three main needs of a diver - dive status/decompression display, communication and navigation. Each function has its own display screen. Besides a graphic dive profile it also shows the present depth, tank pressure, water temperature, time elapsed, air consumption and remaining air time. The modem has a range of 300 feet in 'noisy' waters, where the sounds from creatures such as dolphins disrupt the signal, up to 3,000 feet in tranquil lakes. DiveTracker models cost between Dollars 1,600 and Dollars 3,000. It is being used across a range of military applications. These include the enigmatic category of 'special warfare' and the less mysterious disposal of explosives, as well as positioning divers on underwater structures for ship repairs. The system should slot into the military's chain of command easily - 'the precise navigation capability - accurate to within six inches - along with the system's communication capabilities allow more efficient mission control to military users,' says Marco Flagg. In other words, even captains in their cabins will be able to know exactly what their divers are doing, 1,000 ft below. There is a software package that is targeted for divers that need to follow precise search patterns under water, such as in explosive ordnance disposal. In the scientific field, there has been an interest to use DiveTracker for data recording as well as a sensor data acquisition device. One group may also use it to track scientists performing their underwater experiments: safety regulations call for surface team members to be aware of scientist-diver locations.</p>

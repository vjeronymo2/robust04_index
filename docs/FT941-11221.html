			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Labour attacks Tory 'sleaze' Labour yesterday launched its campaign for the European and local elections with an attack on 'Tory sleaze'. Launching the campaign at a local government conference in Glasgow, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, said the elections would be a nationwide referendum on the government, which was 'disintegrating in a spectacle of frenzied infighting'. Activists were warned that the Tories would 'fight dirty' in the elections, which take place in May and June. Government strategists fear that Labour's lead of nearly 20 points in the latest opinion polls points to a massive loss of support in both elections. However, officials on both sides are warning that the number of seats that change hands may be small because of the poor Tory performance in the last round of elections. Mr Jack Straw, manager of Labour's local elections campaign, yesterday made clear that the party would focus on the Conservatives' fitness to govern. 'This is a government which is finding it almost impossible to distinguish between private and party gain on the one hand, and the public interest on the other,' he said. Government ministers will this weekend reinforce Mr John Major's rallying call for unity, made to backbench Tories on Thursday night. They will also issue a co-ordinated attack on Labour's European policy. However, one rightwing MP made it clear that his wing of the party would continue to speak out on issues that concerned it. Mr Edward Leigh, MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle, said: 'If we believe we are spending too much or taxing too much or appeasing the IRA too much, we are entitled to say these things.' Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, last night told Conservatives in Crewe that a lack of discipline was the reason the party was not getting broad public support. 'It is time to forget about factions . . . it's time to turn our fire on to the Labour party whose policies could so damage the country,' he said. Mr Howard is expected to offer Mr Major emphatic support when he addresses the Young Conservative conference in Southport today. Mr Norman Fowler, the party chairman, who will also address the conference, is expected to do the same. An opinion poll today in The Herald, the Glasgow newspaper, shows Labour support in Scotland unchanged from last month at 47 per cent. The Scottish National party is on 22 per cent (1 point down); the Tories are on 16 per cent (1 point up); and Liberal Democrats unchanged at 14 per cent.</p>

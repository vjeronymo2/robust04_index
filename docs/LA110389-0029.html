			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR IN CORONADO BECOMES STYLISH  ITALIAN RESTAURANT  </P> <P> The self-transformation of an old-fashioned neighborhood bar into a tony eatery  isn't quite as surprising as would be, say, the sudden decision of a punk  guitarist to devote his life to the study of Mozartian nuances, but it is  unusual.  </P> <P> The Secret Harbor in Coronado for years was the kind of neighborhood place at  which regulars traded tall tales over a couple of cold ones. But management  switched off the neon beer signs at the beginning of the year and reopened in  mid-summer as Primavera, an upscale, uptown kind of restaurant with a formal  mood and an especially attractive decor.  </P> <P> It is Italian, naturally -- most new restaurants seem to be Italian these days,  and Coronado certainly was in need of a good one -- and the cooking generally  ranges from satisfactory to rather nice.  </P> <P> Primavera means springtime, but the word also connotes renewal, which neatly  sums up the transformation of a clubby, casual hangout into an establishment  with deep banquettes upholstered in floral print, a menu that includes bresaola  and bagna cauda and a maitre d' who kisses women's hands.  </P> <P> The selection of dishes seems largely pan-Italian, with a certain degree of  emphasis on preparations from the provinces of Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria  -- which is to say, with great caution, that there is some Northern Italian  cooking. The term is these days enormously overworked, misused and  misunderstood, and applied scattershot by many of the restaurateurs who know  that dishes specified as "Northern" have snob appeal.  </P> <P> However, chef Luigi Tornatore (who cooked previously at Point Loma's unassuming  but delightful Michelangelo), does come from the North, and his menu offers  several good renditions of that region's specialties.  </P> <P> One of the best of these is bagna cauda, or "hot bath," which is not mentioned  by the menu but is available most days. Bagna cauda classically consists of  olive oil and butter heated with anchovies and garlic, and is served as a  fondue-like dip for bread and raw vegetables. Tornatore reverses the process by  spooning a little of the mixture over a plate of grilled eggplant, slivered  Parmesan and pungent sun-dried tomatoes, and the finished product ranks as a  particularly elegant sort of antipasto.  </P> <P> There is a similar elegance to the caprese al prosciutto, which dresses up the  now-typical presentation of sliced tomatoes layered with fresh mozzarella and  basil leaves by adding strips of delicate cured ham to the plate. The light  drizzle of olive oil that moistens the arrangement adds a good bit of flavor.  (A similar dish, in which red onion stands in for the prosciutto, is presented  as a salad.)  </P> <P> A third handsome appetizer, the bresaola con carciofini, pairs thin slices of  the lovely, air-dried, cured beef called bresaola with baby artichokes, and it  is indeed a luxurious combination. Other starters include the usual stuffed  mushrooms and fried squid, and, less typically, a small filet of sole under a  browned topping of Parmesan and white wine sauce. The minestrone seems done  with a lighter hand than elsewhere, and the now almost ridiculously ubiquitous  Caesar salad has a good, sharp bite to it. (The restaurant employs mustard in  the dressing, which is against tradition and usually doesn't work, but the  other ingredients are balanced around it and this is, in fact, an excellent  salad.)  </P> <P> The pasta list runs on rather enthusiastically with a roster of alternately  creamy and pungent dishes, but pasta by and large does not seem the  restaurant's strongest suit. The list begins, unsurprisingly, with fettuccine  primavera, the classic tangle of ribbon noodles, assorted vegetables and light  cream sauce. It then pauses at gnochetti (small dumplings) in a shrimp-flavored  cream sauce before plunging into such rustic and theoretically robust offerings  as the spicy penne alla puttanesca, the very pungent vermicelli aromatici (the  sauce includes garlic, mixed herbs, capers and anchovies) and rigatoni al  Gorgonzola, rich with the musty snap of that most regal, Italian blue cheese.  </P> <P> The last two were sampled, and both seemed quite timid in their approach; the  pasta used also was limp and flat-tasting, an unexpected circumstance in any  Italian restaurant but especially in one of this pretension. More familiar  choices include fettuccine alfredo, cannelloni, spinach lasagna and linguine in  red and white clam sauces.  </P> <P> As an alternative to pasta, the menu offers a couple of risotti, the often  elaborate rice stews that are, in fact, a trademark of some Northern Italian  cooking, especially that of Milan. The risotto pescatore decorates the rice  with a variety of shellfish.  </P> <P> Both seafoods and meats are, by and large, sauteed in the particularly  satisfactory Italian manner that finishes them with a syrupy sauce of reduced  pan juices and wine thickened with a bit of butter. Choices include scampi  Primavera, or shrimp and mushrooms in an herbed wine sauce; sea bass livornese,  which spices the sauce with capers and black olives; and chicken breasts and  veal scallops finished in the Marsala, con melanzane (with eggplant) and  Valdostana treatments. The chicken Valdostana was done with particular  delicacy; a boned, lightly pounded breast was stuffed with prosciutto, sliced  mushrooms and creamy Fontina cheese, dipped in flour and beaten egg, gilded in  butter and moistened with the lightest of pan sauces.  </P> <P> The menu offers more steaks than usual -- perhaps because of the large number  of conventioneers attracted by Coronado's resort hotels -- and dresses them  variously with Cognac sauce, an herbal marinade and a topping of sauteed  onions, mushrooms and peppers. The sole lamb listing, slices of herb-marinated  loin, is grilled, and, although a portion sampled came off well enough, the  advertised herbal flavor was disappointingly meek.  </P> <P> A couple of daily specials usually complete the menu, but a highly touted  lobster fra diavola was worth neither the kitchen's nor the diner's efforts,  and it certainly was not worth the price. What should have been lobster cooked  in a spicy tomato sauce was fresh lobster overcooked in a bland, chunky stew of  tomatoes that had irritating bits of shell as one of its chief seasoners. This  was served atop a great pile of overcooked, characterless fettuccine that  should not have been allowed to pass through the kitchen door.  </P> <P> The dessert tray also needs a little attention. Its chief attraction,  tirami-su, is turning up at so many ambitious Italian restaurants these days  that a few alternatives from the vast Italian repertoire might find a  surprisingly warm welcome. It is, however, a nicely composed dish (the English  would call it a pudding) of liqueur-soaked ladyfingers topped with a sweetened  mascarpone cheese and a heavy dusting of powdered chocolate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PRIMAVERA  </P> <P> 932 Orange Ave., Coronado  </P> <P> 435-0454  </P> <P> Lunch served weekdays, dinner nightly.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of house wine each, tax and tip, $40 to $75.  </P></p>

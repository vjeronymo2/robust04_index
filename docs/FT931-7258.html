			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK competition policy Tarzan is clearly quite happy applying the law of the jungle. By unexpectedly rejecting the Office of Fair Trading's recommendation and clearing Airtours bid for rival package tour operator, Owners Abroad, Mr Michael Heseltine has perhaps signalled a shift in the regulatory regime. The trade and industry secretary's decision certainly raises some ticklish questions about the predictability of competition policy. If Airtours' bid succeeds, its market share would push through the 25 per cent barrier, which was previously assumed to be the trigger point for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation. It would also give the two biggest players control of more than 60 per cent of the market. But it would be rash to conclude that a deliberate policy change is under way. The DTI has previously ignored the OFT's advice without reappraising competition policy. Moreover, there were many specific considerations in this case. The DTI suggests barriers to entry are low while the industry is intensely competitive. Having blithely allowed Thomson to assume such a dominant market position in the first place, it may simply have seen a stronger Airtours as an effective counterbalance. Nevertheless, companies may feel tempted to test the limits of competition policy. Some suspect the climate may be more amenable to 1960s-style industrial restructurings leading to the emergence of national champions. If such is the intention, the package tour industry seems a strange place to start. Especially when the philosophy has been so sketchily explained.</p>

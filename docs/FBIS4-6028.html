			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's top  leader Kim Il-song flatly denied possessing or thinking of  possessing nuclear weapons in a press conference with Western  reporters Friday.    He said he wants to visit the United States to do some  hunting, fishing and to "make friends."    The 82-year-old ruler of the most isolated nation of the  world said anyone who wants a war on the Korean peninsula must  be out of his mind, adding his country will never use nuclear  weapons against Koreans.    Parts of his two and half hour press conference was  broadcast  on Cable News Network (CNN) whose Beijing bureau chief Mike  Chinoy was among the Western press group that went into North  Korea to report on Kim's birthday April 15.    He reacted with irritation when asked about North Korea's  suspected nuclear program, saying the international community  demands to see nuclear weapons that North Korea simply doesn't  have.    It's useless to own nuclear weapons, Kim said in the press  conference, North Korea doesn't have the delivery system to  launch such weapons, and his country is too small to attempt  nuclear tests.    But other than denying any nuclear development, Kim made no  reference to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s demands  for additional inspection on the North Korean nuclear complex.    Kim described how he was proud of his heir-apparent son Kim  Chong-il and denied reports of his failing health, saying he is  in good condition.</p>

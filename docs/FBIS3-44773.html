The country carried out a large-scale trial examination last  year which covered more than 9,400 enterprises and about 825,000  administrations and institutions.    Finance Minister Liu Zhongli told a national working  conference that through squaring accounts, over nine billion  yuan in state- owned assets were found to have been excluded  from accounts of the enterprises, and 144 billion yuan from the  books of governmental administrations.    Liu said that besides presenting a rough understanding of  the  present status of state-owned assets and problems existing in  management of the assets, last year's work has also helped  define ownership of some state enterprises.    About 1.77 billion yuan in state-owned assets which have  long  been diverted to collectively-owned enterprises have been sorted  out. More than 24.7 billion yuan in enterprise investments in  other trades have been rechecked or recovered.    After the audit, Liu said, fixed assets in the 9,400-plus  enterprises were revalued at 42 percent higher than before,  showing a total revaluation volume of 180 billion yuan.    He pledged that the examination of state-owned assets will  continue this year. The coverage will still be limited to  10,000 enterprises.    According to the finance minister, enterprises involved will  include the 1,000 enterprises chosen to undertake the tests of a  new supervision mechanism, and the 100 large and medium-sized  state- owned enterprises chosen to establish a modern enterprise  system.    Some enterprises which will have their ownerships  transferred  and some key large and medium-sized state enterprises which need  solid support will be also included.</p>

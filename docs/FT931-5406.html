			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (9): Marketing man reaches for the sky - Profile, Gil Thompson MOST British airport chief executives used to have military or air traffic control backgrounds. When Gil Thompson left British Airways to take over Manchester Airport, he says he was the first marketing man in such a job. That was 12 years ago. He was 51 and had been with BA for 31 years, ending up as northern manager. What he has done since has been acknowledged as an amazing feat of marketing management, with a trebling of passengers carried and Manchester's emergence as Europe's fastest-growing airport. Mr Thompson got his market research into shape, then used the results to sell to the airlines. The crucial leap of management thinking was to regard the airlines and tour operators as the airport's primary customers, rather than passengers and freight forwarders. The latter have not been neglected - far from it, he says - but the prime movers of growth are airlines. As events have proved, passengers then come in a rush once there are aircraft available. 'Although we say it ourselves, no other airport is better at research than Manchester,' Mr Thompson says. 'We have worked hard to establish how many passengers in our catchment area travel to various overseas destinations through an intermediate point, such as Heathrow or another European airport. 'Armed with such information, we will go to an airline and say, 'Did you know there were 50,000 passengers a year flying between Manchester and your home base?' 'We have then been able to prove from our experience here that if that airline were minded to fly direct, it would carry at least 50 per cent more. Chicago is a case in point: there were 40,000 when American Airlines started, then 60,000, then 80,000, then 90,000 and now it's 130,000 people. Manchester regards its main catchment area as the 20m people within two hours' driving time, of whom more than half can get there in around an hour or less. Having to travel to Heathrow - or, worse, Gatwick - to catch a flight, does not impress northerners, because of the cost and inconvenience involved. Indeed, many business travellers have long used Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Zurich to change aircraft, rather than London, flying from Manchester or another northern airport offering a connection. The breakthrough for Manchester in proving the strength of northern demand was Qantas's service to Australia in the mid-1980s. Market research showed at least 50,000 northerners travelling to Australia via other airports. Qantas decided to test the water. 'They got 28,000 in the first year; now it's up to 75,000,' Mr Thompson says. 'They proved that the northerner rewards the airline that flies to his doorstep. Our research shows that if airlines come in here, people will move their itineraries around to use the services.' Some opponents of Manchester's expansion point out that Qantas, and other long-haul carriers, do not fly full from Manchester, but have an early first hop - say to London, Amsterdam, or Frankfurt - to top up with passengers. Manchester argues this matters little, because of the considerable improvement in convenience. Passengers do not disembark, thus avoiding the disruption of transit - such as changing airlines and terminals and having to allow enough extra time to make connections. Transatlantic services, however, are non-stop and are saving tens of thousands of people from the extra cost and time of shuttling to Heathrow or elsewhere to catch planes to New York, Chicago or Atlanta. From next month, British Airways will add Los Angeles to its north American routes from Manchester. Moreover, competition is stimulating these long-haul direct markets even further. Mr Thompson says: 'When American Airlines started a daily service to New York - as BA already offered - BA was afraid it would halve the cake. 'What has it done? It has doubled the traffic. Instead of 100,000 passengers a year to New York from Manchester, there are now 200,000. 'Our research has shown that direct, particularly non-stop services, multiply the traffic. We are not in the business of putting airlines on the margin by trying to cut the cake into too many small slices. They know now we have proved it.' Many northerners are grateful to foreign airlines for taking up Manchester's offers of facilities, for BA inevitably also has an interest in flying passengers through Heathrow, using its Manchester shuttle, to fill its jumbos there. This can conflict with opting for a new Manchester service. 'It hasn't always suited BA's purpose to come to us,' Mr Thompson admits. 'That's understandable. When you have a hub the size of London - and BA has over 50 per cent of the traffic there - they would want to feed traffic to their 747s at Heathrow. 'We are as patriotic as anyone. Whenever we have established what we think will be a viable route, we have always shared our figures with the national carrier first of all. Only when they have been unable or unwilling, have we gone overseas.' His background with BA and in marketing has proved invaluable. 'What I found soon after I started here was that the airlines like to talk to their own people. I knew the language and that proved a great asset. I also talked to them as a customer trying to serve their customers, not as a landlord,' Mr Thompson adds. He has also promised incoming carriers to widen Manchester's catchment area by providing more feeder services from around the UK. 'Six years ago we started to attract passengers from all over the UK. We have developed Manchester as a major hub now. There are now more domestic passengers feeding Manchester as a hub than any other airport in the country, including London,' Mr Thompson says. 'We have 19 domestic routes. Six years ago only 2 per cent of our turnover was transfer business, now it's 7 per cent. That means 250,000 extra passengers, mainly to long-haul carriers, such as American to Chicago, Delta to Atlanta, or Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong. This is the top-up traffic we promised them when they started these long-haul services. 'It's expensive to do in terms of handling and usage of the runway because we are using up slots we should have for larger aircraft, but it's investment in the future to be a hub rather than an airport that flies from point to point.' He is now working on Japanese inward investors, who have been meeting in a group led by Sharp, which has its UK headquarters in Manchester. 'We have told Sharp that we can prove that the growth in passengers carried will be 50 per cent in the first year if a Japanese carrier flew direct from Manchester. Then it will go up to 100 per cent, then 200 per cent.' He hopes Japanese companies in the UK will help argue the case for Manchester-Osaka direct service to All Nippon Airways, filling one of the intercontinental gaps. He will not see it in as chief executive, because he plans to retire. 'You can really see only 10 years ahead,' he says. 'I think it would be totally wrong for me to start off something I could not finish.' Few believe he will be allowed to disengage totally, so that some sort of non-executive involvement will be offered. Mr Thompson worries about this: 'One thing at a time. I think we would need to consult the new chief executive. I would not want to get under his feet. I have heard of people who found it hard to give up. If the company thinks I can be of use, then since I believe in and love this airport, I should give it all I can. But I don't intend to hang in if I'm not wanted.'</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PETE ROSE PROBE TO LAST SEVERAL MORE WEEKS, INVESTIGATOR SAYS  </P> <P> will probably be several more weeks before the baseball commissioner's  investigation into allegations against Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose's is  completed, the lawyer heading the inquiry said today.  </P> <P> The announcement apparently clears the way for Rose to be with the Reds when  they play the Los Angeles Dodgers in baseball's traditional opener on Monday in  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> "I have advised Commissioner (Peter V.) Ueberroth and Commissioner-elect  (Bartlett) Giamatti that in my judgment it is likely the investigation will  require at least several more weeks," John Dowd said in a statement released by  his law office in the nation's capital. "Rumors to the contrary are inaccurate  and prompted this clarification."  </P> <P> He characterized his committee's work as complicated and time-consuming.  </P> <P> The commissioner's office has never given details of what it called "serious  allegations," but other sources have said the investigation deals with Rose's  betting activities.  </P></p>

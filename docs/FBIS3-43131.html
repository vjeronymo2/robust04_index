			<p>Reflecting     both the PLO's frustration over protracted  negotiations with Israel on implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  plan and its renewed fears that U.S. policy will ultimately favor  Israeli interests, Voice of Palestine (VOP) in Yemen recently  carried the harshest mainstream PLO radio attack on U.S. handling  of Middle East peace negotiations observed since the signing of  the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (DOP) on 13  September.  In a commentary on 10 January, VOP charged that  Washington is "shirking its responsibilities" toward  implementation of the DOP.  US policy, VOP said, "reflects the  abandonment of responsibilities toward the peace process," and  has even "at times impeded rather than aided the peace process."  Reviving longstanding PLO charges of U.S. favoritism toward  Israel, VOP charged that "allegedly objective U.S. impartiality  reflects a favorable response to Israeli wishes."  In particular,  referring to U.S. peace talks coordinators as "the five rabbis,"  the commentary claimed that they sought "more for Israel than it  wanted for itself."  In addition, the commentary implicitly  blamed the United States for recent strains in the PLO's  relations with other Arab participants in the peace process,  charging that Washington has "sought to preclude any coordination  among the Arab negotiators."     The commentary's appeals for the United States to continue an  active role in the peace process suggest that the PLO, despite  the evident disappointment with U.S. diplomacy that contributed  to its decision to conclude a secret accord with Israel in Oslo,  still harbors doubts about its own ability to negotiate  successfully with Israel and will, therefore, continue to look  outward--primarily to Washington--to bring about a favorable  conclusion.  The commentary thus warned against what it portrayed  as a U.S. misinterpretation of the significance of the DOP.  Perhaps, it suggested, Washington had concluded that the accord  had resolved Israeli-Palestinian differences "without their  [U.S.] intervention and without their having to provide any  guarantees."  But the U.S. role, asserted VOP, "cannot end" with  the Oslo agreement.  Implicitly urging the United States to press  Israel for concessions, the commentary argued that "It is  mistaken . . . to address a major conflict involving peoples'  rights and the sufferings of successive Arab generations" on the  basis of a belief that "the strong must emerge as the winner  because they had the skills required to seize the others'  territory and rights."

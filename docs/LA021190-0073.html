			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOODY SUNDAY  </P> <P> The best crime writing diverts and entertains but it also catches the flavor of  its time, and now and again the milieu is itself the message. So it is with  Josef Skvorecky's The End of Lieutenant Boruvka; translated by Paul Wilson (W.  W. Norton: $18.95; 167 pp.), six connected stories featuring a homicide  detective working in Prague in 1968, at the time of the Soviet "fraternal"  occupation of the country.  </P> <P> It is the third collection of Boruvka stories and, to judge by the climactic  events, the last. Josef Boruvka has had all he can take of the political  corruption around and above him. He solves crimes -- among them, the apparent  suicide of a beautiful young woman, the shooting of another -- only to have the  guilty protected because of their political job or connections.  </P> <P> Skvorecky, whose other writings include "The Bass Saxophone" and "The Engineer  of Human Souls," evokes, with a terrible and mesmerizing immediacy, an  oppressed and oppressive country with all its petty tyrannies, hypocrisies and  insults to the soul. Read now against the recent freeings-up in Czechoslovakia  and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Skvorecky's stories have the quality of  prediction. He leaves no doubt that everything had to change, and in the  lieutenant, Skvorecky has created a real, idiosyncratic and thoroughly likable  protagonist, a rumpled and perfect symbol of the urgings for rebirth.  </P> <P> By my count, Vespers (William Morrow: $18.95; 331 pp.) is the 41st of Ed  McBain's 87th Precinct novels, set in a metropolis that is not quite New York  or any other identifiable metropolis but linked to them all by the turbulence  of its streets and the extremes of its life styles.  </P> <P> The first three in the series were published in 1956, but after more than 30  years at it (his output also including other novels published as Evan Hunter),  McBain shows no sign of wearying or repeating himself. He is a muscular  storyteller whose pace is relentless, dialogue crisp, detailings economic but  telling, and who keeps finding fresh themes and sub-environments.  </P> <P> In "Vespers," a young Catholic priest is stabbed to death at the door of the  church. A cult of Satanists is headquartered not far away. (McBain gives more  play-by-play on the Black Mass than the devout or the squeamish may care to  read about; fair warning.)  </P> <P> There are some surprising links between church and anti-church in the story,  and surprising, too, in its believable way, is the solution of the mystery of  the priest's death. McBain is not unsympathetic to his characters, and he can  lead the reader's sympathy exactly where he wants it to go. But his  encompassing vision of life appears neither sunny nor optimistic, and the  ending of "Vespers" is a very sardonic song at twilight.  </P> <P> Patricia Daniels Cornwell was a crime reporter on the Charlotte Observer who  then became a computer analyst in the chief medical examiner's office in  Virginia. Her only previous book was a biography of Mrs. Billy Graham. For her  first mystery, Postmortem (Scribner's: $16.95; 293 pp.), she has created a  protagonist, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, who is, conveniently enough, Virginia's chief  medical examiner.  </P> <P> The police are confronting a serial rapist, following a forensic trial in which  the computer is massively involved. Cornwell trots out her expertise in  dazzling and occasionally bewildering fashion. But the specifics are  fascinating, as work well-described always is, whether it's Dick Francis at the  track or Amanda Cross on campus.  </P> <P> Dr. Scarpetta has a terrible time with the chauvinists around her, one of whom  in particular is malevolently eager for her to fail. These passages have the  ring of truth as experienced, and so does the portrait of an investigative  reporter who abets the solving. (Cornwell has mastered the writer's lesson of  starting with what you know best.)  </P> <P> Remarkably, the novel is about the tracking down, not the culprit, who turns  out to be as anonymous as a bus rider, even though he nearly adds Scarpetta to  his scorecard. The story is based loosely on an actual serial killer in  Richmond, and Scarpetta evidently has a real-life model in the medical  examiner's office. Whatever its inspirations, "Postmortem" is a first-rate  first thriller, and I hope to run into Dr. Scarpetta again.  </P> <P> Edna Buchanan is another police reporter (for the Miami Herald, where she won a  Pulitzer Prize in 1966) who has become a crime novelist. Nobody Lives Forever  (Random House: $17.95; 241 pp.) is her second thriller (the first was "The  Corpse Had a Familiar Face").  </P> <P> She is nothing if not adventurous, and her villain is a woman with multiple  personalities -- an evil Eve. She is by turns a simpering child-woman, a raging  and imaginative nymphomaniac, an uptight and obsessively clean housekeeper, a  murderous male and, when she is reasonably in control, the mistress of a cop  who is working on the various murders.  </P> <P> The cop is conveniently blind to his lady's severe mood swings, although his  buddy tumbles soon enough, thus enhancing the story's quota of suspense.  Writing through the consciousnesses of the various personae (who are  dangerously jealous of each other, and, in every case but one, resentful of the  detective), is no small trick. Buchanan makes it readable rather than  convincing, but she generates a lot of suspense along the way and her plotting  is nothing if not inventive.  </P> <P> At that, Buchanan is at her most readable when she is evoking today's Miami,  especially when a full moon has set all the weirdos a-hollering or when, in the  blazing light of day, the great contrasts in a city with its own multiple and  conflicted personalities are seen as through shimmering heat waves.  </P> <P> William Hood is said to have spent 30 years with various intelligence and  counterintelligence agencies, including the OSS and its successor, the CIA.  Reading Cry Spy (W. W. Norton: $18.95; 303 pp.), that claim is easy. Like the  works of John Le Carre, his novel declares on every page that these must most  indubitably be the tricks, the jargon, the endeavors of spy craft.  </P> <P> These are hard days for spies and spy-writers, with glasnost making gingerly  neutrals of old adversaries and leaving an operative uncertain where his next  squeal is coming from.  </P> <P> Hood's man, the veteran Alan Trosper, introduced in "Spy Wednesday," wants to  discover why an old cloak-and-dagger pal, who had ostensibly come in safely  from the cold, has been killed in England by a hard-to-detect poison favored by  Moscow Central.  </P> <P> I suspect I'd have trouble passing a quiz on who had done what to whom on whose  behalf. As in both Le Carre and Len Deighton, clarity is not a top priority and  everyone speaks cryptically. The book, for all the ellipses, is considerably  talkative, and yet there is a satisfactory quantity of action, a kidnaping and  a forced confession or two among the pleasures. The mostly European settings  and the characters, moles and countermoles as well as excessively mannered  Washington higher-ups, are vividly captured (if that's the word).  </P> <P> Bloody Sunday  </P> <P> The Man in the Moon (St. Martin's: $16.95; 295 pp.) is a first cloth novel by  Frank Norwood, a Los Angeles social worker and screenwriter. His hero is a  half-Irish, Half-Hispanic bail-bondsman, raised in the East Los Angeles barrio,  a sometime welterweight contender (still bearing scars from a fight with  Marvelous Marvin Hagler) now in his late 30s. He lives in a dumpy flat near  Venice.  </P> <P> The book's interest is that it does have a feeling for the Los Angeles  underside, not that Norwood is the first to discover it. The book's problem is  Norwood's overwriting in emulation of Raymond Chandler and other stylists who  kept or keep their images under fairly strict control. Plenty of complication  and, after much action, a snowy shoot-out in the mountains of far-off  Pennsylvania. A writer to watch for again, as he steadies his voice.  </P></p>

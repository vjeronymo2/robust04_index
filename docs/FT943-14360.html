			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Latvian coalition to resign The Latvian coalition government is to resign because of the decision by the Peasants' Union party, the smaller of the two coalition partners, to pull out of the government. Mr Valdis Birkavs, announcing the decision on television on Wednesday night, said however that his Latvian Path party would be ready to form a new government with another coalition partner. The Peasants' Union decision reflects growing tension over economic policy in Latvia, and came after Mr Birkavs had refused the Peasants' Union request for increased tariffs on imported foodstuffs. The president and prime minister of Estonia yesterday issued a statement welcoming the offer by Russian President Boris Yeltsin for talks - described by Mr Yeltsin as a 'final effort' - on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia by August 31. Mr Yeltsin said at the Group of Seven summit in Naples that he would not withdraw the troops unless Estonia guaranteed full civil rights for the large ethnic Russian population. Estonia, along with Latvia, has adopted a citizenship law which in practice restricts the numbers of Russians able to take citizenship.</p>

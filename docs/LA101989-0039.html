			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET DIRECTOR AIMS FOR THE HEART WITH REP PREMIERE OF 'SLINGSHOT'  </P> <P> "Yescho, yescho, yescho!" insists Soviet director Roman Viktyuk, spinning his  arm as he stares intently at actor John David Bland spinning actor Jon Matthews  around in a wheelchair.  </P> <P> "More, more more!" Susan Laron swiftly interprets at Viktyuk's side.  </P> <P> Neither Viktyuk, who speaks only Russian, nor the American actors, who speak  only English, ever look at the interpreter -- only each other -- during  rehearsals of "Slingshot," Nicolai Kolyada's play about a crippled dock worker.  The play will have its world premiere at the San Diego Repertory Theatre on  Sunday in conjunction with the Soviet arts festival.  </P> <P> The show marks his first directing job in the United States -- and in English  -- but Viktyuk said during a rehearsal break that working with a different  language is no problem at all.  </P> <P> "The principle of my directing and my work is from heart to heart," Viktyuk  said through yet another interpreter, Raia Rechaim. "If I feel the heartbeat of  the actors, then the language means nothing to me.  </P> <P> "Out of all the people we were choosing," he said,  </P> <P> referring to the actors, "these people, their nervous systems are so clear and  pure that we can see them as if they were an X-ray. It is as though I am  holding their hearts in my hand and their hearts are beating as if they are  birds in my hands.  </P> <P> "They still do not know how to fly yet, and I am not letting them go. Their  little legs must get stronger. That should happen any day now. Maybe tomorrow  or the day after tomorrow."  </P> <P> So far, the only part about working in America he loathes is the Actor's Equity  rule, which gives actors 15-minute breaks every hour and a half.  </P> <P> "I hate breaks," said Viktyuk. "As soon as the heart starts beating, as soon as  there is a correct taking of breath, as soon as the eyes start shining . . .  the stage manager says it is time for a break, and we have to start all over.  When there is surgery, no one takes a break. If the nurses and the surgeon and  the machinery just shut down, the patient would die."  </P> <P> The gambles he takes, the choices he makes, have given Viktyuk the brand of  being one of the most risk-taking directors in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> He knows he could have made his first directing job in the United States a lot  easier if he had gone for well-known actors or even a well-known playwright --  which Kolyada is not.  </P> <P> The artistic team at the San Diego Rep told Viktyuk they wanted to present "the  best contemporary Soviet play." They were so certain from previous  conversations with the director that his choice would be "Smirnova's Birthday  Party," by one of his favorite playwrights, Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, that the  offering was printed in the arts festival brochure before Viktyuk arrived in  San Diego on July 29.  </P> <P> But, typical for him, Viktyuk came into town with a surprise. An actor living  in Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains had sent him a new play about an embittered  33-year-old Soviet dock worker named Ilya, crippled in a work-related accident,  who learns to love again through a troubled, but growing friendship with Anton,  a teen-age boy, and Ilya's neighbor, Larisa (to be played by Mary Forcade).  </P> <P> Viktyuk read the play just two weeks before his flight to the United States  and, even though the writer had never been produced in Moscow or Leningrad, he  was convinced that, in Kolyada's "Slingshot," he had at last found "the best  Soviet play."  </P> <P> He read it -- in Russian -- to the Rep's artistic director, Doug Jacobs, to  producing director Sam Woodhouse and managing director Adrian Stewart, with  simultaneous translation by Rechaim, and convinced them all that this was the  play they ought to present. (Larson made the final translation used in this  production.)  </P> <P> "I read it at night," Viktyuk said of the play, "and I called him (Kolyada) in  the morning, and I told him who was calling. There was a long pause, and then  he started yelling, 'It is a dream!' "  </P> <P> Viktyuk smiled at the memory.  </P> <P> "It would be easier to take a well-known play, a classic, well-known  experienced actors, and maybe even take a play that I did before," Viktyuk  acknowledged.  </P> <P> "And then we would know what is going to come out. But here we don't know the  way. We don't have the transportation. We must find our way with our own hands  and legs. I like that feeling because in this danger is the heartbeat of life.  If the machinery which checks the EKG waves is only a straight line, that is  death. We need to make the zigzag line. Then we know we are alive."  </P> <P> If risk is something Viktyuk feels comfortable in courting, it's mainly because  he's had plenty of training: Danger has never been a stranger from the moment  his life as an artist began.  </P> <P> For years before glasnost lifted censorship in Russia, he directed plays that  were closed by Soviet officials because of the way they mocked modern life in  the U.S.S.R. Fourteen years ago, during the Brezhnev period, when "there was  censorship of everything," Viktyuk said, he directed a play by Petrushevskaya  at a university theater because her works were banned in official Soviet  houses.  </P> <P> The actors were not paid; the troupe took care of all expenses themselves. The  production, which dealt with how proletarians turn to "the malevolent aspect of  life" when finding no other emotional outlet, had an impact on critics -- which  was not enough to save the show.  </P> <P> "Even though all the press said the play was wonderful, the bureaucrats from  the party closed the show and they closed the theater," Viktyuk said.  </P> <P> The director and crew took the props and stage designs and fled to another part  of the city. For 10 years, he and his friends performed underground, keeping  the work secret from government officials.  </P> <P> Then, all restrictions came undone under the Mikhail Gorbachev policy of  perestroika. Still, Viktyuk's memories of the pre-glasnost era are, like much  of his work, unexpected.  </P> <P> "As funny as it sounds, it was the happiest time of my life, because we knew  why we were doing this," he said. "This was our resistance to the official view  of the arts in the Soviet Union. I just wanted to yell out the truth."  </P> <P> In "Slingshot," Viktyuk hopes again to yell out the truth about the  contemporary Soviet challenge of coping with housing and food shortages, as  well as changing roles and relationships.  </P> <P> He also sees it as a great opportunity for bringing Russians and Americans  closer together. This play, as he tells his actors during one of many  impassioned speeches, "expresses the Russian soul."  </P> <P> As the actors come closer to capturing that soul in rehearsal, Viktyuk  expresses increasing determination to have the American cast perform in Moscow  when he premieres the play there in the spring of 1990. No visas have been  acquired, but he refers to it as accomplished fact, explaining that he wants  the production to be the same, using longtime collaborators Vladimir Boyer, as  set designer and Ury Butsko, who wrote original music for the work.  </P> <P> "I would love to have these three actors come to cold, wintry, snowy Moscow and  with their hearts they would melt the hearts of the Russian people," said  Viktyuk, who, in rehearsal, often refers to the male actors by the affectionate  Russian diminutive Johnochka, and to all three by one of the few English  expressions he requested to learn from the translators, "lovely children."  </P> <P> "We only need these three hearts, and they will conquer any borders," Viktyuk  said. "I feel there is a tremendous need for art to be taken to the Soviet  Union so people can see that the Americans care about problems in the Soviet  Union. Then they will know the American hearts are just as open and tender as  Russian hearts."  </P></p>

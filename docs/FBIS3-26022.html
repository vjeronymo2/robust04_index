			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Zhurun and Ni Siyi] </F>   [Text] Beijing, February 1 (XINHUA) -- China will take at  least five years or longer to open its futures market to the  outside world, a leading Chinese futures trader said today.    "Only after the legal framework for the futures market is in  shape, financial reforms are carried out and China's economic  strength substantially enhanced, will the country be ready to  open up its futures market," said Lu Jian, president of the  China International Futures Co. Ltd (CIFCO).    He explained that futures trading involves high risks and  high profits, which require solid economic and legal foundations.    The country's current policy to bar overseas traders from  entry into the country's futures market is not intended to close  it, but to prepare for its opening up at the earliest possible  date, Lu said.    According to CIFCO estimates, China's futures trade reached  1.3 to 1.5 million deals last year, compared with 200,000 deals  in 1992.    However, the number is only tiny when compared with  developed  countries, Lu Jian said, noting that nearly 400 million futures  deals were made in the United States last year.    He compared China's futures industry to a "sampan", and the  industry in developed countries to a "gigantic ship."    "How can the gigantic ship be allowed to sail in China when  the country has yet to dig the channel?" he said.    China now stresses "an active but safe approach" in  developing its futures market.    A government regulation for the country's futures operation  is expected to be issued before April this year, and Lu said  that "to his knowledge" the futures law is in the making.    He said a nationwide futures craze emerged last year when  too  many trading companies and commodity centers were set up. Some  profiteering merchants from outside the chinese mainland took  advantage of the confusion to drain off Chinese revenue.    This led to massive waste and several unusual financial  frauds in the country, Lu Jian said.    Disorder in the country's futures market obstructs entry of  trading companies or clients with high credibility, Lu said.    As a pilot futures company, CIFCO is the only Chinese  company  to have bought broker's seats in the three largest commodity  exchange centers in the U.S. and also in the world: The Chicago  Board of Trade, the Commodity Exchange Inc of New York and the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange.    It is also one of the 160 futures trading companies  qualified  in the country's just finished reshuffle of futures trading  companies and exchange centers.    The CIFCO president said he is optimistic about the  development of China's futures market, since its functions to  find prices and avoid risks will be of importance for China's  market economy.    "It will also help to link China's economy with that of the  world," he said.    Lu said the volume of China's futures trading will continue  to rise, in line with the healthy development of China's economy.    State-imposed prices are being cancelled as part of China's  market-oriented economic reform, prompting enterprises to  safeguard the value of products by engaging in futures trading,  Lu said.    The better equipped futures organizations and well trained  personnel will also stimulate the rise in trading volume, he  said.    Dr. Lu Jian, 39, an Oxford educated economist, is a renowned  management expert in the futures trade in China. He conducted  intensive and extensive investigation and research work on major  futures organizations in the U.S., the U.K. and Hong Kong.</p>

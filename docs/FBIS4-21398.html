			<p>CSO     [Text][Text above title]Bacteria Convert  Heavy Metal With Special Enzyme.    [Text below title]For Seep Waters and the Electrotechnical  Industry -- by Joerg Brandes.    Many microorganisms feed off substances which are  poisonous to humans. Scientists from the Society for  Biotechnical Research (GBF) in Braunschweig have discovered that  bacteria can be used to clean up water contaminated with  mercury.    Mercury gets into the environment from burning trash,  industrial waste waters and the sewage system, but also from  volcanic eruptions. Since heavy metals are not biologically  degradable, they can gradually build up in the food chain and  become, finally, a danger to humans and animals. Today there a  variety of technological processes available for "fishing out"  poisonous heavy metals out of waste water. New in the selection  are biological processes in which the heavy metal is taken up by  the organisms into their biomass.    In looking for possible microbes the GBF scientists in  Braunschweig soon struck it lucky. They correctly assumed that  mercury-resistant microorganisms would have to be found near  sources where a lot of the heavy metal accumulated. Among these,  for instance, would be waste waters from the electrotechnical  industry or from seed protectant or fungicide plants.    Basically, however, mercury is as harmful to bacteria as it  is to other living organisms. Microbes which take up very much  of it must therefore at least be able to transform it into a  biologically "tolerable" form. With the help of a special  enzyme, mercury reductase, the bacteria convert the mercury into  a metallic form which is much less toxic. More than twenty  naturally occurring bacterial strains have since become known  which possess this enzyme.    Tests are carried out in so-called fixed-bed reactors in  which microorganisms are colonized on a medium. The contaminated  water is passed over the [bacteria] and loses the greater part  of its toxic cargo in the process. The filtered-out metallic  mercury is precipitated out in the form of small pellets in the  reactor. After completion of the process the bacteria are  removed and the remaining heavy metal is distilled off. The  medium can then be reused.    Since the enzymatic transformation of the heavy metal occurs  in a very directed way and is practically non-reversible, it is  particularly well suited to the treatment of waste waters with a  mercury concentration of less than 5 mg per liter. Prof.  Wolf-Dieter Deckwer, head of bioengineering at GBF, considers  seep water from trash dumps, for example, to be suitable, as  well as seed treatment operations where mercury compounds are  heavily used.    To widen their scope of application, microbiologists are  giving their bacteria a little boost genetically. They have  succeeded in joining in one strain of Pseudomonas putida two  characteristics which do not occur together in nature: the  microbes can split particularly toxic organic mercury compounds  as well as convert the resultant--and still toxic--cations of  the element.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wlodzimierz Gnarowski, chief designer of the </F> I-22 Iryda aircraft: "Iryda With New Capabilities"]    [Text] At the Mielec airport, Engineers Tadeusz  Lechowicz and Grzegorz Warkocki, test pilots at the Aviation  Institute [Instytut Lotnictwa], have performed their first  flight on an M-93 Iryda, with modern aviation equipment that has  been integrated by a French firm named SAGEM.    The flight was the first step in the implementation of a  joint demonstration program by the Mielec Polish Aviation Plant  [PZL- Mielec], SAGEM, and the Aviation Institute. The main goal  of the program is to present the plane's expanded capabilities.    The development of aviation technology in recent years was  to  a large extent possible because of the introduction on board of  aircraft and helicopters, of modern electronic systems called  aviation electronics. Microprocessors, computers, radars,  lasers, and electronic meters have been widely applied in both  civilian and military aviation. The solutions used thus far  with regard to onboard systems of Iryda training/combat aircraft  were largely based on equipment coming from the former USSR,  which was a logical consequence of using the equipment in combat  planes of the Polish Air Forces and of the practical  accessibility of that type of equipment. Currently, it is  possible to modernize Iryda quickly by introducing aviation  electronic systems produced in Western countries. It is not  possible to design or manufacture domestically a wide array of  equipment required in the plane, within time limits set by the  user. So there is a need to rely on foreign producers, while  not giving up domestic designs for the future, in those cases  where it is justified economically.    The Aviation Institute and PZL-Mielec have jointly  considered  offers of some leading foreign producers of aviation  electronics. They have chosen the SAGEM company for the  implementation of the demonstration program, during which modern  aviation electronics were placed into and integrated with the  aircraft. The equipment installed includes, among others,  precise systems of inertial navigation [nawigacja  bezwladnosciowa] and satellite navigation, computers  facilitating the carrying out of precisely-targeted attacks, as  well as electronic meters that describe flight parameters and  that make it easier to perform tasks.    As a result of this work, the M-93 Iryda aircraft was born,  which will make it possible to train pilots and trainees (during  flights and during performance of air-to-air and air-to-ground  combat tasks) while using modern equipment, which, in a way,  reflects the performance of those tasks using combat aircraft  during ordinary and difficult weather conditions, both at night  and during the day. The Inertial Navigation System (INS) makes  it possible to train a pilot under conditions that approximate  war conditions, regardless of the infrastructure on the ground.    The solution adopted is open to possible further  modernizations, depending on the needs of the aircraft's  developmental versions. Among others, the navigation/targeting  computer can be adapted to navigation depending on terrain  features, while the entire system can be supplemented by a  FLIR-type device whose goal is to fight targets with no  visibility and to conduct reconnaissance tasks.</p>

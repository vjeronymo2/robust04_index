			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- A MNR [National  Revolutionary Movement] spokesperson announced here today that  MNR Secretary General Victor Valle has resigned. The  spokesperson added that Jorge Pinto, a former member of the  party's political commission, assumed Valle's post three days  ago.    The MNR, the Democratic Convergence, and the former  guerrilla  movement Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front make up the  leftist coalition participating in the run-off presidential  elections that began this morning. The MNR ran by itself in the  20 March elections for deputies and mayors and lost.    Valle said that many obligations, which he did not specify,  prompted his resignation.    Today, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist  coalition, called Valle's resignation an act of treason and  blamed it on the defeat the MNR suffered in the March elections.    None of the candidates of the parties participating in the  run-off elections received the required majority in March --  half of the total votes cast plus one -- to win the presidency.  The Supreme Electoral Tribunal convened a second election  between the two leading presidential candidates. Thus, Zamora  and Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the ruling  Nationalist Republican Alliance, are today competing for the  presidency for the 1994-99 period.</p>

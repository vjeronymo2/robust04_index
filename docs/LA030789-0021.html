			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 6 ALISO HIGH STUDENTS FINISH L.A. MARATHON  </P> <P> Six students from Aliso High School, who put in extra hours during the last  seven months training for the Los Angeles Marathon, finished Sunday's grueling  26.2-mile race, their teacher and coach said Monday.  </P> <P> "We did it," said Paul Trapani, the social studies teacher who ran with the  students after school and on weekends. "We are feeling a little wounded but  very proud."  </P> <P> The students, who transferred to the Reseda continuation high school after  experiencing attendance and behavior problems at other schools, signed up for  Trapani's fitness class last September. The class required students to train  daily and to complete at least two 10-kilometer races.  </P> <P> The student times ranged from a little more than five hours to nearly seven  hours, Trapani said. "We stressed that the important thing was to just cross  the finish line," he said.  </P></p>

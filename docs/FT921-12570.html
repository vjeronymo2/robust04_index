			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Property: Hertfordshire Tudor Lordship for rent THE Lordship at Standon is the formal name of the house, but any buyer who wanted to add the Manorial Title to the village of Standon in Hertfordshire need only work out a deal with the present owners who bought the Title a few years ago. The Lordship is a genuine 16th-century manor house built for Sir Ralph Sadlier, one of the custodians of Mary Queen of Scots. Often in distinguished houses the owners have added wings as the fancy took and the purse allowed. Here, the various owners stopped at eight principal and four secondary bedrooms. The 11-acre estate contains 350 yards of indifferent fishing on the River Rib, a helicopter pad, a hard tennis court, paddocks and landscaped gardens. The Lordship was brought to the market by Strutt &amp; Parker's St Albans office (0727-40285) last autumn with a tentative asking price of Pounds 1.25m for the freehold. S&amp;P's Anna Rowbottom says: 'The owners bought The Lordship around ten years ago when it was divided into two. Now, it is a beautifully restored Manor house, but it doesn't feel at all overwhelming. They have made it an ideal family house.' Ideal or not, Pounds 1.25m has proved too steep for the people who have viewed the house so far. Now, in a set-piece illustration of the new question that must face any would-be country home buyer in the next few years, S&amp;P is offering to rent the house for Pounds 3,000 a month. Rowbottom expects rental inquiries from the usual directions for properties of this size: overseas bankers on a short stay in the City, companies keen to have a single country retreat for executives being jetting around the world, or senior business people travelling with their families who need a British base for from six months to a few years. After allowing for tax and other costs, anyone putting the asking price on deposit and renting instead would be making a large financial saving. On the face of it, the suggested rent barely equals the capital value of a third of the asking price. That reflects a demanding asking price and the current immaturity of the larger country house rental market. But that immaturity will not last for long in face of these kinds of financial alternatives.</p>

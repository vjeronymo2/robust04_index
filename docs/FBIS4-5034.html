			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri will visit Rangoon  on April 19 and will official!y invite Burma to attend the Asean  Ministerial Meeting in July as Bangkok's guest.    His visit, at the invitation of Rangoon, comes shortly after  Prasong finally obtained approval from the five other member  states -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and  Singapore -- that Burma should be invited as a guest of the host  country and not of the regional grouping.    This will limit Rangoon's participation to attending the  opening session and the official dinner, not the closed  discussions.    Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines had initially held  "some reservations" about inviting Burma to the Asean  conference. They have expressed concern over Asean losing  credibility in the eyes of the world community and about strong  criticism from the West, which has strongly condemned the  Burmese military regime's heavy-handed policy against the  democracy movement.    They are also concerned that the problems of Muslim Rohingya  refugees fleeing from military persecution in Burma's western  Arakan State into Bangladesh are not yet fully resolved.    Thailand, as chairman of the Asean Standing Committee, will  host the ministerial meeting in July. The forum will be  immediately followed by a meeting of Asean with its seven  developed, dialogue partners -- Australia, Canada, Japan, New  Zealand, South Korea, the European Union and the United States.    Informed sources said Prasong's acceptance of the Burmese  junta's invitation and the date is being conveyed to Rangoon for  final approval. The trip will last one or two days, depending  on the programme arranged by Burmese authorities.    Prasong will visit Burma as chairman of the Asean Standing  Committee and as Thai foreign minister. The objective of the  trip is to inform the Burmese regime what he has done in  inviting Burma to the Asean meeting, and to assess the political  situation and development in the country, said the sources.    The Thai foreign minister has been criticized for his  drastic  shift of policy towards Burma. He earlier strongly criticized  the government of then prime minister Anan Panyarachun for its  ties with the Burmese junta and for ignoring the plight of the  Burmese democratic forces. At that time he called for a change  of policy and for sympathy and support for pro-democratic  movement in Burma.    Since his appointment as foreign minister, however, he has  discarded his previous views and himself become involved with  the military junta known as the State Law and Order Restoration  Council (Slorc).    He travelled to Burma last September amid strong opposition  from the Burmese dissidents to endorse the establishment of a  new bilateral Thai-Burmese committee, which is to oversee trade  and economic relations.    Prasong has expressed his strong desire to include Burma as  a  member of Asean at the earliest opportunity. Rangoon has for  the past three years shown interest in attending the annual  Asean meeting, but lack of consensus among the Asean countries  prevented its participation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.N. Security Council statement on North Korea  issued Thursday took the format suggested by China but it is not  milder in content than the resolution that had been initiated by  Western countries, a Foreign Ministry official said yesterday.    He said South Korea and four countries with permanent  membership on the council--the United States, Russia, Britain  and France-- decided to accept the Chinese proposal to issue a  statement instead of a resolution in order to gain future  cooperation from China, the other permanent member.    But the content included much that had been suggested by the  five countries, especially South Korea, he claimed. "The  statement, therefore, can be said to be a compromise of the  Western idea of adopting a resolution and the Chinese proposal  for a statement," said Ham Myong-chol, director-general for  international organizations of the ministry.    He tried to place the most significance of Thursday's U.N.  Security Council statement in setting a deadline for an  additional nuclear inspection on North Korea at the end of this  month or early next month. He said Hans Blix, director-general  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is scheduled  to make a report on North Korea to the council within "six weeks  from March 24." The statement issued Thursday has required the  director-general to report also on the completion of the  inspections agreed between the IAEA and North Korea Feb. 15 on  the day.    "This means North Korea is given a deadline for receiving  additional inspections to make up for those conducted last  month, which the IAEA said are unsatisfactory.    "The deadline, to be specific, is the end of this month or  early next month," he said.    He said another noticeable change in the process of  negotiations on the statement was the active participation of  China. Ham said China participated in the process from the  beginning when the other four permanent members of the Security  Council started to draw up the first draft. China, however,  remained silent during the first stage and proposed a few days  later to issue a statement instead of the resolution.    South Korea also took part in the whole process and  succeeded  in having the statement include a phrase on the deadline for  additional inspections of North Korea, Ham said. He said the  original draft drawn up by the four Western permanent members  did not mention the deadline. The Seoul government, however,  supported the Chinese proposal out of the belief that what  counts more is content not format, he said. The official said a  resolution appears more resolute than a statement. But a  statement, if it is made with a consensus among members, could  be more effective than a resolution that is vetoed by one member.    He said a presidential statement can also serve well the  purpose of the Security Council measure--to urge North Korea's  acceptance of inspections and recommend dialogue between the  parties concerned.</p>

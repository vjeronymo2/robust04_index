			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Kuwait move causes big fall in oil price OIL PRICES tumbled yesterday following Kuwait's refusal to agree to restrain its output in coming months in accordance with a deal struck late on Thursday by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Ministers meeting in Geneva had agreed to maintain their current production ceiling of 23.6m barrels a day for the third quarter. But Mr Ali Ahmed al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, said the emirate would increase its production. North Sea Brent crude fell 65 cents to Dollars 17.80 a barrel as traders reacted to an expected rush of supply to the market. Kuwait is planning to raise its production to 2m b/d from 1.6m b/d over the next three months and Mr al-Baghli has indicated it could reach 2.16m b/d by the end of September. But he said Kuwait would not flood the market and is not looking to depress prices. 'It's not as bad for the market as it looks,' said Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst with UBS in London. 'Politically, it's a terrible agreement, but commercially it won't be so awful.' Most Opec producers are pumping oil at close to their full capacity which will stop them over-producing. Others, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, are keen to see firmer prices. Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister said yesterday the kingdom will stick to its quota under the agreement. 'If everybody adheres, we think the market will stabilise,' he said.</p>

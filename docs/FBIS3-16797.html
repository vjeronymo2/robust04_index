This conclusion follows from  a ruling by Vologda City Court, which has considered an action  against Yuriy Nekrasov, "Democratic Russia's" local leader, by  the oblast organization of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia].    Soon after the elections of 12 December last year Prof.  Yuriy  Nekrasov, Doctor of Historical Sciences, published in the  newspaper RUSSKIY SEVER an article analyzing the reasons that  led to the LDPR's sucess. A specialist in German history, he  compared Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's actions with Adolf Hitler's in  the Reichstag elections of January 1933 and called the LDPR a  profascist political organization.    Vologda Liberal Democrats took out a court action to defend  their honor and dignity. They demanded a public apology from  Yuriy Nekrasov, as well as a sum of 10 million rubles for the  moral harm. Sergey Mormin, coordinator of the LDPR's oblast  organization, explained in court that they need this money for  propaganda work to restore the party's undermined prestige.  Some 29 percent of the voters who went to the ballot boxes  voted for Zhirinovskiy's party in the 12 December elections in  Vologda Oblast. But the Liberal Democrats have been unable to  field a single candidate for the elections to the oblast duma to  be held 20 March.    "More than two-thirds of the citizens who supported us in  the  last elections," Sergey Mormin explained, "have refused to sign  documents in favor of our candidates, saying that we are a  fascist party."    In the court session Prof. Yuriy Nekrasov, relying on works  by U.S. and Italian researchers into fascism, named six generic  signs of this political trend and illustrated them convincingly  with quotations from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's book and speeches.  Evidently finding nothing with which to counter the professor's  arguments, Sergey Mormin, the Vologda Liberal Democrats' leader,  disowned his own leader, telling the court that Zhirinovskiy's  actions are a personal matter for Zhirinovskiy and have no  bearing on the activity of the whole party.    After an investigation lasting more than three hours the  court rejected the Vologda LDPR organization's action against  Prof. Yuriy Nekrasov, chairman of "Democratic Russia's" oblast  branch.</p>

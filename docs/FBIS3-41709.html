This time the vibrio was possibly imported from  Bulgaria. According to the State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight signs of illness usually  accompanying cholera appeared in a Russian citizen traveling by  train from Bulgaria. A group of Russian tourists was riding in  the same car. Specialists have to determine whether the  intestinal disease the patient has is really cholera. The  patient and others who were in the car with him are now  hospitalized in Bryansk for establishment of the final  diagnosis. And in the meantime the statistics of cholera  morbidity in Russia remain the same: 15 patients and 8 carriers  of the cholera vibrio. In this case 11 patients and 5 carriers  were infected abroad.    Around 600 persons who had contact with vibrio carriers were  recently hospitalized in Kazakhstan for cholera testing. Among  these subjects, disease has been detected in 16 thus far.  Epidemiological oversight has been intensified in Alma-Ata,  especially on main transportation routes, in terminals and at  airports. For example, imports of vegetables and fruits from the  republic's southern regions have been banned. Special attention  is being turned to tourists coming from Asian countries by air.  Every person arriving in Alma-Ata remains under the observation  of medical workers for around a day. As a result several persons  infected with cholera vibrio were once again detected on 16  September among foreign passengers in an airplane from Karachi.    A Russian tourist returning from Turkey never made it to his  home in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. He was taken off the Sophia-Moscow  train at the Romanian-Moldovan border and hospitalized. The  diagnosis-- cholera. The Moldovan epidemiological service  discovered cholera vibrio in another three of his fellow  travelers. Moldovan doctors took the necessary precautions, and  issued warnings of the danger to the epidemiological services of  Ukrainian and Russian cities through which the Sophia-Moscow  passes.</p>

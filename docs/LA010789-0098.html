			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLAROID PLAN IS UPHELD, BLOCKING BID BY SHAMROCK  </P> <P> A judge upheld a controversial Polaroid Corp. employee stock ownership plan  Friday, effectively blocking a hostile $2.6-billion takeover bid by Disney  family-owned Shamrock Holdings Inc.  </P> <P> The ruling by Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger of Delaware Chancery Court comes  more than two months after the companies squared off in court over the validity  of the stock plan, which was unveiled just before Shamrock's bid for the  instant-camera pioneer.  </P> <P> "Looks like they won," said William Relyea, an analyst with Eberstadt Fleming  Inc. in New York. "It just raises the odds even higher that Polaroid is safe in  the hands of management."  </P> <P> Shamrock, based in Burbank, maintained that Polaroid enacted the  10-million-share, $300-million stock plan specifically to block the takeover.  </P> <P> Polaroid said it was a long-planned effort to benefit employees.  </P> <P> In a 53-page ruling, Berger said the employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP,  was partly defensive in nature but not unfair to shareholders or workers "and  should not be invalidated."  </P> <P> "It is structurally fair in its voting and tendering provisions and I do not  find either the timing of its implementation or its possible anti-takeover  effect objectionable under the facts of this case," Berger wrote.  </P> <P> "This is a defensive device -- assuming it is one -- that is designed to and  appears likely to add value to the company and all of its stockholders," she  added. "It does not prevent stockholders from receiving or considering  alternatives."  </P> <P> Shamrock spokesman John Grimaldi said the company would not comment until  reading the decision.  </P> <P> The decision all but blocks a takeover because it puts 14% of Polaroid stock in  the hands of employees. Under Delaware takeover law, a hostile bidder must  acquire more than 85% of a target's outstanding shares for control. Polaroid is  incorporated in Delaware.  </P> <P> Polaroid, which was founded by Edwin H. Land in 1938 and introduced instant  snapshots 10 years later, also faces the favorable prospect of a trial in  federal court in Boston to determine how much it will receive of a $5.7-billion  damages request against Eastman Kodak Co. for patent infringements.  </P> <P> Polaroid closed Friday at $38.25, up 50 cents, in composite New York Stock  Exchange trading.  </P></p>

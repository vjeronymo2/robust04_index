			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Questions for the multiple-choice Pep - Serious Money Readers will hear a lot about personal equity plans as the tax year draws to a close on April 5. Many people leave their tax-planning measures to the last minute so fund management groups wait until the last quarter to bombard potential investors with new launches and discounts. The annual maximum investment in a general plan is Pounds 6,000 in a tax year and income and capital gains are tax-free. However, investors must have a plan manager who will charge an annual fee. The issue of charges has become most heated in the case of unit trusts. This might seem a little strange at first, since charges on a unit trust Pep may frequently be no higher than investing in the same trust direct. By contrast, charges on an investment trust Pep tend to be higher than a direct holding because the trust has to charge for the extra administration involved. However, unit trusts tend to be a more expensive way into the market than investment trusts because investors typically face an initial charge of 5-6 per cent and an annual management fee of 1.5 per cent. The initial charge is part of what is known in the jargon as the bid / offer spread - the difference between buying units and selling them. A typical bid / offer spread is about 6 per cent, but it can be wider. Some unit trust companies have been reducing the initial charge on their Peps but have introduced withdrawal charges on a sliding scale. A number of stockbrokers will offer discounts on the initial charge for self-select Peps or for execution only-unit trust deals. This week, Skandia Life, has come up with a new twist for the launch of its first non-insurance product. Its Multipep aims to allow the investor to switch between a number of unit trusts at low cost. How does it work? Skandia has pre-selected 30 funds, in the main for good performance and for a spread between the UK and abroad, and capital or income. You pay an initial charge for the Pep of 4.75 to 5 per cent, which is lower than that on most unit trust Peps. UK funds include: Fidelity Special Situations, Gartmore British and two James Capel index funds - the Footsie and the Trixie; those in the European sector include Baring European Growth, Henderson European Income, Morgan Grenfell European Growth and another James Capel tracker fund, its Eurotrack 100 Index. There are three ethical funds - Abtrust Ethical, Credit Suisse Fellowship and Merlin Ecology - and one emerging market fund: Framlington Emerging Markets. Investors can also choose from a number of US, far eastern, Global and fixed interest funds. Most of the funds have good or excellent performance, apart from the ethical trusts and some of the index-linked trusts. If, for example, you invest in Fidelity Special Situations through the Multipep but later decide you wanted income rather than capital growth, you could transfer to one of the income funds at a low initial charge of between 0.25 per cent and 0.5 per cent, instead of usual transfer charges of between 2 and 5 per cent. You can also switch temporarily to cash in the Pep. There are disadvantages. Skandia imposes its own annual fee of 0.5 per cent on top of the fee charged by the manager. This means that the total annual fee will vary between 1.5 and 2 per cent. Over time, annual fees have much more of an effect on performance than initial fees. There is also a dividend collection charge which varies depending on the number of dividends a year. The charges are for each dividend collection: Pounds 5 if only one dividend is paid out; Pounds 4 each for two; Pounds 3 for four; and Pounds 2 for 12. If your chosen trust were to pay dividends on a monthly basis and you took them all as income, you would pay Pounds 24 a year. Anomalies can also arise. A Fidelity Pep bought direct has a low initial charge of 2 per cent and withdrawal fees. If you own Fidelity Special Situations but want to transfer into Multipep within three years of taking out the Fidelity fund, you could find yourself paying Fidelity's withdrawal charges and an initial charge of 5 per cent for the Multipep, instead of the 2 per cent on direct purchases into the same fund. You could use a discount broker to reduce the initial charge. The strength of the Multipep is for those who envisage moving between funds. How likely is this? Skandia Life argues that many investors feel locked into one fund manager once they invest in a Pep but that over the longer-term, they are likely to make a number of transfers because investment needs change or the performance of funds drop. Many people may say they are able to get good performance by choosing the right fund at the outset and can achieve diversification by investing their annual allowance in different funds. They may also argue that the choice of funds in Multipep is restrictive, although Skandia says it will be adding to them. Moreover, given the trend towards lower Pep prices, the annual charge appears too high. Nevertheless, Skandia gets full marks for a good idea. Last week I wrote that Noble Lowndes' fine of Pounds 740,000 was for switching people out of occupational schemes and into private pensions. In fact, the fine was in no way related to this issue but was for unnecessary switching and unsuitable advice in connection with investments. My apologies for the error.</p>

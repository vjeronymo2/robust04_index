			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BBA buys rest of US offshoot BBA GROUP, which serves the automotive, industrial and aviation markets, has conditionally agreed to acquire the outstanding 20 per cent minority shareholding in IGH, its US subsidiary, as part of an overall settlement of all litigation with the original vendors. Shareholder approval will be sought because the vendors are currently directors of IGH. BBA acquired the 80 per cent of IGH in May 1989 for a consideration of Dollars 51.6m (Pounds 30.7m). The acquisition arrangements included provisions for the vendors to receive an earned pay-out of Dollars 15m based on the results of IGH for the two years ended June 30 1990 which has not become payable. During the course of 1991 actions were brought against BBA and certain of its subsidiaries' directors and its employees in a New York Federal Court by the vendors. The damages claimed were in the sum of Dollars 300m. The settlement details mean that when added to the consideration BBA paid for the original 80 per cent of IGH this gives an aggregate acquisition cost to BBA for 100 per cent of IGH of Dollars 72.6m.</p>

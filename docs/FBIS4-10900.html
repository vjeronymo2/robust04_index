			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Council of Science and Technology of  Mexico and the State Committee for Economic Cooperation [CECE]  of Cuba signed an agreement today in Havana which includes 20  cooperation projects in the scientific-technical spheres. The  projects cover the agricultural-livestock, industrial, fishing,  and food sectors and were signed by Dr. Fausto Alzati Araiza  chief representative of the National Council of Science and  Technology in Mexico, and by Ernesto Melendez, minister  president of the CECE.    [Begin Alzati recording] We are seeking to establish  specific  research and development projects that are as close as possible  to application. In other words, we are talking not about basic  research but about projects that could soon materialize into  economic benefits.

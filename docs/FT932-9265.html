			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Dial M for money Oh, to have had a bug on the wall when the Treasury mandarins heard about BT's pension deficit. Some Pounds 500m of the deterioration in the fund has come about directly as a result of the Budget advance corporation tax changes. A similar amount fell victim to over-optimistic assumptions about dividend growth in 1992 - perhaps an excusable error given the chancellor's persistent visions of economic green shoots. To compensate, BT is pumping Pounds 1.1bn of cash into the pension scheme just when the government is trying to unload around Pounds 5bn worth of the company's shares. BT did not have to replace the whole deficit at once, but there were obvious reasons for doing so. Since the company can afford to cough up, it makes sense to get the cash working tax-free as soon as possible. The board is understandably keen to avoid the accusation that it has raided the pension fund to pay for its redundancy programme. Paying now also puts off the awkward day when BT clears its debts and starts piling up cash, thus provoking serious questions about what should happen to its money. The heavy redundancy programme makes BT a special case, but the dramatic swing in the pension fund carries a wider message. If actuaries are sensibly assuming that companies will not increase dividends to compensate for ACT changes, and if 1992 was worse than generally anticipated, some company pension holidays are about to come to an abrupt halt. Most companies will have to make up the difference steadily - further limiting their ability to increase cash dividend payments. By contrast, BT's financial strength, phenomenal cash generation and 8.3 per cent dividend increase only underline that it can afford to do what most others can not.</p>

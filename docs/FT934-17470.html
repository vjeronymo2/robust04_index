			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Gummer advocates one-tier local government structure ENGLAND'S two-tier local government structure should be replaced with a series of unitary authorities, even if it costs more than the present system, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced yesterday. He also said that the Local Government Commission for England would complete its work next year, having previously been due to finish in 1997. The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, has already recommended the abolition of three county councils. Mr Gummer said he wanted unitary authorities because 'it's much clearer where the responsibility lies'. The measures alarmed business leaders and led to angry opposition from county councils, which said transition costs might reach more than Pounds 1bn. Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants used by the commission, produced figures suggesting that the transition costs for small unitary authorities might be prohibitive. District councils, which have campaigned for unitary - or single-tier - authorities on existing boundaries, reacted positively. Mr Gummer announced the shift by changing the policy guidance to the commission, with the effect that: Retaining the existing two-tier structure is now expected to be 'the exception'. 'Local consensus' is now important, and the commission is to give 'particular weight' to proposals jointly put forward by groups of authorities. The importance of cost has been downgraded and the commission is not now 'precluded from recommending an option which would be marginally more expensive than the status quo'. 'Very large' unitary authorities will need 'special justification in terms of community identity'. Statutory and voluntary joint arrangements between authorities can now be recommended for strategic planning. The CBI welcomed the 'shorter period of uncertainty', but described the revised guidance as 'fuzzy'. It said local businesses had consistently put cost and quality of local services at the top of their list. Mrs Josie Farrington, deputy chairman of the Association of County Councils said: 'The case for changing local-government structure has yet to be made. The proposals assume it has.' But the Association of District Councils was 'delighted'. Mr Geoffrey Filkin, chief executive, said very few districts would now ask for unitary status without arranging mergers with other districts.</p>

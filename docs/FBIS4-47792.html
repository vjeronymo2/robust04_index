			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The northwestern Zambian city of Solwezi has more  than 27,000 refugees. Most of them are Angolans, but there are  also people from Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire. Last weekend 316  Angolans arrived in Mwinilinga and another 55 in Solwezi. They  are believed to have come from Moxico Province and they are  fleeing the war caused by the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola. [passage omitted]</p>

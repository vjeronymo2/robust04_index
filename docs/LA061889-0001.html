			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BOYHOOD IN THE PAST PERFECT;  </P> <P> BACK THERE WHERE THE PAST WAS A SMALL-TOWN BOYHOOD BY CHARLES CHAMPLIN;  FOREWORD BY RAY BRADBURY (SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $18.95; 232 PP.,  ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> The best prescription for a happy childhood is a bad memory, Charles Champlin  remembers someone saying. And when we consider 20th-Century fiction, all the  Joyces and Lawrences and Wolfes, it is sometimes hard to bear in mind that  countless human beings remember their childhoods precisely and fondly,  sometimes even as the best part of their lives. Perhaps it is true, as Pound  remarked, that hatred, rather than love, is more often the driving force of  literature. Perhaps contented souls are less tempted to take up their pens.  </P> <P> All the more reason, then, to be grateful to the Garrison Keillors and Charles  Champlins in our midst. Hammondsport, N.Y., has been to a still-unfinished  series of Champlin columns in the Los Angeles Times what Lake Wobegon, Gateway  to Central Minnesota, has been to Keillor's monologues on American Public  Radio. But whereas Keillor has tried to sight his childhood mythically, as if  it were a constellation in the heavens, Champlin, sticking to the discipline of  fact, keeps his earthbound.  </P> <P> Champlin's Hammondsport is set in the Finger Lakes of New York's Southern Tier  in what must be the most underratedly beautiful landscape in the Northeast. And  though Hammondsport is small-town by anyone's standards, it has long had  connections to the larger world, both as a center of aviation (local scion Glen  Hammond Curtiss flew the world's first seaplane over Keuka Lake) and, more  anciently, a wine-making district and home to the vineyards of Taylor and Great  Western (a Champlin family enterprise).  </P> <P> The picture Champlin paints for us is modest, grave, and yet, at this distance,  almost fantastic. In towns like Hammondsport, the '20s never roared, and the  '30s, though they wiped out savings, did not erase the simple rituals of  civility: the uncles in their dignity, the aunts bustling quietly, the  dedicated maiden-lady teachers, the gang down at the gas station, the little  railroad, the bandstand in the park (and the cars that honked their  appreciation at Saturday-night concerts in summer), the humble movie theater,  the many-layered preparations for Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas, the  importance of the churches. Champlin remembers a way of life that flourished in  this country from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War II. It  was a life dependent on small details and small pleasures, and, except for the  inventions of auto, aircraft and cinema, a life that seemed like one continuous  woven cloth. "No one," writes Champlin, "who has not tended a coal-burning  furnace -- shaken its grates, started it from scratch when it went out,  shoveled its ashes (and lugged them to the street), been enslaved to its hourly  needs, learned to bank the fire so it would last the night -- no one who has  not coped with these mystical rites has experienced life fully."  </P> <P> I am especially grateful to Champlin for his elegiac evocations of  French-American and German-American family life, as represented by his mother's  family. It seems to me that, like the beauty of the Southern Tier, the  contributions of these two ethnic stockpots to the flavoring of American  culture have long been ignored, in favor of louder and brasher contributors.  The Germans, in particular, who bestowed upon us such characteristic American  products as frankfurters and lager beer and who raised the Catholic Church in  the Midwest to a level of civilization that the Irish and Italian immigrants in  the East rarely approached, have been undervalued. How very much poorer would  our Advents and our Christmases be without their genius for festive ornament  and domestic conviviality.  </P> <P> Champlin is hardly an aggressive writer, and, given the contemporary style of  verbal overkill, it is easy to miss his quiet effects: the "root-heaved  sidewalks"; the "semaphore eyebrows" of his aunts; that all adult family  friends were "aunt" or "uncle"; that every other man in Upstate New York seems  to be known by the initials of his first and middle name.  </P> <P> Today Hammondsport boasts much less in the way of locally owned business. The  vineyards were consumed by Coca-Cola, then by Seagrams, then by a management  group called Vintners International. The local bank is now "the least branch of  a vast conglomerate financial institution." The local telephone company is a  memory only. Champlin mentions twice the contemporary phenomenon of  homelessness, which bothers him greatly. I wonder: Is our loss of local control  over our own destinies anesthetizing us to the "lost" members of our society?  Does the loss of a sense of place (even in urban neighborhoods) mean that the  homeless belong nowhere and to no one?  </P> <P> Certainly it is hard to imagine a contemporary father writing to his son as  Champlin's great-great-great-grandfather Sam Baker wrote: "Now Richard, as you  lay the foundation so will the building be strong or weak. One thing I would  impress on your mind -- it is much easier to be what you would wish people to  think you are than to make them believe you are what you are not. It is very  easy to practice Justice, Mercy and Love and Truth but very hard to make people  believe you are an honest man without being in reality such."  </P> <P> I have often thought that what this country really needs is a "Dictionary of  Outmoded Terms" to help us remember all the lost experiences that had once been  crucial to everyone. I am thinking of nouns like privy and groaner and  adjectives like square (as in "square meal" and "square deal" and "square  guy"). But in "Back There Where the Past Was," Charles Champlin has given us a  "Book of Outmoded Experiences" to help us remember our past and enrich our  present and future.  </P></p>

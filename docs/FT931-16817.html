			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Clinton team faces gentle Senate test: Most emollient hearing may be for Lloyd Bentsen's Treasury posting SENATE confirmation of President-elect Bill Clinton's new cabinet begins this week. In spite of earlier threats by Republicans to subject the nominees to what has become known as the 'Tower test', no one appears to face rejection - the fate that befell Mr John Tower, President George Bush's choice as defence secretary four years ago. He was undone mostly by revelations about his private life. The Democratic party's 57-43 edge in the Senate should provide sufficient insulation against rejection, but it is three votes short of being filibuster-proof and the elasticity of Senate rules makes procedural delays possible. Those likely to face the toughest questioning are Mr Ron Brown, the choice for the Commerce Department, Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary-designate, and Ms Donna Shalala, due to take over health and human services. Mr Brown, who faces the Senate commerce committee tomorrow, is the quintessential Washington lawyer-insider, which helped make him such an effective national Democratic chairman. Political lobbyists, however, are not too popular at the moment, as Mr Clinton's tough new ethical standard for senior members of his administration attests, and Mr Brown's law firm has represented a number of foreign governments and corporations. These include Haiti when it was run by President 'Baby Doc' Duvalier. Mr Reich's voluminous writings over the last decade will provide critical senators with plenty of ammunition for what could be entertaining hearings, beginning on Thursday. Ms Shalala may be a target of Republican conservatives concerned she will push those policies favouring reproductive choice so vigorously opposed by the Reagan and Bush administrations. She has also spent more time in the field of education than in the areas covered by her new portfolio. Hearings for the main foreign and security policy nominees will mostly take place next week, although there is a chance that the Senate armed services committee may begin its questioning of Mr Les Aspin, picked as defence secretary, on Thursday. The most emollient session is likely to be next week when the Senate finance committee hears from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary-designate who has chaired the committee for the last six years. If the cabinet makes it through unscathed, history suggests that some secondary-level appointments subject to Senate confirmation could face rougher proceedings. The pro-life knives, for example, are out for Dr Joycelyn Elders, head of the Arkansas Public Health Department, who has been nominated to take over as surgeon general next summer and who is a leader of the pro-choice movement.</p>

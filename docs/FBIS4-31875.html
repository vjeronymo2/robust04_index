			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 15 (BTA) -- European standards  concerning the free expression of national identity are much  higher than those operative in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] which are likely to be applied  in the forthcoming census there, Foreign Ministry spokesman  Radko Vlaykov told a news conference here today. The official  documents on the forthcoming census (to be taken June 21-July 5)  mention a choice of seven nationalities, including even Turkish  and Egyptian, but no Bulgarian.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that prior to the census  the government of Macedonia should take the necessary steps to  secure free expression for all its citizens, in line with  European standards. Bulgaria will take a stand on the results  accordingly.    Bulgaria follows with great interest the process of  democratization in Macedonia and supports its efforts to join  the community of free and democratic states, Mr. Vlaykov pointed  out. He reminded that Bulgaria was the first country to  recognize the independence of Macedonia and clearly declared its  willingness for close cooperation. It makes efforts to assist  Macedonia's integration with the international community and the  recognition of its independence. Bulgaria's efforts to help  Macedonia overcome its economic difficulties are no secret,  either, he added.    Only 1,500 Bulgarians were registered in Macedonia in the  latest census. In the forms for the new one the Bulgarian  nationality has not been included at all. The previous census  was boycotted by the Albanians for the same reason. Now, unlike  Bulgarians, they have been included in the forms. Mr. Ilija  Ilijevski, leader of the Human Rights Party in Macedonia, told  reporters in Sofia last week that Bulgarians will be deprived of  the right to free expression of their national identity. He  also pointed out that the census will be conducted in conditions  of long-lasting violation of the human rights of Bulgarians in  Macedonia and that the results will not be objective and  reliable.</p>

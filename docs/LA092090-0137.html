			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: BELL GARDENS;  </P> <P> CROWD PROTESTS REZONING, SUCCEEDS IN GETTING DELAY  </P> <P> More than 60 Bell Gardens homeowners, developers and residents filled the City  Council chamber Tuesday night during a Planning Commission meeting to protest a  city staff recommendation that certain portions of the city be rezoned.  </P> <P> Many held colorful handwritten signs carrying such messages as "End the abuse"  and "We demand justice."  </P> <P> Twenty-nine families in the Kress Avenue area said they have been attending  Planning Commission meetings for the past four months, requesting notification  of rezoning plans. They were never informed of the changes and found out about  the meeting after a neighbor saw the notice posted in the public library, they  told commissioners. City officials say notice of the meeting was published in  the local newspaper.  </P> <P> Property owners are concerned that the recommended downgrading of zones will  decrease property values. After three hours of heated discussion, the  commission decided to send the recommendation back to the city staff for review  before the next Planning Commission meeting Oct. 16.  </P></p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Brussels set to encourage mobile telecoms networks The European Commission is expected to show its determination to speed up the liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications industry by forcing through legislation that will let mobile telecoms operators build their own networks. Buoyed by the support for plans for deregulating Europe's telecommunications networks at the Corfu summit last month, the commission intends to use special powers to ensure that the liberalising of mobile telecoms infrastructures is not delayed. The move is bound to upset some of Europe's most entrenched telephone monopolies. Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome allows the commission to impose liberalisation on intransigent member states without a vote at the Council of Ministers. It is rarely used as it is criticised for being undemocratic, but has been used relatively frequently in telecommunications. Few are surprised at the commission's intention to adopt article 90 to impose the mobile telecoms green paper. Momentum for liberalisation has been gathering pace not just in Brussels but among the member states too, who recognise that a competitive network is crucial for European competitiveness. Liberalisation of mobile infrastructures would give mobile operators greater flexibility, and enable them to avoid interconnection payments to Europe's fixed network operators. Experts at the commission believe this could cut the cost of long distance mobile calls by as much as 50 per cent. But many of the big public telephone companies in countries such as Portugal, Germany, and Spain fear a loss of revenue, and are pressing for delays in infrastructure liberalisation in this sector until the commission introduces plans for the deregulation of all infrastructures later this year. They argue that they need the revenue from mobile interconnection fees to keep up their commitment to a universal telephone service. Recent consultations in Brussels on the mobile telecommunications green paper attracted opposition from the public operators in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Belgium over the pace of liberalisation. But the commission believes it is now in a strong position to push ahead, backed by the welcome given by member states to the recommendations of the Bangemann group of industry leaders, which called for speedy liberalisation of EU telecoms infrastructures and services.</p>

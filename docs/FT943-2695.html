			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (2): Made to measure - Investment management / Fees are high, because Savile Row portfolio treatment does not come at Marks &amp; Spencer's off-the-peg prices Their highly desirable City offices may suggest ivory towers, but the blue-chip investment houses know that they can no longer rely on the cachet of their name, or on 'old' money and personal recommendations, to attract new private clients. Competitive pressures mean that they regularly present their case to prospective clients at 'beauty parades', and many have been converted to the need for selective marketing and the raising of some hitherto discreet profiles. Even today, however, no leading investment management firm professes to provide a private-client service for Everyman. Few, if any, will consider managing a portfolio of equities for a client with less than Pounds 100,000 of free assets, and many require considerably larger sums. At Kleinwort Benson the minimum is around Pounds 200,000, for example; at BZW, Pounds 250,000; at Mercury, Pounds 300,000; and at Schroders, a cool Pounds 2m. Even when minima are not cast in stone, the annual management fee may dictate the minimum acceptable sum. For instance, Barings' minimum fee is Pounds 10,000 a year. Performance, therefore, would have to be red-hot for the merchant bank to provide value to a client with less than Pounds 1m. Clearly, Savile Row investment management does not come at Marks and Spencer's off-the-peg prices. Most investment managers charge percentage-based annual fees, and the minimum annual charge can vary from the relatively modest to the very expensive. For example, the minimum fee at Schroders is Pounds 20,000 a year. Cazenove is among those that have retained a commission-charging structure for private clients, however; and there are others who charge a combination of commissions and management fees. Flemings allows its private clients to choose. Despite their size and their institutional clout, the best known investment managers argue that they provide a highly personalised service for their private clients. The common view is that no two clients are the same, and that portfolios must be created to suit the individual, rather than to fit in with a preconceived set of guidelines. Every private client has a bespoke portfolio, reflecting their own particular circumstances. There is frequent contact with clients, starting with an initial meeting to establish their investment aims and their tolerance to risk; and great care is taken when allocating clients to their named manager. Nicholas Bowater, head of private clients at Credit Suisse Asset Management, says: 'We go through a selection process, to ensure that the manager matches the client.' Much stress is placed on empathy. As a senior partner at Cazenove has said: 'You should never be seduced by the amount of money on offer. It is much more important to feel that we can get on with the client.' It is certainly not unknown for an investment house to turn down a prospective client. After all, there is little point in choosing a highly disciplined and conservative house such as Rothschilds or Schroders if one wishes to pursue a markedly adventurous investment strategy. Michael Chamberlayne, chairman of Barings' private client division in London, comments: 'Clients do come in with an inflated view of what is possible, and I am never prepared to answer the question 'what return are you going for?'. It is a complete non-starter.' A considerable selling point for the leading investment houses is that both their institutional and their private clients benefit from their depth of research capability and their often vast global investment resources. The managers argue that this global perspective enables them to deliver services that are denied to the clients of smaller investment management firms. For example, they can provide private clients with expertise in overseas and emerging markets and international bond markets, and protect their portfolios with derivatives and with hedging techniques. The asset allocation in each private-client portfolio is likely to reflect the current thinking of the investment house's experts, judiciously adjusted for individual private-client circumstances; and the stocks will largely be those that have passed the scrutiny of a team of analysts and researchers. This should both add value and reduce risk. For example, no Mercury private clients held a Polly Peck or British and Commonwealth share when these companies ran into difficulties. Collective investment vehicles are widely used to provide clients with exposure in specialist and overseas markets, however. Most managers argue that a portfolio needs to be very substantial indeed before a manager can introduce individual overseas stocks. Cazenove puts the figure at Pounds 1m. There is no consensus on the use, or avoidance, of in-house unit trusts, however. Some managers stick to the firm's funds; others, such as James Capel and Rothschilds, devote considerable research resources to analysing all the available collective funds. Similarly, there is no unanimity about the type of investment anagement offered. Some firms will accept new private clients only on a discretionary basis - Schroders, Mercury, Cazenove, Barings and Rothschild fall into this category - while others, including Flemings, Credit Suisse, Kleinwort Benson, James Capel and BZW, welcome both discretionary and advisory clients. Clearly, the bottom line for private clients is the performance the top investment managers achieve on their behalf, and it is not easy for a prospective client to assess this. However, a number of the biggest investment management firms now run unit trusts that replicate the portfolio of a wealthy private client, and these are useful shop windows on their overall performance. Managers running these funds include Mercury, Schroders, Cazenove, Barings and Credit Suisse. The one thing none of the leading investment managers professes to provide is an all-singing, all-dancing financial supermarket. They will work with a private client's accountant and solicitor; and they may act as honest broker if a client wants to invest in something like agricultural land. But they do not sell life assurance or indeed general financial planning services. The fundamental brief of virtually every private client division of a top investment management firm is, in fact, unambiguous. It is to preserve the real value of a private client's wealth through the management of a carefully weighted portfolio of UK and overseas equities, domestic and international bonds, and cash.</p>

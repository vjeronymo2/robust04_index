			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM  </P> <P> Your editorial on cooling the medical cost epidemic (Editorials, March 27)  informs us that the "Clinical Appropriateness Initiative" being developed by  the RAND Corp. will attempt to define standards for what is or is not an  appropriate surgery, a long overdue effort to eliminate the many unnecessary  procedures now being performed.  </P> <P> It is obvious that the medical care crisis is a serious, complex problem  requiring thoughtful, workable solutions, such as the fixed fee, universal  coverage approach in Canada, combined with reforms.  </P> <P> Our politicians, however, have a much simpler solution. No problem, don't  address the structural flaws in our system, just let the employer pay for  universal coverage.  </P> <P> What the politicians don't understand is that most businesses that don't offer  employer-paid health insurance can't afford to. Many businesses are like mine,  heavy on labor, with less than $150 per month per employee in net profit.  Forcing the employer to pay insurance under these circumstances becomes a  monetary impossibility.  </P> <P> PHILIP G. deCARION  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

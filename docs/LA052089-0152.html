			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OVERCOMING 'AMERICAN PIE' LEGACY;  </P> <P> MCLEAN COOKS UP OTHER SONGS  </P> <P> Anyone who has been near a radio anytime in the last 17 years probably knows  these lyrics: "Bye-bye Miss American Pie, Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the  levee was dry. . . ."  </P> <P> But do you remember who wrote them? If it took you longer than a few seconds to  answer, then you have some idea of the upheaval that the last 17 years have  brought Don McLean.  </P> <P> It has taken most of that time for McLean to put some distance between himself  and "American Pie," the monster hit that he wrote and sang and that became the  object of relentless scrutiny for its abstruse lyrics.  </P> <P> "I kind of shot myself in the foot back there in 1972 because I raised  expectations so high," McLean said of his best-known record during a recent  phone interview. "So much happened around that song that it was very hard for  Don McLean to crawl out from under it."  </P> <P> In a very real sense, McLean, who does about 85 performances a year, has been  battling to avoid the stigma of being a one-hit wonder.  </P> <P> "I felt that my albums were excellent and my songwriting was excellent, and  people were missing out on a lot that I had to offer," McLean said. "My  relentless concertizing has probably done a lot to change that."  </P> <P> McLean's new label, Gold Castle, will release each of his last six albums over  the next 3 years. He will continue touring this summer, then spend 6 weeks in  Britain before returning for a November date at Carnegie Hall.  </P></p>

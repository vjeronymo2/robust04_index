			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE DIVIDEND  </P> <P> The most frightening concept to come out of Washington recently is the  so-called "peace dividend," referred to by everyone with a shiny new idea in  need of a buck.  </P> <P> There exists no dividend with its resulting infusion of cash to liberate a  budget shackled by huge deficits.  </P> <P> Any savings realized as a result of decreased defense spending are merely  non-spent dollars that immediately reduce the deficit. The savings are not  actual hard dollars to be spent on alternative programs.  </P> <P> The crisis of the federal budget is the lack of effective leadership and  inability of elected representatives to make difficult decisions. The "problem"  is not a lack of revenues, now approximately a trillion dollars a year.  </P> <P> New programs should be introduced on the basis of value after careful  consideration, not on the ability of government accountants to perform various  sleight of hand.  </P> <P> DREW J. PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Thatcher backs down in S Africa row with Major: Prime minister speaks of optimism for country's economic future Mr John Major, UK prime minister, won a victory over Baroness Thatcher last night when the former prime minister backed down after a long-distance row over South Africa's economic prospects. The row, which threatened to overshadow a three-day official visit to South Africa by Mr Major, erupted after Lady Thatcher during a trip to India dismissed South Africa's hopes of attracting international investment. She told businessmen at an official British gathering in Bombay that investors were afraid of violence and social unrest in South Africa, in spite of the formation of a government of national unity after the country's first all-race elections in April. 'What you are getting is people who look at the rest of Africa. They say 'Look at Rwanda, look at Somalia'. Are we going to have the same thing happening in South Africa?' she said. Lady Thatcher, who also described Nigeria as 'a terrible mess', pointed to tensions between Zulu leaders as evidence of continuing friction in South Africa. 'There will be a certain amount of trouble there. This is why people are holding back,' she said. However, after a vigorous rejection of her views by Mr Major and British business leaders, Lady Thatcher issued a statement saying that she 'fully supports the new democratic government of South Africa and feels that the country will attract the inward investment it so much needs'. In a clear attempt to repair the diplomatic damage in South Africa, the statement said that Lady Thatcher 'further hopes that the prime minister's present mission to that country will be highly successful'. Her views contrasted with the tone of Mr Major's visit, during which he has expressed confidence in the South African government's ability to achieve economic prosperity. British officials are also aware that Lady Thatcher is a controversial figure among black leaders, many of whom were angered by her reluctance to endorse sanctions against the former all-white government. Without responding directly, Mr Major went as far as he could to rebuke Lady Thatcher without naming her, suggesting that she was out of touch with events in South Africa. 'I do not think there is a shred of doubt about the confident future South Africa can look forward to,' he said. 'You don't have to sit back in your armchair abroad and wonder what is happening. People should come here. It would be good for South Africa and good for them too.' Mr Major told businessmen that optimism about South Africa's future was well founded.

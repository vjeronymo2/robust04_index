			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Wheels and deals along the old Silk Road - Marcus Dalrymple and friends meet the helpful Chinaman, the greedy Chinaman and the bureaucrat WE EMERGED from our dingy cabin on to the deck to find that our boat had reached its destination. To the east, the sun was rising over the grey city. On the quayside, brawny dockers in grubby white vests were heaving crates on to a trolley. Paint was peeling off the walls of the custom house in great flakes. The air was clammy. Hanging limp from a rusty pole was a red flag emblazoned with the five gold stars of the People's Republic of China. It was 7am. The four of us had three hours to get ourselves and our bicycles packed in boxes across Guanzhou to the airport for the next stage of our journey - a flight to Lanzhou. Three hours later saw us safely seated aboard China Airways. How we managed to get there in time is another story, but suffice it to say that in doing so we encountered three types of Chinaman we were to meet again and again during our sojourn in Cathay: the helpful Chinaman, the greedy Chinaman and the bureaucrat. Lanzhou, the start of our cycle ride, was a large, sprawling and polluted city straddling the Yellow River. We checked into the Lanzhou Hotel - a huge grey building that looked like the ministry of defence - and there, over two days, transformed our four-bedroom area into a bicycle workshop. By the evening of the second day, and much to the amusement of the cleaning ladies, we had assembled our bikes and packed our panniers. After a final visit to the night market for a feast of mutton kebabs, noodle soup and dumplings, we were ready to go. The first stage of our 1,500-mile, three-month ride took us 700 miles north-west through the Hexi corridor. For centuries, this natural passageway served as the only communication link between Han China to the east and the land of the barbarians to the west. Bound to the south by the Qilian mountains and to the north by the Mazong range, great caravans of merchants travelled at a snail's pace along what later became known as the Silk Road. With their precious merchandise of silk, spices, gold and armaments, they crossed thousands of miles of searing desert and snowy mountains exposed not only to the elements but to marauding bandits. We were fortunate enough not to encounter any brigands, though both the mountains and the desert presented us with their own challenges as we followed the age-old trade route. From Lanzhou we made good progress, cycling 60 miles a day through the lush Yellow River delta with its watery paddy fields, picturesque villages and apple orchards. On the third day our road began to rise away from the river towards a range of snow-capped mountains. By 2pm we had begun to climb Maoma Shan, a high pass overlooking arid plains to the west. For four hours we struggled up the switchbacks, groaning with the weight of our panniers. Sheep and cattle grazed on the sparse upland pastures and dotted about the hillside were the flapping sheepskin tents of herders. We reached Tianshui that night numb with cold. The town clung to the steep mountainside like moss to a rock below dark and ominous peaks. We found lodgings in an old caravanserai just as dusk was falling. Our host, a jolly, ruddy-cheeked Han Chinese with a mischievous smile, told us that the town was officially closed to foreigners, but he assured us that we were welcome anyway. Reaching Wuwei marked the completion of one stage of our journey. Having dropped down to sea level from Maoma Shan in an exhilarating and rapid descent, we found ourselves cycling in quite different country. Ahead of us, for miles, stretched the long straight road. The desert wind blew relentlessly with only a few brown hills to block it. Soon our progress was reduced to 6mph, and by the time we reached Wuwei we were tired, thirsty and covered in dust. None of us will have fond memories of Wuwei. Famous for its flying bronze horse discovered in 1969, it will only ever be remembered by us as the place where we were spat upon by two old men, where we had a pair of gloves stolen, and where we bought some buns that tasted and smelt of unadulterated ammonia. The small, black dot on our map, 1 inch west of Wuwei, was Yuanshanzi, a collection of flat-roofed huts surrounded by poplars in the middle of the desert. We had not intended to stay. We had stopped for a cup of sweet green tea, with the aim of pressing on to Jiuquan, some 40 miles further on. But it was a cold overcast day and the tempting offer of a bowl of meat and noodle soup was too good to refuse. We stayed for lunch . . . and tea . . . and eventually for supper and the night, too, since we had been told we could sleep in the outhouse if we wanted to. Before turning in we took a stroll to the end of the village. Yuanshanzi enjoys a spectacular location. To the south, just 20 miles away, the huge, black Qilian mountains, their peaks shrouded in cloud, rise out of the desert. To the north are the boundless wastes of Mongolia. As the sun began to set, we stood silently in the sagebrush and watched a steam train chugging across the vast horizon. Jiayuguan was the symbolic end to the first stage of our expedition, for it lies on the very edge of China. For hundreds of years, Jiayuguan's fort, the last along the Great Wall, defended China to the east against Tartary and its desert hordes to the west. But like the hoped-for end to so many things, when we reached Jiayuguan and cycled the short distance out of town to the castle, we were disappointed. The overcast sky obscured the view north to the Mazong mountains, a squadron of soldiers in tatty green fatigues was garrisoned in the tourist car park, and foreigners were being charged an extortionate fee just to walk inside the fortress gates for a view of the ramparts. No doubt, on a clear day, the view of the mountains to the north and south and of the undulating desert to the west is impressive, but what no guidebook tells you is that if you turn back east, just a mile away, huge chemical fertiliser, cement and coke factories stand belching out yellow smoke into the smoggy sky and the air is filled with the smell of bad eggs. After refusing to pay the entrance fee, we returned to our hotel disappointed. As we were locking up our bikes, we were approached by a young man with a badge on his jacket that read 'China Travel Service.' In English that was impeccable in all but pronunciation, he said: 'I think you have just returned from visiting the great fart in the desert.'</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hornby hit by consumer spending fall HORNBY, the toy and sports boat manufacturer, yesterday reported a 45 per cent fall in pre-tax profits before exceptionals, from Pounds 3.82m to Pounds 2.09m, for the year to December 31 1991. Last year's figures were restated following the reclassification of an extraordinary item - Pounds 616,000 profit on disposal of land and buildings  -as an exceptional item in accordance with the recent Accounting Standards Board guidelines. Although the fall in consumer spending affected both sides of the business, Fletcher sports boats was worse hit, turning a Pounds 350,000 profit into a Pounds 450,000 loss. The company has appointed 100 more dealers in France and Spain to boost its share of the European market. Profits from toy sales, which account for the bulk of the company's turnover of Pounds 32m (Pounds 39.5m), were only marginally down on the previous year. The company is focusing on a new product range. Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said: 'This is a year for caution, not a year for risks. We are going to concentrate on developing our existing businesses instead of looking at further acquisitions.' Net cash fell from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 3.3m because a greater proportion of sales occurred in November and December. Earnings per share fell from 30.1p to 15.4p but the single final dividend is unchanged at 9p.</p>

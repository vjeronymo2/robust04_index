			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Pete Townshend barely escaped serious injury Wednesday during a Who concert at  the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Wash., when the tremolo bar of his electric guitar  pierced the webbing between the fifth and fourth fingers on his right hand.  Townshend was executing his trademark windmill strum during "Won't Get Fooled  Again" -- the final song before the encores -- when his hand was snagged by the  metal bar. The band went ahead with encores of "Twist and Shout" and "Hey Joe"  without its leader, who was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital. It was  determined that he had suffered no nerve, bone or tendon damage, and no  stitches were needed. According to a Who spokesman, Townshend will be able to  perform as planned in shows tonight and Saturday in Vancouver, British  Columbia. The Who's 25th anniversary reunion tour will reach the Southland next  week. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

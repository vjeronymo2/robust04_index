			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Dependence on US leaves Kuwait few choices: Little remains of the Gulf state's policies from before the war against Saddam President Bill Clinton's arrival in Kuwait today is designed to demonstrate the depth of US commitment to the Gulf state in the wake of the renewed military threats from President Saddam Hussein. But it also underlines the extent to which the latest crisis with Iraq has deprived Kuwait of what little freedom of choice it had left in international affairs. In four years, Kuwait has passed from being a self-consciously assertive leader of all that was considered progressive in the Arab world, to a state whose survival depends on continuing US support. The result has been a paralysis in policymaking on virtually all Middle East issues. Officials appear to have no more original thoughts than would be expected were Kuwait's foreign ministry the Gulf branch office of the US State Department. Far from regarding these developments as negative, Kuwaitis are basking in a new-found sense of security that officials are convinced is set to grow. The danger is that Kuwait's back-seat diplomacy will turn out to be as illusory as the image that it used to promote on the world stage. Before August 1990, Kuwait was foremost in championing political and human rights for Palestinians; it was a leader of the non-aligned movement, spending generous foreign aid to win friends; it was a decade ahead of its partners in the Gulf Co-operation Council in opening diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Today, little of these policies remain. The non-aligned movement is extinct, as is the Soviet Union. Foreign aid money that might have bought goodwill has left Kuwait with billions of dollars of non-performing loan assets, still listed in the State General Reserve Fund 'for book-keeping purposes only,' one government financial adviser says. As for the Palestinians, feelings against them run deep for what is still regarded as their 'betrayal' in 1990 for supporting President Saddam. Jordan's King Hussein is close behind. 'If Saddam Hussein rates a five out of five on the barometer of mistrust, King Hussein gets a four,' a senior foreign ministry official said. Others close to Kuwait's Emir, say this antagonism could change quickly under US pressure following Jordan's peace treaty with Israel. In mock seriousness, senior officials suggest Kuwait still has five levels of foreign policy options. It can call on: Its own resources. Security arrangements with its five GCC partners (Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Qatar). The wider partnership of the GCC, plus Egypt and Syria, through the so-called Damascus Declaration. The United Nations and the coalition of countries that came to its aid after the Iraqi invasion of August 1990. Bilateral defence agreements with the US and three other permanent members of the UN Security Council: Britain, France and Russia. In practice, only the last two count for anything, and these are wholly contingent on a sustained US response to crises such as the one Kuwait has just faced. 'The deepest feeling among all Kuwaitis is their concern for survival,' says Mr Abdalla Al-Nibari, a National Assembly member. 'For this, we look to the US. It is unfortunate, but it is a fact.' A European diplomat describes the way Kuwait has come to depend on the US as 'first by necessity, now by conviction'. But there is a price to pay. 'Kuwait better come up with more dollars and more soldiers,' US Senator John Warner shouted into the microphone at the end of a recent press conference in Kuwait, a reminder of US congressional priorities and an outburst which embarrassed foreigners and left many Kuwaitis humiliated. European diplomats argue that Kuwait has become dangerously sucked into the US's 'personalisation' of policy, which implicitly rules out having to deal with an Iraq controlled by Mr Saddam. 'We are small and cannot even protect ourselves against Iraq's power, so we cannot have any views about the internal structure of Iraq,' said Mr Sulaiman Majed al-Shaheen, foreign ministry under-secretary. Periodic talks with Iraqi opposition groups such as the London-based Iraq National Council (INC) and the Washington-based Free Iraqi Council (FIC) have got nowhere. A senior official conceded that some members of the INC are 'articulating a policy based on a constitutional monarchy in Iraq'. But Kuwait, he said, 'doesn't care if Iraq's constitutional monarch is an Indian guru or a Hashemite, so long as their intentions towards Kuwait are peaceful'. Under US protection, Kuwait can afford the same detachment concerning Iran. 'Iran does not have any claim on Kuwaiti territory. Iran only wants to be number one among equals. Kuwait says we are all equal regardless of size,' one official said. 'We want the Gulf to be what it is: number one in the strategy of the big powers.' So Kuwait is content to leave its future in US hands. This back-seat policy is based on the assumption that the US is able and willing to provide open-ended guarantees for the security of Kuwait and the other members of the GCC. But in politics, as Senator Warner made clear, nothing is certain.</p>

Today the ustashas directed most of their attacks on Blagaj,  targeting it with more than 100 destructive shells and causing  fresh casualties and considerable material damage. This town,  which is also inhabited by several thousand refugees, was  targeted by the ustasha artillery for two hours. Fourteen  people were wounded in these bestial attacks by crazed  supporters of the vampire from Grude [reference to Herceg-Bosna  president Mate Boban]. Despite the increasing aggressor attacks  on the free part of the Mostar municipality, the demarcation  lines have remain unchanged and firmly controlled by the 4th  Corps units.</p>

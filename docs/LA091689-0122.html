Islas was being held in Orange County Jail in connection with the theft of a  car from the Garden Grove area and on suspicion of a parole violation in a  narcotics-related conviction, Thomas said.  </P> <P> Thomas said Santa Ana police surrounded the Bush Street house about 8 a.m.  Friday after receiving a tip that Islas was in their area. They called to the  man inside to come out and surrender, but the man did not comply. After about  four hours, police entered the house and found Islas hiding a rear bedroom. "He  was then arrested without incident," Thomas said.  </P></p>

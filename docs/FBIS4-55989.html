			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and </F> foreign minister, by Gordan Nuhanovic; place and date not given:  "The United States Will Support the Federation Position"]    [Text] In the few hours between arriving from Vienna and  leaving for Geneva, Foreign Minister Mate Granic agreed to a  short interview.    [Nuhanovic] Mr. Granic, after the Croat-Bosniak agreement  has been signed, there is an impression that the United States  has provided no specific guarantees for the agreed 58 percent of  the territory for the federation, other than the "paper" ones.    [Granic] This percentage is a matter of principle. We  should be aware of the fact that these are the areas in which  the Croats and Bosniaks form a majority. Great success has been  achieved with the Vienna agreement: The negotiating position of  the Bosniak-Croat federation has been consolidated. There are,  of course, no specific guarantees, but the aim has been achieved  in Vienna -- the Federation has been consolidated. The stronger  the Federation is, the stronger the U.S. support will be.    [Nuhanovic] However, the positions of the international  forces are divided. Namely, the same day the Vienna agreement  was signed, Alain Juppe stated he hoped the ministers in Geneva  would support the proposal of 51 percent for the Federation and  49 percent for the Serbs. What is your comment on that?    [Granic] This is a well-known position represented by  France, Russia, and Great Britain. The United States is close  to that position, but it will not accept the position if the  Federation does not accept it.    [Nuhanovic] What would the lifting of the arms embargo in  Bosnia-Herzegovina mean for Croatia?    [Granic] The present situation should be distinguished from  that of about six months ago, during the conflicts between the  Muslims and Croats. In that situation it would have been  negative both for the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for  Croatia. The Croat position that the Bosniaks are victims of  Serb aggression just as the Croats are is well known. The  international community believes that an agreement can be  reached by putting pressure on the Serb side. However, if that  does not happen, then the defense of the Croats and Bosniaks in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only way out. Croatia supported this  elementary right in the Security Council. Ultimately, though, we  consider participating in the Partnership for Peace as much more  important, and the same goes for the disarming in the area. We  will specifically support that. We would like the international  community to become more involved, but we will not give up our  legitimate rights in Croatia, just as it is a legitimate right  of the Croat and Bosniak people in Bosnia-Herzegovina to defend  themselves. However, after everything that has happened, it  would be better if peace were imposed in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  When I say this, I am thinking of the Serbian side.    [Nuhanovic] Could you comment on Ganic and Durakovic's  appearance at the Vienna negotiations? Their political  positions were significantly different from what was agreed at  the end.    [Granic] It is never good to talk about what happened during  negotiations. Both sides were a little afraid, but the  influence of the U.S. mediator was beneficial, as was that of  the Croatian side. However, the solutions are better than was  anticipated, as they are solutions that lead toward the end of  the war. Naturally, another important thing is that the  international position of Croatia has become even stronger.</p>

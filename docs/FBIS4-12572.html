			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM has learned from exclusive sources  that a ranking Iraqi officer who was very close to Saddam Husayn  has defected to the United States through Turkey after doubts  were cast on his role in the attempt to topple the regime that  was discovered two months ago, following which a number of  ranking military commanders were executed.    These sources said the officer had played a central role in  preparing for the invasion of Kuwait, and was directly  responsible for all cash payments and gifts that were given to  top officials and a large number of journalists in some Arab  countries in order to extend material and moral support for the  Iraqi adventure against Kuwait.    AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM also learned that the Iraqi officer will  hold a news conference soon to reveal in figures and names the  huge sums of money the Iraqi regime had given to some political  and military officials and journalists shortly before the  treacherous invasion.</p>

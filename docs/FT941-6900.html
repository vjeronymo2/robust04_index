			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Pressure builds in EU entry talks: Pace gets frenetic as clock ticks away We Greeks use a Turkish term for this sort of situation - a bazaar,' Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek chairman of the European Union's council of ministers, said yesterday, summing up the frenetic negotiating to agree EU entry terms for Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden by the deadline of midnight tonight. The Brussels talks - which have to conclude before March for the four candidates to enter the EU next January - were multi-layered. The 12 member states were still trying to agree a common line among themselves; the EU negotiated separately with each applicant; and 11 working groups of experts tried to mesh the interests of the 12 and and the four on outstanding issues from tax regimes to fish quotas. By yesterday evening, it looked as though Sweden and Finland would meet the deadline - a possibility which Mr Pangalos, the 12 and the European Commission were using to put pressure on the more difficult candidates: Austria and, particularly, Norway. The real crunch issues remained: money; lorry transit through the Austrian Alps; Norwegian fish; and the largely intra-EU question of how many votes are needed in a Europe of 16 to block measures in the council of ministers. One money issue, EU regional aid, was resolved to all four candidates' satisfaction yesterday. Austria's backward eastern province of Burgenland will get the generous Brussels aid reserved for the poorest EU regions. The thinly populated Nordic north will get a slightly less well-endowed special Arctic regime. All told, the four will receive regional and employment aid of about Ecu1bn (Pounds 750m). But there was still confusion on both sides about how to accommodate Nordic and Alpine agriculture, subsidised (except in Sweden) at 25-100 per cent higher than already lavish EU levels. The 12 say they want Norway, Finland and Austria to cut their prices straight after entry to EU levels, with the applicants compensating farmers out of their own pockets. In previous enlargements farm prices were equalised over long transition periods, the differences being ironed out by levies collected at the frontier - a method now rejected as a threat to the border-free single market. Moreover, the old system (accession compensatory amounts) would in theory cost the Union Ecu500m more, because the applicants export basic products like wheat, with a full price refund, and import a lot of processed foods like biscuits, with small amounts of levy-attracting wheat. But the UK, and to some extent France, feel that applicant insistence, particularly from Austria, that the EU pay part of the farm compensation bill will make the so-called 'big bang' or single market solution more expensive. Already, the Commission is suggesting chipping in Ecu1.6bn as a transitional cushion for 1995, and total compensation in 1995-98 of Ecu2.8bn, in addition to normal price support. Many of the negotiators appear baffled by the detail, amid charge and counter-charge of theological rigidity on budgets and borders. But those, like Britain, who were looking closest at their pockets were holding fire yesterday in the expectation that the applicants themselves would shoot down the proposal as insufficient. Wherever this argument settles will determine how much the four will contribute to the EU budget. At the moment, Brussels reckons on smallish net contributions for the newcomers of around Ecu1.7bn in all. Swedish and Austrian demands that even this should be phased in were being firmly resisted yesterday. Austria's wish to retain an existing treaty restricting EU trucks transiting the Alps - ultra-sensitive after the recent Swiss vote to ban lorries using its own Alps - was getting more sympathy from the EU, which fears that a green backlash could lose Austria its referendum on entry. Vienna wants to retain the restrictions until 2004, which may be illegal under the EU treaty. But a senior Austrian official said the two sides were 'trying to find camouflage' for a formula very near what Austria needs. Norway and its fish (the issue on which Norwegians voted against Europe in 1972) is another matter. There is not even a hint of a mid-point between mainly Spanish demands for access to Norwegian fish and Oslo's refusal to surrender a single cod. The EU, at French insistence, also wants safeguards against Norwegian fish flooding into the single market. Germany, next after Greece in the rotating EU presidency, yesterday took over 'intensive talks' at expert level in search of a solution no one can yet discern even in vaguest outline. Within the EU, Britain wants to retain the weighted majority voting formula through which 23 votes (normally meaning two big states and one small country) out of 76 can block a law or measure, even though if all four applicants enter, total votes will rise to 90. Spain agrees, in cases where at least three member states oppose or abstain, but otherwise will accept the majority view that the existing balance between small and big member states means the threshold for a 'blocking minority' should move to 27 out of 90. The Benelux countries suspect the big states of a surreptitious power grab; federalists fear setting higher thresholds for majority voting will hold back integration; and the European parliament, which has to ratify the accession treaty by May 4 to get the four in by next January, not only flatly opposes the Anglo-Spanish ambitions but wants more radical decision-making reform ahead of the scheduled 1996 constitutional review. Mr Pangalos warned Spain and the UK yesterday that they could sink the negotiations if they held fast to their existing blocking rights. 'They will take responsibility for the political failure of enlargement,' he said.</p>

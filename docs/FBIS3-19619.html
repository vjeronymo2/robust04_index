A delay in joining the EU would mean that  Sweden would lose a year's rebate, or between 1 and 3 billion  kronor [SKr].    Wibble's argument in Brussels was that the contribution to  the EU would hit hardest in the first years of membership, when  the expected positive social effects of membership would not yet  have occurred. In the negotiations with the EU, Sweden won a  rebate of SKr4.4 billion in 1994, SKr3.9 billion in 1996, and  SKr0.5 billion in the two subsequent years.    If Swedish accession to the EU does not happen until 1996,  the Swedes will have to accept that the EU side would consider  the SKr4.4 billion rebate to have been lost, a centrally placed  source in the membership negotiations said:    "That will be the EU's point of departure. Sweden would  probably then be able to make a case for a renegotiation of the  rebate, but it will never get back all the SKr4.4 billion --  half of them at most."    The reason why the Swedish rebate can only last until 1998  at  the latest is that the following year the EU budget will be  renegotiated. If at that point a country has a rebate on its  budget contribution, the view is that it will have an incentive  to block an agreement because the rebate will remain in place  until a new budget is decided.</p>

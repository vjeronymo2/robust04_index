			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Unrest on the Belgian front SPECULATIVE flurries surrounding the Belgian franc rarely give rise to more than a flutter on foreign exchange seismographs. Underlining Belgium's apparent credentials as a member of the 'hard core' of the European Monetary System, since 1990 the Belgian National Bank has kept the franc within a narrow 0.25 percentage point fluctuation margin against the D-Mark. Now, however, the illusion that the Belgian franc is simply a north-western appendage of the German currency has been shattered. Pressure on the franc forced the Belgian central bank to raise interest rates yesterday for the second time in six weeks. The outbreak of Belgian monetary hostilities does not represent an isolated incident. Belgium's travails illustrate problems at the heart of the Maastricht programme for European convergence. The proximate cause of the difficulties is a budgetary squabble. Belgium's public-sector debt exceeds 130 per cent of gross domestic product. This is more than double the Maastricht target of 60 per cent - one of the conditions set to determine EC members' suitability for economic and monetary union (Emu). Interest payments were nearly twice last year's public-sector deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP, itself well in excess of the 3 per cent Maastricht target. Pleading the need to stick to the Emu path, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, has proposed 1993 tax rises and spending cuts equivalent to 1.6 per cent of GDP. After his coalition failed to agree, Mr Dehaene offered his government's resignation, though this may be essentially a ploy to concentrate coalition party minds. Another reason for nervousness lies in uncertainty caused by parliamentary agreement last month to transform Belgium into a federal state. Fears that Belgium could disintegrate into two entities - Flemish-speaking Flanders and francophone Wallonia - may be overdone. Yet the accord has prompted some anxiety about the risks of an eventual north-south split over debt repayments. At the very least, regional factionalism could hamper the drive for budgetary solutions. Belgium is trapped between two unattractive policy options. Monetary tightening - in particular higher long-term interest rates - will in the short run set back efforts to approach the Maastricht targets. The economy seems likely to contract in 1993, putting upward pressure on public deficits. In view of close trade ties with Germany, a dash for growth through devaluation would spur inflation. Belgium has little choice but to keep taking the medicine. Yet if the general chances of attaining Emu come to appear increasingly remote, the painful policies Belgium is following will command ever diminishing public support.</p>

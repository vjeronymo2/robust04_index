			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USF WINS AGAIN, THIS TIME BEATING LOYOLA  </P> <P> The University of San Francisco has been the mystery team of the West Coast  Athletic Conference this season, but Saturday night everyone knew whodunit.  </P> <P> USF left no doubt as a couple of big Macs, mercurial senior Mark McCathrion and  lightly regarded sophomore Mark McWhorter, lead the Dons to a 123-109 upset  victory over Loyola Marymount before 5,220 fans at USF.  </P> <P> The victory gave USF a sweep of Loyola and Pepperdine this weekend. The Dons  defeated conference champion St. Mary's earlier this month, making them the  only WCAC team to beat the top three finishers.  </P> <P> With the loss, Loyola (17-10 overall) finished tied with Pepperdine for second  at 10-4, while USF (16-11) clinched fourth place at 7-6.  </P> <P> Conference tie-breakers make Loyola the third-place team going into next  weekend's WCAC tournament at USF. Loyola will open against sixth-place Gonzaga,  while USF will face Bay Area rival Santa Clara.  </P> <P> The question now is which USF team will show -- the one that defeated the top  three WCAC teams as well as Notre Dame, or the one that lost to last-place San  Diego and was beaten by 38 points at home by Santa Clara?  </P> <P> "When people were saying we were inconsistent, I said our goal was to peak at  the end of the season," Dons Coach Jim Brovelli said.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-8 McCathrion, who sometimes led the break, finished with 35 points,  17 rebounds and 9 assists -- all career highs.  </P> <P> McWhorter, a 7-point-per-game scorer, was often on the end of McCathrion's  passes, getting 34 points, 25 in the second half, on 13-of-15 shooting.  </P> <P> For Loyola, Hank Gathers had 34 points and 12 rebounds and Enoch Simmons added  26 points.  </P> <P> The game turned in a four-minute stretch midway through the second half, when  the Dons cut Loyola's lead to 76-71, then went on a 19-8 run to build a lead  the never relinquished. Loyola pulled to within 94-92 with 7:11 left but went  down in a flurry of USF two-on-ones and breakaways.  </P> <P> "We were pressing and trapping pretty well but we didn't get the turnovers,"  Lion Coach Paul Westhead said. "Instead of getting steals they were converted  into baskets."  </P> <P> USF shot 72.5% in the second half by beating Loyola's press.  </P> <P> McCathrion, who scored six points when USF lost at Loyola in January, said, "In  the open court it's fun -- get it and go. I wish every team in the league  played like that."  </P> <P> Loyola seemed on the verge of pulling away several times in the first half,  building several double figure leads as Gathers scored 19 and Simmons added 16.  </P> <P> But USF hung tough, pulling to within a point at 28-27 and never allowing the  Lions to put together an explosive run.  </P> <P> McCathrion and Joel DeBortoli scored 17 apiece, with DeBortoli spinning in a  layup at the buzzer for the halftime score of 59-51. DeBortoli finished with 28  points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Will USF, playing on its own floor, be the sleeper of the WCAC tournament? "I  don't think anyone ever doubted they were a good team," Westhead said. "I'm  sure it doesn't hurt them winning two in a row like this."  </P></p>

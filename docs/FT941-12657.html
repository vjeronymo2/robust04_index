			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Where low overheads spell value for money - Investing offshore, building societies / UK tax reform means that the advantages to savers are fewer, but bargains are still available to those who plan carefully Building societies are redolent with security. Trust in these worthy institutions is embedded deep in the British psyche. 'Offshore', on the other hand, is regarded with the deepest suspicion. Mainly as a result of affairs such as Barlow Clowes, off-shore tax havens seem to be havens for crooks and frauds. Consequently investors are often a little perplexed to know why building societies have dipped into such apparently murky waters. But hard work by the financial authorities on the UK's three main 'offshore' centres - Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man - has cut down on the level of financial crime. Meanwhile, UK legislation means that offshore building societies are as 'secure' in the event of the society failing as their parent companies on the mainland. In the event of collapse, the 1986 Building Societies Act requires the parents societies to guarantee 100 per cent of the liabilities of its offshore subsidiary, with no ceiling on the amount payable to individual savers. No building societies have collapsed this century, so the issue should be academic, but this is actually stronger compensation than is available on the mainland - where the statutory compensation scheme would pay out 90 per cent of the deposit, up to a maximum of Pounds 18,000 per person. The Isle of Man also has its own investor-protection scheme. So there is no great reason why investors should avoid offshore building society accounts. A more relevant question is: 'Why bother?' Recent reforms of the UK taxation system have made this rather tougher to answer. The big 'plus' of offshore financial centres is that funds are free of tax, allowing interest to be paid gross. When 'composite rate tax' was levied on all UK bank and building society accounts, irrespective of what level of income tax the account-holder paid, this gave offshore accounts a great attraction. Non-taxpayers could avoid losing more than a fifth of their income, just by placing their funds off-shore. The introduction of independent taxation for husbands and wives gave the offshore societies a further boost, as couples took advantage of the new tax-planning opportunities. Now, interest is payable gross on onshore accounts for non-taxpayers. Further, interest earned offshore is still taxable for those liable to tax on onshore accounts. The offshore accounts have therefore lost their old financial advantage. However, the societies point out that opportunities for financial planning still exist, because tax on interest earned does not have to be paid immediately. Careful planning should allow investors to earn extra interest before they finally pay tax - an option not available onshore. The offshore societies also compete on two other factors - service, and value-for-money. All of these societies are small one-branch operations, with low overheads as a result. Most of their business is postal, as the vast majority of their customers are not resident on the islands. All the three main offshore centres have developed a small financial industry, ensuring that all can recruit experienced staff. Thus, they hope to be both swift and efficient. The low overheads should also allow them to compete on price with their mainland rivals, who must offer a wider range of products, and maintain a costly branch network. Comparisons of some leading societies' onshore and offshore rates, using figures drawn from the January edition of Moneyfacts, suggest that there is strength in this argument. For example, the Alliance &amp; Leicester offers 4.60 per cent on an instant access account with a balance of at least Pounds 50,000 on the mainland. Offshore, the 'Manximum' instant access account offers 6.0 per cent for the same balance. On balances of Pounds 100,000, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Channel Islands' Guernsey Gold account will offer 6.2 per cent, compared with 4.0 per cent on the society's equivalent Cheltenham Gold instant access account and 5.7 per cent on the postal London Share account. Derbyshire's Isle of Man account offers 7.00 per cent on instant access for balances of Pounds 50,000, compared with the maximum of 5.00 per cent available from the society on the mainland. However, offshore bargains like this need to be searched for carefully. Many other societies, such as the Halifax, make little or no difference between the rates available offshore and on the mainland. The very top rates at any one time, for those prepared to shop around using the Weekend FT's Highest Rates for Your Money table, compiled by Moneyfacts, are usually roughly comparable, with neither onshore nor offshore accounts having an overall advantage. Expatriates stand to gain the most from offshore accounts. The societies are geared to their needs in any case, but, most important, onshore building societies are now getting nervous about paying interest gross to expatriates, for fear of falling foul of the Inland Revenue if their customers return to the UK. This makes offshore accounts much more administratively simple for the expatriate Briton.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SAVERS' SELECTION: OFFSHORE (GROSS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Telephone                       Notice                                   number          Account     or term  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Woolwich Guernsey            0481 715735    International     Instant Derbyshire (IOM)             0624 663432   Instant Access     Instant Confederation                                    Flexible  Bank (Jersey)               0534 608060       Investment     60 days Derbyshire (IOM)             0624 663432           90 Day     90 days Bristol &amp; West                              International  International               0800 833222          Premier    6 months Yorkshire Guernsey           0481 710150        Key Extra    180 days Bristol &amp; West                              International  International               0800 833222          Premier    6 months  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Minimum             Rate     Interest                           deposit Pounds                %         paid  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Woolwich Guernsey                    500             5.75       yearly Derbyshire (IOM)                  50,000             7.00       yearly Confederation                     10,000             6.30   1/2-yearly  Bank (Jersey)                    25,000             6.80   1/2-yearly Derbyshire (IOM)                  50,000             7.00   1/2-yearly Bristol &amp; West                    25,000             6.80       yearly  International                    50,000             7.30       yearly                                    5,000             6.05       yearly Yorkshire Guernsey                10,000             6.35       yearly Bristol &amp; West                   100,000             7.35       yearly  International  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All rates are subject to change without notice.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Tokyo tries to defend policy towards Iran Japan's foreign ministry yesterday defended its policy of ties with Iran following allegations last week that Tehran has been supporting terrorist groups including the Irish Republican Army and the Japanese Red Army. The ministry was attempting to deflect criticism of Japan's independent Iranian policy which is likely to be on the agenda at July's G7 summit. Officials indicated that the policy could be reviewed if the UK provided conclusive evidence of terrorist links. 'The allegations involving the IRA are completely new and have come as a complete surprise to us. If Iran is linked with the IRA, then we would have to be decisive,' said a ministry official. A change in Tokyo's policy towards Tehran would be a relief to the US and UK. Both have been anxious to use Tehran's short-term debt crisis to to force Iran to change its policies and Japan has been providing aid and finance for Iran's beleaguered economy, including rescheduling Dollars 2.3bn worth of short-term debt and supplying Y38.8bn in aid for a hydro-electric power project. Ministry officials yesterday said the aim of this strategy was to support the 'pragmatists' in Tehran. These moderate elements, led, according to the officials, by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, are on the defensive because of Iran's deteriorating economy. The danger was that President Rafsanjani could fall, to be replaced by someone worse. 'Iranian politics is complicated and it is far from clear what would happen if he (President Rafsanjani) was ousted. But it could lead to an extreme form of government, and that would not be in the international community's interest,' said one official. The ministry pointed out that German, Austrian and Danish companies had carried out similar rescheduling programmes. 'The rescheduling issue is over because of the Europeans,' said an official. In any case, he explained, the Japanese government, given its free-market policies, did not have the authority to prevent private companies rescheduling. US trade with Iran was expanding and was already greater than Japan's, he added. 'By having reasonable relations with Iran, we have some influence. The Iranians, for example, are being very careful with the North Koreans (about missile technology),' the officials concluded. 'President Rafsanjani is a source of realism in the government. We can see that in the restraint Iran has been showing in not exporting revolutionary Islamic ideology to neighbours such as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia.' The ministry said its policy was not motivated by oil. Iran supplies between 7 per cent and 8 per cent of Japan's oil requirements, compared with more than 30 per cent before the Iranian revolution. However, officials conceded that Japan had an interest in achieving stability in the Gulf, since more than 50 per cent of Japan's oil supplies come the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Ministry officials said they were aware of incidents suggesting links between the Iranian government and assassinations, noting that since the beginning of 1991, at least 12 opponents of the regime in Tehran have been killed. They include the former bodyguard of the Shah killed in Turkey two years ago, the assassination of Mr Mohammad Hassan Arbab in Pakistan last June; the machine-gunning of four members of the Kurdish Democratic Party in Berlin in 1992, and the dramatic killing of the former Iranian prime minister, Mr Shahpour Bakhtiar, in Paris in 1991. The Japanese foreign ministry said it had no evidence directly linking the assassinations with the Iranian government but cite investigations into the murder of Mr Bakhtiar which led French prosecutors to conclude that Vevak, Iran's secret service, was responsible for the murder. Ministry officials said they were aware of reports suggesting members of the Japanese Red Army had visited Tehran late last year together with elements of the IRA, Abu Nidal and other groups. They had also heard suggestions that the Japanese then travelled to the Beka'a Valley in Lebanon to be trained by members of the Iranian Republican Guards with the intention they should conduct joint assassination missions with other extremist groups in the US and Europe. If the UK was able to provide evidence about links between Iran and the IRA, this could affect Japan's policy, the officials said. The moment for decisive action has not yet arrived, however. 'Until we are provided with proof, it would be premature for Japan to take sanctions against Iran,' they said.</p>

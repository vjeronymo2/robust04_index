			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Cardoso confirmed as winner Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's former finance minister, was yesterday confirmed as the country's future president following elections two weeks ago. With the final votes counted yesterday, Mr Cardoso polled 34.4m votes or 54.3 per cent of the valid votes cast. His nearest rival, left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, polled 27 per cent. The right-winger, Mr Eneas Carneiro, seen as a protest candidate, came third with 7.4 per cent, beating established politicians Mr Orestes Quercia and Mr Leonel Brizola, who polled 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively. Most votes had been counted by early last week, but delays and fraud allegations in Rio de Janeiro slowed the final announcement of the results. Mr Cardoso, who is on holiday in Russia with his wife, is due to take office on January 1.</p>

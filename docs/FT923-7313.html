			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: Entrepreneurs get foot in door IN NEARLY every city of the former Soviet Union, cells of capitalism are forming. These are the germs of a new order: the more they spread, the less easy it will be to reverse. The coup was an important contributory factor. There are western oilmen in Sakhalin in the Far East, Murmansk in the Far North and Baku in the Caucasian south. There are private coal mines in the fields of the Donbass in Ukraine, the Kuzbass in Russia and Karaganda in Kazakhstan. There are joint venture advertising agencies in St Petersburg; Turkish traders in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi; and in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, though electricity and water supply is only intermittent, a host of commercial shops have sprung up to replace the state stores. In Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, big foreign consultancies are establishing offices. In Tallinn, Estonia, private restaurants cluster round the beautiful square of the old town, and the music festivals are sponsored by German breweries. Everywhere, people turn out with a table, or a piece of newspaper on the ground, and sell what they can: vegetables, a can of petrol, champagne. A new stratum is being created, composed of people who have little or more often no other source of income than what they are able to trade, sell, make or exchange. In a state where most such activity was illegal a few years ago, the activity is remarkable. The coup gave it a boost in Russia, and then in other republics. When the constraining hand of the centralised Soviet state was removed, Russia went for immediate and radical economic reform: trade was wholly legalised, company formation by foreigners and Russians was simplified, and privatisation plans were drawn up and introduced. Entrepreneurship is now officially sanctioned, even if it is not generally liked, or encouraged. Free enterprise has arrived chaotically, and through often crooked channels. Monopolisation of capital by the state and the party until the last part of the 1980s means those now wanting to open banks, exchanges or companies are forced towards criminality. Workers and managers have turned over to themselves most of the companies now in private hands; the state has been too weak to intervene. Much of the oil and metals being exported from Russia belongs to the state but enriches those who can control it. Many goods sold by the roadside have been diverted from state networks. Private business began, in 1987, with co-operatives and joint ventures between foreign and soviet companies. By 1990, private banks and commodity exchanges began to be established. Now, Russian businessmen are starting to see themselves as capable of matching foreign business. The movement towards the market, for all its vulnerability, has gone beyond the fringe. In another year, short of terror, it will be irreversible.</p>

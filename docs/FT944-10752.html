			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ashbourne to join market with Pounds 80.5m valuation Ashbourne Holdings yesterday announced its shares would be offered to potential investors at 150p, valuing the nursing homes operator at Pounds 80.5m. Ashbourne, which was the subject of a management buy-out last year from Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, is raising Pounds 48m after expenses through a placing and public offer to pay off debt. Some 15 per cent of the 33.3m shares being issued will be offered to the public and the rest placed with institutions. Existing shareholders will retain 38 per cent of the company. The company is coming to the market on a p/e of 12.9 times, based on historic earnings of 11.6p. Ashbourne said that if it had been listed for the year to October 2, the board would have recommended a dividend of 3p. This represents a notional yield of 2.5 per cent. Ashbourne caters for the upper end of the private pay market and is one of the largest nursing home groups in the UK with 19 homes and 1,599 registered beds. Mr Tom Hamilton, chief executive, plans to open four new homes and build two extensions to existing homes by the end of 1995. Ashbourne has the land and planning consent to build homes with a further 515 beds.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Observer: Been there, done that Brazilians could be forgiven an uneasy twinge of deja vu. While former president Fernando Collor lives as a recluse in the capital Braslia following his 1992 resignation amid corruption charges, his younger brother is now following in his footsteps. Pedro Collor, who failed to win election to the legislative assembly of the poor northern state of Alagoas in elections earlier this month, has been given the consolation prize of secretary of industry and commerce in the state government. This is precisely the same job which gave Fernando Collor his start in politics in 1976. There is little chance of the two brothers teaming up. It was Pedro who made the initial, ruinous allegations against his brother, apparently sparked by a family row; they have apparently not spoken for some time. Fernando, meanwhile, is still smarting from a court decision earlier this year to uphold an eight-year ban preventing him holding political office.</p>

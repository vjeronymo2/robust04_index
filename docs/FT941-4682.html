			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Clinch goes full blast into ICI in UK Australian Peter Clinch, 53, has been given the job of putting a bit more bang behind ICI Explosives, the world's biggest supplier of commercial explosives and blasting technology. He replaces Bob Clark, 57, as chief executive of ICI Explosives, on April 1. Clinch, an executive director of ICI Australia, takes charge of a company which can trace its origins back to Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite in 1867. Nobel Industries was one of the four companies which merged to form ICI in 1926. ICI Explosives, which recently moved its headquarters back to Britain from Canada, is one of ICI's five core businesses. In terms of turnover of Pounds 643m it is ICI's smallest business but last year its trading profits of Pounds 52m accounted for nearly a fifth of the total. Clinch, who has a civil engineering degree from Sydney University, joined ICI in 1965 as a works study engineer at the group's plastics factory in Botany Bay. Bob Clark, who has headed ICI Explosives since 1988, retires in June after 33 years with the group.</p>

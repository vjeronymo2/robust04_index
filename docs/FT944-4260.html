			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Operators find little waiting involved with London buses: The Pounds 16.3m sale which completes disposal of the network Ten in the space of just nine months. The bus passenger resigned to a long wait for the arrival of his local service would be impressed with the speed with which London Transport has sold off its bus companies. Yesterday's sale of South London Transport for Pounds 16.3m to Cowie completed the disposal of London's red bus network to a range of private operators and buy-out teams. London travellers will have to come to terms with a number of competing liveries in the coming months. Only in the centre of town will operators be obliged to keep their buses mainly red. The acquisition of South London makes Cowie - a company with car leasing and motor trading activities as well as bus and coach operations - the biggest bus company in the London area. It owns Leaside Bus, bought from London Transport for Pounds 29.9m in September, and Grey-Green, a coach and bus business. South London brings the total proceeds of the bus company sales to Pounds 233m, more than twice the figure initially pencilled in. London Transport will keep the first Pounds 100m and 25 per cent of the remainder to spend mainly on its cash-strapped Underground. Six of the London bus companies went to established bus operators but, in line with the government's wish to promote management-employee buy-outs, four of the companies have been acquired by management-employee teams. The speed of the sales and the prices at which deals were struck should provide some compensation for the embarrassing climbdown forced on the government over its plans to fully deregulate London's buses. This idea was scrapped just over a year ago because of its unpopularity with government backbenchers and local councillors. Deregulation would have allowed a number of operators to run buses on a route. This has led to fierce price wars in many provincial cities. The privately-owned companies which have taken control in London will run fully commercial services on most routes while a minority of unprofitable but socially desirable routes will continue to be run with the help of subsidies. The attractions of the London bus companies are that they allow existing operators to spread their overheads over a bigger operation while negotiating better terms when it comes to renewing their bus fleets. Operators also see the opportunity to cut the fat out of organisations previously in the public sector. The buy-out teams believe they can manage more effectively free from central control. Bus use across the UK has been in decline for many years but it is a cash business with many passengers paying in advance for season tickets. Revenues can be forecast with a fair degree of accuracy. And the future for buses may be brighter. Increased congestion is likely to lead to a spread of traffic control measures such as London's 'red routes', which cut bus journey times.

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: CGIP forecasts profits growth for full year CGIP, the French holding company that has been raising capital through disposals, is on course for a return to strong profits growth in 1994, according to Mr Ernest-Anotione Seilliere, chairman. Mr Seilliere told shareholders at yesterday's annual general meeting that he expected to see 'a significant boost to earnings' this year. CGIP, which earlier this year raised FFr994m (Dollars 175m) from a convertible bond issue, recently reported flat profits for 1993, at FFr547m against FFr542m in 1992. However, the board yesterday proposed an increase in the dividend, to FFr34 for 1993 compared with FFr32 for the previous year, as a reflection of its confidence in the future. Mr Seilliere said this year's increase in profits would be partly due to 'an improved contribution' from CGIP's interests, which include a 32 per cent stake in the CarnaudMetalBox packaging concern and 20 per cent of Cap Sogeti Gemini, the computer services group. CGIP should also benefit from the capital gains on disposals, including the recent sale of control of Cedest to Holderbank, the Swiss cement group, for FFr3.6bn. The group has been raising new capital to help pay for last year's deal whereby it lifted its stake in CarnaudMetalBox.</p>

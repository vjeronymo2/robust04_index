			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Mexico link for Trafalgar TRAFALGAR House Construction, part of the UK property, engineering, shipping and hotels group, is forming a new company with Sidek of Mexico to take advantage of the expanding Mexican construction market, writes Andrew Taylor. The joint venture based in Guadalajara will begin with a large order book in the resort development and leisure sector, Trafalgar House said. The new company, Grupo Sitra, would be able to call on Trafalgar's bigger technical and operational facilities to work on infrastructure and industrial projects. Mr Barry Myers, Trafalgar House director responsible for construction, said industrial investment in Mexico was expected to rise as North American Free Trade talks led to reduced trade barriers between the US and Mexico.</p>

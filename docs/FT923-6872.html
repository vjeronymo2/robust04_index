			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Observer: Outspoken Will Vadim Hetman, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, quit after his very public dressing down by Ukraine's President Kravchuk? Ukraine's central bank has only been running for just over a year and Hetman is already its second governor. A 57-year-old technocrat who ran Ukraine's largest commercial bank before being chosen to shake up the national bank, Hetman is no westernised whizz-kid. But his technical competence combined with his ability to work the old party network made him an effective choice. However, in his quest for the status enjoyed by his western peers, Hetman has already got a taste of the political dangers of central bankers who speak out of turn. Humiliated by the dizzying collapse of the coupon, Ukraine's pseudo currency, Hetman has laid into the government's massive deficit and called for restrictions on credit and spending. The betting is that Hetman will soldier on. But his credibility will not survive many more such outbursts.</p>

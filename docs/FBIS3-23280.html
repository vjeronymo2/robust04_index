Instructions have been issued to the Fatah Hawks.  However, these instructions have not been implemented yet  because of the Israeli maximum state of alert in anticipation of  a painful Palestinian response.    Complaining about the weak coordination among the joint  commands in the occupied territories, Zaki said Fatah has made  no decision to end the armed struggle against the occupation.  He complained that the Palestinian factions are vying among  themselves for positions in unions or professional federations  in the West Bank and Gaza strip, but fail to vie to confront the  Israeli occupation.    He said competition for positions has exposed many  militants.  He said Fatah means martyrdom, pride in martyrs, and the  inevitability of the masses' victory. [passage omitted]</p>

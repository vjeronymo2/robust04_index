			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo By the middle of this decade Lasmo could have entered a golden age. Development expenditure is peaking; if the disposal programme proceeds according to plan, gearing should soon start to drop from its present 80 per cent. Debt should be further reduced within a couple of years as the heavy oil and gas investments in Indonesia and the North Sea pay off. That could suggest the shares are undervalued after their fall of more than 60 per cent during the past year. The snag is that there are still some short-term hurdles to overcome before long-term promise is fulfilled. Lasmo has managed to maintain its interim dividend, but it was helped by its decision to capitalise the Pounds 22m interest costs of carrying Ultramar's downstream businesses which are now sold. The company would argue that the move was a logical reflection of the fact that the downstream assets were never relevant to its main business, but indirectly it still helped relieve pressure on distributable reserves. More open assistance came from the release to distributable reserves of Pounds 373m from its merger reserve. That more than offset the extraordinary loss of Pounds 291m on the downstream assets disposal. One interpretation of these balance sheet manoeuvres is that they show the company's determination to maintain its dividend. But they also underline the tightness of the distributable reserve position. The company should be placed to maintain its final payment. Barring a rebound in the sterling price of oil, next year's prospects are less certain. By then there will be less scope for capitalising interest on development activities. Lasmo may be trading close to the lower end of the range of net asset estimates, but the shares are not for the nervous.</p>

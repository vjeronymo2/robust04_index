			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN SHIRT LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> Re Arnold T. Schwab's Oct. 7 letter attacking Rep. William Dannemeyer: It is  incorrect to assert that the Nazis "were heterosexuals" who "ended toleration  of homosexuals." In fact, the leadership of the brutal Brown Shirts -- the  Sturmabteilung, or S.A. -- were homosexuals. They were instrumental in creating  the climate of terror and intimidation that enabled Hitler to come to power. He  in turn double-crossed them and they were eliminated in a purge.  </P> <P> For an account of these events, see William L. Shirer's "The Rise and Fall of  the Third Reich."  </P> <P> DANIEL PLATT, Los Angeles  </P></p>

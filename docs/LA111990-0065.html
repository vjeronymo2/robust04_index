			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACKERS WIN IN LAST MINUTE, 24-21;  </P> <P> NFC: A ONE-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS PLAY WITH 16 SECONDS LEFT LIFTS GREEN BAY OVER  PHOENIX.  </P> <P> Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski goes by the nickname "Majik."  </P> <P> And now, Packer backup quarterback Anthony Dilweg has adopted a similar  moniker.  </P> <P> "Just call me 'The Wizard,' " Dilweg said Sunday after he led the Packers to a  24-21 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals. "This team has a lot of character.  It's not just me. I just went out there and did my job."  </P> <P> The Packers (5-5) trailed, 21-10, with 13:14 remaining.  </P> <P> But Dilweg, who entered the game after Majkowski strained his right shoulder  nine minutes before halftime, pulled the Packers to within 21-17 on a 15-yard  touchdown pass play to Clarence Weathers with 6:20 left.  </P> <P> He then connected with Ed West on a one-yard touchdown pass play with 16  seconds left to give the Packers the win.  </P> <P> "The offense missed Don, but they rallied very, very well around Anthony,"  Packer Coach Lindy Infante said. "It was a great win. This gives us another  little step to get us into the playoffs."  </P> <P> Phoenix (2-8), which lost for the fifth consecutive time, gave the Packers the  opportunity for victory by turning the ball over on downs at the Packers'  43-yard line with 2:10 left.  </P> <P> Dilweg, who completed 11 of 21 passes for 134 yards, connected on passes of 19  and nine yards to Herman Fontenot and 16 yards to Weathers before a three-yard  run by Herman Fontenot got the ball to the Phoenix one.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Dilweg rolled right and found West in the back of the end  zone.  </P> <P> "We had a running play called, but there was 22 seconds left and we wouldn't  have had enough time left if we got stopped, so we changed it to a passing  play," Dilweg said. "We faked left, went right and I saw our tight end (West).  He did a nice job to get open."  </P> <P> The Cardinals tried to salvage a tie on Al Del Greco's 58-yard field-goal  attempt on the game's final play, but the ball barely reached the end zone.  </P> <P> Cardinal quarterback Timm Rosenbach, completed 17 of 30 passes for a  career-high 285 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Phoenix rookie Johnny Johnson, the NFC's leading rusher, gained 103 yards in 15  carries despite straining his right ankle early in the game.  </P></p>

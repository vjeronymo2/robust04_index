			<p>Cancellation   <F P=102>   PY0306132094 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish  2151 GMT 2 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY0306132094 </F> <F P=104>  Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo today said the Condor-2 missile project was drafted by  "a gang of European mafia members who used our territory to  develop technology that in fact was theirs."    Without mentioning names or nationalities of these alleged  mafia members, the minister said President Carlos Menem decided  to dismantle the project because he was certain the initiative  "did not help Argentine interests."    Cavallo said this during a public hearing before Congress  about the pharmaceuticals patents law. He compared the decision  to dismantle the Condor-2 project to the efforts to ratify a law  that recognizes the intellectual property of foreign  laboratories. Cavallo said that both seek "to foster  international trust in Argentina."    While delivering his lengthy speech about the official  patents draft bill, the minister harshly clashed with Radical  Civic Union Senator Conrado Storani who said the Condor-2  Project was an example of the capacity of the Argentine  scientists and technicians.    The economy minister bluntly rejected this opinion, saying  the initiative was "really bad for our country."    He revealed that at the end of the Persian Gulf War, the  U.S.  forces found in Iraq a project similar to the Falda del Carmen  facilities in Cordoba Province, where Condor was developed.    "The Condor project was not dismantled earlier because some  Argentines asserted it would be giving in to U.S. pressure,"  Cavallo said.    Cavallo mentioned Brigadier Ernesto Crespo, retired, the  former Air Force commander, as one who supported the theory of  "not giving in to U.S. pressure."</p>

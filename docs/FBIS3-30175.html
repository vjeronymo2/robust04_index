			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Australian foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says  his government hopes the massacre of Palestinians in the West  Bank town of Hebron leads to a new sense of urgency in peace  negotiation. Senator Evans has condemned the massacre in which  more than 50 Palestinians were killed by a Jewish gunman and  extended Australia's sympathy to all the bereaved or wounded.  He has urged both Israel and the Palestine Liberation  Organization to intensify their efforts for peace and says it is  particularly important for the all sides use restraint to avoid  further bloodshed.</p>

Zhirinovskiy was invited to the Czech Republic at the  beginning of February by the extreme right Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC), which has 8  out of the total of 200 parliamentary seats.    Havel said on February 6 that "Mr. Zhirinovskiy has a  diplomatic passport, he can come here and then it will depend on  him what he says here and whether or not our authorities find it  suitable to possibly expel him."    Zhirinovskiy announced in Warsaw on Monday that he would  arrive on Sunday, March 20, for a two-day visit to the Czech  Republic.    The Czech Foreign Ministry said on Monday it did not think  that Zhirinovskiy's possible visit could help promote  Czech-Russian relations. Marek Skolil, the ministry's press  department director, told CTK the ministry learnt about  Zhirinovskiy's intention to visit the Czech Republic from the  media.    The chairman of the government coalition Christian  Democratic  Party (KDS), Ivan Pilip, told CTK it would be better if  Zhirinovskiy did not visit the Czech Republic. "Political  extremism has radiated many times and most clearly from  Zhirinovskiy's statements, and it would not be good not to  counter it only because he does not have real executive  political power at the moment," Pilip said. He added that this  could change given the current situation in Russia.    Otakar Vychodil (Civic Democratic Party), a member of the  parliamentary foreign committee, told CTK that he personally did  not think that Zhirinovskiy's visit could influence the  political situation in the Czech Republic.    Miloslav Vyborny (Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak  People's Party, KDU-CSL), chairman of the parliamentary  constitutional-legal committee, said he was not enthusiastic  about Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming visit. "Nevertheless, I do not  think that we could prevent the visit in any way."    The opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) is ready  to call on the public to stage demonstrations to express  disagreement with Zhirinovskiy's visit, CSSD Deputy Chairman  Pavel Novak told CTK. He said "it is not only up to the  government, but to all democratic political parties to use all  possibilities of expressing their disagreement with his  [Zhirinovskiy's] fascist views," Novak added.    Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the parliamentary deputies'  group Left Bloc (LB), told CTK that the Republicans' invitation  to Zhirinovskiy was an expression of contempt for both the Czech  Republic and humanism in politics.    The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) does not  agree with many of Zhirinovskiy's statements which it considers  to be extremely nationalistic, the party's spokeswoman Vera  Zezulkova told CTK.    But she added that it should not be forgotten that  Zhirinovskiy's party "has to a certain degree narrowed the  maneuvering scope of those political groups and the economic  lobby hidden behind them which directly promoted foreign  interests in Russia and which wanted to treat Russia as a mere  colony."    "It will be decisive for the development of our relations to  Zhirinovskiy... whether he will respect the principles of  equality and full sovereignty of all states and nations,"  Zezulkova said.</p>

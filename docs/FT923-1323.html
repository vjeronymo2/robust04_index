			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Smiling, not drowning: The UK chancellor's economic policy is in ruins, but he has never seemed so cheerful Politicians are paid to be resilient. But Mr Norman Lamont is setting new standards of cheeriness in the face of apparent disaster. Although his economic policy is in tatters and his credibility with the markets and many Conservative backbenchers is seriously diminished, he has never looked happier since becoming chancellor. Mr Lamont's puckish - almost feline - grin was so much in evidence during the past weekend in Washington that he was asked by journalists why he was in such good humour. 'I always look on the bright side,' he said, adding: 'My wife said she had never heard me sing in the bath before.' As yesterday's 1 percentage point cut in base rates shows, the chancellor has some reason to feel pleased with himself. Now freed of the constraint of the European exchange rate mechanism, he has been able to push the UK's short-term interest rates below those of Germany for the first time since the early 1980s. The move is not without risk. Yesterday's sharp fall in sterling will have done nothing to further the government's stated goal of low inflation. But there is no doubt that UK monetary policy in the ERM has been too tight, and this persuaded the Treasury and the Bank of England to sanction lower interest rates. At the same time, Mr Lamont's main objective is to save his political career. The rate cut could not be better timed in view of tomorrow's economic debate in the Commons. The suspension of sterling in the ERM has opened up other opportunities for the embattled chancellor. It allows him to play the Euro-sceptic card. In the Commons, Mr Lamont's position is widely perceived as weak after last week's humiliation. But it is far from hopeless so long as he can establish himself as the cabinet spokesman for those Tories who are hostile to Europe. His bid to grasp the intellectual leadership of the Euro-sceptics was apparent in Washington, just hours after the news of the narrow majority for the Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht. On Sunday afternoon Mr Lamont had chaired a meeting of European Community finance ministers with the aim of providing verbal support for financial markets. He did his duty by the British presidency of the EC by reading a statement in which the ministers said they were committed to the European Monetary System 'as a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe'. Seconds later, however, he was wearing his British hat and issuing a far less enthusiastic statement about the EMS. 'As far the UK is concerned, we have made clear that a number of important and fundamental issues will need to be addressed before sterling rejoins the ERM,' it said. His performance when answering questions was notable for the fluency and passion with which he warned governments to heed public opinion when pushing ahead with plans for European integration. The man who had frequently appeared uneasy when expounding government economic policy in the months ahead of last week's decision to float the pound seemed on much surer ground when discussing the merits of a cautious political approach to Europe. The press conference gave an insight into some of the frustration he must have felt when negotiating the economic and monetary union part of the Maastricht treaty. He had, he said, explained 'again and again and again' to his European colleagues that governments must take account of the wishes of the people of Europe. After the Danish No vote and the feeble French Yes, the chancellor clearly felt that his political beliefs and instincts had been vindicated. What still has to be vindicated is the chancellor's belief that the UK economy will recover from recession. He takes care these days not to spy 'green shoots of recovery' or prophesy 'recovery around the corner'. But he is equally anxious 'not to overdo the gloom'. On the plus side, he can point to a slight increases in non-oil gross domestic product and retail sales in the second quarter and higher manufacturing output in both the first and second quarters of this year. Lower interest rates and a more competitive exchange rate following the floating of sterling may now inject the so-far missing ingredient of confidence. After slogging through 22 months of grim economic news the thought that Britain might be poised for recovery would explain Mr Lamont's cheerfulness. But he will have to make sure that he does not unleash a bubble economy. For bubbles only end in tears.</p>

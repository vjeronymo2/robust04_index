Pham Van Quang, born in 1942, a resident of Phuoc Binh  village, Thu Duc District, deliberately engaged in a rebellious  act in a public place when Ho Chi Minh City was hosting its  first international marathon on 16 December 1992. On that day,  Pham Van Quang drove his family car to Me Linh Square with the  intention of creating trouble. He reasoned that many people,  especially foreigners, visit this place each day and that his  act might produce political repercussions. At noon, Quang  climbed onto the hood of his car and waved a flag. He fired a  revolver at intervals to draw people's attention. He reloaded  his gun five times, firing a total of 19 shots. Seeing this,  people in the vicinity immediately tried to stop Quang, but were  driven back when he pulled the pin of an M26 grenade to frighten  them. Quang was later arrested along with his exhibits.    The Ho Chi Minh City People's Court sentenced Pham Van Quang  to 15 years imprisonment on the charge of "rebellion." After  serving his jail term, Quang will be on parole for five years  and will be deprived of some of his rights as a citizen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly was informed today that the  government has again raised with the French Government the issue  of the supply of the nuclear power plant to Pakistan. Foreign  Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, in a written reply to a  question, described as false the rumors that the United States  has sought Pakistan's permission for establishing military  bases. He said there is no question whatsoever of any  commitment from Pakistan's side to the United States to set up  military bases here.    In reply to a question by Mian Abdul Waheed, the foreign  minister said spares of the defense equipment, including the  F-16's, are being purchased from the United States on commercial  basis due to the Pressler Amendment.</p>

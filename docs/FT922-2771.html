			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Azeri forces claim gains near Nagorno-Karabakh AZERI forces said yesterday they had pushed Armenian fighters out of the Shaumyan district of Azerbaijan, in a third day of heavy fighting in and around the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Moscow. Recent clashes have left thousands of refugees including these Azeris (above) in a camp close to the Armenian border. The Asa-Irada news agency reported that Azeri forces captured the town of Gulustan, the last Armenian-held stronghold in Shaumyan district just north of Nagorno-Karabakh itself. In Armenia, which punched open a road corridor to Nagorno-Karabakh in a major offensive last month, a Karabakh committee official confirmed the loss of Shaumyan. He said Azeri forces were using more than 300 tanks and armoured vehicles, helicopters and jets.</p>

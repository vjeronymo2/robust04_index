			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE IN ILLINOIS SOLD FOR $400,000 AT AUCTION  </P> <P> Robert Morris College -- its dormitories, classrooms, library, gym and 20 acres  -- sold at auction Thursday for $400,000.  </P> <P> The College Education Foundation, a nonprofit group of area businesses, made  the only bid. If the college's trustees approve the sale, which is considered  likely, the buyers want to find another school to take over the facilities. The  two-year business school used to be based here but now has its main campus in  Chicago.  </P> <P> In December, school officials stunned Carthage residents with their decision to  close the campus because of a deficit of $460,000.  </P> <P> The school was one of largest employers in this city of 3,000. The college,  which will close this summer, has about 370 students and 110 faculty and staff  members.  </P></p>

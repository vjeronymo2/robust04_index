			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Strong NFC looks confident NFC, the transport group which yesterday launched a Pounds 263m rights issue, said that it was too early to make a forecast of the outcome for 1994, but said it viewed the future with confidence. Pre-tax profits increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 104.9m in the year to October 2 on turnover ahead 10 per cent to Pounds 1.9bn. NFC said growth in its core businesses of Exel Logistics, BRS, Allied, Pickfords and Merchants was more impressive, with turnover up 16 per cent and operating profits ahead 35 per cent. Allied, Pickfords and Merchants were more affected by economic conditions and weak housing markets than the other two businesses, but made steady progress with operating profit up 24 per cent at Pounds 28.8m. Operations in the US and mainland Europe benefited from the devaluation of sterling and the effect of acquisitions in previous years. Devaluation boosted turnover by Pounds 116.3m and operating profit by Pounds 5.6m. The net pen-sion credit increased by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 19.9m and redundancy costs were reduced from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 9.9m. Exceptional items included Pounds 50m profit from the sale of the waste management activities; an adjustment to the profit on the disposal in the previous year of Pickfords Travel of Pounds 1.5m, and a profit of Pounds 3.3m on the disposal of properties. These were offset by a provision of Pounds 45m for the reorganisation of continuing operations. Lynx, the parcels operation, incurred an operating loss of Pounds 10.1m following problems with the start-up of a new hub at Nuneaton. The group said a new management team had managed to reduce the rate of loss, but the company was not yet profitable. Mr Peter Sherlock, NFC's chief executive, said the group would continue to pursue appropriate corrective action and to examine all options to address the situation - including disposal. Earnings per share under FRS 3 rose 33 per cent to 15.9p (11.9p). Excluding exceptionals, earnings rose by 22 per cent to 13.1p (10.7p). A final dividend of 2.6p gives a total for the year of 7p (6.55p), a rise of 7 per cent.</p>

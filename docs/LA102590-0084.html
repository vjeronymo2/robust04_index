			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PLACES TO LOOK FOR THE RIGHT PUMPKIN  </P> <P> Should you need a jack-o'-lantern to brighten your doorstep this Halloween, you  will find plenty of North County growers ready to provide you with just the  right ones. Besides being used as seasonal decorations however, locally grown  pumpkins and squashes can also enliven humdrum fall menus.  </P> <P> Robert and Peggy Torres of the Chestnut Produce Stand in Carlsbad are  particularly excited this year about white pumpkins -- in all ways similar to a  medium-sized jack-o'-lantern, except for their whitish tinge.  </P> <P> "The flesh is bright orange and very thick," said Peggy Torres, adding that  they make excellent pies. The unusual white specimens contrast with the bright  orange sugar pumpkins next to them. "The sugar pumpkins are smaller than  jack-o'-lanterns and they have a thicker flesh, which also makes them excellent  for pies," said Torres, who with her husband farms in Carlsbad and Valley  Center.  </P> <P> The pink banana squash has a deep-orange flesh and tastes much like the  butternut. Robert Torres recommends baking it with a little butter and a  sprinkle of cinnamon.  </P> <P> The Chestnut Produce Stand also features decorative miniature Indian ears of  corn, and decorative lufa gourds as twisted as rattlesnakes. Around Halloween,  the stand creates a "haunted house" for classes of grade-school children. The  tours are already booked for this year, but teachers interested in arranging a  tour next year should call by the end of next September.  </P> <P> Madeline Maciel of the Maciel Family Farm in Bonsall sells pumpkins, squashes  and a variety of seasonal produce at area farmers' markets. Her sister Irene  sells flowers from the back of the family truck. At this time of year, bright  orange mini-pumpkins, yellow sunbursts, dark green Hubbards and soft, golden  Tahitian squash attract scores of regular customers. "The Tahitian is almost as  sweet as a yam," said Maciel as she dispensed recipes along with her home-grown  produce. "It caramelizes as it cooks."  </P> <P> She also recommends the spaghetti squash: "It's great for people on a diet.  Just bake it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, and then separate the flesh with a  fork. It's a delicious substitute for spaghetti."  </P> <P> Howard Jewett, who also likes to experiment with exotic produce, swears by the  kabocha, a squash of Japanese origin that looks a little like a large,  malformed, acorn squash. "It doesn't look like much, but it's very juicy," he  said. "Little beads of juice form as soon as you cut it open. It's succulent  when you bake it." The lime-green opo squash, originally from Hawaii, is  another of his favorites. The slender zucchini-like vegetable is ideal for  grating and stuffing.  </P> <P> "Look at this," said Don Picket, co-owner with Ron Wright of the Berry Patch  Stand in Vista, as he breaks in half a yam the color of tangerine sherbet. "You  won't find a sweeter yam anywhere." Picket, who has been farming in the county  for 25 years, maintains that his yams can be baked and frozen for up to one  year. The golden pride variety of yam grows in San Pasqual Valley, and attracts  customers from as far as Orange County.  </P> <P> "I sold over 20,000 pounds of yams last year," Picket said proudly. "Many  customers buy them by the 50-pound box."  </P> <P> Pumpkins and squashes are very low in calories, and a good source of vitamin A.  When buying pumpkins or squashes, avoid pumpkins with cracked shells and  squashes with blemishes, or any that feel "mushy" to the touch.  </P> <P> Textures and tastes vary. The small, sweet-tasting acorn squash has slightly  fibrous texture and is ideal for stuffing. The banana squash's golden flesh is  creamy and sweet, much like the butternut and the Hubbard. The kabocha's dark  orange flesh boasts a nuttier flavor.  </P> <P> Medium-sized hollowed-out pumpkins make a dramatic serving-dish for pumpkin  soup or home-made stew. To warm the pumpkin shell, scoop out the seeds, pour in  boiling water and let stand about 20 minutes. Discard the water, and pour in  the soup or stew.  </P> <P> A FEW PUMPKIN PATCHES  </P> <P> Robert and Peggy Torres, Chestnut Produce Stand, on Chestnut Street, a half  block west of Highland Avenue, Carlsbad.

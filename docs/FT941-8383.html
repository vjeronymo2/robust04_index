			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going Shopping / In the third part of our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers look at how the people of five major cities dress to go shopping Shopping is becoming a less frequent activity for the Japanese, if the dismal retail sales figures are anything to go by. Dressing for shopping, as a result, is a concern that preoccupies them less and less as there is no longer a compelling need to be seen dressed in the very best at all times. One popular style among young women is the long skirt over boots, topped by a short jacket or big shawl and often a hat. This is new for Japan - there is a definite sense of no-nonsense, practical fashion, a far cry from the extravagance of the go-go years. Style among shoppers tends to be different depending on where you shop. The staid Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya department stores in Nihonbashi, close to the Tokyo stock market and the main banking district, attract well-heeled women who prefer a conservative look of suits and twin sets. Closer to the popular residential neighbourhoods, in Shibuya or Shinjuku, the department stores tend to attract a more casual clientele while in fashionable Aoyama, shoppers are keen to be seen in asymmetrical Yohji Yamamoto or Comme des Garcons outfits. Most striking, however, is the emptiness of the designers' shops and how much more accommodating the shop assistants appear to be. Department stores have also become more like small shopping malls with a variety of tenants, and are losing customers to supermarkets, downmarket shopping malls and discount stores where more attention is paid to price than to what people are wearing.</p>

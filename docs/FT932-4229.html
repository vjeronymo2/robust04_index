			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / People: Nomura raids CSFB to upgrade treasury Nomura International is upgrading its treasury operations in Europe by creating a separate division and hiring Nicholas Alicabiotis from CSFB as managing-director to run it from the beginning of next month. Hence there are now five divisions, with investment banking being the only area run by a Japanese executive. Greek-born Alicabiotis, 41, was executive director in charge of funding CSFB's European businesses, with previous experience at both Citibank and Bank of America. Rival market participants give him high marks for his performance at CSFB, where he has been since 1990, pointing out that funding an investment bank is a very considerably greater challenge than funding a UK clearing bank. Nomura set up its treasury operation when it first gained a banking license in 1986, a move which enabled the securities house to gain crucial experience at a time when it could not operate as a bank in Japan. Market observers surmise that the collapse in the Tokyo stock market, combined with the Japanese preference for measured growth, means that the group had perhaps taken its eye off the treasury function for a while. 'This time I think they will go for it,' was the comment of one UK clearing banker, although a Nomura spokesman said that plans were solely to optimise the operation's cost of funds, rather than selling treasury services to clients, at least at this stage.</p>

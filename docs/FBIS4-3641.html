			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP) -- China called Thursday on  Indonesia to defuse the situation in northern Sumatra which was  rocked this week by violent anti-ethnic Chinese rioting.    "We hope and believe that the Indonesian Government will  properly settle this case so that people there can enjoy a  stable and happy life," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin  told a weekly press briefing. "China is a friendly country to  Indonesia," Wu stressed.    Anti-Chinese riots in the Sumatran capital Medan left one  ethnic businessman dead and scores of Chinese-owned businesses  sacked. There is widespread resentment in parts of Indonesia  against the country's wealthy ethnic-Chinese minority, which  comprises a mere three percent of the population but controls a  disproportionate share of economic wealth.</p>

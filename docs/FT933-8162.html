			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand for CDollars 1bn global offering from Quebec THE INTERNATIONAL bond market had a fairly active start to the week as the Province of Quebec launched its previously-announced CDollars 1bn global offering to good demand. Syndicate managers expect new bond issuance to remain buoyant in the coming days. A spokesman at the joint lead manager, Merrill Lynch, said that strong investor interest, especially from North America and Europe, enabled Quebec's 10-year bonds to be priced to yield 68 basis points above the yield on the Canadian 7 1/2 per cent Treasury due 2003. The pricing of the offering came at the lower end of the yield spread target of 68 to 70 basis points. The bonds were freed to trade yesterday afternoon and were bid at their re-offer price of 98.813. In addition to Luxembourg, Quebec's global offering has listings in Hong Kong and Singapore for the first time, to recognise the growing interest among Pacific/Asia investors for bonds which are traded internationally. The World Bank also included Hong Kong in the listing of its Dollars 100m three-year deal, for the same reason as Quebec. Yesterday's offering from the World Bank gives investors an opportunity to increase their return if Italian interest rates fall during the life of the bonds. The initial, semi-annual coupon on the bonds will be 2 per cent. Thereafter, the coupon, which is paid in dollars, will pay 11.5 per cent minus six-month lire Libor, which stood just below 9 per cent yesterday. 'We believe that Italian interest rates will go a lot lower,' said a spokesman at the lead manager, Morgan Stanley, which has arranged similar deals in various currences for private placement in the past. He added that the borrower had hedged itself against this eventuality. Investors in Pacific/Asia had shown a particular interest in the offering and around half of the bonds already sold had been placed in that region, the spokesman said. The bonds were re-offered at their issue price of par and were not freed to trade by yesterday afternoon. In the same sector, Cemex, the Mexican cement company, launched a Dollars 120m seven-year offering which completes its Dollars 650m Euro medium-term note programme. A spokesman at the lead manager, Citibank, said that most of the bonds were placed with US investors but that there had been interest from Europe and Japan. US investors are keen to buy Latin American bonds because their higher yield. Cemex's bonds were priced to yield 311 basis points above the yield on the 8.75 per cent US Treasury of August 2000. The pricing reflects the steady tightening of yield spreads for Latin American issuers over the last year. The bonds were freed to trade yesterday and were quoted at par bid, up from a re-offer price of 99.74. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has set up an Ecu1bn global commercial paper programme under which it may issue commercial paper in the US and in the international bond market. The EBRD plans to draw on the multi-currency facility at the start of September, Ms Veronique Pellan, part of the bank's funding team, said. She added that proceeds from the programme will be used to replace existing bank loans and for cash management and short-term hedging purposes. With regard to the EBRD's longer-term borrowing programme, Ms Pellan said that the bank has almost completed its 1993 funding target of Ecu900m.</p>

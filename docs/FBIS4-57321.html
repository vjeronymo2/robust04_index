			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Octavio Ochoa] </F>   [Text] Fernando Gomez Mont, National Action Party [PAN]  deputy and president of the Chamber of Deputies' Justice  Commission, has described as "serious and unhealthy" the  replacement of the attorney general because, he said, this  change "reflects political and juridical instability in the  country." Gomez Mont yesterday favored legal reforms to give the  Attorney General's Office [PGR] full autonomy and detach it,  once and for all, from the Executive's decisions.    Rene Bejarano Martinez, leader of the Party of the  Democratic  Revolution in Mexico City, has said that Diego Valades Rios'  hasty dismissal "casts serious doubts on the government and the  administration of justice in the country" and arouses the  "permanent suspicion" that high officials are involved in drug  trafficking, all of which heightens the climate of insecurity in  Mexico.    All of these changes have altered the functions of the  Attorney General and Mexico City's Federal Attorney General. It  is time for this office to become fully autonomous and to be  freed from the president's control, Gomez Mont said. He voiced  his fears that Humberto Benitez Trevino, the new PGR head, will  file away the Hank Gonzalez case permanently.    Gomez Mont said that Benitez is openly pro-Gonzalez and that  all of Benitez' background consists of positions he held in the  state of Mexico and SARH, [Secretariat of Agriculture and  Hydraulic Resources] which was headed by Gonzalez. Apart from  this, the change "is unhealthy" because it destabilizes the  institution even further and reveals "a certain mismanagement"  at the federal level. These changes give the impression of  "messiness." Instead of benefiting the country, these changes  harm it.    Finally, Gomez Mont refuted the report that his party  pressured for Valades Rios' removal.</p>

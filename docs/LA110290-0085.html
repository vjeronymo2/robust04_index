			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATHE CLOSES LONG-DELAYED MGM/UA DEAL  </P> <P> Hollywood's historic film studio MGM/UA Communications Co. was acquired  Thursday by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti in a patchwork deal valued at  $1.36 billion.  </P> <P> The terms of the oft-delayed buyout were not revealed, but Parretti's Pathe  Communications Corp. reportedly put the deal together with a complex package of  loans and advances. The new company, the third major Hollywood studio to be  controlled by foreign interests, will be named MGM-Pathe Communications Co.  </P> <P> "Ha! . . . Bravo for him," said company spokeswoman Arlene Cattani of  Parretti's success in completing the deal that skeptics had contended would  never be done. MGM/UA marked the deal, eight months in the making and the  subject of several lawsuits, by delivering a live, 400-pound lion to Parretti's  office.  </P> <P> The buyout puts a wrap on the 21-year reign of MGM/UA majority shareholder Kirk  Kerkorian, who had tried to sell the studio for two years. Kerkorian made $996  million from the sale.  </P> <P> Leaving MGM/UA "saddens me a lot," Kerkorian told The Times shortly before the  deal closed. He acknowledged that the company was in a weak competitive  position against bigger media conglomerates such as Sony Corp. and its Columbia  Pictures subsidiary. "You've got to be in hardware today, you've got to be in  satellites, you've got to be in manufacturing home videocassettes and in  theaters. That's what it's all about these days," he said.  </P> <P> Parretti, whose conquest was set back several times by false starts and funding  problems, assumes the title of co-chairman and chief executive at MGM-Pathe.  His longtime business partner, Florio Fiorini, will serve as co-chairman.  Rounding out the troika is former Cannon Group boss Yorum Globus, who will be  president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> Parretti said, in a prepared statement, that he will develop the kind of  product that has made the MGM name "legendary for generations." But MGM is  hardly the titan of old.  </P> <P> The company, best known for the roaring "Leo the Lion" logo that precedes its  films, has captured only 1.4% of the domestic box office so far this year and  has already been largely dismantled by Kerkorian, who sold the Culver City  studio lot and the MGM film library. MGM produced such classics as "Gone With  the Wind," "The Wizard of Oz" and, in the Kerkorian years, had occasional hits  such as "Rain Man" and "Moonstruck."  </P> <P> An MGM/UA spokeswoman said the logo would continue to be used exclusively by  the company, adding that the logo will have no connection to the stylized lion  logo used by Kerkorian's MGM Grand airline and hotel company.  </P> <P> Pathe is expected to divulge its financing to the Securities and Exchange  Commission by next week. So far, the company has said only that it will receive  about $700 million of the purchase price from the sale of its assets to MGM/UA,  which in turn has raised at least part of the money by selling long-term rights  to the MGM/UA and Pathe film libraries.  </P> <P> Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and Time Warner Inc. agreed to pay more than  $325 million for certain rights over a period of more than 10 years. But it  remained unclear who provided the balance of the $700 million or whether any  banks assisted in the financing.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills-based Pathe has said that the balance of the funds came from  transactions with European investors, which reportedly include Pathe  affiliates.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles, said  the MGM/UA acquisition "breaks all the records for investment banking  ingenuity." Logsdon said it's highly likely that further MGM/UA assets will be  sold to pay any debt that Parretti might have incurred.  </P> <P> "Clearly there's a financial mandate for de-leveraging, especially with these  guys," Logsdon said. "Some assets have got to be sold and some movies have got  to work. They could sell the TV division. It's not doing poorly at all. So  they've got some latitude."  </P> <P> Despite the instability caused by years of asset sales, MGM/UA has retained a  presence in network television. It has four series on the networks, including  "thirtysomething" and "The Young Riders," and is scheduled to reprise "Dark  Shadows" for NBC early next year. MGM/UA also is developing a series for CBS  based on the studio's "Pink Panther" movies.  </P> <P> David Gerber, chairman of MGM/UA Television Productions Inc., said he was glad  the sale was finally over. The corporate turmoil has taken its toll, he said,  adding that "over the years, we've lost talent and had a hard time convincing  the agents to work with us."  </P> <P> Gerber said Parretti and MGM/UA Chief Executive Jeffrey Barbakow told him in  recent meetings that the television division would not be sold. Parretti, said  Gerber, "talked with a global understanding of where broadcasting has to go."  </P> <P> Analysts say MGM/UA's chances of remaining solvent may largely depend on the  performance of the 11-picture film schedule that Pathe has developed. One top  financial analyst, who asked that his name not be used, said MGM/UA will be  even more pressured than other studios to come up with box-office winners. "If  those pictures do not attract box-office success, you'd be looking at a  severely wounded or impaired company," the analyst said.  </P> <P> Pathe also must contend with lawsuits filed by two top producers, Alberto  Grimaldi ("Last Tango in Paris") and the producers of the James Bond films, who  contend that their profit participations will be sharply curtailed under the  buyout. In his suit, Grimaldi has claimed that Pathe had sold rights to MGM/UA  films to an array of foreign buyers, and has borrowed as much as $650 million  against the contracts from Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland. Pathe is contesting  the lawsuit but hasn't commented on the specific claim.  </P> <P> Under an earlier plan, Pathe had raised a substantial portion of its buyout  financing through short-term loans and advances that it expected to retire by  selling $300 million or more in new common stock.  </P> <P> It isn't clear whether any such plans lay behind the current buyout, although a  new share offering would be extremely difficult in a market that has battered  the stock of even such solid entertainment companies as Paramount  Communications Corp. and Walt Disney Co.  </P> <P> The merger represents a marriage of two companies that have been struggling.  For the nine months ended May 31, MGM/UA posted a $32-million net loss. Pathe  made a $1.3-million profit for the last six months before an extraordinary  credit.  </P> <P> While Pathe brings such upcoming films as "Russia House" to the table, the  combined companies will now have to come up with millions of dollars to cover  the cost of marketing those films, as well as a bare minimum of $100 million to  produce even a modest slate of big studio-quality movies over the next year.  </P> <P> Pathe representatives have said they expect to have ample funding to produce  and market films, largely from existing bank credit lines. But they haven't  detailed future film plans.  </P> <P> Alan Ladd Jr., a 52-year-old film veteran and Pathe's current film chief, will  head movie-making operations for the combined companies.  </P> <P> Richard Berger, who has headed MGM/UA's film operation since Ladd quit in a  falling out with Kerkorian two years ago, said he wasn't sure if he would  remain with the company. "Laddie's said they'd like to find a place for me. But  I don't know," Berger said in a telephone interview after the merger was  announced.  </P> <P> Berger said he expected staff cuts of 100 employees in MGM/UA's home video unit  and other cuts in the film production staff. But he said the marketing and  distribution departments might actually expand to handle the dozen or so films  Pathe has produced and now expects to release through MGM/UA.  </P> <P> "This is very sad for a lot of people. They're not going to have jobs. . . .  The business is contracting," Berger said.  </P> <P> In the last several years, the film industry has seen Tri-Star Pictures and  Columbia Pictures combined into Sony's Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and the  collapse of independent movie companies such as the Lorimar Telepictures film  unit and Weintraub Entertainment Group.  </P> <P> Pathe was formed in 1989 when various European companies controlled by Parretti  and Fiorini took control of what was then known as Cannon Group. Cannon had  long produced low-budget films and made a largely unsuccessful attempt to  produce big-star vehicles under its top executives, Globus and Menachem Golan.  </P> <P> MGM/UA's sale has been contemplated for years. The Australian-based Qintex  Group agreed to buy the studio for $1.5 billion last year. The deal fell apart,  however, when Qintex was un able to secure financing. Qintex was subsequently  forced to file for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA for $1.5 billion in 1986 but  immediately sold back most of the company to Kerkorian, keeping the MGM film  library for use on his cable television services.  </P> <P> Kerkorian declined to say what he plans to do with his share of the proceeds  from the sale, though it is widely assumed that he will use it to build his  planned Las Vegas casino and theme park. "Whatever it is, we have to wait and  see," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Robert E. Dallos, David J. Fox and John Lippman contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

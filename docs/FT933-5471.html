			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: JAL to service jumbo jets in China JAPAN Air Lines is to take a 10 per cent stake in a Pounds 21m aircraft servicing plant being built in China, to which it will move some maintenance work in an attempt to reduce labour costs. The Taeko servicing plant project was established in June and will become operational in 1996. It is 51 per cent owned by Hong Kong Aircraft Maintenance, which does work for Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline. JAL said it intended to transfer some of the maintenance on its Boeing 747 jumbo jets to Taeko and will send its own technical staff to train engineers in China. Since Chinese labour costs are much lower than those in Japan, the move could save the Japanese airline about Y200m (Pounds 1.25m) in annual maintenance costs per jet, which in Japan amount to between Y500m and Y800m. The Japanese carrier, the country's largest, is under severe pressure to cut costs quickly. In the year to March it made a Y54.9bn (Pounds 345m) pre-tax loss and has been carrying out a significant restructuring programme aimed at cutting Y200bn in costs. Some Y100bn of that will cut from investment. A key part of its strategy in cutting costs is to increase the ratio of personnel costs accounted in foreign currencies. JAL already has some maintenance carried out in Singapore. Japan's Civil Aviation Board, which oversees aircraft safety, will inspect the new facility in China before it is given the go-ahead to start maintenance work for JAL. Mr Stuart John, Cathay Pacific's engineering director and deputy chairman of HAECO, the Hong Kong airline's maintenance arm, said his company had been forced to go into China because of space restrictions at Kai Tak airport, high inflation and the shortage of labour.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Investor wins case on savings account NATIONWIDE, the second-largest building society, was ordered yesterday to pay compensation to an investor who lost money because the society's publicity failed to make clear that a better savings account existed than the one in which she was investing, David Barchard writes. Mr Stephen Edell, the building society ombudsman, ruled against a second complaint by another investor that he had lost money because a slightly better 90-day account had been introduced during the period in which he was required to give notice before withdrawing his money. Mr Edell said yesterday: 'Fundamentally, it is up to people to look after their own investments. Investors should be vigilant about their investments, but I don't think that building societies ought to hide the interest rates paid on closed accounts.' The complaints followed an outcry against the society last spring when many of its savers discovered that they were trapped in a lower 90-day interest account and could not transfer their funds after a better account had been introduced. There was uproar at the society's annual meeting in the summer as members attacked the directors for not telling them about the better account and not relaxing the90-day rule for giving notice.</p>

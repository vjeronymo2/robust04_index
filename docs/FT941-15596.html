			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Major lukewarm on Scott inquiry The row over the conduct of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry looked set to continue yesterday after the inquiry was given only a lukewarm endorsement by the prime minister. Speaking four days before he is due to give evidence to the inquiry, Mr John Major said: 'The government appointed Lord Justice Scott to conduct an independent inquiry. I believe it is therefore for him to draw up his own procedures and it is not a matter for the government to comment upon those procedures and I have no adverse comments to make on them.' His question-time comments came the day after Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary and deputy prime minister, criticised the conduct of the inquiry and issued a veiled threat that its eventual recommendations would be considered invalid by officials and ministers. It emerged yesterday that Lord Howe told friends - including former government colleagues - as early as last July of his disquiet about the procedures being followed by the inquiry. 'He was sufficiently exercised personally about the inquiry to criticise it without anyone coming to beg him to do so,' said a former colleague. Nevertheless Lord Howe's attack on the inquiry was being described inside and outside Westminster as 'politically powerful' and one which could have an even bigger impact in the longer term. Conservative backbenchers were expected to use it in any parliamentary debate after publication of the Scott report, expected in the autumn. One high-ranking political source said Tory MPs would claim that the inquiry had used unfair procedures if current or former ministers were singled out for criticism. Lord Justice Scott yesterday appeared to be trying to distance himself from the row. An official said his priority was to proceed with his inquiry, which will resume public hearings on Monday, when Mr Major is to give evidence. The conduct of the inquiry was backed last night by Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants. 'Thanks to Scott we have had a more public explanation of the inner workings of government and that is a good thing,' she said.</p>

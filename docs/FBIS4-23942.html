			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rafael Omar in Nampula] </F>   [Excerpts] Carvalho Pensado, political adviser to the  Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] president, has accused  Eduardo da Silva Nihia, first secretary of the Mozambique  Liberation Front [Frelimo] in Nampula, of helping 34 Tanzanian  citizens to register as voters in the city of Nampula. Carvalho  Pensado told Radio Mozambique recently that he received reports  that Eduardo da Silva Nihia had taken 34 Tanzanians to a voter  registration center [words indistinct] Ward on 15 June. [passage  omitted].    Our reporting team this morning contacted Eduardo da Silva  Nihia, and he had this to say:    [Begin Nihia recording] Pensado is a Mozambican. As a  Mozambican, when he receives information, he must, first of all,  examine it. He must try to obtain the truth before running to  the media. It is a citizen's right to register as a voter. I  come from this province. When I came here from Maputo, I asked  my relatives whether they had registered. They said: No, we  were waiting for you because we do not understand how it is  done. I explained them what it means. I told them it was a  citizen's right and duty to register. So, we all went to  register at the voter registration center. The voter  registration officials are Mozambicans. They spoke with each  one of my relatives in Macua and Portuguese. I do not know  whether a Tanzanian could speak Macua or Portuguese [words  indistinct]. [end recording]    Radio Mozambique then visited the Election Commission  headquarters in the city of Nampula to obtain more information  from [words indistinct]. Team supervisor Mahomade Yusufu said  although he did not like Nihia's attitude, he cannot confirm  that the people who were with him were Tanzanians. [passage  omitted]</p>

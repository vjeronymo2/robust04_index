			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: ALL EARS TRAINED ON 'REAL MEN . . . '  </P> <P> The Scene: "Listening Party," Thursday night at the China Club. On the  turntable was the new album "Real Men . . . Wear Black" by the three-man funk  group Cameo, and several hundred people, including 66.6% of the band, showed up  to lend an ear.  </P> <P> The Entertainment: For those who have never been to one, a listening party for  a rock album isn't quite like an evening at the symphony, with guests listening  quietly and applauding between movements. In fact, it's not much different than  a regular party, with guys scamming on girls (and vice versa). And other guests  queuing at the bar for sophisticated adult refreshments while the record plays  over and over. And over.  </P> <P> Who Was There: Larry Blackmon and Tomi Jenkins of Cameo, along with celebrity  guests Priscilla "Three's Company" Barnes and Sally "Oscar nominee for 'Anna' "  Kirkland. Robert and Rosemarie Stack were among the later arrivals. 2 Live  Crew's lead singer, Luther Campbell, was thought to be coming, but he  apparently stayed home to wash his hair. Or his mouth.  </P> <P> Dress Code: The title of the album dictated the dress code, though L.A.'s club  hoppers hardly need a reason to drag out the black raiment. Some men wore sharp  suits that would have looked right at home on Arsenio Hall, while women went  for the time-tested, tight fashion model look. ("They looked like hookers,"  exclaimed one guest from New York, who was the only one in the room wearing a  knee-length, floral-print dress.)  </P> <P> Fashion Statements: Sally Kirkland wore one of her trademark tight dresses  accented with pink and yellow flowers in her hair. One man wore shiny,  skin-tight black vinyl pants that looked like hip huggers made out of hip  waders.  </P> <P> Quoted: Asked if he was a big Cameo fan, Robert Stack replied, "I dig them.  They're part of MTV, which is the motion pictures of today." Stack also  revealed that he used to be a musician, to which his wife, Rosemarie,  commented, "Now he just sings in the shower."  </P> <P> Glitches: Video crews began to annoy on their 800th pass through the crowd. One  man at the bar reached over, pretended to disconnect a few dangling wires from  a camera positioned precisely three millimeters from his head, and said with a  sneer, "Bon soir."  </P> <P> Photo Op of the Night: What photographer or media crew could resist Robert and  Rosemarie Stack cutting a rug on the dance floor.  </P></p>

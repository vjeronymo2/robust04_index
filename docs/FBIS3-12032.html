			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 28 Mar (DPA) -- Today, the Mexico City  press reported the Mexican police have arrested and interrogated  an alleged collaborator of Mario Aburto Martinez, the confessed  assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio, who appears in a video opening  the way for Aburto to shoot at the presidential candidate at  point-blank range. According to reports coming from Tijuana  where the murder took place last Wednesday, this man is  Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas who was allegedly hired by the  ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) as a member of  the candidate's security corps. Colosio was murdered last  Wednesday at the end of an election rally held in Lomas  Taurinas, a neighborhood in northern Tijuana, on the border.    The video, filmed by an amateur and disseminated today by  Televisa, first shows Sanchez Venegas getting close to the  candidate and later opening the way for Aburto Martinez. In the  video, one can see how the assassin raises his arm and puts the  Taurus .38 caliber just a few centimeters from Colosio's right  temple, as well as the blast at the moment of the shooting.  This is the first direct image of the homicide, which even  registers the exact hour of the shooting, 1912 Mexico City time  (0112 GMT).    Quoting sources close to the investigation, the daily  EXCELSIOR said, however, that Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas denied  any link to the attack and pointed out that the fact he was  there next to Aburto Martinez is a mere "coincidence." Two  other persons arrested on the day of the murder as witnesses,  Vicente Mayoral and Jose Antonio Sanchez Ortega, were released  24 hours after the murder.    The Attorney General's Office [PGR] denied reports to the  effect that Sanchez Ortega tested "positive" in the so-called  "paraffin test," conducted immediately after the murder to  determine if he had fired any weapon. The police also arrested  several relatives and people close to the confessed killer,  including his mother, Maria Luisa Martinez, and his sisters  Elizabeth and Karina, ages 17 and 9, the press said today,  adding that their whereabouts are unknown.    According to the PGR, there was only one man, Aburto  Martinez, and only one weapon, the Taurus .38 caliber gun,  involved in the attack, but political circles and the local  media do not rule out a plot. Investigations are now under  Special Prosecutor Miguel Montes, whose appointment has been  challenged by the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution  (PRD), who believe that Montes' pro-government affiliation does  not guarantee the impartiality necessary for arriving at the  truth.</p>

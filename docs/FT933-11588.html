			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Economists call for end to ERM SIX of the world's most eminent economists, including three Nobel prizewinners, today call for France to lead the way in the abandonment of the European exchange rate mechanism. In an article in the Financial Times, timed to coincide with today's Bundesbank council meeting, they argue that Europe is repeating the mistake of the 1930s, when countries tried to maintain currency values in spite of economic depression. The economists say: 'In 1931, when Britain went off gold, a baffled ex-labour minister noted: 'They never told us we could do such a thing.' Just in case the message has not got through to France and Spain: no, it is not un-European to uncouple from the D-Mark, and not even unwise.' The six - Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow - are all professors of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professors Modigliani, Samuelson and Solow are past recipients of the Nobel prize for economics. Early burial for EMS, Page 15</p>

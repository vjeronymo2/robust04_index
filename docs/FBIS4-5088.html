The commissioning of Monju fully reveals Japan's undisguised  scheme to become a nuclear power by securing a large quantity of  plutonium for itself and manufacturing nuclear weapons any  moment.    It is an open challenge to the Korean people and the Asian  and world people who are desirous of peace.    Japan is already possessed of elements for the manufacture  of  nuclear bombs including electronic explosive devices and their  technologies. Before commissioning Monju it launched the large  long-range rocket "H-2" in February this year. Its nuclear  armament has now reached the danger line.    Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities are now crying for  "additional inspection" and "economic sanctions" over the  fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. This is as base as a  thief crying "stop thief " the Japanese authorities must give up  their criminal nuclear design, mindful of the grave consequences  to be entailed by their moves to make Japan a nuclear power.</p>

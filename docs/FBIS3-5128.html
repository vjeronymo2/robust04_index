			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 1 March editorial: "Let Us Brilliantly </F> Embody the Party's Socialist Rural Construction Program"]    [Text] The National Agricultural Meeting, which was held  amid keen interest and expectations of our agricultural working  people and the whole nation, has concluded after the successful  conclusion of its work.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent an historic letter  for the ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner  of the socialist rural theses to the National Agricultural  Meeting and personally attended the meeting to encourage the  agricultural workers.    The respected and beloved leader's letter is a program of  socialist rural construction of our times and a militant banner  that makes it possible to develop our country's rural economic  work to a higher level. Agricultural workers and other people,  bearing deep in their hearts the great glory of receiving the  programmatic work that indicates the future road of socialist  rural construction, are turning out in the struggle to implement  it.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter  consummates the theoretical and practical matters for finally  solving the rural question, the most difficult question in  socialist construction, by dynamically accelerating rural  construction along the road indicated by the rural theses.    The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has  taught: If we consolidate the position we have already taken up  and launch a new battle by making more strenuous efforts, we  will win a historic victory in the solution of the rural  question, the most difficult question in the building of  socialism.    Whether we finally solve the rural question under socialism  or not is an important matter that affects the future of  socialism. Through their long struggle to implement the great  rural theses, our party and people have already solved basic  problems in socialist rural construction.    We are on a high peak that affords the prospect of ultimate  solution of the rural question. This is a great victory won by  our party and people in their historic struggle for socialism  and communism. The tasks of consolidating the position we have  already taken up and ultimately solving the rural question in  the near future lie ahead.    The work clearly indicates the road for intensifying and  developing the three revolutions -- ideological, technological,  and cultural -- will give more assistance to the rural areas,  and will promote the overall rural economic work to meet the  high demands of socialist rural construction.    Every system and content of the work embodies our party's  firm will to complete, under all circumstances, the historic  task for the ultimate solution of the rural question set forth  in the socialist rural theses. Accordingly, the work is a  guideline with which our party and people must persistently keep  up in their struggle to protect, adhere to, and develop the  our-style socialist cause.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic work, for  the  ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner of the  socialist rural theses, has a great theoretical and practical  meaning in our people's revolutionary struggle and the  implementation of the overall socialist cause.    The work, above all, is a militant banner that instills into  the minds of our people and agricultural workers the conviction  of the might of the chuche-based system of the socialist rural  economy and the invincibility of our-style socialism and that  powerfully encouraged them in the work for consolidation and  development.    Our country's rural economic system set forth by the great  leader is a superior rural economic system under which  agricultural workers become masters of production and management  and which continues to develop based on the principle of  collectivism. We have not witnessed a more superior and  advanced rural economic system anywhere in the world.    In the course of struggle to implement the rural theses, the  feature of our rural areas has changed a great deal and our  rural economic system has been strengthened and developed in  every domain of politics, economy, and culture to the maximum.    The work proudly summed up the decisive victory won during  the course of accelerating the three revolutions -- ideological,  technological, and cultural -- changes in farmers' material and  cultural life, and achievements in managing and operating  cooperative farms. It also displayed the might and superiority  of our rural economic system.    In this way, the work powerfully demonstrated that our  socialist rural economic system is the one that provides free  and creative life to the working people and is a superior system  that makes it possible to push ahead with the tasks to  assimilate farmers into the working class and industrializing  agriculture.    From the work, we have come to learn a precious truth that  the chuche-oriented socialist road lead by our party is the only  road to the agricultural workers' true sense of life, happiness,  victory, and glory.    The great leader's work is a highly important guideline in  effecting a new revolutionary turn in our rural economy and in  all sectors of agricultural production.    A difficult and enormous task of an unprecedented scale is  set for the field of socialist rural construction today. We are  carrying out the task of rural construction on a high stage in  an acute confrontation with the enemies. The work sets forth  the principles, specific tasks, and method for the successful  acceleration of this task. The work comprehensively sets forth  the struggle guidelines reflecting the new demands of the  construction of our rural areas, such as the guideline on  vigorously conducting ideological work for the agricultural  working people and imbue them with a mind toward revolution, the  working-class, socialism, and the chuche idea; the guideline on  enhancing the technological and cultural standard of the  agricultural working people in conformity with the demand of  intellectualizing the entire society; and the guideline on  realizing the industrialization and modernization of agriculture  on a high level.    In particular, the guideline on intensifying the party's  guidance in socialist rural construction is of important  significance in building the socialist rural base firmly  politically, ideologically, and in terms of class. If the tasks  set forth in the work are thoroughly implemented, the socialist  rural construction will bring forth a new revolutionary upturn,  vigorously accelerating the complete victory of socialism.    The great leader's work is also an immortal classic work  that  further developed and enriched the revolutionary theory of the  working class on socialist-communist construction with new and  original contents. Solving the socialist rural problem is a  creative work which no one has ever carried out. The great  leader clearly saw through the future of our rural areas with  his wisdom of second sight and scientific insight and put forth  original ideology and theory for the ultimate solution of the  rural problem, thus breaking new ground for the development of  the revolutionary theory of the working class.    In particular, the great leader comprehensively elucidated  in  this work the principles, the method, and the timing of  transferring cooperative ownership to all-people ownership.  This is of important significance in the development of the  revolutionary theory on rural construction. Thanks to the  theories put forth in the work -- such as the theory on creating  the condition for transferring cooperative ownership to  all-people ownership, the theory on carrying on this work by  county as a unit, and the theory on correctly establishing the  form and method of transferring cooperative ownership to  all-people ownership -- the way to solve the rural problem  ultimately without the slightest deviation has been made  available.    The great leader's work has now become a powerful weapon to  crush the imperialists' sophism that socialism cannot solve the  rural problem and the opportunist trend which excludes the  revolutionary principles of the working class in rural  construction. The justness and truthfulness of the ideology,  theories, and guidelines put forth in the work will be  thoroughly demonstrated in our practice of socialist  construction which vigorously advances crushing the  antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries.    We should wage a vigorous struggle to effect new upsurge in  socialist rural construction upholding the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song's programmatic work, "For the Ultimate Solution of  the Rural Problem Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural  Thesis." All party members and working people should, above  all, intensively study and assimilate the profound ideology and  theory contained in the great leader's work. Important here is  to deeply learn the wisdom of the leadership of the respected  and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the greatness of his  achievements.    The great leader attached great importance to the problem of  peasants and agriculture long ago and has made energetic efforts  for its solution, and has led all sorts of work, large and  small, arising in the development of rural economy. The work  sums up the great leader's guidelines of rural construction,  which he put forth and verified their might, and comprehensively  incorporates the grand idea of rural construction which the  leader [suryong] formulated. We should deeply cherish the great  pride in accelerating socialist rural construction under the  leadership of the great party and the leader [suryong]. All the  functionaries and working people of the agricultural sector  should deeply study the work in close connection with the  specific reality of their county, their farm, and their work  team, so that they can further deepen the work of adding luster  to the great leader's leadership achievements.    To thoroughly implement the task presented in the work it  is important for all the people and agricultural working people  to firmly believe in the superiority of the chuche-oriented  socialist rural economic system and the correctness of our  party's socialist rural construction program. Historic lessons  of socialist construction teaches that defending socialism  results in victory and renouncing it brings about death in rural  areas.    We should have the firm faith that the popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style is the best and make  all possible efforts to safeguard, defend, and glorify these  noble gains. At the same time, we should implement our party's  great rural construction program with the firm faith that we can  realize without fail any difficult tasks in rural construction  due to the single-hearted unity of our people around the party  and the leader [suryong] and the mighty self-reliant national  economy, which has the chuche-oriented industries as its pillar.    Further deepening and developing the three revolutions --  ideological, technological, and cultural -- in conformity with  the demands of the new high stage of socialist rural  construction is one of the important tasks presented in the  work. We should define the ideological revolution as a most  important and indispensable requirement for safeguarding,  defending, and consummating the socialist cause and should  vigorously wage ideological work among the agricultural working  people. We should conduct in-depth indoctrination in the chuche  idea by closely combining it with the indoctrination in the  party's policy, the indoctrination in the revolutionary  traditions, the indoctrination in socialist patriotism, and many  other forms of ideological work, while putting primary emphasis  on the indoctrination in the principle of the chuche idea. In  particular, we should concentrate greater efforts on  strengthening the indoctrination in class and the indoctrination  in collectivism.    By strengthening the cultural revolution in rural areas we  should constantly enhance the technological and cultural level  of the agricultural working people, should thoroughly establish  their tidiness in production and life, and should do away with  the disparity in the conditions of their cultural life between  urban and rural areas.    The task that we should carry out in the field of the rural  technological revolution is vast. We should further consolidate  the success in irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and  chemicalization that has already been achieved and should  further expand and develop it so that we can constantly enhance  the level of industrialization and modernization of agriculture.  In particular, we should develop the comprehensive mechanization  and chemicalization of the rural economy into a high level.  Along with this, we should develop agricultural science,  actively utilize its success, and thoroughly implement our  party's chuche-oriented farm method. Thus, we should make  agricultural production more scientific.    To carry out the difficult and vast tasks arising in  socialist rural construction today it is important to strengthen  urban support for rural areas. We should further enhance the  working class' revolutionary spirit, organizational spirit, and  cultural level and, thus, should see to it that the working  class further strengthen their leadership role in rural  construction. At the same time, we should guarantee by all means  industrial material and technological support for the rural  economy.    All industrial sectors should give priority to producing and  supplying fuel, energy, equipment, and materials required in  agricultural production and rural construction in conformity  with the demands of our party's agriculture-first policy. We  should brilliantly carry out the historic task of eliminating  the disparity between industry and agriculture in economic  management activities and of gradually converting ownership by  cooperative into ownership by all of the people on the basis of  the success gained in the three revolutions -- ideological,  technological, and cultural.    Practical experiences in our country clearly show that the  party's leadership becomes the lifeline of socialist rural  construction and overall socialist construction.    All party organizations should pay deep attention to rural  problems and vigorously organize and mobilize party members and  the working people into the struggle to implement our party's  great rural construction program. All rural party organizations  should substantially carry out the work of deeply explaining and  inculcating among party members and the agricultural working  people the profound ideologies and theories elucidated by the  great leader in his work.    An infinitely bright vista is being opened for our socialist  rural construction. We have the most correct socialist rural  construction program and the wise leadership of the party and  the leader [suryong].    Let all of us vigorously advance for the final solution of  the socialist rural problem and for the victory of socialism of  our own style by upholding the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song's historic letter and with the overflowing faith in  victory.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. -- Consumer associations should  not allow them-selves to be used by politicians and foreign  interests which may be competing against Malaysia, Prime  Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today.    Should this happen, the country and consumers would suffer,  he said at the launching of World Consumers day and an  anti-inflation campaign at Pusat Islam.    Dr Mahathir said knowledgeable consumers could become a  force  in influencing the market and controlling inflation, and  collectively, they could eradicate all kinds of unhealthy trade  practices.    "Together with the Government, they can act in a manner  which  will benefit them and save the country."    "The achievement of Vision 2020 (objectives) depends a lot  on  knowledge, responsible attitudes and the role of consumers --  that is all the people".    He said the Government would continue with its efforts to  fight inflation so that it would not adversely affect the  people's standard of living, especially the lower income group's.    He urged all parties to play their roles to control  inflation  and ensure the stability of the ringgit to protect the country's  economy. He said that if the economy collapsed, then everybody  -- the people, traders, banks, the Government as well as the  country -- would suffer. He said the lower income group, those  who did not have fixed income and pensioners were most  vulnerable to inflation.    Dr Mahathir said the Government had taken various measures  to  reduce the inflation rate to ensure the prosperity of consumers.  However, he said, the success of any Government policy would  depend on the cooperation of all parties.    "Inflation and consumer problems cannot be resolved by only  one party. It requires the involvement of all."    He said it was also important for them to understand the  mechanisms and effects of inflation and consumer problems in  order to play their role effectively. He said consumer groups  were important, not only as activists but also to disseminate  information on the matter. However, he said, consumer groups  should not allow costs to increase because of vague struggles  for consumer interest which sometimes contradicted with their  own interest.    Dr Mahathir said the time had come for Malaysian consumers  to  fully realise their role which, if properly undertaken, would  benefit all. He said consumers had tremendous power. Only by  deciding to buy or not to buy, consumers could cause businesses  to make profits or suffer losses, he added.    "When consumers are grouped in associations, their power  will  be so great that it will be beyond control, giving rise to the  desire to use it for other purposes."    Dr Mahathir said consumers possessed a "sharp weapon" and  urged them to be extremely careful with it because, if wrongly  used, it could be harmful to them.    "On the other hand, if the power is wisely and carefully  used, not only consumers will benefit but the country will also  prosper," he said, adding that a progressive nation would double  the benefits for its people. He said the Government had to take  certain measures to ensure that consumers were given adequate  protection. He said the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs  Ministry was in the process of drafting a "Consumer Protection  Bill" and a national consumer policy aimed at sefeguarding  consumer interests.    Dr Mahathir said the Government had also taken numerous  steps  to ensure that the country's rapid development was undertaken in  a situation where prices of goods and services were low and  stable as it believed that price stability was the key factor in  efforts towards sustainable development.    "A stringent financial policy has been implemented to  prevent  surplus reserves. This is to ensure that there would not exist  a situation where too much money is chasing after a limited  supply of goods."    Nevertheless, he said, after the economy recovered from the  1987 slowdown, the country had undergone rapid growth for six  consecutive years. He said the increase in money supply had  resulted in excess demand.    If the Consumer Price Index is anything to go by, inflation  has increased by 4.4 per cent in 1991 and 4.7 per cent in 1992,  which is the highest since 1982. There was a drop last year to  3.6 per cent but it increased in the first quarter of this year  by 4.5 per cent.    Dr Mahathir said that when there was inflation and the value  of money depreciated, the value of income would also decrease.  He said the easy way to overcome the reduction in the value of  income would be to increase salaries or profit margin. However,  he said, salary increase because of inflation would worsen the  situation and further reduce the value of the currency and  weaken the economy. He said Europe was currently facing serious  economic problems with unemployment rates of between 11 and 12  per cent.    "Meetings after meeting of the Group of Seven countries have  not been able to overcome the problem".    "Now they plan to force developing countries to impose the  minimum wage rate so that their unemployment problem can be  overcome".    He said the countries were more willing to see workers in  developing countries suffer to protect their high standard of  living. He said the wages of workers in this country should be  increased, but it should be carried out carefully so that the  nation would not lose its competitive edge and suffer from  inflation.    "The employment of foreigners was not the way to overcome  the  problem. The more effective way would be to increase the  productivity of local workers through education, improving  production and management systems and the use of robots and  automation or move to idustries which are more capital, knowlede  and skill-intensive."    Also present at the function were Domestic Trade and  Consumer  Affairs Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar and his deputy, Datuk  Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir.</p>

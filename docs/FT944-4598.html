			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow little changed after volatile day Wall Street US share prices closed nearly flat after a volatile day that saw stocks buffeted by negative news and first cheered, then depressed, by climbing bond prices, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.03 at 3,745.95. Secondary indices fell modestly. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.21 to 453.11, the American SE composite was off 1.24 at 431.01 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 4.48 to 741.23. NYSE volume amounted to 300m shares. The Dow dropped by nearly 20 points in early trading before heading into positive territory near midday. Analysts speculated that the drop might have been due to the announcement late on Monday by Fidelity Investments - the largest mutual fund company in the US - that its Magellan Fund would not make a previously announced year-end distribution. Analysts worried that individual investors, who had flocked to mutual funds in recent years, might shift their investments to fixed income instruments, where yields were becoming increasingly attractive. Rising bond prices, however, initially pulled the stock market up, before exerting some pull on assets, thereby pushing shares to the session's lows late in the afternoon. The Dow fell more than 25 points before program trading kicked in and brought the average up just above Monday's close at the end of the day. The late-morning resignation of Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen went all but unnoticed by the market because the move had been widely anticipated by investors. Among individual shares, BankAmerica lost Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 40 3/8 after an analyst at Paine-Webber downgraded the shares to 'neutral' from 'buy' on the basis of slower than expected loan growth. Mr Lawrence Cohn also cut his 1994 earnings estimate by 15 cents to Dollars 5.35 per share. Other banking stocks were mixed. Chase Manhattan Bank edged up Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 and Citicorp firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 , while Bank of New York was Dollars  1/8 softer at Dollars 27 3/4 and First Chicago slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 46 3/8 . Borden shed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 3/8 after the group rejected overtures from Mr Paul Kazarian, a would-be suitor for the beleaguered company. High-technology shares were mixed. IBM gained Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 71 5/8 , Compaq Computer rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 , Apple Computer put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 1/2 and Dell Computer hardened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 . Hewlett-Packard lost Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 97 1/2 , Digital Equipment fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 and Unisys eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 9 1/8 . Canada Fears of rising interest rates drove Toronto stocks down but the market ended well above the day's worst after moderate trading. Year-end tax-loss selling was also contributing to weakness in the market. The TSE 300 composite index, down nearly 40 points at one stage, finished 17.12 off at 4,079.44. Declines outpaced rises by 488 to 284 after volume of 59m shares. Eleven of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by conglomerate, oil, industrial products and financial stocks. Gold, transportation and real estate shares posted gains.</p>

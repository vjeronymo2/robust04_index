			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: St Ives static with Pounds 10.1m St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, yesterday reported static interim profits reflecting tough conditions in its core magazine and book printing businesses. The company, which prints titles like Which, Marketing Week and the Tatler, announced unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m for the six months to January 31 on turnover ahead to Pounds 109.1m (Pounds 108m). The results exceeded expectations and the shares gained 4p to 233p. Operating profits increased slightly to Pounds 10m (Pounds 9.8m) and would have been higher still without Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 300,000) of redundancy costs and Pounds 300,000 of bad debt provisions. Earnings held steady at 7.3p. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. The re-equipment programme, which has cost Pounds 130m over the last five years, is now largely complete.</p>

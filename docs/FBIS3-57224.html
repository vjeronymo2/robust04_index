The  plan for their organizational development, which consists of  three stages, is starting to be implemented.    The plan has been designed through the end of 1995. The  independent state's Army will finally acquire its own budget.  The minister confirmed that by that time the Ukrainian Armed  Forces will have a strength of 450,000 men. The Main Staff is  being transformed into the General Staff, although the general  complained of a certain shortage of cadres, particularly in the  operational-strategic component. He reported that foreign  experience, including Russia's, had been taken into account in  the process of forming the General Staff.    Vitaliy Radetskyy described as correct the decision on the  nuclear weapons located on Ukrainian territory. He emphasized,  however, that Ukraine is a space rocket power, since it is  capable of manufacturing its own rocket to put a satellite into  orbit. The minister said that Ukraine must create modern  deterrent forces equipped with highly accurate weapons.    Vitaliy Radetskyy drew his audience's attention to the  problem of reducing conventional arms in accordance with the  1990 all-European treaty. He believes that these quotas are  rather too low now, after the breakup of the USSR. Not only for  Ukraine but also for Russia, particularly on the southern flank  of its defense. The minister proposed two ways out of the  impasse: a revision of the accords or the creation of new types  of arms. In artillery, for example, if the reductions affect  guns with a caliber of 100 mm and above, then guns with a  caliber of 99 mm should be put into production.    The minister described the problem of the Black Sea Fleet as  very complex. He declared: "It is closely connected with the  situation in Crimea. I, a Ukrainian citizen, believe that there  can only be one president in our state. I believe that it will  be harder to find the solution here than in the case of nuclear  weapons." Vitaliy Radetskyy ruled out the possibility of an  armed conflict in Crimea and also the possibility of Russia's  strong-arm intervention.    He also emphasized the nonbloc nature of Ukraine's military  policy, stressing that it has no intention of being a younger or  middle brother but intends to build equitable relations. He  cited as an example Uzbekistan, which is prepared to supply  cotton uniforms in exchange for Ukraine's repairing its military  hardware. Turkmenistan is prepared to pay with oil and gas in  exchange for the training of military cadres.</p>

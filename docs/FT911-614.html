			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Sears Sears is one of those British companies that specialises in the management of decline. Some parts of the business - such as sports clothing, continental retailing, the Selfridges catalogue - are growing. But much of the management's time is spent shrinking Charles Clore's shoe-shop legacy as tidily as possible. Last year, tidiness was not enough. UK shoe profits probably fell by more than half and menswear, the other problem sector, incurred a loss. Meanwhile, the company's ability to make money from property is suffering: a quarter of the drop in pre-tax profit came from lower disposal surpluses. The strength of the property portfolio shows up, however, in an unchanged valuation. That reflects the helpful cushion of an undervalued Selfridges; but it also reflects the solidity of all those shop-fronts. In the longer term, however, a giant question mark over the future of high street shopping lessens the stock's appeal as an asset play, weakened further by the imminent ERM-induced slowdown in inflation. Sears itself thinks the high street, gravely threatened only a year or so ago, has been reprieved by the way the recession has choked off out-of-town developments. Just as well. With its lure as an income stock threatened by some heavy hints about dividend policy, and no sign yet of an upturn in business, the share price needs all the help it can get. If there are any potential bidders left, they need not worry that the first-quarter rally has priced Sears out of reach. It is still only 18 per cent up on its five-year low, touched last autumn; the FT-SE has risen half as far again.</p>

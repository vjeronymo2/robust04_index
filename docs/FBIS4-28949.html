			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The council of the  South Korean Subway Trade Union on Thursday called a press  conference and urged the puppet authorities to lift the wage  ceiling, according to a radio report.    The trade union warned that it would launch into a general  strike that would cause a total suspension of the operation of  railways and subways throughout South Korea in case the present  "regime" physically put down its demand as the past military  regimes had done.</p>

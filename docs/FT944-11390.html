			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / China turns up pressure in Gatt talks: Denying access to trade body could turn Beijing into wild gorilla, official warns Denying China access to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade could turn the country into a '900lb gorilla' at large in the world trading system, a senior Chinese official warned at the weekend. Professor Chu Xiangyin, dean of the School of International Trade and Economics, told the official Business Weekly newspaper that it would 'do no good for anyone' for China to be excluded from Gatt and its successor World Trade Organisation (WTO). He said large US companies would be hurt by China's exclusion since their investments would be afforded better protection under Gatt rules. China regards the US as the main stumbling block to its Gatt ambitions. Statements at the weekend by the professor and by a senior Chinese trade official indicate a tougher Chinese stance on Gatt accession, coinciding with the last phase of difficult negotiations. China has been negotiating Gatt issues bilaterally. The Gatt working party on China is expected to resume discussions in Geneva later this month for a final push on Beijing's application to rejoin. Both US and European Union officials say China has 'some way to go' before satisfying Gatt market liberalisation requirements. Ms Charlene Barshefsky, an assistant US Trade Representative, said last month that Beijing needed to 'step on the gas pedal' to become Gatt-consistent in time for the planned birth of the WTO on January 1. US officials want firmer commitments from China on tariff cuts, phasing out of non-tariff barriers and access for service organisations. The US is also demanding concrete action against widespread abuses of intellectual property rights, including counterfeiting of compact discs and computer software. One of China's top Gatt negotiators, called, in a newspaper interview, for 'high-level, strategic support and foresight' from the US over the issue. 'The US should take stock of its medium and long-term commercial benefits in China, not just the short-term ones,' he said. He urged US officials to give what he described as 'earnest consideration to three key questions.' These were: Is China's Gatt accession good for trade liberalisation advocated by the the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (Apec)? Is Gatt membership good for promoting China's reforms? And should China be brought within the new multilateral trading system from the beginning?' Ms Wu Yi, China's trade minister, and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, are scheduled to meet in Jakarta on November 12 during the Apec forum for what is expected to be crucial discussions on Gatt issues.

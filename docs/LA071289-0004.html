			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEUKMEJIAN KILLS PLAN TO SELL LAND  </P> <P> In a setback for Hawthorne officials and residents, Gov. George Deukmejian has  cut from the state's $49.3-billion budget a provision requiring the California  Department of Transportation to sell the city two parcels of property for  $200,000.  </P> <P> Caltrans, which claims that the properties are worth at least $3.3 million,  opposes the sale.  </P> <P> Provisions of the sale were set forth in a bill approved in June. The bill, by  Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Hawthorne), is to go before the state Senate  Transportation Committee on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The requirement that Caltrans sell the properties for $200,000 was contained in  the proposed state budget submitted to the governor in late June. In a memo  listing his cuts from the proposed budget, Deukmejian said Friday that sale of  the properties at below-market value would not be in the state's interest.  </P> <P> Residents of the affluent Holly Glen area of Hawthorne have urged the city to  acquire for parkland the 4.7-acre parcel known as the "Glasgow Strip." The  narrow, mile-long property alongside the San Diego Freeway has been used as a  dumping ground and become an eyesore and safety hazard, the Holly Glen  Taxpayers Assn. says.  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Khmer Rouge sets up new party THE leftist Khmer Rouge guerrilla group yesterday announced the formation of a new Cambodian political party which it said could participate in UN-sponsored elections next year if Khmer Rouge conditions were met. The Khmer Rouge has repeatedly violated a ceasefire and refused to take part in the elections. It has reaffirmed its opposition to the way the UN is implementing the Cambodian peace plan agreed by all parties last year. A statement from Khmer Rouge headquarters in Pailin on the Thai border, issued in Phnom Penh, said the new party was called the National Unity of Cambodia party. The main condition for the party's participation in the election scheduled for May is the same as the one previously adopted for the Khmer Rouge - the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. Vietnam says they were withdrawn in 1989 and the UN says it has no evidence of Vietnamese troops inside Cambodia. Mr Khieu Samphan was named leader of the new party; he is also leader of the party of democratic Kampuchea as the Khmer Rouge is officially known. The latest Khmer Rouge announcement is likely to be seen as a further attempt to play for time. UN officials are struggling to organise an election, which will exclude Khmer Rouge areas and take place with tens of thousands of men from the four main factions still under arms. Under the peace accord, most guerrillas and troops were supposed to be regrouped and disarmed before the election, but the Khmer Rouge has refused UN forces access to its territory and the disarmament process has stalled. Khmer Rouge guerrillas are disrupting UN efforts to register Cambodian voters, intimidating Cambodians and the UN electoral officials themselves.</p>

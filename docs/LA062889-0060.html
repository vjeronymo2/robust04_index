			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : PAUL MAZZIO AWARDED $3,000 FELLOWSHIP; BERRY GIG TO BENEFIT  CHILDRENS HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Trumpeter/fluegelhornist Paul Mazzio of North Hollywood has been awarded a 1989  Jazz Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts -- a $3,000 grant to  support the costs of making a demo recording.  </P> <P> The trumpeter was one of 18 applicants from the arts endowment's Western  Region, which includes California as well some of the Northwestern and  Southwestern states, and the only one from California to win a fellowship. In  all, 74 jazz musicians nationwide received fellowships, which totaled $450,000  and are given only to individuals.  </P> <P> In contrast to California, in the greater New York City region there were 42  musicians (out of 127 applicants) who received grants. One of these was pianist  Keith Saunders, former San Fernando Valley resident who currently lives in  Manhattan. Asked about this disparity, the arts endowment's acting director  Antoinette Handy said that "an insufficient number (of musicians) seem to be  applying" from the Western Region. "New York has more recipients since there's  a larger pool of applicants to draw from."  </P> <P> The applicants compete by tape in a blind judging, Handy noted.  </P> <P> This year's panel of judges included pianists Valerie Capers, Anthony Davis,  Roberta Davis and Judy Carmichal, reedmen Richie Cole and Paul Jeffery and  bassist Bill Lee. "In designing the panel, we're very careful about region,  gender, race and ethnicity," Handy said. "And," she emphasized, "We're most  careful about expertise."  </P> <P> For detailed information on applying, write NEA, 1100 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.,  Washington, D.C. 20506, or call (202) 682-5522.  </P> <P> AIDING CHILDRENS HOSPITAL: When Bill Berry leads his Ellington All-Stars in one  of four "Concerts for a Sunday Afternoon" this Sunday at the Joslyn Community  Center in Manhattan Beach -- all of which benefit Childrens Hospital of Los  Angeles -- he'll be talking, as well as playing, his way through the show.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do an intimate concert series (the Joslyn seats 350 people) in  which the audience got to hear some varied music (coming shows feature music  from India and the Los Angeles Cello Quartet) and also heard the performers  explain what they're doing or tell anecdotes," said musician Brad Dechter, one  of the series' producers.  </P> <P> "I've been at concerts at the Music Center where performers talked to the  audience and these explanations and demonstrations really enhanced the  performance, making it much more enjoyable," said Dechter, a saxophonist and  composer who co-wrote and orchestrated the recent Nick Castle film, "Taps" and  has scored episodes of "Moonlighting."  </P> <P> Dechter -- who is producing the series along with his wife, Maureen Smith  Dechter and Robin Smith -- chose Childrens Hospital as the beneficiary of the  concerts for personal reasons. "The staff there diagnosed a major disease in  our son, Graham, and eventually cured him," he said. "My wife and I are forever  grateful and were looking for a way to give something back to the hospital," he  said.  </P> <P> Tickets for the Berry concert, which begins at 3 p.m., are $20, or two for $30.  Information: (213) 376-6170.  </P> <P> *** 1/2 Joe Sample's "Spellbound" (Warner Bros.) sits atop the contemporary  jazz charts for good reason. The pianist's style is a listenable mix of  earthiness and sweetness and here he provides a balanced program, from the  dancing title track to the bluesy "All God's Children." Vocals from Al Jarreau,  Michael Franks and Take 6 spice things up; the latter group shines on "U Turn,"  which, while philosophical in nature, happily eschews the group's usual gospel  slant.  </P> <P> Records are rated from one to five stars. ***** means a swinging must-have for  the jazz lover, * means save your pennies, Benny.  </P> <P> </P></p>

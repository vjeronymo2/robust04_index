			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Ali Altas said that Indonesia is  worried about the indecisive attitude shown by the United  Nations and NATO toward the Serbs in Gorazde, Bosnia. He said  that the United Nations had declared Gorazde a safe haven and  that no party could interfere there. Therefore, according to  the resolution, the United Nations and NATO should take firm  action against the Serbs for violating the United Nations  resolution several times.    Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that the Foreign Affairs  Department is continuously monitoring the situation in Gorazde  and is making efforts to seek the release of five Indonesian  military observers taken hostage by the Serbs. He said the  worrying situation in Bosnia does not change Indonesia's wish to  send health officials or other military observers to Bosnia.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / EC poll concludes lack of unified currency obstacle to single market Lack of harmonisation in tax and business law is the chief obstacle to the working of the single market, according to a poll of senior EC company executives, writes Tony Jackson, Industry Editor. The next biggest obstacle is the lack of a single currency. In a survey of European chairmen and managing directors by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, 87 per cent thought it important the Maastricht Treaty should be ratified. The treaty's most beneficial aspect was seen as the move to economic and monetary union. The biggest drawback was seen as the risk of extended EC powers.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Decline in earnings from sports goods cuts Grampian Holdings to Pounds 2.45m A COLLAPSE in first-half earnings from sports goods reduced Grampian Holdings' profit before tax and exceptional items by 40 per cent. The Scottish mini-conglomerate's share price, which stood at 207p less than a year ago, fell 16p to a five-year low of 90p yesterday. Pre-tax profit declined from Pounds 4.12m to Pounds 2.45m before an exceptional profit of Pounds 8.34m on the Pounds 16.3m sale of Mitre to Genesco, of the US. Turnover slipped to Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 68.3m). In the continuing businesses, pre-tax profit was 28 per cent down at Pounds 2.44m (Pounds 3.37m) on sales of Pounds 63.6m (Pounds 60.7m). Mitre's contribution was only Pounds 10,000 compared with Pounds 749,000. Sports goods accounted for the main decline in ongoing activities, making only Pounds 160,000 profit compared with Pounds 1.1m - although that was helped by Pounds 400,000 of plant and machinery sales. Profits roughly halved in golf gear and at Patrick, the French supplier of football boots. Mr David McGibbon, finance director, said: 'Margins came under pressure as retailers destocked and looked for deals.' Animal pharmaceuticals, the largest division, increased sales to Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 20.3m) with the help of an acquisition. But pre-tax profit was flat at Pounds 3.06m (Pounds 3.03m). Mr Bill Hughes, chairman, said volumes had fallen in some of Grampian's niche agricultural markets, such as sheep dip. Demand from poultry and fish producers had been weakened by imports. The offseting factor was an improved performance in Australia. Retailing, namely tourist mill shops, repeated its seasonal loss of Pounds 1.2m. Transport saw pre-tax profit inch ahead to Pounds 942,000 (Pounds 922,000). Mr Hughes said that pharmaceuticals and sports goods had remained under pressure in the third quarter and the tipper side of transport had also weakened. Retailing had enjoyed a 12.4 per cent sales increase. Interest costs rose to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 2.1m) and year-end debt was expected to be Pounds 19m (Pounds 21m) after the first Pounds 12m of the Mitre payment and a Pounds 7m acquisition. Earnings per share fell to 2.61p (4.34p) before exceptionals and rose to 14.7p afterwards. The interim dividend is held at 1.7p. COMMENT Grampian triggered last year's bidding scramble for Macarthy, owner of the Savory &amp; Moore retail chain which eventually fell to Lloyds Chemists. In the wake of that ambitious attempt at a hostile bid, the headache has proved painful. In the continuing businesses, the former star performer, pharmaceuticals, is facing rationalisation and redundancy costs. Sports goods has been hit by recession and conditions for transport are worsening. In the accounts, questions have been raised about profits from disposals, capitalisation of R and D costs and the underlying trading performance of what has been an acquisitive company. The share price ought to find a floor at its present yield of 8.1 per cent and prospective p/e of 10.5, on an Pounds 8m pre-tax profit forecast. At this level it begins to present a buying opportunity. But with another tough year in prospect, the potential for recovery is long term.</p>

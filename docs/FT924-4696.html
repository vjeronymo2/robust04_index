			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Flotation benefits bolster Kenwood KENWOOD Appliances, the kitchen equipment company, yesterday reported a 10 per cent fall in interim operating profits after difficult trading conditions in July, the month after the group floated on the Stock Exchange. At the pre-tax level profits in the six months to September 30 increased from Pounds 3.11m to Pounds 3.89m as the group benefited from a much lower interest charge after the float. The result was struck on sales marginally down at Pounds 45.3m. Operating margins were one percentage point lower at 11.6 per cent. Earnings per share, on a pro-forma basis, were down from 10.4p to 9.2p. The company is paying a 1.5p interim dividend. Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said Kenwood was hoping to pursue a progressive dividend policy and cover the payment 2.5 times. Had it been paying a dividend in the year to March 1992 it would have been 7.5p. Sales in the UK market, which account for about a third of the total, held up with the introduction of new models. Sales of the Kenwood Chef, on which the company was originally built, remained firm and sales of a new Ultrascreen electronic water filter had a good early response. In Scandinavia sales continued to be depressed, but sterling's depreciation before and after retreat from the ERM had benefited margins as Kenwood invoices in foreign curren-cies. COMMENT After October's profits warning, Kenwood's trading slide has halted-it is now just another company selling quality products to a public that has lost the appetite to consume. Shareholders can thank the Chancellor's sterling devaluation without which full year profits would have been Pounds 1.4m lower. It is difficult, however, to see where else exciting growth will come from in the short term or how the company is to return to a premium rating. Kenwood will enjoy any recovery in the UK - perhaps more than purveyors of larger ticket consumer goods - as it has strong market position and brands. But who knows when that recovery will be. China holds out more hope since Kenwood acquired cheap manufacturing capacity and an entree into the local market with the acquisition of Tricom. But that, too, will have long term rather than immediate benefit. Nevertheless, with full-year profits forecast at Pounds 9.5m, or 17.2p of earnings, there is probably room for price recovery given the kicker Kenwood should continue to receive from currencies.</p>

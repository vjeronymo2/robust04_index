			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates ease CASH rates in the sterling money market eased yesterday as dealers again took the view that there could be a cut in UK base rates in the immediate future. On Monday, sterling's dramatic fall on the foreign exchanges to a low of DM2.3690 made dealers very bearish about the possibility of a cut. However, the currency rebounded in Asia and Europe yesterday, peaking at DM2.4548 at the start of London trading. This triggered renewed speculation of a rate cut being announced to coincide with the chancellor's speech at the Conservative Party conference on Thursday. Views on whether the government could cut rates were mixed. One clearing bank dealer said that the government could not afford another cut unless sterling first rebounded above DM2.50. Another suggested that a  1/2 point cut in rates could even trigger a sterling rally because the small size would show the markets that the government had not thrown caution to the winds. Either way, dealers remained confused because of the uncertainty about the government's economic strategy. One discount house dealer said: 'We ought to have 8 or 8 1/2 per cent base rates before the end of the year. What we don't know is when the cuts will come.' Three month sterling cash closed at 9 1/8 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 9 3/16 per cent. One month money also closed softer at 9 5/16 per cent from a previous close of 9 1/2 per cent. The December short sterling contract also registered the more favourable outlook on rates closing up 7 basis points at 91.76. The Bank of England's discount house operations reflected the paucity of bills held by discount houses and clearing banks after the huge shortages that have followed the Bank's 'Black Wednesday' intervention. A shortage of Pounds 1.4bn proved to be 'sticky' and late assistance of Pounds 435m was offered. The Bank purchased Pounds 124m in a repurchase agreement (repo) at 8 15/16 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 1.5bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 23m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 53m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 136m in a 'repo.' In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 525m of Band 1 bank bills.</p>

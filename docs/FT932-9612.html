			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / 1,000 Lloyd's Names face Pounds 300,000 call ABOUT 1,000 Names could eventually be asked to pay an average of up to Pounds 300,000 each because of far heavier-than-expected losses from the storms, explosions and oil spills that hit Lloyd's underwriters in the late 1980s. Many of the Names - the individuals whose assets back the insurance market - already face financial ruin. The Names were members of Rose Thomson Young syndicate 255, one of the leading underwriters of catastrophe reinsurance business in the late 1980s. Even before yesterday's projections the syndicate was known to face some of the worst losses at the insurance market and was one of nine syndicates whose losses have been subjected to independent investigation by Lloyd's. A report to be published this week on syndicate 255 concludes that there were 'errors of judgment' and the lack of 'a full appreciation of the market' in which it was operating. The report, prepared by Mr Timothy Boatman, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says there was no malpractice. Syndicate 255 closed at the end of 1991 and RTY appointed new managers last year. Following an extensive examination the new team reported yesterday that cumulative losses between 1988 and 1990 would be at least Pounds 145.7m, Pounds 60m worse than feared. These losses could eventually rise to a maximum of Pounds 362m. By contrast, the syndicate's capacity (capital base) amounted to Pounds 27.9m in 1988, Pounds 34.14m in 1989 and Pounds 13.06m in 1990. Names, who have already been asked to pay more than Pounds 130m, will face an additional cash call of 62 per cent (Pounds 6,200 for each Pounds 10,000 traded) for 1989 and 136 per cent for 1990 in July. Further cash calls of 19 per cent for 1988, 66 per cent for 1989 and 12 per cent for 1990 will follow in January next year. Names who have been unable to fund cash calls to date will be asked for more to cover exchange losses and interest charges (17 per cent for 1988 and 50 per cent for 1989). Mr Vernon Ashford, RTY finance director, said: 'We are not expecting the Names that do pay claims to subsidise those who do not.' Mr Stephen Edwards, underwriter, said the syndicate had been forced to create additional reserves because some reinsurance policies had been exhausted or proved to be deficient. In addition, claims from the European hurricane of 1987, three large petrochemical explosions and hurricane Hugo in 1989 had been heavier than expected. Claims from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 could also be higher because Exxon is seeking to recover a further Dollars 700m (Pounds 446m) under policies reinsured at Lloyd's.</p>

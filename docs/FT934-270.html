			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / China will allow market forces to set exchange rate: Official yuan rate abolished as Beijing steps up reforms China underlined its determination to press ahead with market-oriented economic reforms by announcing yesterday that the country's exchange rates would be unified from January 1. The present officially set rate for the yuan will be abolished. The new single rate, expected to be based on that already quoted in 'swap centres', where most foreign exchange transactions take place, will be controlled by the state but will float and reflect market forces. 'This unitary and controlled floating exchange rate system based on market demand and supply will replace the current dual-track system,' said the central bank, quoted by the official Xinhua news agency. The government had promised to reform the currency in 1994. The decision to move earlier than expected suggests that Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy and central bank governor, is retaining his authority to push through reforms in the face of vested interests within the communist system. Fundamental changes to China's tax system are also being introduced from January 1 even though mechanisms for central tax collection are not in place. The changes include new tax-sharing arrangements between the central government and the provinces and introduction of a nationwide consumption tax. Reforms of the banking system are also in progress and deregulation of prices is continuing. Although the new rate for the yuan is not yet known, the currency reform is likely to mean a substantial technical devaluation. Yesterday the official rate stood at Yn5.8 to the US dollar, against Yn8.7 in the swap centres. In practice, however, swap centres already account for four fifths of China's trade-related transactions, according to Chinese officials. To exercise control over the floating exchange rate, the central bank is likely to intervene in swap market trading - as it did this summer when it wanted to narrow a widening gap between the official and swap rates. State-owned enterprises, heavily subsidised in being permitted to use the official rate when importing goods, have increasingly been forced by the government into using the swap market rate. Nevertheless, the currency change will affect state industries - 37 per cent of which are losing money - and may also worsen inflation, which is running above 20 per cent in big cities. Officials said foreign investors, who have had to register capital in new ventures at the official rate but repatriate their profits at the swap market rate, would benefit from yesterday's decision. Ms Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation, said the reform would assist China's efforts to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The unification of rates means that Foreign Exchange Certificates, the currency foreigners in China are required to use, will be phased out. FECs are purchased at the official rate. No more will be printed. Economists emphasised that the latest reforms do not mean that the yuan will become freely convertible, a step likely to be some years away. The central bank last night issued complex new rules on access to foreign exchange. Patten attacks China on Basic Law Page 3 Editorial Comment Page 11</p>

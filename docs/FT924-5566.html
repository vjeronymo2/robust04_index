			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Nine engineering companies will close if pit closures go ahead NINE engineering companies will close and more than 4,500 jobs be lost if the pit closure programme goes ahead, according to the AEEU, the largest union in engineering. Mr Bill Jordan, the union's president, told the Commons employment committee yesterday: 'In normal times it would be difficult to sustain the cutbacks and redundancies the proposed pit closures would inflict on its suppliers. But at this time, in the midst of the longest-running recession since World War Two, such avoidable damage is the last thing that British industry needs.' Basing his estimates on reports from companies where his union had members, Mr Jordan asked the committee to keep confidential a detailed analysis of the companies affected. He said the companies did not want to be identified for commercial reasons. Mr Jordan said suggestions that Magnox nuclear power stations should be run down faster to allow more room in the market for coal-fired stations would result in thousands of nuclear power workers losing their jobs. British Coal should seek to export its coal, which was the cheapest in Europe, he said.</p>

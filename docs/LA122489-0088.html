			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POSTAL SERVICE MIXES TECHNOLOGY WITH ANTIQUITY;  </P> <P> MAIL: AUTOMATION WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPROVE SERVICE. BUT EFFORTS TO AUTOMATE HAVE  BEEN PLAGUED BY POOR MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING, COSTLY CHANGES OF DIRECTION AND  SCANDAL.  </P> <P> At the gigantic mail-processing center in New Orleans, 22 clerks sit in front  of pigeonholes, the kind used 214 years ago by Benjamin Franklin's office,  slowly examining each letter before placing it into its proper, numbered niche.  </P> <P> Mail handlers unload letter trays from trucks, wheeling them inside where  others haul, lift, toss and sort mail all night and half the day.  </P> <P> In the middle of this scene from the 1950s is an island of innovation, the U.S.  Postal Service's link to the 21st Century: new, electronic sorting machines  that flush 28,000 letters an hour past blinking electronic eyes and into one of  100 steel traps, each representing a carrier's route.  </P> <P> But the sorted letters must be picked up again by human clerks and delivered by  human carriers. In the course of being sorted and delivered, a typical letter  is touched by 14 humans' hands.  </P> <P> Decades after its first stab at modernizing, the Postal Service -- a  $41-billion-a-year, government-owned corporation with more employees than the  U.S. Army -- has undergone the most expensive, traumatic technological change  in its history. The change has not yet been palpably beneficial.  </P> <P> Having poured $526 million into new sorting machines and other technology in  the last 12 months, the Postal Service faces a $1.6-billion loss this year,  declining business growth, lagging worker productivity and raids on its most  lucrative business by private competitors.  </P> <P> "We've got to capture the savings dollar-for-dollar that these machines  represent or we can kiss the Postal Service as we know it goodby," Robert  Setrakian, chairman of the Postal Board of Governors, told postmasters in  September.  </P> <P> 30-Cent Stamp Expected  </P> <P> Meantime, U.S. postal patrons can get ready to kiss the 25-cent stamp goodby.  As Postal Service costs continue to rise nearly 1 1/2 times as fast as  inflation, the board is prepared to raise postage rates again in 1991, probably  to 30 cents for a first-class letter.  </P> <P> First-class mail delivery performance was at a five-year low last year, and  complaints about late mail rose last summer by 35%, despite a sluggish 1%  growth in mail volume.  </P> <P> Automation was to be the service's hope for a turnaround. But efforts to  automate have been plagued by poor management and planning, costly changes of  direction, internal scandal and an inability to achieve the paramount goal of  moving the mail with fewer people.  </P> <P> With 822 new sorting machines like the one in New Orleans installed across the  country in the last two years, the post office's total work force declined by  only 1.1%. In the area most affected by automation, mail processing, the worker  pool actually increased by 5,131 people, according to postal figures.  </P> <P> Work-force reductions are complicated by union contracts that provide postal  workers with wages and benefits worth about $20 an hour and contain strict work  and assignment rules, strong seniority rights, restrictions on the use of  part-time employees and bans on layoffs.  </P> <P> The New Orleans post office is one example of how poor planning from above and  labor restrictions from below can play havoc with efforts to cut costs.  </P> <P> Within an eight-month period, the facility received seven new 60-foot-long  letter-sorting machines, had two others taken away and another four already in  the plant retrofitted with new equipment. To make room, concrete walls were  knocked down overnight and some of the new equipment was used to hold down  still-drying floor tile.  </P> <P> Despite drastic decreases in the volume of mail handled, the service had to  hire additional employees: technicians to run the new machines. Postal managers  were unable to lay off people whose jobs were made redundant by technology.  Instead, they transferred employees to areas where there was more work and  adjusted work hours to better coincide with the new mail flow.  </P> <P> Morale Plummets  </P> <P> The changes affected workers' personal lives and depressed morale. "You're  talking upheaval," said postmaster Charles K. Kernan, general manager of the  New Orleans division.  </P> <P> About 550 processing clerks on the late-night shift downtown were told to begin  work at midnight instead of 10 p.m. This meant a 10% pay cut because more of  the shift occurred in daylight hours. The change also made it impossible for  many parents to get home in time to send their children to school.  </P> <P> Wayne Cola, who works the letter-sorting machine, said his three children now  must spend the night with his mother-in-law because he gets off later in the  morning. "The kids don't like it," he said.  </P> <P> Postal officials in New Orleans also centralized mail processing so they would  have more mail to feed into the machines. As a result, 22 of the 34 manual  clerks in a nearby suburb were forced into the downtown processing center  because there was no work for them elsewhere. They were put in one corner of  the facility where they spend the day under-employed, sorting letters by hand.  </P> <P> "The mail is not coming in here so we have to slow down" to avoid looking idle,  said C. J. Roux, a postal clerk. "We don't want to work ourselves out of a  job."  </P> <P> The transfer infuriated some longtime employees, who had thought that they  would be protected in desirable jobs because of their seniority.  </P> <P> "They shuffled me away like an old piece of furniture," said Alvin Coulon, a  27-year veteran of the post office and one of those transferred to the midnight  shift in New Orleans. "Nobody knew nothing" about the change. "Nobody can do  nothing about it," he said.  </P> <P> With more mail being sorted in processing offices, the goal across the country  is to have letter carriers spend more time on the street, with larger  quantities to carry. But some carriers are not happy about that possibility and  they, too, admit to slowing their work pace.  </P> <P> "They know the future," Joseph Williams, manager of the Carrollton post office  in a section of New Orleans, said of his disgruntled carriers.  </P> <P> Although automation was planned for years, some offices were caught off-guard  when it finally arrived. For example, last fall a planned upgrade of some of  the sorting machines in the main District of Columbia processing center, which  serves Washington, as well as Montgomery and Prince George's counties in  Maryland, caused a drop in on-time deliveries from 93% to 79% because postal  managers were unable to adjust to the temporary shutdown of some equipment.  </P> <P> The standard is 95% on-time arrival.  </P> <P> The most advanced machine in the current automation plan is called a  "multi-line optical character reader." Its electronic eye can read a five-or  nine-digit typed or printed ZIP code and up to four lines of address. The  machine translates the address or ZIP code into a bar code symbol, which it  sprays on the envelope, then sorts to a particular tray that represents a  carrier's route. Bar code machines read and sort envelopes that contain the  codes.  </P> <P> Officials point to San Diego as a model of the way automation should work. The  success there is due largely to the innovative work of local managers who  devised their own strategy for using the machines and, more important, figured  out how to stop the workers from feeling threatened by the change.  </P> <P> "It's like a rock in the water," said San Diego division postmaster and general  manager Margaret Sellers. "You start out with a ripple; if you don't do  planning, you get a tidal wave."  </P> <P> First, Sellers created an automation team, with five subcommittees to manage  the change and to sell it to employees. When she received the first sorting  machine, she put it on display at a post office open house and then persuaded  union leaders to hold meetings and to walk the workroom floor explaining to  workers what the machines could and could not do.  </P> <P> "Our reaction at first was against it," said postal clerk Gary Pattee, an  eight-year veteran. "It was hard to sell it to us because we thought we were  out of here."  </P> <P> Instead, Pattee, like other workers, was encouraged to learn how to operate the  mechanical letter-sorting machines, and he was paid for doing it on his own  time. Now his skills and his position are more flexible.  </P> <P> Fast-growing San Diego has been insulated from some of the problems experienced  elsewhere because redundant employees are used to handle an increasing volume  of mail. Still, the office has been able to reduce the number of manual sorting  clerks by 10% during the first year of automation.  </P> <P> The mission of the U.S. Postal Service is indisputably ambitious. Each day a  work force of more than 800,000 employees in 40,000 post offices and processing  centers across the country flies, ships, trucks and carries an estimated 537  million pieces of mail to 92 million households and 7.3 million businesses.  </P> <P> The United States alone produces 40% of all the mail in the world and has kept  the cost of its first-class stamp well below that of every other major  capitalist nation.  </P> <P> Postal officials are lobbied by no fewer than 70 industry groups and must  negotiate compensation and working conditions with four labor unions and three  managers' organizations. Once a repository for political patronage jobs, its  relationship with Capitol Hill today consists of 24 annual oversight hearings  before committees in both houses of Congress.  </P> <P> Its work has been made no easier by constant turnover at the top -- there have  been four postmasters general in the last five years.  </P> <P> The history of the service's efforts to automate is one that "makes me want to  cry when I rehear it," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin.  </P> <P> D. H. Shepard first invented an "apparatus for reading" addresses in 1951,  according to records of the Patent Office. A handwritten memoir by Omer M. Long  in the postal archives shows that during the late 1950s and 1960s the then-Post  Office Department had the lead in optical character readers.  </P> <P> "We were visited regularly by the foreign engineers trying to learn the state  of the art," Long wrote. "Unfortunately, management . . . changed so often . .  . (or was) totally unsuited for the position . . . that we lost all respect for  lack of performance in the field."  </P> <P> Lawrence F. O'Brien, postmaster general in 1965-68, called the post office's  1960s research and development investment "laughable."  </P> <P> In 1978, then-Postmaster General William F. Bolger announced the invention of a  nine-digit ZIP code, which made it possible for new machines to read an  envelope and sort it to a particular carrier's route. Reacting to opposition  from commercial mailers and the public, Congress put a three-year hold on the  idea. When the nine-digit code finally became policy, many fewer mailers used  it than predicted.  </P> <P> There were other problems as well. In one 18-month period, the Postal Service  gave $25 million in rate discounts to business mailers for using a nine-number  ZIP code that the new machines could process, but then failed to process them  on the machines, according to the General Accounting Office.  </P> <P> In 1982, then-President Ronald Reagan appointed Peter E. Voss to the Postal  Board of Governors. In 1986, Voss pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from a  Michigan lobbying firm for his help in trying to steer a $250-million  sole-source contract for optical scanners to Recognition Equipment Inc., a  Texas firm.  </P> <P> Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the Voss scandal set the agency back  18 months in its effort to automate.  </P> <P> Foreign firms now dominate the field of mail-automating equipment. Contracts  for many of the newly installed machines went to a Texas licensee of a West  German firm, AEG Telefunken.  </P> <P> This month, reaffirming its long-term commitment to automation, the Postal  Board of Governors endorsed a five-year strategic plan that will cost more than  $5 billion. Frank has promised to keep costs 2% below inflation, to achieve  historic productivity gains and to increase revenues.  </P> <P> "This is not a speedboat here. It doesn't turn on a dime," Frank said in an  interview. "It is changing, it is slow, it is frustrating once in a while, but  so is every large corporation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Those Who Mail Most. . .  </P> <P> Cards and letters mailed in 1987.  </P> <P> United States: 82,642,680,000 (41%)  </P> <P> Japan: 17,052,890,000(8%)  </P> <P> U.K.: 13,568,100,000 (7%)  </P> <P> France: 10,699,900,000 (5%)  </P> <P> India: 10,332,810,000 (5%)  </P> <P> Soviet Union: 8,094,000,000 (4%)  </P> <P> W.

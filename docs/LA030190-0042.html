			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL DIVISION II/V SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> In the other Division II semifinal:  </P> <P> El Camino 63, San Pasqual 49 -- The record was already even. What El Camino  wanted to do was set it straight.  </P> <P> In previous meetings of the Avocado League rivals, San Pasqual and El Camino  each had won once. Trouble was, El Camino's first victory was considered by  many a fluke because San Pasqual was without the help of Erik Meek.  </P> <P> Then in the second game, and with Meek, San Pasqual won.  </P> <P> The third and most important meeting didn't disappoint, and the lopsided score  wasn't indicative of the the game up until the final eight minutes, during  which El Camino outscored San Pasqual, 29-18.  </P> <P> San Pasqual led, 31-30, with 2:20 to go in the third. But then El Camino's Jeff  Reeves scored on a layup, and the Wildcats never looked back.  </P> <P> Meek finished with 21 points for San Pasqual. El Camino was paced by Glenn  Ankton with 17.  </P> <P> Division V semifinals  </P> <P> Christian 57, Bishop's 50 -- Tony Clark had 18 of his game-high 40 points in  the third quarter as Christian, the No. 3-seeded team, pulled away from  second-seeded Bishop's at Santana High. The Patriots (15-11) advanced to the  final against top-seeded Calipatria Saturday morning at 11:30 at Golden Hall.  Bishop's finished 23-5.  </P> <P> Clark, the county's leading scorer, was "held" to four below his season  average, but at the end of the third quarter, Clark had 34 points, Bishop's 30.  </P> <P> Calipatria 47, Marian 39 -- David Oyama scored all of his nine points in the  first half as top-seeded Calipatria (21-3) took a 23-15 halftime lead at  Santana High. Cesar Romero had a game-high 13 points for top-seeded Calipatria  (21-3). Marian finished 10-16.  </P></p>

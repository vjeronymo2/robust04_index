			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- China's "Hope Project"  is due to get more help from Beijing, as the city started a  working group on Thursday [31 March] to take care of the matter.    The "Hope Project" aims to help dropouts to return to  primary  schools in poverty-stricken areas.    On March 8, the city launched a "Hope Project" donation  center in downtown Beijing, which so far has received 350,000  yuan in donations from some 4,000 citizens.    Beijing has been leading other Chinese regions in the amount  donated to the "Hope Project" ever since it was launched in 1990  to raise funds from society to help children in poor areas  return to classrooms and finish their primary school education.    Over the four years, the "Hope Project" has provided help to  549,000 children in 1,200 counties in 26 Chinese regions,  reaching across all of China except for Beijing, Shanghai,  Tianjin and Jiangsu.    The project has built 204 primary schools for poor areas and  given awards to 100 rural school teachers. It has also provided  special scholarships for 200 university students and 1,361  middle school students.    This year's theme for the "Hope Project" is "One Family  Helps  One Dropout", setting the goal for an urban family to donate 300  yuan to help a child finish five years of education.    The project plans to help one million children return to  classrooms in 1994.    [Beijing Central People's Radio Network in Mandarin at 1030  GMT on 1 April in its "National Hookup" program carries an  under-minute report on the "Hope Project" fund-raising drive in  Beijing, which says that "Beijing City leaders Chen Xitong, Li  Qiyan, Zhang Jianmin, and Wang Daming took the lead in donating  money to the newly founded Beijing donation center."]</p>

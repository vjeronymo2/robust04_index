			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Government statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a </F> Bundestag session in Bonn -- live]    [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Remembering  the historic importance of overcoming the division of the  European continent and the necessity to establish firm  foundations for the shape of the future Europe, the European  Union [EU] was founded, as the preamble of the Maastricht Treaty  says. It is open to European democracies that commit themselves  to the goals of the European Union. The current expansion by  four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries -- namely  Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria -- is the first one since  the end of the Cold War. Their accession to the European Union  will finally put an end to the competition of two West European  concepts for the future shaping of our continent.    The current model of the European Union, which is equipped  with common institutions, has managed to dominate over the idea  of a simple free trade zone. This is of extraordinary and  important significance for the future European system.  [applause]    Already, today the European Union forms the one anchor of  stability on our continent and reliably prevents the return of  nation states and changing coalitions to Europe. It stands for  a large single market, which multiplies the prosperity of all  member states and increases their international competitiveness,  and it stands for a Europe of solidarity that has set for itself  the goal of gradually harmonizing the differences in performance  and prosperity within the European Union.    These are sufficient reasons for many European democracies  to  press into this union. Therefore, the current round of  expansion will not and must not be the last one. [applause]    Its conclusion will prove that the European Union is capable  of acting on the basis of the treaty, which came into force on 1  November 1993. Being capable of action also means establishing  a consensus to ensure peace in freedom and prosperity on our  continent. The expansion will also -- and this is very  important -- give an encouraging signal to the reform  democracies in Central and East Europe that the European Union  is not a closed society of the rich and the secure. [applause]    This also makes it clear that the united Germany will not  remain the eastern border country of the European Union. It is  moving into the center of Europe again, politically as well.  [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the acceptance of the three Nordic  countries and of Austria into the European Union is an essential  step on the path toward reestablishing the balance in Europe.  The Federal Government has never identified itself with the  concept of a western or southwestern union. It has always  committed itself to the entire Europe. [applause]    Just as in the 1980's, we acted as the advocate of the  expansion to the south and emphatically -- I stress the term  emphatically for a special reason -- came out in favor of  membership for Spain, Portugal, and Greece. From the very  beginning we have energetically supported the desire of Austria,  Sweden, Finland, and Norway to become members. The current  round of negotiations is not taking place at the cost of  Europe's southern countries. [applause]    Just like all other member states and the new members, they  also will benefit from the fact that the European Union will be  strengthened in political, economic, and cultural terms by the  addition of four tested democratic states with efficient  national economies that are committed to free world trade.    It is correct that the new members will better balance the  European Union within itself, and it is obvious -- and we said  this in Brussels during the negotiations and I am saying this  here again -- that for Germany, in its central location, this is  a not an unimportant benefit.    Ladies and Gentlemen, during the current negotiations, the  Federal Government has primarily been guided by the interest in  strengthening the European Union and the stability of the entire  Europe. German and European interests are identical on these  questions. Germany's future is in Europe.    Security and the prosperity of our country are linked  inseparably with European unification. A failure of these  negotiations, a stalling of the European unification somewhere  in the middle, would harm all Europeans. [applause]    Membership negotiations began on 1 January 1993, and in  Norway's case on 1 April 1993. It is a really great achievement  of all governments involved and of the Brussels Commission that  these negotiations have practically been concluded with three  states in approximately one year and that we are on the verge of  a breakthrough with Norway. If the Council session next Tuesday  [15 March] achieves this goal -- and the Federal Government will  once again do everything possible to achieve this goal -- then  there is a good chance that all four countries will be accepted  into the European Union on time, on 1 January 1995, just as we  planned. [applause]    I would like to expressly note that Germany cordially  welcomes all four countries as close partners in the expanded  European Union. [applause]    They enrich and strengthen the European Union. With the  appropriate and necessary modesty, I would like to note that we  certainly would not have come this far without the Federal  Government's contribution. [applause]    I feel myself confirmed and justified that we pushed for  speed, thus producing and passing on the necessary momentum, and  helped as mediators. On this occasion, I would like to thank  all those in the Federal Government and beyond who contributed  to getting this far. Over the past weeks, we went through  marathons that were unique even for Brussels.    The goal is right within our reach. It simply must not be  that this expansion, which is so important for all of Europe,  fails because of a few thousand tonnes of codfish. This cannot  be right. [applause]    I stated during the negotiations at night that it really can  not be right that we are negotiating and talking about  dimensions, which amount to 2, 3, or 4 million ECU. Norway's  accession must not fail because of that. [applause]    Nor must it be that the process of European unification  suffers a serious setback because of internal problems among old  members. No one should be deceived -- a failure of the  membership negotiations would give rise to a serious crisis for  Europe. Therefore, from this position, I appeal to the Spanish  and, above all, also to the British Government to contribute  constructively to achieving this goal that is so close now on  Tuesday. [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the expanded European Union will  constitute the largest market in the world -- with 370 million  people and a clearly higher economic capacity than the United  States or Japan. Two out of three German jobs in exports depend  on trade with this economic area. I say once again here in the  German Bundestag: There is no large industrial and economic  country that can be compared with Germany in terms of being  dependent on one single region -- namely, Europe in this case.  One must tell the Germans this again and again.  [unintelligible interjections, applause]    From Germany's viewpoint, expansion is also advantageous  because the ideas of the countries that want to join the  European Union in terms of environmental protection and social  safeguards largely correspond with our own. In addition, all  new members -- perhaps also Finland -- will be net payers. At  the beginning, this will not be fully effective because the  European Union will help them with overcoming the difficult  problems at the beginning, but later on, it will be important.  In the medium term, the accession of economically strong  European neighbors will contribute to easing the burden on  Germany.    Ladies and Gentlemen, the participation of the four  countries in the development of the EU's foreign and security  policy will be an important advantage. Austria, Sweden, and  Finland, which have been neutral so far, also accept -- and this  is very important -- the foreign policy achievements of the  European Union without any if's, and's, or but's and commit  themselves to the goals set down in the treaty.    By the way -- and this should not be forgotten either --  they  have a very high foreign policy profile and a lot of experience,  in particular in the United Nations, regarding peacekeeping  operations. This will benefit the European Union and the  development of its own identity, especially in this field.  [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the Federal Government on 15 March  will  go to Brussels with the firm will to achieve a breakthrough with  Norway and a consensus on all other open questions. However, I  would also like to say very clearly, calmly, and in a  businesslike manner that its readiness for compromise hits its  limits where the success of the referendums or the approval of  the European Parliament are endangered. This would, for  instance, be the case of the threshold for the blocking minority  if the Council were to be put at such a low level that majority  decisions would be made considerably more difficult.    On 15 March, we want to formally conclude the negotiations  with all four countries and hope that all other partners will  act in the same spirit. [applause]    Time is of the essence if we still want to maintain 1  January  1995 as the date of accession. Before the treaties can be  signed, the European Parliament must approve them. From here, I  also appeal to its deputies to take the political significance  of the expansion into account and to deal speedily with the  treaties, regardless of the forthcoming new elections and  without any formalism. [applause]    I am sure -- and this also must be known and taken into  account by the European Parliament -- that this is extremely  important for the credibility of European policy, especially  before the European elections on 12 June. [applause]    In addition to the approval of the European Parliament and  the ratification of the membership treaties, a precondition for  accession on 1 January 1995 is a positive result of the  referendums in the would-be members. We should and must not  forget that, and it should particularly be kept in mind by our  partners during the talks on 15 March.    I am an optimist. The Nordic countries and Austria have  weighed the matter carefully. They know their future lies in  the European Union. They also know that they need not fear any  loss of national characteristics and domestic way of life. The  European Union stands for a Europe of variety, a Europe of the  citizens and the regions.    I would like to expressly thank the German Bundestag for the  constant support granted to the negotiating by the Federal  Government. The awareness -- in particular, at such difficult  negotiations, and they were and remain difficult -- that one is  able to act on the basis of a broad political consensus means  strength. I hope that the German Bundestag, which must agree to  the membership treaties, will also do its part so that we can  keep to the intended target date. It would be important for  Europe and it would be important also for Germany. Therefore,  we hope that the final breakthrough can be achieved on Tuesday.  [applause]</p>

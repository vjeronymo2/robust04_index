			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central  Committee, today greeted model party members selected from  central party and government departments and the Beijing  municipality as part of the 73rd anniversary of the founding of  the CPC, which falls on July 1.    Accompanied by Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao, both members of  the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee, and other senior party leaders, Jiang extended  festival greetings to the 652 outstanding party members and  advanced party workers present and posed for pictures with them.    The outstanding party members present today range from  intellectuals to workers and farmers. They have been awarded  for their efforts in different walks of life to push ahead with  reform, help promote economic development and safeguard  stability.    Meanwhile, they were lauded for striving to care for the  masses, resist or fight against corruption, or explore new means  for economic construction.    Over the past two years, a majority of the advanced and  model  workers selected were party members, according to the CPC  Central Committee.    Communist Party members have made up 88.1 percent of the  people who have received national May 1 medals, the highest  honor given to advanced workers on the first of May each year.  In 1993, 1.89 million party members were named "excellent party  members" by party committees at various levels.    Last year, over 50,000 party organizations were newly  established at grassroots and another 1.76 million people were  admitted to the Communist Party of China.    The Communist Party of China has a total of 3.34 million  local organizations. About 54 million Chinese people have party  membership.</p>

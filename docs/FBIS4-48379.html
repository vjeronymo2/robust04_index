			<p>BFN     [Text] Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development [MRND]'s militias who have been operating inside the  RPF-controlled areas in Kibungo Prefecture are now losing the  war and have started fleeing to Tanzania. The militias have  been killing people in the countryside and at the same time  attacking RPF soldiers. The militias have now run short of  supplies of food and ammunition. They have decided to flee to  Tanzania using canoes across River Akagera, according to  (Nyirigira Mutabaruka) of Radio Muhabura who has been touring  Prefecture Kibungo.    Reports from the Tanzanian side of River Akagera tell us  that  thousands of people have been discovered camping in areas  unknown to the UNHCR up to now. Most of these people could be  the MRND's combatants who are fleeing after running short of  food and ammunition. Most of the youthwingers who have been  operating in Kibungo are now ordinary residents of Prefecture  Kibungo. They were transported from Gisenyi and on reaching  Kibungo, they went underground and started their terror campaign  which reached a crescendo after the death of President  Habyarimana. These youthwingers have been operating far away  from home and cannot easily replenish their food and ammunition  supplies given the fact that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is  continuing its pacification of Kibungo Prefecture. The only  option available for the youthwingers is to flee to Tanzania  using canoes across River Akagera.</p>

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NASD is proposing an amendment to the Interpretation dealing with affirmative determinations made by members, or those persons associated with such members, in connection with short sales. The proposed amendment to the Interpretation establishes a requirement for a member to annotate the affirmative determination made before effecting a short sale. The affirmative determination requirement already appears in the Interpretation and requires members or associated persons to assure that securities are available to cover the short position. The Interpretation currently requires the executing member or an associated person, in connection with any sale, to make an affirmative determination that delivery will be received from the customer or that the securities will be able to be borrowed by settlement date. For long sales, the affirmative determination is required to be noted on the order ticket at the time the order is placed. However, the rule does not require that such determination be evidenced in any specific manner for short sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new rule would require members or associated persons to annotate, on the trade ticket or on some other record maintained for that purpose by the member firm, the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

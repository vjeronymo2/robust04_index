Organic Lipids Can By Themselves Arrange Themselves  Into Special Structures"]    [Text] Frankfurt--Chemists at the British University in  Bath under the direction of professors Stephen Mann and Douglas  D. Archibald have found a fabrication process for  organic-inorganic microcomposites that allows one very flexibly  to make quite different structures of materials. The process  points out new ways to make submicron structures.    The process is based on laboratory observations that organic  lipids that have a hydrophilic sugar group like that of the  so-called cerebrosides can by themselves arrange themselves into  special structures. Moreover, lamellar, fibrillar, or tubular  developed microstructures form via self-arrangement.    When suspensions of these structures are brought into  contact  with ferric chloride in an acid environment, films of iron  oxides form that eventually change into magnetite-type crystal  beds. So, ceramic structures form from an organic matrix with  metallic oxide particles.    Their structure can be compared with that of bone matter,  which consists mainly of an organic matrix made of the  cartilage-forming protein collagen and are embedded in the  inorganic particle made of the mineral calcium phosphate  hydroxyapatite, and thereby impart to the bone hardness and  strength together with a certain elasticity.    Until now similar microcomposites have been able to be  produced in small amounts only with zeolites, into whose pores a  few different organic molecules were embedded. A greater  multitude of different structures is possible now because of the  ability to influence the organic components of the  microcomposites.    Although one can not yet predict which end products can be  synthesized in large quantities even technically in the future,  synthesis from lipids represents an important advance in the  direction of the utilization of self-arranging organic  compounds. However, extensive research work is still required.    The University of Bath (Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom)  reports  that it hopes that a portion of this work can be sped up by  means of special designer programs that can make, already before  the actual synthesis and synthesis reactions, quite precise  theoretical statements concerning the properties that can be  expected.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report bu Christine Fauvet-Mycia: "Michel Rocard Disturbs </F> the Socialist Party"]    [Text] Can Michel Rocard be the Socialist Party's [PSF]  champion in the presidential election? This is not a new  question. It now takes on a degree of relevance in keeping with  the concern felt by Socialists worried by the stagnation in the  opinion polls of the European list headed by their first  secretary, embarrassed by the clearly announced opposition  between Francois Mitterrand and Michel Rocard on the Bosnian  issue.    The PSF first secretary's most lukewarm supporters have no  hesitation in saying that they now only meet "despairing"  members ready to envisage any solution to overcome "this looming  disaster."  <H5>  `Nothing Is Settled' </H5>   Bernard Tapie's name is no longer mentioned but that of  Jacques Delors [EU Commission president] still is, with  popularity ratings to support it, and that of Jack Lang [former  culture minister], who has kept a very low profile since he has  occupied seventh place on the Rocard list. "There will be a  debate in the PSF," they predict. "How could the first  secretary lead a presidential campaign when he cannot lead a  European campaign, and fails to create the slightest dynamism?  With a view to the municipal elections, the main deputies,"  they assert, "will no longer accept the inevitability of  Rocard's candidacy."    Those who most obstinately defend the mayor of  Conflans-Sainte-Honorine merely detect an entirely  understandable "perplexity," the consequences of which should  not be exaggerated. Especially in view of the fact, they add,  that the removal of the "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" list proves  Michel Rocard "correct in practice," although it does not end  the debate between those who think that the PSF first secretary  has distanced himself too much from the head of state and those  who think he was right to defend the solitary position adopted  by his party on 20 April "as a matter of honor." With 12 days to  go before the election, they do not want to give up. "Nothing is  settled," they say, refusing to attach too much importance to  the latest snapping jaws of "a few old Mitterrandist crocodiles"  or to the "alarmist reactions of rather uncommitted spectators."  The official campaign which is starting will, they think, make  it possible to clarify the choices, to simplify the rules of the  game. And when some pass harsh judgment on the first television  debate between Dominique Baudis and Michel Rocard on Sunday,  they see it as a successful initial confrontation between a  "politician" and a "man of convictions" who succeeded in  defending his plan.    The others, who are neither fierce opponents nor  unconditional supporters, prefer to say nothing. By their own  admission, they feel "trapped." They have chosen to support  Michel Rocard, and it is too late to change their minds: "Doubt  has returned but we cannot afford to have a new crisis on our  hands," they explain. "Whatever the issue, we must handle it  calmly." This does not prevent them, in the privacy of Rue  Solferino [PSF headquarters], from deploring this "pointless  tension" with Francois Mitterrand when the rumors on the  Elysee's [office of the president] maneuvers in support of  Bernard Tapie had scarcely died down. Their criticisms do not  relate to the content of the statements made by the PSF first  secretary when faced with Bernard-Henri Levy, but to the method  adopted. Michel Rocard's presence at the Mutualite, where the  intellectuals booed Francois Mitterrand's name, is not deemed to  be very clever. "Fabius," one of the former first secretary's  aides remarked, "has disagreed with Francois Mitterrand twice  recently -- on Bosnia and on the expansion of the EC -- but has  done so in an effort to implement party thinking, not trying to  dissociate himself from the head of state at all costs." In the  same way as they criticize Michel Rocard for allowing himself to  be locked into a debate between Mitterrand and the Socialists  once again, for blurring the "Right-Left divide" on which his  campaign should be focused, they regret a certain lack of  pugnacity on the part of the first secretary which cannot help  the men on his list or Socialist statements. "But at least,"  they point out, "when we have disagreements with Michel Rocard,  we have the tact not to display them publicly."    As is always the case, the criticisms of Michel Rocard are  inconsistent. The same people who yesterday criticized him for  following Francois Mitterrand too closely are now accusing him  of trying to sever the link too suddenly. The same people who  yesterday were sarcastic about his big bang, now criticize him  for not now going far enough in this effort to reshape the Left  and for clinging too much to the Socialist tradition. The same  people who yesterday urged him to take a more attacking line,  now despair at seeing him stand out.    Reacting to this new assault and to this strategy of  "blocking," the PSF first secretary says that he is immune to it  and reaffirms that "nothing" will make him abandon the  presidential race. It is not so much that he hopes for a  dazzling score which would, as his entourage hopes, "silence all  those who are speculating on a defeat." He still has very  little room to maneuver.  <H5>  Attraction </H5>   He knows this and has no illusions, although he thinks that  the current opinion polls cannot be reliable. On the other  hand, he thinks that the political scene after the European  elections will be clarified, with Jean-Pierre Chevenement  failing to achieve the 5-percent threshold and Bernard Tapie not  standing up for long in face of his judges. "His opponents will  then be clearly identified," one of his close advisers said, "it  will be time for him to join the presidential campaign, to go  out to meet the French people after completing his term as party  leader. He will be able to demonstrate his individuality, as he  has started to do on the Bosnia issue," he added. Not everybody  shares this optimism. Although they do not fear an all-out  offensive by the leaders of the former PSF factions after 12  June, they expect an explosion of uncontrolled initiatives  against a man who, they say, will not have demonstrated that he  has real power of attraction.</p>

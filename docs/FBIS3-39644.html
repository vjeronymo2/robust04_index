			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commerce and Industry Minister Konstandinos Simitis  said today that there will be a full embargo on fuel for Skopje  and stressed that there would be no repercussions for our  economy over the measures against Skopje. Vasilis Tzovaras has  the following report:    [Begin Tzovaras recording] The embargo on Skopje will be  implemented normally for all Greek products sent to this  statelet, while our country will not give its consent to the  granting of any Community loan unless Skopje changes its policy.  This statement was made today by Commerce and Industry Minister  Konstandinos Simitis, who made it clear that the embargo against  Skopje would have no repercussions for our country's foreign  trade and the smooth channeling of supplies to our market. The  Panhellenic Exporters Association agrees with Simitis'  assessments while the North Greece Exporters Association  expresses the opposite view.    As to why the transportation trade and our country's general  foreign trade would not be affected by the embargo on Skopje,  Simitis said that for about two years now, the passage through  Skopje of goods being exported from or imported to Greece has  virtually been reduced to nothing because of the situation in  the former Yugoslavia and mainly after the implementation of the  UN embargo on particular statelets of the former Yugoslavia.  The transport of goods is being carried out primarily through  Italy or Bulgaria and with preference given to Italy after  recent developments in mixed transportation.    Our country's foreign trade with the statelet of Skopje is  slight: In 1992, goods worth $9 million were imported and items  worth $16 million were exported. During the first 10 months of  1993, the imports from Skopje were $12 million and the exports  $108 million. This big variation in exports is due to the  supply of large quantities of oil from Greece to Skopje last  year. Skopje recently bought large quantities of fuel, much  more than it could consume, Simitis confirmed, and probably  built up some reserves, possibly disposing of the surplus in  favor of third parties, that is, reselling it. [end recording]    On the implementation of the embargo, our Thessaloniki  correspondent Dhespina Khari has the following report:    [Begin Khari recording] Three ships that sailed into  Thessaloniki port this morning with cargo destined for the  statelet of Skopje were not unloaded because the members of the  Thessaloniki Port Authority longshoremen's association refused  to unload the cargo. The loading of fuel [words indistinct] for  Skopje has already stopped, while no foreign freighter appeared  outside the Kalokhori installations to load fuel.    According to Thessaloniki Port Authority records, 3,000 tons  of crude oil were leaving the port daily for Skopje while 1  million tons of dry cargo was loaded and unloaded at its  installations for Skopje or was coming from this statelet for  export. Skopje's products were in transit at Thessaloniki port.  The dry cargo was stored in warehouses and the liquid fuel  unloaded from tankers was stored in private companies' tanks due  to leave for the statelet by rail. The oil and its products,  which until yesterday were transported from Thessaloniki port by  tanker or other means, were the lever of power for this  statelet's industry and communications and its heating  requirements.    The administrative council of the Thessaloniki Chamber of  Commerce and Industry passed a resolution assessing that the  measures the Greek Government announced concerning the Skopje  issue--the suspension of the operation of our country's  consulate in Skopje and a ban on the use of Thessaloniki port  for freight to and from Skopje--is a necessary consequence of  the premature recognition of this republic. The resolution of  the Chamber of Commerce and Industry stresses: We believe the  Greek Government could have made no other decision while [words  indistinct] the process of recognition was cultivating Skopje's  intransigence.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 23 April TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk and Secretary-General of the Western European Union  [WEU] Willem van Eekelen who met here on Saturday, discussed  collective security in Europe, stability in the region and  development of contacts between the Western European Union and  Ukraine.    Later in the day, Eekelen who visits Ukraine on an official  mission at the invitation of the Ukrainian Peace Fund held a  news conference where he stressed that he was satisfied with the  results of his visit.    He noted that meetings with Kravchuk and other Ukrainian  leaders as well as broad exchange of opinions gave him a chance  to understand better problems facing Ukraine.    The secretary-general said that Europe now is not divided  into two blocs. All nations should assume obligations to  promote peace processes. "I believe that Ukraine, an influential  European state, should play an important role in such issues."  This is largely explained by its geopolitcal position in Europe.    Asked by UKRINFORM whether Ukraine can be at least an  associated member of the European or Western European Unions,  the guest replied that this process will be gradual. However,  the process does not preclude broader cooperation between  Ukraine and European structures.    This cooperation can develop even now in the form of a  political dialogue and consultations, interparliamentary  relations as well as in the framework of the Institute on  Studies of Political Security which functions at European  structures and which can establish fruitful relations with the  International Relations Institute at the Kiev University.    The secretary-general stressed that the Ukrainian president  displayed interest in these forms of cooperation. According to  Eekelen, Kravchuk said that such contacts should be actively  developed.</p>

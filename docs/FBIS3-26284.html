			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Fang Jin (2455 </F> 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and director of the  Taiwan Affairs Office under the CPC Central Committee, met with  Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho], vice chairman and secretary general  of the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], and his party at the  Great Hall of the People today.    Wang Zhaoguo welcomed the SEF officials, who have come to  Beijing for talks with officials of the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS]. He commented  positively on the meetings between SEF and ARATS, and applauded  SEF for keeping a channel open for contact and discussions with  ARATS. Wang Zhaoguo said: Since its inception, ARATS has had  many contacts and discussions with SEF, and helped advance  contacts and discussions on routine affairs across the strait.  Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] had a successful meeting  in Singapore last April, which General Secretary Jiang Zemin  termed a successful and fruitful meeting that marked an  important, historic step in the development of relations across  the strait. After the Wang-Ku talks, the two organizations had  several working discussions. This visit by Vice Chairman Jiao  to Beijing for high-level talks is of great significance. He  said: Regular contacts and discussions will help the two sides  enhance mutual understanding and reach a consensus.    Jiao Renhe said: The SEF and ARATS have already had many  discussions. This is my first visit to Beijing; in the past  three days I have had two meetings with Tang Shubei and Zou  Zhekai. The two sides have made considerable progress toward  reaching a consensus; one thing still lacking is "convergence"  and more efforts are needed. Jiao Renhe also said: Promoting  cross-strait exchanges involves a host of miscellaneous  problems. A key point is to build "mutual confidence." It is  hoped that things will develop in ways conducive to cross-strait  exchange and cooperation.    Wang Zhaoguo said: The current visit by Jiao has helped  advance the development of cross-strait relations. After  discussions, the two organizations have reached an understanding  on the following four points: First, high-level officials of  the two organizations reaffirmed the understanding on  repatriation, in principle, of all hijackers; second, the two  organization agreed that they should follow the principle of  stressing the nongovernmental and routine nature of their  discussions, eschew politically sensitive issues, and refrain  from imposing their political demands on each other; third, it  is essential and important to keep open a clear channel of  contact and discussions between the two organizations; fourth,  both sides wish to see that a second Wang-Gu meeting be held at  an early date.    After the meeting, Tang Shubei briefed reporters on the  meeting. He said: The meeting proceeded in a sincere, cordial,  and harmonious [cheng zhi qin qie rong qia 6134 2304 6024 0434  5816 3174] atmosphere. Wang Zhaoguo also briefed the guests the  on progress the mainland has made in implementing the policy of  reform and opening up over the past 15 years, and its ongoing  efforts to develop a socialist market economy. Jiao Renhe  briefed the hosts on the political situation in Taiwan.    After the meeting, Wang Zhaoguo entertained Jiao Renhe and  SEF Deputy Secretaries General Shi Qiping [Shi Chi-ping] and Xu  Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu].

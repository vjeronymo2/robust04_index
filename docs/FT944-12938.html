			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: Virtual hippies - It is not all a brave new world CYBERIA: LIFE IN THE TRENCHES OF HYPERSPACE by Douglas Rushkoff Flamingo Pounds 6.99, 320pp The Utopian urge has been with us since Cro-Magnon man started bumping his head on the cave ceiling, so it is hardly surprising that some people maintain that quantum advances in information technology might give birth to a vastly better society. The young American journalist Douglas Rushkoff is such a believer. His lively and informed book is an ode to computers and fibre optics, a glowing map of a brave new world called Cyberspace. Rushkoff defines Cyberspace as a 'consensual hallucination accessed through the computer' - hence, anything from two people speaking by satellite link, to a boy wandering deep in the latest virtual reality program. For Rushkoff, Cyberspace is a realm ripe with possibilities for new human organisation and development. It is a place potentially free of governmental oversight and personal neuroses, where human impulses can be infinitely perfected with the help of the microchip. The author is at his most convincing while charting recent advances in hardware technology and showing how these have benefited the human imagination. For Rushkoff, the existence of a 'datasphere', where a large number of people are plugged into one another's computers, provides an imaginative arena of unbridled possibility. He posits a world where business meetings and classrooms no longer require physical proximity, where correspondence occurs without delay, where news can be transmitted without need for media conglomerates. Rushkoff breathlessly scans the future horizon, catching glimpses of scenarios such as cyber-sex between two people using Virtual Reality software and 'wet', body-reactive hard- ware. It is hard to argue that technology like Video Toasters, which allow us to 'sample' television shows as disc jockeys now do records, and 'wireheading', hardware that plugs directly into the human brain, promise a whole new way to work and play. What Rushkoff seems to have less of a stomach for is the dark side of this world, the dystopia in which technology is used as a means of repression and conformity rather than liberation. Believing that 'as computer-networking technology gets into the hands of more cyberians, historical power centers are challenged,' he seems to forget that the reason so much power is centralised is that the people who wield it have a knack of staying one step ahead of the rest of us. Cyberia's relation to its Soviet namesake may be more meaningful than just a facile pun. That said, Rushkoff's examination of the technological aspects of Cyberspace remains essential for those interested in the subject. Where the book proves far less effective is in its second part, which deals with the non-computing side of Cyberia. Smart drugs, house music and Cyberpunk fiction are all subsumed under a tatty umbrella of New Age thinking that would have us believe is in some way related to the information revolution. Rushkoff's arguments are far from convincing - one need only listen to the monotonous drone of rave music or the cretinous babble of a 'smart drug' saleswoman to understand that this is nothing more than warmed-over hippyism. Rushkoff's prose, so lucid in the early parts of the book, becomes unmoored and jargon-ridden as he takes us through the poorly-lit labyrinth of 'neopaganism' and 'technoshamanism'. Where he started off largely convincing us that a brave new world was being born, we leave the book thinking that Cyberia is little more than an enclave for the sort of drop-outs who have always found their utopia in the same place - anywhere but here.</p>

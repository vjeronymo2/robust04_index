			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (24): New world of communication for deaf people DEAF people who use text-phones now have a new world of communications opened up for them with the introduction of 'Typetalk.' The telephone/text service, developed jointly by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and BT, with Pounds 4m BT funding over three years, was launched this month. Pictured above, left, is Tricia Parry, an operator who converts the spoken word into writing in the Typetalk switchroom at Speke, near Liverpool. Pictured right is Dr John Stuart, who - thanks to Typetalk - is now able to carry out his work more quickly and efficiently. Dr Stuart, who is the hazard information officer at Manchester University, reads incoming conversation on the screen of his terminal, but uses the mouthpiece to speak directly to the caller. Typetalk calls are relayed to and from text-users through the UK to hearing people worldwide. The new service is available round-the-clock as specially trained operators relay text messages to hearing customers and return the spoken reply by text. In most cases, the cost of the call is no more than a hearing person would pay by calling direct. There is a rebate scheme, funded by BT and operated by Typetalk, entitling users to claim back 60 per cent of the cost of non-business calls from one phone line, up to a maximum of Pounds 160 per person a year. More details on the service are available from Typetalk, at Pauline Ashley House, Ravenside Retail Park, Speke Road, Liverpool, L24 8QB</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOLS SETTLE SEX HARASSMENT SUIT  </P> <P> The Simi Valley Unified School District has negotiated a tentative settlement  of a lawsuit that accused a high school principal of sexually harassing a staff  psychologist for two years until she accepted a demotion to escape him, lawyers  in the case said Monday.  </P> <P> Attorneys refused to disclose financial terms of the agreement, but the  psychologist who brought the suit, Sara Kopman-Davis, described the amount as  "real substantial, especially for a school district."  </P> <P> "Settlement-wise, I'm satisfied, but money isn't what I wanted," said  Kopman-Davis, who filed suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. "I wanted  him reprimanded."  </P> <P> The chief defendant, Apollo High School Principal Brad Greene, declined to  comment. His attorney, J. Jane Fox of Ventura, said he denied all the  allegations and that the pending settlement should not be considered an  admission of guilt.  </P> <P> Greene was accused in the lawsuit of making sexually explicit remarks to  Kopman-Davis as part of an effort to seduce her, of touching and grabbing her,  and of giving her a poor evaluation in the spring of 1987 after she repeatedly  rejected him, said her lawyer, Julia Dragojevic.  </P></p>

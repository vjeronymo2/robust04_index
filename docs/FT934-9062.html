			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Rule clash may force tendering change A CLASH between two European directives could force a revision of government policy on compulsory competitive tendering by councils. Many authorities now advertise contracts on the basis that Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981, known as Tupe, will apply. In effect these require any bidder to maintain the same workforce on the same wages and conditions of service. The European Commission believes, however, that this might clash with the procurement directive, which forbids authorities from forcing bidders to use local labour forces. According to today's Local Government Chronicle the commission raised the issue after it saw an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Communities tendering Croydon borough council's financial services work. The advertisement stated that the council's existing staff must be transferred to the bidder. Croydon confirmed that the commission had queried the advertisement. Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, of Clause 26, a lobby group for contractors, said the commission's stance could sweep away the serious obstacle Tupe poses to private contractors. He said: 'If the commission insists that this is indeed a local labour clause then the environment department will have to amend its advice for the Next Steps initiative and for compulsory competitive tendering.' Separately, Britain's biggest local authority is facing a claim that it awarded contracts worth Pounds 22m uncompetitively. Strathclyde Regional Council, centred on Glasgow, told potential bidders for its cleaning contracts that Tupe applied. The contracts were won by the in-house teams. But the Business Services Association, another lobby group of contractors, branded the policy anti-competitive in a letter to Mr Allan Stewart, the Scottish office minister.</p>

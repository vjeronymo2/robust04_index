			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Three bids may vie for BTG THE government is believed to have received three bids for British Technology Group by yesterday, when the deadline for submissions passed. In addition to two well-publicised consortia - one led by BTG management and the other by Mr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics - a group put together by Strategy International, a London consultancy, is thought to have made an offer for the state-owned technology transfer organisation. A fourth consortium, headed by Sir Ronald Mason, former chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence, withdrew on Tuesday. The BTG management group identified CINVen, the venture capital arm of the British Coal pension fund, as its lead investor. Mr Ashworth heads a British-American consortium including Research Corporation Technologies, BTG's closest US equivalent. The DTI hopes to select the winning consortium next week and to complete the sale before the general election.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Leonid Kravchuk at a Supreme Council </F> session in Kiev -- live]    [Text] Esteemed people's deputies: In my speech to you,  to the Supreme Council, I set out the arguments. In analyzing  the discussions that took place both yesterday and today, it  seemed to me that the stress was put only on the first argument;  namely, on the necessity of postponing the elections. But the  other important argument -- that if the Supreme Council adopts  the relevant laws and clarifications then the elections should  be held -- was not analyzed. Therefore, I am not saying from  this podium that the elections should not be held. I said, and  I am saying, and I stick to this point of view, that it is  necessary to hold the elections [applause], but must be held  only when the elections are subject to a legislative base. This  is my position and it is based on the fact that otherwise we  could finally lose control of power. If the elections are held  without the introduction of amendments and additions to the  Constitution and laws and if the authorities of oblast and rayon  chairmen, and so on, are not clearly defined, then we will have  an uncontrolled situation and we will have a complete collapse  of the executive authority.    I am not threatening you. I am speaking from the experience  we have had since 1990, and you will recall that we did not  introduce presidency because of someone's whim but because of  the situation that developed.    Second, if you carefully read the law passed by the previous  Supreme Council on the formation of national and local state and  representative bodies, you will not find any mention of  president there. I remember how your predecessors censored this  law and how much they were opposed to the institution of  presidency. Suddenly, today, they say that a president must be  elected. I am asking you, how? If that law vests everything in  the government, this being only a probability because no one  knows what specifically is vested, since it only says that  specific laws are yet to be worked out, what is the role of the  president?    If the president is popularly elected given these powers --  and as far as I can see, there is no alternative -- we will have  a president in Kiev, who will be the head of state and head of  executive power, with no tools whatsoever for the president's  regional influence. That is why I am saying that these issues  must be settled.    If the Supreme Council really wants, as some declared here,  Ukraine to remain an independent, governed, sovereign, and  democratic state, then, confirming its decision to hold the  election on 26 June, it should not make a mere general  statement, but take a specific responsibility here, in front of  everyone, to prepare relevant documents before 26 June. This  must be stated in a resolution. Because the draft resolution  says: submit before 12 June -- I read on -- documents regulating  the powers of the president of Ukraine. The powers of the  Ukrainian president are regulated by the Constitution, and no  law can change it, no matter how much you may wish. Changes  must be made in the Constitution. Is there a real possibility of  making the changes? If there is, let us make them. I am in  favor of this; moreover, I was the first to stand for a clear  delimitation of powers, and it was my proposal to write down in  the draft constitution the delimitation of the president's  powers as the head of state and the head of executive power.  But this must be written down in the Constitution.    Therefore, I would like you to withdraw the allegations made  here that someone wants to hold on to his seat, and someone  wants something else, and questions as to why the president  signed the law on elections. Yes, the president did sign it,  but the president has since submitted draft documents to the  Supreme Council concerning the law on power, and you said here  from the podium that the law on power was absolutely redundant.  But it clearly defined what the president does, what the  government does, what judicial power does, and what the Supreme  Council does. People would have voted for it on 27 March, and  then, on this basis, elections would be held. Then there would  have been no tug-of-war. But you did not want it that way.    Now there's another interesting point. They say that you  need only one change: the chairman of an oblast council should  be elected by council deputies. Then all will be well. I am  asking you: If the chairman is elected by council deputies, can  the central government dismiss him? No. Can the president do  so? No. I have now three times more powers against the  president of Crimea then the president elected in June will have  against an oblast or rayon council chairman. If we are to elect  a president not just because one does not like the current  president, as I feel the case is, I would like the president to  be elected without destroying state and executive power,  legitimately, consistently, and without saying: Why do we need  these legal intricacies, the people want elections! Because  tomorrow, when it is destroyed, the same people will come to the  Supreme Council and say they are getting no pension, because the  budget will not receive any contributions, they are not getting  this, they are not getting that. I ask you, who will answer  these questions and how?    If we are to create new power, in which I support you, let  us create it in a way to make it work. I repeat: The power we  will elect now will not work. If it does, there will be no  control over this power by present law. I don't want to be a  prophet in my country, as they say, but you will see it for  yourself in a while. That's why I want us to approach the  situation in a very responsible way.    If the Supreme Council and its commissions undertake to  amend  these laws and lay the necessary emphases in the laws passed by  your predecessors, then there is no doubt that I will support  the elections. This is my absolutely clear position on local  elections.    Second, my position on the presidential election. The  president's status today is defined by the Constitution. If the  president is elected in this status, then, believe me, if he  endures all the tortures of election, no Supreme Council will  take away any powers from him. Therefore, any change will have  to be put to a referendum. Someone here already hinted at a  referendum, that we must hold one to see what is necessary and  what is not. This is a curious line of argument, electing a  president with all his powers in June, and holding a referendum  in September to see if there is any need for him at all. What  powers can you then taken away from him?    I ask you, what are we after? Just to pass on slogans? I am  appealing to you: you will have the greatest responsibility, and  I want you to know this, because the presidential campaign is  under way. I am a presidential candidate. You are a popularly  elected legitimate Supreme Council, a constitutional but not a  full-blooded one, because one third of deputies are missing.  Some regions are not represented in the Supreme Council. But  you are a legitimate, constitutional Supreme Council. You bear  the greatest responsibility today for the kind of power we will  form. History must know this, what kind of power we are  forming. What kind of power it will be is exclusively and fully  within the competence of the Supreme Council. Any political  passions, any allegations as to who wants what and how, must be  dismissed if we indeed are rooting for Ukraine. You can quote  enough arguments today both for and against. I want us to form  a strong executive power, a legitimate supreme legislative  power, and a president with clear and well- defined powers. If  we do this, and I urge you to do this, then we need to go to the  polls on 26 June. Whoever wins will win -- I never denied that.</p>

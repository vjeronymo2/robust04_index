			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 5 Jun (TANJUG) -- Commenting on the talks on  the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina held in Geneva  under the auspices of the Contact Group, Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the parliament of the Srpska republic, said today  that "those who drew the maps did not at all accept" the Serb  side's suggestions. According to the maps, "western Bosnia, the  Posavina area, and eastern Bosnia are all problematic,"  Krajisnik told Serb Sarajevo television and TANJUG journalists.    "They are trying to take away the largest part of the  corridor -- the towns of Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Odzak, Samac,  and Orasje. There are also aspirations toward considerably  enlarging the territories of the Muslim enclaves in eastern  Bosnia, almost the whole of the left bank of the river Drina and  the right bank near Gorazde."    We explained why we cannot discuss those areas, Krajisnik  said. We expressed concern, Krajisnik went on to say, because  the division of 51 percent and 49 percent is being insisted  upon, rather than the quality of the territory. We reminded  them that the Srpska republic assembly in Pale had found it  difficult to accept even the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which  allocated 53 percent of the territory to the Serbs, and the rest  to what has now become the Muslim-Croat Federation.    Speaking about the stance of the Bosnian Serbs, Krajisnik  said that it was a problem to go to the talks with pre-set  percentages. He believes that each area should be discussed  separately and viewed in the context of its distinct  characteristics.    According to the Serb delegation, "the Muslims are not  playing their own game, but an entire bloc is trying achieve its  interests through the Muslim-Croat Federation, and it is trying  -- on behalf of the Federation -- to adjust the territories of  future states to its strategic needs."    "We know why they are insisting on eastern Bosnia. They need  it as a springboard toward Serbia. As for the corridor, we will  never agree on it being merely a road, a corridor. It has to be  a populated area, an organic entity linking a Serb state" --  Krajisnik said.    In reference to the constant delays in the negotiations to  cease hostilities, Serb Republic President Karadzic told  journalists that "consistent rumors are coming from  well-informed sources in Europe that the Muslims are being  constantly driven into a conflict first with the Serbs then with  the Croats by the people who wish them harm, who hope for their  total extermination."    Karadzic said that the "Muslim side has again demonstrated  that it favors war and that it is not willing to accept a  peaceful solution for a period of four to six months, thus  helping in the efforts to extinguish the conflagration in  Bosnia." "The Muslims are not undermining the conference at  their own initiative. To their detriment, someone is advising  them to choose wrong tactics" -- Karadzic said.    "No one will go before the international community to  justify  their attempt to undermine the conference, and I therefore  believe that in the end, someone, most likely some circles from  America, will try to bring them eventually to the negotiating  table," the Srpska republic president said in conclusion.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Russian loses ministerial job Mr Sergei Shakhrai, 38, a Russian deputy prime minister, became the first casualty of the recently reformed Russian cabinet when he yesterday lost his post as nationalities minister, though hr kept that of deputy premier. His successor, Mr Nikolai Yegorov, is a governor of the Krasnodar region who has shown conspicuous loyalty to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and appears to be benefiting from it. Like Mr Shakhrai, he is from a Cossack background. The Russian press has speculated that Mr Shakhrai's loss of position stemmed from his sturdy opposition to Mr Dzhokar Dudayev, president of the breakaway autonomous Russian republic of Chechnya - with whom the Russian president is now seeking a rapprochement. Mr Shakhrai had earlier called for presidential elections in Chechnya as a condition for talks with a man who has defied Russian central authority for more than two years. Mr Shakhrai had created a centrist grouping in the small but influential Party of Unity and Accord, which boasts two deputy prime ministers, Mr Shakhrai and Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for the economy. Both have taken a centrist position after some time in the liberal camp, and both have strongly supported Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister.</p>

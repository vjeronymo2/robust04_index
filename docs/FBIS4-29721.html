			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodia is a safe and viable area for investment,  and is looking to play a part within Asean in the economic life  of Southeast Asia, Om Rasadi, chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the Cambodian Parliament said.    At a conference organized last week by Chulalongkon  University and attended by top officials from the Thai Foreign  Office and National Security Council, Om and his deputy, Un  Noeng, discussed Cambodia's position in the region a year after  the May 1993 elections.    Om represents the royalist Funcinpec [National United Front  for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]  party of King Norodom Sihanouk. Noeng is a member of the  opposition Cambodian People's Party of Hun Sen. They represent  the two largest parties in the new national parliament created  when the new constitution was ratified last September.    Om was more confident about the future than recent press  reports on the Cambodian situation have suggested. "I would  prefer to say that we have challenges in Cambodia and not  problems", he said. He went on to outline the need for economic  stability.and growth, long term economic management, and the  encouragement of private enterprise.    Despite being on opposite sides of the political divide,  both  men were united in the desire to encourage direct foreign  investment in their country. They stressed that Parliament was  working on the National Plan for Reconstruction and Development  which has the support of the United Nations Development  Programme.    Both men denied that the continued hostilities between the  Phnom Penh government and the Khmer Rouge were an obstacle to  investment, and Om invited the international community to visit  Cambodia "in order to see for themselves".    Noeng claimed the Khmer Rouge controlled only 5-10 percent  of  Cambodian territory, and that moves were underway to merge and  reform the security forces of the major factions.    "If one has been ill for 20 years, one cannot be cured in  one  hour, but the patient is able to tell you that the medicine is  working," said Om.    Using the rhetoric of `national reconciliation', a veiled  metaphor usually understood to mean inclusion of the Khmer Rouge  in the governing process, both parliamentarians claimed that  with the development of a human rights policy and with  sustainable economic growth, the Khmer Rouge problem could be  solved through integration rather than suppression .    This position directly contradicts a motion currently tabled  by MPs seeking to outlaw and condemn the Khmer Rouge and follows  the policy of reconciliation inconsistently promoted by King  Sihanouk over recent years.    The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee also hinted  that Cambodia may in the future play a more involved role in  regional economic development, in addition to be coming a member  of the Asean Parliamentary Union and acting as an observer at  full Asean meetings.    "It takes time to be member of these important  organisations,  but I say to you also that Cambodia will play real role not only  in the development but also in the security of the region," said  Om.    Co-operation with Thailand was also seen as crucial to  Cambodia's future, and Om brushed aside rumours of link between  the Thai Army and the Khmer Rouge. The other nations of  Southeast Asia were requested to help with technological change  such as skill training and education.    Om concluded by expressing the wish that Cambodia an the  Asean nations could "try to have a common interest for the next  century, for the year 2000."</p>

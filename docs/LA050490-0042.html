			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> TRIP SHAKESPEARE CARVES ITS OWN NICHE  </P> <P> Honest romanticism and winking hipness aren't supposed to work together. So how  do you explain the L.A. debut of Trip Shakespeare at Club Lingerie on  Wednesday? How a simple fairy tale turned into a novelty dance called the  slacks, how a twisted comic-book adventure became a hilarious rhyming farmland  epic of, well, near-Shakespearean proportions? And, most important, how  youthful irreverence did nothing to diminish the bare sentimentality of a  closing ballad, or vice versa?  </P> <P> The Minneapolis quartet is obviously a band that's willing and able to carve  out its own distinct and rewarding niche. Maybe if L.A.'s wacky metal parodists  Redd Kross had been weaned on Neil Young and the Band instead of Kiss and the  Partridge Family, they might sound something like this. The harmonies and  emotions are heartland-pure and plain, but the attitude is  television-generation-hip. The trick of the Trip is that it's never snide -- an  accomplishment that has eluded virtually all who have tried for this chemistry  (not that many have tried). And, not incidentally, the band writes great hooks,  and it rocks. Maybe the name says it all. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

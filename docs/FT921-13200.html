			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis announce 100,000 barrels a day oil output cut SAUDI ARABIA yesterday became the latest member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to announce a voluntary cut in output to shore up crude prices. It is cutting production by 100,000 barrels a day with immediate effect. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said the kingdom made the cut 'out of its desire to maintain a balance between supply and demand on the oil market'. He added: 'We hope that by taking this measure things will return to normal'. The cut will reduce Saudi production to 8.4m barrels a day. The reduction follows voluntary pledges over the past few days from six other Opec members - Venezuela, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Iran and Qatar - to cut output by a total of 200,000 b/d in response to recent softness in the market. The United Arab Emirates has also hinted that it may trim its production. Opec's 11 fully producing members have been pumping oil flat out since the agreement at their last ministerial meeting in November on a nominal output ceiling of 23.65m b/d for the first quarter. Real output, however, has been nearer 24.2m b/d and the combination of a mild winter, a delayed economic recovery in the US and a draw-down on stocks during the first quarter has undermined prices. Opec ministers are due to decide on output levels for the second quarter at their next conference in Geneva on February 12. Gulf oil officials said yesterday that the round of token voluntary cuts would make agreement in Geneva easier, but that the meeting would almost certainly have to agree on further reductions in output. They said the voluntary cuts would help to support prices before the meeting while accelerating the first quarter draw-down on stocks, which is expected to add to the demand for Opec oil in the second quarter. They believe, however, that, despite the cuts, the February meeting would be Opec's most difficult since the Gulf crisis, with several Opec states certain to press for Saudi Arabia to undertake the biggest share of overall cut. By lifting production during the Gulf crisis to help fill the gap left by lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, the kingdom has lifted its share of Opec output from less than a quarter to more than a third since the Gulf crisis. Saudi Arabia is known to be seeking a pro-rata cut shared equally by all Opec members, with the exception of Kuwait, which will be permitted to recoup its lost revenues. 'The possibility for such an agreement is there, particularly since these voluntary cuts have been shared - it will make it easier if there are to be further cuts that they too should be shared,' said one Gulf oil official. Officials said, however, that the Geneva meeting was likely to see strong disagreements over where the production ceiling should be set for the second quarter and they predicted wide variation in members' forecasts for the second quarter demand for Opec crude. Russia expects oil output to fall to 405.5m tonnes in 1992, from 462.3m tonnes in 1991, reports Reuter from Moscow. The forecast, contained in an official document, is below figures outlined last week by Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the Russian energy minister. Mr Lopukhin said that Russia intended to produce 426m tonnes of oil in 1992.</p>

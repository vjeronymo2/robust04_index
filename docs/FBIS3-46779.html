			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-ku and O Yong-hwan: "How Will North </F> Korea Change in the New Year?"]    [Text]  <H5>  Power Structure </H5>   The matter of greatest interest regarding the change in the  power structure expected to take place this year in North Korea  is Kim Chong-il's succession to power. The year of 1994 will  mark 20 years since Kim Chong-il was nominated as the successor  in the plenary session of the Workers' Party Central Committee  in February 1974. This also attracts the people's attention.    In view of the importance attached to the so-called "cyclic  year" -- such as the 10th and the 20th year -- in North Korea,  it is likely that visible steps for settlement of succession to  power will be taken this year. This speculation is also  supported by the step-by-step measures taken each year since  1991 for Kim Chong-il's succession to power, including his  successive nomination as the supreme commander of the military,  marshal, and chairman of the National Defense Committee. If  step-by-step measures are not taken this year regarding  succession to power, it could mean that an abnormal front [isang  chonson] might have been created within the North Korean power  structure.    People observe that at least one of the titles retained by  Kim Il-song at present, including general secretary of the  party, chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, and  the president of the state, will be transferred to Kim Chong-il  this year, and complete succession to power, including transfer  of the remaining titles, will be finalized in late 1995 or  thereafter.    This observation is supported by the fact that North Korea  has designated 1995 as "the year for reunification," that North  Korea would require an overall evaluation of its decision to  designate the upcoming two and three years as an adjustment  period, and that Kim Il-song demonstrated his health by giving  on-the-spot guidances more than 10 times last year.    Therefore, it appears that this year the title of either  president of the state or chairman of the party's Central  Military Commission will be transferred to Kim Chong-il, while  succession to the position of general secretary of the party  will be somewhat delayed in view of the characteristic nature of  the socialist state.    The possibility of early succession to the presidency was  predicted in 1992 through the revised Constitution, which  abolished the regulation stipulating that the president hold the  additional post of chairman of the National Defense Commission  and which prescribed that the president's responsibility may be  reviewed at the Supreme People's Assembly. As a result of this,  the president's power was drastically reduced. This may be  construed to be a step- by-step measure for Kim Chong-il to  advance toward the position of president from chairmanship of  the National Defense Committee.    There has also been speculation regarding succession to the  post of chairman of the party's Central Military Commission.  The party's rules stipulate, however, that the general  secretary hold the additional post of chairman of the Central  Military Commission. Therefore, in order to realize the  succession, the step to separate the two positions must be taken  by first revising the party's rules.    Last year, senior officials, including O Chin-u, Choe Kwang,  Yi Chong-ok, Pak Song-chol, Kim Yong-chu, and Kim Pyong-sik,  either retained their incumbent positions or were newly  appointed. It is anticipated, however, that a fierce whirlpool  of generational shifts will sweep North Korea at the end of this  year.    The generational shift will be carried out in such a manner  to support Kim Chong-il's succession to power. It is highly  likely that Kim Tal-hyon and Kim Yong-sun, who were demoted,  will be reinstated; and Kim Ki-nam, Kim Kuk-tae, Chang Song-tae,  and the like, who are close associates of Kim Chong-il, will  appear at the forefront during the shift.    If the nuclear problem is not satisfactorily solved and the  economic crisis persists, succession to power and the  generational shift will face serious trials.  <H5>  Nuclear Issue and Diplomacy </H5>   The North Korean nuclear issue is the core for maintaining  the system and for defining economic problems.    Through the drastic measure of withdrawing from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], North Korea is attempting to  ensure maintenance of its political system and to secure  economic assistance.    It seems that the North Korean nuclear problem, which was  the  main cause of deadlock in North-South relations last year, will  be settled this year in some form. There is great possibility  that North Korea, which is now standing on the crossroads of its  decision to advance toward nuclear weapons development or to  ensure its nuclear transparency, will undertake a policy of  ensuring its nuclear transparency.    As the NPT will be revised in 1995, the policy for  international denuclearization will likely be strengthened, and  North Korea's nuclear development will only cause its own  isolation by going against the trend of the time after the end  of the cold war.    North Korea's choice to ensure nuclear transparency will be  made in expectation of maintaining its system. This choice may  give rise to discord within North Korea's power structure. Even  if North Korea makes this choice, the North Korean nuclear issue  will enter into other aspects if the quantity of extracted  plutonium proves to be more than expected as the result of  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. In this  case, concealment of plutonium will be the point of dispute and  North Korea and the international community will again wrangle  with each other.    In the event North Korea accepts complete nuclear inspection  of the seven nuclear facilities it reported to the IAEA, North  Korea-U.S. relations will begin to improve above all and  negotiations between North Korea and Japan for establishment of  diplomatic relations will be resumed.    The first step in improving U.S.-North Korean relations will  be the lifting of the U.S. embargo against North Korea; even the  mutual exchange of liaison missions will be realized between  North Korea and the United States.    The negotiations for establishing diplomatic relations with  Japan, held over eight times in the past, will be resumed and  will make noticeable progress.    This is because the pro-North Korean Japanese Social  Democratic Party has the majority of seats in the Hosokawa  coalition cabinet and because North Korea is in need of  reparations from Japan to overcome its economic difficulties.    In the meantime, North Korea will likely strive to improve  relations with China and Russia, its traditional allies, and to  emphasize economic diplomacy with oil producing countries  including Iran and Libya.    At the same time, North Korea will continue pushing for  nonaligned diplomacy with third world countries, including those  in Southeast Asia and Latin America.  <H5>  Economy and Society </H5>   It appears that this year North Korea will unlock the gate  of  its economy externally, while internally it will attempt to  further strengthen the control of people in order to maintain  its political system, thus implementing two contradictory  policies.    In view of its outdated production facilities and backward  technology, the North Korean economic index will not likely show  noticeable growth this year.    Improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations following  solution  to the nuclear problem, however, will bring about a stable  supply of foodstuffs and oil, as well as a reduction in defense  expenses, thus serving as a new factor for invigorating its  economy.    It is expected that this year North Korea will, for the  first  time, induce foreign capital to Najin-Sonbong free trade zone as  part of its external opening up. North Korea will also likely  induce foreign investments for developing sight-seeing resources  in the Mt. Paektu and Mt. Kumgang areas. It is presumed,  however, that North Korea will decide on the opening of Nampo  industrial zone and the like after analyzing the result of  development of Najin-Sonbong district.    It is clear that North Korea will accelerate external trade  following declaration of the trade-first policy and will  diversify its markets by extending to Europe, Taiwan, and  Southeast Asia. Needless to say, North Korea will direct its  efforts on restoring normal economic relations with China,  Russia, and Iran with a view to securing a stable supply of  foodstuffs and oil. However, such a limited opening up will  work as an occasion to strengthen the control of people in a bid  to maintain the system, because North Korea has learned a lesson  from Eastern Europe that opening up should not be allowed to be  a factor for collapse of the system.    Therefore, North Korea will allow only the people whose  so-called identities and status are reliable, to move in the  Najin-Sonbong district, which will be opened as a free trade  zone; and ideological indoctrination among the residents will be  intensified more than ever before.    North Korea's emphasis on national tradition by unearthing  the Tangun Tomb and dealing with the issue of national cultural  inheritance as the first agenda item at the Supreme People's  Assembly held in December 1993 can be regarded as a signal of  strengthening the ideological control of the people.    Such indications were also noted during the Korean  intellectuals' rally held in late 1992 at which the laws on  opening were revised, and during the rally of forerunners with  beautiful communist traits held last December at which the  trade-first policy was declared. In spite of such intensified  internal control in North Korea, this year will be the first  year of substantive changes in North Korean residents'  consciousness.    This is because frequent exchanges with the West after  declaring the trade-first policy and the limited economic  opening up will inevitably result in changes in residents'  consciousness.    The success of the control of North Korean residents in the  midst of the policy of limited opening up will be a key to  choosing opening up or self-reliance.</p>

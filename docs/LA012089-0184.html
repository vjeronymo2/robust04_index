			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> RACE BOARD CHIEF CONFLICT ALLEGED  </P> <P> The chairman of the California Horse Racing Board is an executive for the firm  that insures one of the race tracks licensed by the board, but he has not  listed that on his conflict-of-interest statements, The Sacramento Bee reported  today.  </P> <P> Leslie Liscom is a senior vice president of Oland International Co., a Los  Angeles insurance brokerage that is paid more than $1 million in annual  premiums by Hollywood Park Operating Co., which runs races at Los Alamitos Race  Track in Orange County.  </P> <P> Liscom told the newspaper that he was not required to disclose the association.  He said he has nothing to do with the Hollywood Park policy and has an attorney  general's opinion relating to his previous employment saying he did not need to  report the connection.  </P> <P> As a governor's appointee, Liscom is required to file an annual report listing  his sources of income and gifts with the Fair Political Practices Commission.  His 1987-88 statement does not list his firm's relationship with the track.  </P> <P> Lance Olson, a Sacramento attorney representing the board in a lawsuit brought  by a harness race horse organization, said Liscom sought an attorney general's  opinion on an identical situation shortly after his 1984 appointment, when he  worked for another firm that had a race track policy. That opinion said he did  not have to disclose the relationship because he was only an employee of the  firm.  </P> <P> "I feel that I have had no conflict of interest whatsoever," Liscom told The  Bee. "Integrity and ethics have always been important to me."  </P> <P> Michael Franchetti, who is representing the harness race horse organization,  said the association is significant.  </P> <P> "It would appear to us there is a clear conflict that should have been  declared," Franchetti said.  </P></p>

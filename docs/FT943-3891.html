			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Inheritance of Irish regiment Sir, Bruce Clark ('Security issue fraught with danger', September 5), did not paint the full picture in describing the role and history of the Royal Irish Regiment. The regiment was formed, out of 'Options for Change' by an amalgamation of the Royal Irish Rangers and the Ulster Defence Regiment, the former being a conventional line infantry regiment, the latter being deployed in Northern Ireland. It has long been a tradition of the Royal Irish Rangers, inherited from their predecessors, the Irish Regiments, to recruit from both Northern Ireland and the republic with no religious discrimination, as can be seen from the number of Catholic commanding officers they have had: this attitude is already spreading within the whole recently constituted regiment. There is now a service battalion which takes its place in the line as a regular army unit, currently deployed in the eastern Mediterranean, and six home battalions in Northern Ireland. I feel that, by trying to simplify matters, Clark might have unwittingly traduced one example of real integration. R Malachi O'Loughlin, 17 Springdale, Wallingford, Oxfordshire, OX10 0HQ</p>

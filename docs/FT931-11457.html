			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chrysler raises Dollars 1.78bn in share issue CHRYSLER, the US vehicle manufacturer, last night raised Dollars 1.78bn gross when its international issue of 46m new shares was priced at Dollars 38 3/4 a share, - the closing price of the company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The issue is a considerable success for Chrysler, which has seen its share price nearly quadruple since the start of last year as its financial prospects have improved. The company originally planned to issue 40m shares, but it has now sold an additional 6m which it made available to the underwriters, led by First Boston, to make up over-allocation of the stock to investors. Chrysler's share price has performed robustly since the issue was announced on January 11. It stood at Dollars 36 3/8 immediately before the announcement, dipped a little afterwards, but then rose, helped by strong fourth-quarter earnings. The company has indicated it will use almost half the funds raised to reduce the underfunding of its pension obligations. The shortfall stands at about Dollars 4bn and Chrysler has left open the possibility that all the cash could go to the pension fund.</p>

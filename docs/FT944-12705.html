			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Nissan Motor - Other Companies The Japanese carmaker will announce half-year results on Friday. Although the company is seeing firm sales in the US market with a 17.2 per cent rise in unit sales in August, earnings have been hit by the poor performance in the domestic market. Its domestic registrations fell 3 per cent in July in spite of a 12 per cent rise in the overall market and industry analysts expect Nissan's market share to fall further because of the lack of new models. The company forecasts unconsolidated half-year sales to fall 3 per cent to Y1,550bn (Dollars 16bn), and expects to post recurring losses of Y60bn.</p>

The traffickers presumably intended to smuggle the drugs  into the United States for sale and consumption.    It was stressed that no incidents nor confrontations between  authorities and criminals were reported during the activities.    The operations were carried out in Sonora, Baja California,  Michoacan, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit,  Coahuila, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, Jalisco, and  Morelos. They also enabled the Office of the Attorney General of  the Republic [PGR] to arrest 52 presumed drug dealers, and to  seize 13 vehicles, a boat with an outboard motor, five firearms,  and scores of useful rounds, which are at the disposal of the  Federal Public Prosecutor's Offices.    It was specified that, at the highway checkpoint established  on the outskirts of the town of Hermosillo, Sonora, federal  agents intercepted a tank truck purported to be carrying liquid  petroleum gas. However, over 4.5 tons of cannabis indica were  found in its tank, outfitted with special compartments. [passage  omitted]    As for Baja California State, the PGR reported that, in  operations conducted in the towns of Tijuana and Mexicali,  Humberto Fernandez Vazquez, Aurelia Peralta, Martha Bernal  Silva, Margarita Montano Avila, Manuel Gracia Ramirez, and Juan  Luevano Luna were arrested. They had in their possession 80 kg  of ephedrine, a chemical precursor for refining cocaine and  processing amphetamines. They intended to smuggle the ephedrine  north into neighboring California.    Concurrently, at the ferry terminal in Pichilingue, Baja  California Sur, the federal agents seized approximately two tons  of compressed marijuana being transported in special  compartments on a trailer body and under mudguards of a  passenger bus. Two persons were placed at the disposal of the  Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in connection with this  incident. [passage omitted]</p>

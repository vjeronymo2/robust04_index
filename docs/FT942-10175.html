			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Dove who shook Rabin's machine: Julian Ozanne profiles the man who caused a political earthquake His enemies dubbed him a traitor and political opportunist. His friends said he was the brilliant rising star of the Labour party, but yesterday all Israelis agreed Mr Haim Ramon was now the man to watch. The sweeping victory of the 44-year-old lawyer in nationwide elections to lead the Histadrut, the country's trade union federation and Labour party powerbase, is viewed in Israel as a political earthquake. For the first time in 73 years, Histadrut control has been wrested from Labour. Mr Ramon, standing on a hastily put-together independent list, has defeated the well-oiled political machine of the Labour party and humiliated the old-guard leadership. By so doing, he has catapulted a younger generation eager for reform into the political limelight. Born in a working-class neighbourhood in Jaffa, he has also emerged as heir-apparent to Mr Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister. 'A sweeping victory of the new Israeli generation,' an editorial in yesterday's Yediot Ahronot said. 'The vote was a protest against conservatism. The change now has to be deep, a revolution in the Histadrut and in the foundations of the whole Israeli political structure.' Mr Ramon immediately promised to introduce the health bill he tried to push through when Labour's health minister, aimed at breaking the link between compulsory Histadrut membership and the health service. He also promised to slash Histadrut's bureaucracy, sell off many assets and companies and introduce a new pension scheme. 'People will rise free all around the country, free of the apparatus of fear, free of political terrorism,' he said. Since entering politics 20 years ago, Mr Ramon has shaped himself as a dove on the peace issue and a reformer in social matters. He favours reforming the Labour movement. One of his targets has been the dominant power of organised labour. He advocates a social market philosophy. The affable Mr Ramon was elected to the Knesset (parliament) in 1983. Between 1988-1992 he was chairman of the Labour parliamentary faction, before Mr Rabin chose him as health minister. Mr Ramon has always been in the peace camp. He claims to have been the first, in 1987, to propose an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. As a member of the cabinet, he pressed Mr Rabin to open a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, then still a taboo in Israeli politics. Mr Ramon emerged as the charismatic leader of the 'Group of Eight', young left-wing Labour politicians including Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, who met as a virtual shadow cabinet to discuss how to change the party. But until February Mr Ramon was determined to fight from within. When the cabinet refused to back his health bill, he quit. 'He could have ended up in the political wilderness,' says a friend. 'But he had a brilliant sense for what ordinary people want; he grasped their desire for change.' Now, Mr Ramon can call the shots.</p>

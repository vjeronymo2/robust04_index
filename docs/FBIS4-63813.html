			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev believes that  the Black Sea Fleet is capable of resisting any provocations  against it. He stressed in an exclusive interview with Interfax  in Brussels today that the Black Sea Fleet was subordinate to  the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. This to say that any  unilateral actions towards the fleet are illegal, he pointed out.    Grachev said that Black Sea Fleet Commander, Admiral Eduard  Baltin was right when taking preventive measures and  strengthening defense of military facilities within the context  of the present situation in Crimea.    Commenting on movements by Ukrainian military formations in  Crimea, Grachev called this an attempt to exercise military and  psychological pressure on the Crimean leadership. This  represents no military threat. Ukrainian formations are acting  separately, he emphasized.    Grachev suggested that this was done in accordance with  orders of the Kiev leaders. However, he was sure that Ukraine  would not declare war on Crimea since it was a civilized state.    On 23 May Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk had discussed the situation in Crimea  on the phone. They had unanimously agreed that the situation in  Crimea was Ukraine's internal affair.    However, Grachev stressed that Russia could not overlook the  situation in Crimea. "If an armed conflict starts in this  region, it may lead to a civil war between eastern and western  Ukraine," Grachev suggested.    He emphasized that the presidents had concluded that the  situation must be settled by peace political means and  negotiations.</p>

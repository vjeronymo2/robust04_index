IFP Central Committee Executive member, Dr  Ngubane, said in a statement: "As far as we are concerned, last  Friday's deadline is immaterial as to whether or not we decide  to participate in the elections".    He said Inkatha had not missed the election boat, and would  still decide whether or not to join the April poll. This  decision was subject to negotiations on the modalities of  international mediation in South Africa's constitutional impasse.    Dr Ngubane also dismissed as "a lie" any suggestion that he  was considering leaving the IFP and changing parties in order to  fight the election. He said such a suggestion was aimed at  sowing division in the IFP. "It is a lie that I have considered  changing parties because last week's lapsed registration of  candidates deadline has ostensibly resulted in the IFP being  automatically disbarred from participating in elections. This  is patent nonsense. Not only would I not consider leaving the  IFP irrespective of our participation or otherwise, but as far  as we are concerned last Friday's deadline is immaterial as to  whether or not we decide to participate in the elections," Dr  Ngubane said.    Last week the IFP said it would not submit an election  candidates list until there was international mediation on  outstanding constitutional differences.    Mediation would have to achieve amendments to the interim  constitution, secure the position of Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini and rationalise the electoral process and timetables  to ensure a free and fair election in which all parties could  participate on an equal footing.    The IFP indicated the deadline for the registration of  parties and the submission of candidate lists could be changed  by proclamation by State President F W de Klerk. The body  governing elections, the Independent Electoral Commission, said  at the weekend that the time was up for parties to join the poll  because the ballot papers were already being printed.</p>

O ESTADO has  learned that the minister is not willing to be questioned by the  German Government, which conditions participation in programs  including the transfer of high technology to Brazilian  guarantees that it will use nuclear energy only for peaceful  purposes.    The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee must ratify amendments  to the Tlatelolco Treaty and to the quadripartite agreement  signed between Brazil, Argentina, the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for  Accounting and Control (ABACC). After months of negotiations,  Senator Dirceu Carneiro (Brazilian Social Democracy Party -  Santa Catarina), who coordinates the Committee's project for  nuclear safeguard, endorsed on 3 February amendments to the text  of the quadripartite agreement for the supervision of nuclear  research in Brazil. The text, however, was not voted on for  lack of quorum. There will probably be no quorum in the next  meeting of the Committee, which will take place on 10 February,  one day before the Carnival weekend begins.    Foreign Minister Amorim has not officially confirmed if he  will postpone his trip. He admitted on 4 February, however,  that he would like to continue negotiations with the German  Government. He said: "It would be much better if I could take  with me two ratified accords. Instead of being questioned about  them, we would be free to begin talks about scientific  cooperation and access to technology," adding: "I believe  Congress is fulfilling its duty and analyzing the texts." The  minister admitted that Germany may be "concerned" about possible  consequences of a delay in ratifying these agreements.  "Nonetheless, Germany is aware that the delay is not caused by  lack of interest," he said.</p>

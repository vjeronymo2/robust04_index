			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Sicily shows way to clean-up: A new law designed to get the influence of the Mafia out of local public-works planning and construction WHEN US troops stormed Sicilian beaches at Gela in July 1943, the small town they captured was one of thousands of island communities mired in poverty and decimated by emigration. Half a century later, Gela, its population now swollen to 80,000, is suffering a different, but equally chronic, ill: organised crime. Public services are a shambles; the council, suspected of collusion with the Mafia, has been replaced by a special administrator from Rome; and illegal building has buried ancient Greek remains under a mountain of concrete. Much of the damage has been done by poorly planned and badly executed public-works projects, their construction often influenced by Mafia-dominated organised crime. Needless roads, derelict houses and unfinished public buildings testify to the Mafia's infiltration of the building industry. To make matters worse, the work is seldom done well. The Mafia, leaning mostly on small and medium-sized construction companies, has traditionally demanded protection money, putting builders indirectly under mob influence. Increasingly, however, criminal organisations have also been creating their own companies to tap the lucrative construction market directly. Mrs Alice Grassi, widow of a Palermo businessman murdered for refusing to pay protection money, recalls the gradual escalation of pressure through telephone warnings and dead animals outside the factory gates to persuade her husband to bend. Unlike Mr Grassi, many businessmen eventually give way, paying bribes in a slow process that sometimes ends with ceding control of their companies to their new 'partners'. Earlier this year, a new Sicilian law intended to clean up public-sector construction contracts and loosen the Mafia's grip on building took effect. With construction in mainland Italy now in turmoil because of the political corruption scandal, some Sicilians think their new rules could be a model for the rest of the country. 'We had two aims,' says Mr Franco Magro, a Republican politician who became the island's public works minister after regional elections in 1992. 'To reduce the number of people who could award contracts, and to remove politicians from managing public works'. The new law has replaced the 1,400 bodies allowed to initiate building projects with one office for each of the island's nine provinces. Concentrating responsibility in far fewer hands has removed the powers of local authorities, which might have been under Mafia control, and made tendering much more transparent. 'Anyone who wants information about new contracts now knows just where to go. Previously, responsibilities were often duplicated and it was very difficult to find out who was in charge,' says Mr Magro. The stress on information should also help local authorities set budget priorities more clearly. Even when not influenced by organised crime, preliminary plans for new projects were often extremely vague. Often, the vagueness was deliberate, says Mr Magro. 'It was in the interest of politicians and builders to keep the plans unclear. Once a tender had been accepted, variations didn't require a new round of bidding. As the project grew, so did the kickbacks to politicians.' The new Sicilian law demands much greater detail about a project and forbids variations once approved. 'Public authorities must now explain why a contract is necessary and how it fits in with other schemes.' In addition they must declare from the start how much it will cost and how long it will take. While that might sound elementary, such rules were seldom observed in the past. Mr Magro admits there has been resistance to the new law, notably from civil servants who have lost their powers of patronage. Some builders have also complained about additional bureaucracy. Any company wanting to compete for public contracts must obtain a certificate from the local prefect verifying it is not linked to the Mafia. This involves checking police files and official data for any trace of a link. Critics say certification requirements, which have been operating for a decade, have not loosened the Mafia's grip on construction. 'The problem was that not enough was done in the past,' responds Mr Magro. 'The Mafia always tries to use honest citizens as front men. The controls will be even tighter now.' Mr Magro admits that centralising construction contracts will put those running the system at great personal risk. The provincial offices are also obvious targets for Mafia infiltration. The collusion of politicians with organised crime has been the main barrier to good government and efficient services in Sicily for decades, says Mr Magro. Many politicians have either been linked to the mob or have closed a blind eye to line their own pockets. But by 'depersonalising' the contract process and appointing reputable public servants such as retired judges and prefects to supervise it the residents of Gela, and hundreds of towns like it, hope that the new system will remain above board.</p>

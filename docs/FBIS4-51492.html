			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by King Norodom Sihanouk at palace audience on 28 </F> April in Phnom Penh -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Partly indistinct passage appealing for the  release of abducted foreigners] Now I would like to inform  foreign and local newspapers that the roundtable betwen the  Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and Khieu Samphan,  His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of  Democratic Kampuchea, in principle should take place from 2 to 7  May to find a common means to build and restore a peaceful and  independent Cambodia with its territorial integrity to avoid  fighting. Our compatriots have suffered constantly because of  this war. I would like to ask that this fighting end and to  have peace and security for our compatriots everywhere  throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia.    Some do not listen to me, to the king. They keep saying that  they love and respect the king, but in words only not in deeds.  Therefore, I would like to again beg them to stop fighting and  turn to talk peacefully to solve the problem.    Khieu Samphan, H.E. Khieu Samphan, has said that there is no  security for him in Phnom Penh. H.E. Hun Sen, Samdech Hun Sen  and Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh said they can give a 100  percent guarantee that there will be no danger to H.E. Khieu  Samphan and other Khmer Rouge members who attend the roundtable  to talk peacefully. This is 100 percent guaranteed. Despite  this, H.E. Khieu Samphan and his group do not trust it. They  want me to take this roundtable to foreign countries instead of  meeting in our country. The royal government replied that no,  leaving our country would be a disgrace to our nation, which  requires that this be held in our country.    H.E. Khieu Samphan, please reply to my message, sent to you  on 24 April. It is already 28 April and H.E. Khieu Samphan has  not yet replied. Please reply quickly so that I may have enough  time to organize the roundtable.    If he refuses to come to Phnom Penh for the meeting,  however,  we will have to postpone it and discuss the matter if this  cannot be done in Phnom Penh and about the place he wants the  meeting to be held. In Siem Reap? It seems that he wants to go  Siem Reap. But I am not sure. Wait until Khieu Samphan writes  to me and is clear. Since he has not written yet, today I cannot  inform our compatriots and the foreign and local newspapers.  So, wait until he answers, then this answer will be  disseminated. In fact, he wants to meet abroad, China, Korea,  France, or Indonesia. I do not know. Wait until Khieu Samphan  writes, then I will inform you. Thank you.

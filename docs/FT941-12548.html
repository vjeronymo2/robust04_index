			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone hosiery sale to Courtaulds Textiles Hartstone yesterday clinched the first step towards securing its future by selling a large part of its hosiery division to Courtaulds Textiles in a Pounds 45.4m deal and announcing plans for a rights issue later this year. It is understood that the company, which breached banking covenants last summer and has since had several narrow escapes from receivership, is also close to agreement on medium term financing. It is thought this will cover the group's needs for between two to three years. However, any refinancing will depend on an equity issue, which is expected to raise roughly Pounds 25m. An announcement is expected before the extraordinary meeting on February 14, the day before the standstill agreement is due to expire. Hartstone is selling Cogetex of France, which it bought for Pounds 41m in 1991, and the lossmaking UK hosiery business based in Sutton-in-Ashfield which includes Bear brand. The two businesses had total sales last year of Pounds 102m and take Courtaulds Textiles for the first time into the European hosiery market. The deal will eliminate off-balance sheet debt of about Pounds 20m and leave Hartstone's gearing at 118 per cent (200 per cent). It leaves Hartstone with Aznar, the Spanish company also purchased in 1991, some UK hosiery interests and a large leather goods business, mainly US based. Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman, said the group could only afford to focus on one of the two main divisions if it was to survive. The hosiery division had suffered extensively from recession in continental Europe, which had delayed benefits from rationalisation. However, the leather goods business, which includes the well-known Etienne Aigner brand name, required 'half the manpower, half the assets and has twice the profits,' Mr Dowling said. Last year leather goods returned trading profits of Pounds 12.4m, a decline of 34 per cent. The remaining hosiery businesses, with sales last year of Pounds 86m, will be retained for the time being. Courtaulds Textiles has agreed to retain Aznar as a supplier to Cogetex. Hartstone is expected to review the future of Aznar and the UK hosiery businesses in about two years. Mr Noel Jarvis, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said the businesses acquired had 'considerable potential despite the present tough trading conditions'. They were expected to contribute trading profits for the year to March 1994 of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m. They were also likely to result in a small increase in earnings. Courtaulds Textiles is paying Pounds 37.4m cash upon completion, a further Pounds 3.5m upon agreement of a completion statement and the balance in stages over a four-year period. It said the purchase price represented a premium over net assets of Pounds 8.7m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Secretary General of the Straits Exchange  Foundation [SEF] Chiao Jen-ho Wednesday called on Chinese in  both Taiwan and Mainland China to break away from ideological  restraints so that intellectuals can bring out their talents and  wisdom to the foremost. He made the statement in a visit to a  new technology industrial zone in Beijing. Chiao is in Beijing  for three rounds of talks with his Mainland Chinese counterpart,  Secretary General of the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait, Tang Shubei. The two nominally private but  government-funded organizations are entrusted by Taipei and  Peking [as heard] to handle bilateral affairs in absence of  official channels. During the first round on Tuesday afternoon,  both sides expressed their [words indistinct] respective stances  which differed vastly. Taipei reiterated that Beijing should  recognize and respect its judicial jurisdiction and legal  system. Conversely, Beijing argued that now that the two sides  are presently in a state of separation, it should not be  permitted to continue permanently.</p>

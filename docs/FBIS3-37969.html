[Chornovil] If I were president, I would not sign anything  that would contradict Supreme Council resolutions on this issue.  This does not mean that we want to become "very nuclear."  However, if I have some property that costs a million and sell  it for three kopecks, I am either a bad economist or a little  mentally deficient. This means I should not be permitted to  manage anything, even my own household. The compensations that  we are offered are really miserable and do not cover our  expenditures on eliminating these arms. The removal of all  SS-24 missiles in 10 months, including those whose warranty time  period is far from expiring, is simply unwise. In light of the  developments in our region, we should have insisted on more  security assurances as well.    I believe that the process of nuclear disarmament could be  protracted and last 10 to 15 years. This period would give us  time to get back on our feet economically, and strengthen our  defense potential. The world community would become accustomed  to the fact that there is a country in East Europe named  Ukraine. We need at least seven years to remove the nuclear  arms envisioned by START I.    [Kalinowski] What could be Ukraine's reaction if the merging  of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is followed by  these states' reunification?    [Chornovil] For Ukraine, this would be a very dangerous  process, and I once pointed this out to Stanislav Shushkevich.  In fact, a wedge would be driven between Ukraine and the  Baltics, granting Russia access to Poland. Strategically,  Ukraine would be surrounded. Ukraine, unlike Belarus, is still  upholding its independence. Thus, it is clear that our reaction  would be negative. However, we would not shout about this,  because this would amount to meddling in another state's affairs.    [Kalinowski] Would that be a death sentence on the  Baltic-Black Sea Commonwealth?    [Chornovil] Nobody has ever tried to implement this idea; it  was still up in the air and discussed as a possible project.  Due to your question, I have just realized another danger of  this "wedge" -- it will ruin the project.    [Kalinowski] I would like to bring up the open letter to  Mikhail Gorbachev published in SVABODA on 22 October 1987. The  letter carried your thesis that "the Soviet administration gave  Belarus part of Brest and Pinsk Oblasts, that are ethnic  Ukrainian territories." Many Belarusians were gravely concerned.    [Chornovil] I have always advocated inviolability of  borders. However, a large Ukrainian community resides in Brest  Oblast, while the population in some parts is totally Ukrainian.  Only a very uneducated or a very biased person would deny this  fact. This is the way the border was demarcated. Incidentally,  a Belarusian region near Gomel was annexed to Ukraine, while  Kuban was given to Russia. The same happened to Taganrog that  belonged to Ukraine until 1926. We should not dispute the  current borders. Yet, we should guarantee that  national-cultural demands of the Ukrainians are met in Belarus,  and that these people maintain contacts with Ukraine. By the  way in Transcarpathia, we have a rayon totally populated by  Hungarians. This is a historic reality and one cannot do  anything about it. Aside from supplying textbooks and training  teachers for Ukrainian schools in that region, there can be no  other presence of the Ukrainian state there. A similar  situation is in Moldova where 600,000 Ukrainians live.  Ukrainian elementary and high schools are opening there now, as  was once done in Romania. Assisting ethnic minorities is part of  interstate relations. If everything is done on the basis of the  Helsinki agreement, such assistance will be advantageous for  everyone and no hindrance for good-neighborly relations between  Belarus and Ukraine.    [Kalinowski] Observers have recently pointed out that  relations, including economic ones, between Belarus and Ukraine  have been deteriorating. Why is that?    [Chornovil] In my opinion, Belarus has been too oriented  toward Russia, instead of trying to create a certain  counterbalance. If Belarus is too attached to one partner, it  will never become an independent state. Even the United States  does not buy more than a couple percent of its energy resources  from one country, to avoid becoming dependent. If all the  former Soviet republics united, the CIS could become an  organization serving the interests of all its members, not just  Russia. Unfortunately, Russia has been winning these states one  by one by means of gifts, promises, and influencing the loyal  nomenklatura.</p>

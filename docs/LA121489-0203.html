			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANS ACCEPT TURN OF EVENTS ON 'BEAUTY, BEAST'  </P> <P> All through the summer, loyal fans worried and wrote letters protesting CBS'  placing "Beauty and the Beast" on hiatus for retooling. They worried about  pregnant "Beauty" Linda Hamilton leaving the show to have her baby. They  fretted over the producers' decision to stress action over romance to woo the  male viewer. Most of all, they worried that CBS would never bring "Beauty and  the Beast" back at all.  </P> <P> But Tuesday night, the "Beast" was back -- with a two-hour season opener that  killed off Linda Hamilton's character, featured much violence and mayhem and  proved that chaste romance can't last forever as Catherine gave birth to a  child fathered by Vincent.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that, as CBS warned, "it's not a fairy tale anymore," however,  fans appeared Wednesday to have accepted the changes with little protest.  </P> <P> CBS reported "no more calls than usual" following the episode, and Witt-Thomas  Productions received no immediate protest, said co-executive producer Paul  Junger Witt.  </P> <P> "We did our best to explain what the situation was, and to reassure (fans) that  the essence of 'Beauty and the Beast' would be retained. . . . We honestly  don't think we compromised," Witt said.  </P> <P> Fans, for the most part, agreed. None contacted by The Times on Wednesday  objected to the end of Catherine and Vincent's chaste status. And only one of  those interviewed, Donna Koich, 44, of Warminster, Pa., criticized the new,  more violent Vincent as "a furry Incredible Hulk."  </P> <P> "I was well-pleased," said Stephanie Wiltse, 35, of Albany, N.Y. "You have  Romeo and Juliet, except that Romeo survives, and there's a child. I don't  think the violence was gratuitous; there was a balletic feel to it."  </P> <P> Kimberly Hartman, 33, of Fullerton remained eager to see how the story will  develop, but wished that Catherine and Vincent had gotten married before  consummating their relationship, in the tradition of mythic fables.  </P> <P> Julie Hamburg of North Hollywood did not mind Catherine and Vincent's getting a  little closer: "It was getting almost contrived that they could go for two  years without even a kiss," she said.  </P> <P> But she doesn't want Vincent to fall in love with another woman this season.  "I'm going to have a major problem with this, after they set up Catherine as  being his life, his soul," she said.  </P> <P> The program garnered a 13.3 rating (about 12.2 million homes) and 24% of the  available audience. Last season "Beauty and the Beast" averaged a 10.6 rating  (9.6 million homes) and an 18 share.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China hopes to develop  long-term and stable cooperative relations with other countries  and learn from their strong points, a senior Chinese official  said here today.    Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, said this while  meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene here.    The two leaders praised the successful cooperation between  China and Belgium in economy and trade and hoped for a long-term  and stable development of their friendly ties.    Li said that his Europe tour sought to learn from other  states their experiences which will benefit China. China's  cooperation with the outside world would promote both its own  modernization and global peace and development as well, he added.    He said China was far behind the Western countries in  economy  and science as it had to spend time and energy over the past  century winning national liberation from the imperialist  aggression.    Starting to open itself to the world and the international  market in the 1980s, he said, China had been drawing on the  experiences of other countries, accelerating its development and  contributing to the international community.    The Belgian prime minister, meanwhile, hailed the friendship  between the two countries, noting that the exchange of  high-level visits had increased in recent years and Belgium had  made more and more investment in China.    He predicted that China's rapid economic growth would have a  significant influence upon Asia.    Dehaene added that his country pays great attention to and  appreciates China's constructive role in the United Nations  Security Council.    He also expressed confidence that Li's visit would promote  Sino- Belgian ties in the political and economic fields.    The Chinese official arrived here Tuesday [17 May] for a  five- day visit to Belgium, the last leg of his  five-European-nation tour.</p>

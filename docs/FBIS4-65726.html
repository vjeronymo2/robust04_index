			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ZDF Political Barometer: Mood in </F> May; Optimism Is Prevailing Again"]    [Text] Never before after the all-German Bundestag  elections have the citizens in east Germany assessed the general  economic situation as optimistically as this month: A total of  4 percent described it as good (3 percent in April), 53 percent  (45) believe that it is partly good and partly bad, and only 43  percent (52) consider it bad.    Increasing optimism is also noticeable in the assessment of  the further economic development in Germany: For the first time  this year, a majority of Germans (52 percent) believe that the  German economy will improve. In fact, optimism is still greater  than in the east, but it has increased in both parts of Germany.  <H5>  Remarkable Trends </H5>   These two trends are among the most remarkable results of  the  May poll which was carried out by the Mannheim election research  group among over 2,000 citizens in east and west German for the  ZDF political barometer.    The general political mood has changed in different ways in  east and west Germany in the past four weeks: In the west,  support for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union [CDU/CSU] has slightly declined, whereas it has clearly  increased in the east. the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] achieved slightly better results in the west, but lost  considerable support in the east. There have been no changes  for the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], which would  receive under 5 percent of the vote. Support for Alliance  90/Greens has slightly dropped both in the east and the west.  In the whole of Germany, the CDU/CSU was supported by 35  percent in May (unchanged), the SPD by 41, and the FDP by 4  percent. Alliance 90/Greens received 9 percent (-\2 percentage  points), and all other parties together 11 percent (+\2),  including the Republikaner at 4 (+\2), and the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS] at 4 percent (unchanged).    As usual, these results have not been assessed according to  their political significance. Thus, a comparison of the  question concerning future voter behavior and the popularity  measurements of the political barometer with the politically  assessed results of other polling institutes is only possible to  a limited extent. For this reason, the political barometer  publishes the "projection," which means that the political mood  measured in the topical investigations are projected to an  election result ("If Bundestag elections were held next  Sunday..."). This calculated projection is based on findings  concerning the long-term stability of voter behavior during  Bundestag elections resulting from the social structures, and on  findings concerning the theoretical outcome of Bundestag  elections under "normal" conditions. In May the result is as  follows: CDU/CSU 38 percent (+\1 percent as compared with last  April), SPD 39 percent (unchanged), FDP 5 percent (unchanged),  Alliance 90/Greens 8 percent (-\1), other parties 10 percent  (unchanged), including the Republikaner at 4 and the PDS at 3  percent. Thus, a coalition between the SPD and the Alliance  90/Greens could rely on a parliamentary majority (47 percent) in  May, too.  <H5>  Good Rating for the Government </H5>   Satisfaction with the government -- as usually measured on  the basis of a scale reaching from +\5 (very satisfied) to -\5  (very dissatisfied) -- has again improved throughout Germany in  May. to -\0.4 percent. This is the best rating for the  government since May 1992; in April it was still -\0.6, and in  March -\0.9. At 0.3, the performance of the SPD in its  opposition role has been assessed slightly better in May than in  April (0.2)    What is remarkable about the results of the poll by the  election research group in May is that the popularity of the 10  major politicians -- according of those polled -- has not  decreased: Chancellor Helmut Kohl's popularity has slightly  increased throughout Germany from 0.1 to 0.3, Labor Minister  Norbert Bluem improved his rating from 0.7 to 0.9, Finance  Minister Theo Waigel from -\0.4 to -\0.2, Parliamentary  President Rita Suessmuth from 1.0 to 1.1, and CDU/CSU Bundestag  group leader Wolfgang Schaeuble from 0.9 to 1.1.   <H5>    Preference for Scharping </H5>   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's popularity has clearly  increased throughout Germany (from 0.4 to 0.7 percent).  Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who is still considered one of the 10  major politicians by the population, received a rating of 2.6 in  May (2.5 in April).    At 1.1, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping reached the same value  as in April throughout Germany. The popularity of the SPD's  presidential candidate Johannes Rau has clearly increased --  from -\1.5 to +\1.9. Nothing changed for Brandenburg Labor  Minister Regine Hildebrandt (1.8 percent; known to 61 percent).    In May, too, the majority of the German population prefers  Rudolf Scharping as new chancellor. His lead over Kohl has  again increased slightly. A total of 40 percent of all those  polled would prefer Helmut Kohl as chancellor. In April the  percentage was 39 and in May 35 percent. Fifty-one percent  would like a Chancellor Scharping. The share of those who did  not want to or could not make a decision dropped to 9 percent in  May. It is true that, at 55 percent, support for Scharping is  still greater in east Germany than in the west (50), but the  difference has become smaller. Support for Kohl, too, is  largely the same in east (39) and west Germany (40).    Sixteen percent of all Germans believe that it is already  clear who will win the next Bundestag elections in October; 83  percent are of the opposite view. In May, the majority of  Germans also expect a victory of the Bonn opposition parties,  but the lead over the CDU/CSU has decreased. In the whole of  Germany, 40 percent believe in a victory of the SPD and its  leader, and 5 percent in a majority for a coalition between the  SPD and Alliance 90/Greens. A total of 27 percent expect a  victory of the CDU/CSU and of Helmut Kohl, 5 percent a  continuation of the existing government coalition, and 15  percent do not know who will win the next Bundestag election. An  election victory by the CDU/CSU is considered more likely in the  west. The same applies to the SPD. A grand coalition or an  alliance between the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens is viewed  more likely in the east.  <H5>  Mood for Rau as President </H5>   In the event that no party can govern on its own, the  following preferences resulted form the May poll: Coalition  between the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens 24 percent, grand  coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) 23 percent, and continuation of the  existing coalition 15 percent.    A few days before the election of the president by the  Federal Assembly, Johannes Rau enjoys a clear lead among the  population. Asked about the president they would prefer out of  four candidates, exactly 50 percent chose Rau, 19 percent Roman  Herzog, 16 percent Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, and 4 percent Jens  Reich. Every 10th German has not yet made up his mind. The  preference for Rau is even clearer in the east (53 percent) than  in the west (49 percent). Herzog can rely on more support in the  old laender (20 percent) than in the east (16 percent).  Irrespective of the popularity among the population, 40 percent  expect Herzog to win presidential elections; only every third  German believes in a victory for Johannes Rau.    In May the fight against unemployment was again the major  topic in Germany --even though its significance declined  slightly in the east and the west. Asked to mention two issues,  without any suggestions being given, 55 percent of the west  Germans chose unemployment. It was followed by asylum and  foreigners (31 percent), right-wing radicalism (17),  environmental protection (13), inflation and economic  developments (12), crime, law and order (7), rents and housing  (6), problems resulting from German unification (5), other  social problems (5), weariness of politics (5), and taxes (5).    The priorities are as follows in the east: Unemployment  (79), crime, law and order (17), problems resulting from  unification (14), asylum and foreigners (10), rents and housing,  right-wing radicalism, economic developments and upswing (9  percent each), other social problems (7), pensions, peace and  detente, reduction of social benefits, and environmental  protection (5 percent each).</p>

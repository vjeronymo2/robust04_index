			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY STARTS WITH PALOS VERDES GIRLS FAVORED  </P> <P> Palos Verdes High School's cross-country teams have enjoyed a tremendous  winning tradition in the last 20 years. The success has been attributed to  everything from a strong running tradition in the community to the relatively  clean air on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  </P> <P> There have even been hushed accusations that Palos Verdes coaches recruit their  athletes.  </P> <P> But the Sea Kings are guilty of only one thing, says ninth-year Coach Joe  Kelly: "Our kids are totally committed. We run cross-country differently than  some schools. We have many more kids working much harder. They've got a great  work ethic."  </P> <P> They've also got a great record. Since 1974, the Palos Verdes High's boys and  girls teams have combined for seven CIF-Southern Section championships, four  second-place finishes and two state titles.  </P> <P> The boys have won 16 of the last 18 Bay League championships, and the girls  have won the last nine. In recent years, the girls haven't stopped at the  league championship; they have won four consecutive Southern Section 4-A titles  and back-to-back Division I state crowns.  </P> <P> Kelly realizes that while the past triumphs are nice, they can't carry the team  this year. Neither the boys nor the girls have run on a flat, standard-length  course, so Kelly says he "has no idea where we are right now."  </P> <P> Opposing coaches have a pretty good idea. They've ranked the Palos Verdes girls  No. 1 in the 4-A Division and the boys No. 10.  </P> <P> Here's a closer look at the Sea Kings and other top teams in the South Bay,  beginning with the girls:  </P> <P> "We've graduated four quality seniors," Kelly said of Palos Verdes, "but we  have some good young girls coming up." The biggest loss was Ashley Black, an  all-state performer.  </P> <P> Sophomore Maya Muneno, a varsity letter winner in '88, leads a close pack of  Sea King harriers. Juniors Karen Zareski and Joanna Della Gatta are "extremely  committed runners," Kelly said.  </P> <P> Top newcomers include sophomore Yoko Senga and freshman Tammy Wilcox. Senior  Cindy Scribe adds valuable experience.  </P> <P> Despite their youth, the Sea Kings are prohibitive favorites in the Bay League.  They've already won the Royal Invitational at Moorpark College. "I can't see  anybody challenging them," Torrance Coach Jerry Holland said.  </P> <P> West Torrance Coaches Greg Houlgate and LuAnne Howard were pleasantly surprised  by their team's performance at the Warren Invitational last Saturday.  </P> <P> Freshman Angie Parks, daughter of the late West Coach Ron Parks, led the team.  Julie Shepard, Kelly Chang and Kathy Cabuno also ran well and could tilt the  balance of power in the Ocean League in West's favor.  </P> <P> Mira Costa Coach Dave Holland, whose brother Jerry coaches at Torrance, is  trying to nurture a strong cross-country tradition like Palos Verdes'. The  Mustang girls were CIF champs in 1981 and '82, though they have slipped in  recent years.  </P> <P> Senior Joanne Ulibarri has the potential to win the Ocean League individual  championship. Holland said Ulibarri has a tendency to lose concentration but  has performed well in early meets, placing fifth in the senior division at the  Laguna Hills Invitational.  </P> <P> Mira Costa figures to battle West Torrance and Redondo for the Ocean League  title.  </P> <P> "This Banning team could be better than the one that won the City championship  in '78," Coach Don Mulligan said. Mulligan did not predict an L.A. City title,  but the Pacific League championship is within reach.  </P> <P> Luci Mendoza, the City 10th-grade champion in '87, leads the team with a year  of varsity experience. Junior Elva Robles and senior Maura Castillo are the  other top runners. Sophomore Elizabeth Aguilar is a promising newcomer.  </P> <P> Coach Bill Mocnik is in his 13th year of coaching cross country at Carson, but  his enthusiasm has not waned. Part of the reason is senior Noelle Ragland, a  track sprinter who was the Pacific League champion last year.  </P> <P> Junior Jellerine Venadas is another young Colt who should improve and  contribute.  </P> <P> Torrance is in for a tough year, according to Coach Jerry Holland. Sophomore  Jessica Reifer, a soccer player by trade, is the team's top runner.  </P> <P> Miraleste, ranked No. 9 in the Southern Section 1-A poll, is another team to  watch.  </P> <P> Last season was rough for the Palos Verdes boys. Not only did the girls' team  steal the national spotlight, but the Sea King boys failed to win the Bay  League championship for only the second time in 18 years.  </P> <P> Coach Kelly and his charges are determined to knock off '88 champs Beverly  Hills and bring the Bay League championship trophy back to "The Hill."  </P> <P> Leading the repossession effort are senior Sean Yoder, juniors Aaron Rogers and  Joe Snider, and sophomores Dennis Yu and Goss Lindsey.  </P> <P> The five are currently running 28 seconds apart and helped Palos Verdes finish  second at the Royal Invitational.  </P> <P> Israel Pose of Torrance won the junior division at the Warren Invitational,  giving hope that the Tartars can challenge Palos Verdes and Beverly Hills for  the Bay League title.  </P> <P> But Coach Jerry Holland said the other runners on the team must approach Pose,  including seniors Shin Nishihara and Aaron Morris. Morris is a converted pole  vaulter who has run cross-country for only two years.  </P> <P> First-year Coach Houlgate of West Torrance said his team is deep and should win  the Ocean League championship. West is ranked No. 8 in the Southern Section 3-A  poll.  </P> <P> Last week at the Warren Invitational, the Warriors came in fifth, losing only  to Torrance among area teams.  </P> <P> Joe Miles came in third overall with a three-mile time of 15:28, followed on  the team by Andy Kim and Kenji Sumino. Houlgate said he was pleasantly  surprised by the performance of two newcomers, sophomore Geoff DeLahante and  junior Bryan Morris.  </P> <P> Last year Tim Forney's Bishop Montgomery Knights placed third in the tough  Angelus League to make their first post-season appearance in five years.  </P> <P> Senior Joe McDonald, the winner in his age group at the Palos Verdes marathon  last summer, will try to lead the Knights back to championship competition.  Senior team captain Matt Simons is another standout, while first-time  cross-country runner Erik Germain is also expected to do well. Pushing the pack  will be senior Ricardo Vargas and juniors Lucian Shigg and Kevin Chalk.  </P> <P> Carson Coach Mocnik hopes youth will be served in the race for the City  Section's Pacific League title. Junior Steven Gonzales showed tremendous  promise as a 10th-grader, winning the City sophomore championship in the mile  last spring and running the 3,200 meters in 9:33.  </P> <P> Richard Raya is the defending Pacific League champion. He'll team with Raul  Miglietti, Bill Stout and Gonzales to form a tough Colt foursome. "The key is  finding a fifth man; then we could beat (Pacific League foes) Banning, Narbonne  and San Pedro," Mocnik said.  </P> <P> Carson will have trouble beating Banning if Pilot Coach Mulligan can develop  the City's Bee champions into effective varsity runners. Junior Roman Rendon  was the only runner to beat Carson's Gonzales last year and should be the  team's top competitor.  </P> <P> Mike Bryson, Efrain Berumen and Rafael Chavez are inexperienced, but their  progress will be the key to Banning's title quest.  </P> <P> Mira Costa Coach Dave Holland is expecting his Mustangs to run somewhere in the  middle of the Ocean League. Scott Yetter and Jeff Fauber are the top runners.  </P></p>

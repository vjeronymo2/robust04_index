			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Presidency of the Republic; date </F> not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Brother citizens, the National  Salvation Revolution was begun in the defense of this homeland,  which had been overwhelmed by the dangers of fragmentation and  infighting. National unity was threatened and the economy was  in a state of collapse and stagnation. Corruption and nepotism  were rampant because of the weakness of the rulers and the  absence of a true course and higher ideals. Further fuel was  added to the fire by party differences and improper press  practices linked to private benefits and foreign interests.    The principles of the National Salvation Revolution were  opposed to all that. It replaced division with unity. Defense  and the struggle for the sake of God and the homeland replaced  caution and surrender to enemies. It raised aloft the ideals of  purity and impartiality over and above corruption. It raised  aloft the banner of the brilliant Islamic law in place of a  confused and baffled course. It worked to establish a new  society guided by clear ideals linked to heaven.    The revolution established institutions for popular and  political work and embarked on policies for reforming the  economy, the education sector and society. The ship sailed on,  guided by God, confident of victory despite storms, challenges,  and trials.    When the revolution provided opportunities for consultation  and advice, it issued regulations, but some people, whose minds  were narrowed against the revolution and who hated it, thought  that their opportunity had come to achieve their dreams and the  dreams of those who supported them, to drag the country back to  the hated and painful past. Among these was the newspaper  AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI, which gathered a clique blinded by the  brilliance of money which was generously given to them, and by  the fear of the foreigner whom they thought was God disposing of  the universe. They were also friendly to the alliances and the  ghosts of the past, which feed on illusions and live on mirages.    The paper permits its pens to harm the noblest causes of the  homeland in the struggle and defense of its creed and unity. It  raises doubts about the purpose and the struggle of the Armed  Forces and the popular defense forces. It calls for the  separation and negligence of the unity of the country, for which  many martyrs have fallen and colored with their pure blood.    The martyrs march forward, liberating every inch of the  country until they attain victory -- and they will attain it,  God willing.    These journalists have worked to fragment national unity by  raising doubts about the option of the people and the  revolution, about the political system and the popular and  constitutional bodies. They have called for a return to  parties, sectarianism, and tribal conflict. They have waged a  psychological war against the Armed Forces and the other regular  forces, falsely accusing some of them on having committed  excesses and oppression, and denigrating the strength of others  in so far as the protection of the citizens and their property  were concerned.    They resorted to magnifying simple incidents with the  intention of influencing the security of citizens and the  homeland. They then raised the charge of corruption and spread  rumors, without providing any evidence or proof, in spite of the  call made by the minister of justice, the attorney general,  stressing the revolution's readiness and its firm commitment to  establish the truth and to punish anyone whose criminality was  proved. They intended by these acts to harm the revolution and  its noblest intentions, namely righteousness and impartiality.    Finally they crowned all this with a premeditated design to  kill respect for the revolution and its symbols. They became  arrogant without any justification, committed excesses without  any proof, and made allegations without any evidence.    Brothers, the revolution has promised God, then its people,  to go to the end of the road to achieve clear victory and God's  favor. It has proffered martyrs as evidence of its sincerity  and a sign of devotion, and will not retreat or withdraw. God  willing out of fear, nor will it bow before anyone other than  God. [sentence as heard]    An order has been issued in accordance with emergency rules  to close this newspaper. The organs concerned will call to  account all those who have exceeded the bounds and overstepped  the limits. Those who have done wrong shall know the end they  will meet. God is great, glory to Islam, God is great, victory  to Sudan.</p>

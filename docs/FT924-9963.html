			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ciments Francais pressed on Spanish share deals CIMENTS Francais, the French cement company embroiled in a scandal over its off-balance sheet share dealings, has been asked by the Spanish stock market authorities for details of its dealings in Spain by the end of this week. The bulk of Ciments Francais off-balance sheet transactions  - FFr890m (Dollars 170m) out of FFr1.05bn  - were conducted in Spain. It is thought that the dealings could have involved Cementos Molins, a Spanish cement maker, in which the French company already holds a minority stake. This may mean that Ciments Francais is compelled to make a formal offer for more shares. Under Spanish takeover regulations, if an investor holding more than 25 per cent of a company buys another 6 per cent within a year, it is required to bid for a further 10 per cent. Ciments Francais already owns 25.3 per cent of Cementos Molins as a result of a transaction in 1986. Ciments Francais declined to comment on whether it had raised its stake in Cementos Molins. However, it said that, if its stake had been raised by more than 6 per cent in a year, it would explore 'other solutions' apart from an outright bid. Mr Bernard Laplace, who last month succeeded Mr Pierre Conso as chairman of Ciments Francais after the latter's dismissal, held discussions last Friday with the Spanish stock market authorities. Ciments Francais, which last week announced substantial interim losses, is under intense financial pressure over the off-balance sheet losses. As a result, both the Spanish authorities and Cementos Molins are expected to support a compromise solution rather than insisting on a formal bid.</p>

Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' led the Syrian team and  Mr. Karolos Papoulias, the Greek foreign minister, whose country  holds the current presidency of the EU, led the European side.  The talks were also joined by EU Commissioner General Hans Van  den Broek; Yusuf Shakkur, Syria's assistant foreign minister;  and the directors of the Economic Department, Western Europe  Department, and the Information Department. For the EU side,  the meeting was also attended by Mr. (Khristos Zakharakis),  director general of the Greek Foreign Ministry; the director  general of bilateral relations at the ministry; and Mr. (Sham  Kunwa), an ambassador at the EU; and Mr. Yeorios Yennimatas, the  Greek ambassador in Damascus.    Discussions reviewed Middle East developments in light of  the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its serious implications for the  situation in the occupied Arab territories, the region, and the  peace process.    Mr. al-Shar' pointed to the unending obstacles Israel places  in the path of peace, and its lack of seriousness in the search  for a fair and comprehensive peace in the region. Europe's  potential role in the peace process and Syrian-EU cooperation  was also discussed. [passage omitted]</p>

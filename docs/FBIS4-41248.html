			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 17/6/1994 -- According to the  estimations of the Moldovan Ministry of Defense (MD) experts,  all units of the 14th Russian Army could be withdrawn within  four months after the necessary documents are signed, declared  to BASA Colonel Ion Gurulea, chief of the MD Engineering  Department, permanent member of the Moldovan delegation at the  Moldovan-Russian negotiations on the withdrawal of the 14th  Army. Gurulea specified that the document stipulating the  withdrawal of these troops forces both Russia and Moldova to  negotiate with the Ukraine concerning the transportation of the  armament on its railways. Anatol Cosciug, chief of the MD  Department of Military Policy and Negotiations, declared to BASA  that technically all the units of the 14th Army can be withdrawn  in the time-frame suggested by the Moldovan delegation, the  deadline being 31 December 1995-1 January 1996. Cosciug also  stated that the political aspect of the problem is often  exaggerated, as the withdrawal of the Russian troops is also  conditioned by the socio-political situation in Dniester. The  cited source also specified that no alterations were made in the  technical aspects of the agreements.</p>

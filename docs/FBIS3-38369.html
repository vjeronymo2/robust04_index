			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gerhard Hertenberger report: "BMW Invests Billions"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- The BMW automobile corporation will  invest 3.4 billion schillings (financed from cash flow) in the  fourth expansion phase of its engine works in Steyr, Austria, by  the end of 1996. In 1993, 1.3 billion schillings were spent;  this year 1 billion is planned. It is expected that about 15  percent of subsidies, which correspond to European Union  regulations, will be paid. So far, BMW has invested 13.5  billion schillings in Austria. In 1995-96 an additional 300 jobs  will be created in Steyr on top of the existing 2,000, said  Werner Saemann, chairman of the board of directors of BMW  Austria.    Last year the turnover of the BMW group in Austria declined  by 15 percent from 18.2 to 15.5 billion schillings. Still,  Saemann said that the result is "very satisfying," but it is  below the 1.6-billion-schilling gross revenues of 1992.    In Steyr, 331,200 (in 1992 -- 379,000) engines with a  17-percent proportion of diesel engines were produced. Domestic  creation of value is given at about 20 percent. Turnover from  exports amounted to 11.7 billion schillings (in 1992 13.8  billion). The entire purchasing volume of the BMW corporation  in Austria amounted to 14.7 billion schillings in 1993 (in 1992  17 billion). Saemann does not rule out future deliveries of BMW  diesel engines from Steyr to Rover.    With 8,848 passenger cars and 515 motorcycles (3.3 billion  schillings turnover), automotive sales declined by 25.8 percent  and sales of two-wheeled vehicles declined by 6 percent. This  year 10,000 cars and 850 motorcycles are to be sold in new  models (manager Clary: "A normal year for BMW").</p>

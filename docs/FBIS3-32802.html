			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rene Hurtado] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado Figueroa  has said that the report presented by the United Nations, and  which was written by Pedro Nikkens, stating that a systematic  violation of human rights continues in El Salvador "is very  politicized and not in accordance with the country's reality."    The aforementioned report was made public a few weeks ago.  Nikkens states that human rights violations persist in our  country. However, Gen. Corado believes that "these violations  are not systematic nor are the number of violations as high as  years ago. The report gives the impression that in our country  there is a lot fear and that no activities can be conducted  because it is not safe." Gen. Corado said: "It is indispensable  that the United Nations draft these reports in a balanced and  impartial manner and not politicize them."    With regard to the legalization of private weapons, Minister  Corado said that the Defense Ministry is opening a special  office where interested parties can go and request a license to  carry a weapon. The first office will be opened in San  Salvador. At a later date offices will be opened throughout the  country. Corado said that the appropriate guidelines are being  drafted and that they should be ready in the next few days.    Regarding the Salvadoran Air Force A-37 aircraft that  crashed  at sea off the coast of La Paz Department, Gen. Corado said that  despite the efforts made it has been impossible to rescue the  crew and that it is believed that the pilot, Captain Julio Cesar  Godoy Aguirre, and technician, Juan Carlos Ramirez, died in the  accident.</p>

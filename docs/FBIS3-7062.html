I wish to offer my hearty welcome to your excellency the  president of the Republic of Korea, now paying a visit to this  country as a state guest with Mrs. Kim Yong-sam. It gives me  utmost pleasure to be able to have the company of your  excellency, Mrs. Kim Yong-sam and the members of their suite at  this banquet.    Your country is the nearest neighbor to us. Exchanges  between our people date back to ancient times preceding the  descriptions in history books. A variety of arts and sciences  were introduced to Japan by your people and our ancestors  learned many things from your people.    In the course of long and close exchanges between our two  countries, there was a period during which my country inflicted  great many sufferings on the people of the Korean peninsula. As  I expressed my deep sorrow over this some years ago, I always  have the same feeling. Since the end of the war, our people, on  the basis of the lesson of the past history, have endeavored to  build up unshaken trust and friendship with your people.    I am gratified that friendship and cooperative relations  between our two countries have recently been advanced in many  different fields thanks to the continuous enthusiasm and efforts  of their people and that the ties binding the nations have been  strengthened, as seen in the "Korean cultural envoy" events  including the Kaya cultural exhibition two years ago, and the  international exhibition held in Taejon city last year. I  earnestly hope that their mutual understanding will deepen on  all possible occasions.    Today, the world is encountering waves of dramatic changes.  In this situation, our two countries, as your excellency the  president has repeatedly stated, should further solidify their  friendly and cooperative ties and blaze hand-in-hand the path to  the future. Your excellency has been promoting "the creation of  a new Republic of Korea" and making serious efforts to  strengthen the relationship between Japan and the Republic of  Korea. I am confident that your excellency's present visit to  this country will prove to be an extremely significant occasion  for the future relations of our two countries.    Although your excellency's stay is short, it is my ardent  hope that you will enjoy the spring of our country, meet a broad  range of people in various circles, personally observe our  country's actual condition, and find your visit fruitful.    With best wishes for the further development of friendship  between our two countries, may I now propose a toast to the good  health and happiness of your excellency the President and Mrs.  Kim Yong-sam, and the prosperity of the people of the Republic  of Korea.</p>

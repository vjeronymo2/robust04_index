			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ra'id Salah, mayor of Umm el Fahm and "main </F> leader of the Islamic Movement" inside Israel, by Jamal  Khashuqji in Jeddah; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Khashuqji] How was your visit to Saudi Arabia  arranged and what are its aims?    [Salah] The purpose of the visit is to perform 'umrah [minor  pilgrimage] with a delegation from the towns situated inside the  Green Line (Israel). It was arranged in coordination with the  Jordanian Awqaf Ministry. [passage omitted]    [Khashuqji] Let us move to politics. You have participated  more than once in local Israeli elections. How were the results  with regard to the Islamic tendency?    [Salah] Recent local government elections were held on 28  November 1993. The Islamic Movement participated in the  elections in several cities and villages in the Arab areas, and  with Almighty God's help, the movement was able to win the  mayorship in Umm el Fahm, Kafr Qasim, Kafr Bara, Jaljuliya, and  Kafr Qari'. It also secured good and satisfactory results --  temporarily -- in Kafr Kanna, Rahit [as transliterated], and  some other areas in the city of 'Akko. [passage omitted]    [Khashuqji] Was the peace issue and the recent accord  included in your election program, and were you forced to talk  about it in front of your candidates?    [Salah] Actually our position as Muslims has always been  clear vis-a-vis the peace issue. Our understanding of a real  and just peace is part of Muslims' view in life. This is why we  as Muslims always maintain this value and adopt it not as an  empty slogan, but as a value of belief that has a truthful,  realistic, comprehensive, and just substance.    [Khashuqji] Did you talk more clearly about the Gaza-Jericho  agreement during the elections?    [Salah] Without doubt a position was adopted on this plan.  The position was defined through the numerous questions we  raised, which have received no responsible answer from any  official party. For example, the Gaza-Jericho plan does not  answer questions like: What about the fate of holy Jerusalem?  No answer. There is no clear official position on this issue.  Or about the fate of the Palestinian refugees made homeless in  1948 after their cities and villages were destroyed. [passage  omitted]    [Khashuqji] But please allow me to ask you: Are you  Palestinian or Israeli?    [Salah] I say it clearly and openly: I am a Palestinian  Arab Muslim living on my land with no charity from anyone.    [Khashuqji] Have you been accused of sympathizing with  Hamas?    [Salah] Yes, there are accusations by some quarters. But we  have confirmed our clear and open position: We support  Palestinians' rights wherever they are, whether in the West Bank  or in the Gaza Strip or beyond these boundaries. Because we  consider ourselves an integral part of this people, to whom we  are bound by ties of blood, history, and religion. Without  doubt this bond is fixed, permanent, and cannot be severed by  anyone. So we do not deny our sympathizing and cohesion -- and  I am not just saying sympathizing, but also cohesion -- with  Palestinian legitimacy -- the legitimacy of the Palestinian  people, who have the full and natural right to establish their  state and to cling to their capital, holy Jerusalem. We do not  hesitate to express our cohesion in many situations. [passage  omitted]</p>

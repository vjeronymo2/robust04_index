			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Placing a finger on the financial pulse For those needing to keep up with share and commodity prices outside the office, Hutchison Pager has produced the 'Pulse' pager, writes Andrew Adonis. The pager - or 'pocket-sized dealing screen' - is not the first financial information services pager. Nor is it the only one which bleeps when share prices or indices pass pre-set levels. Apart from a standard database providing an overview of financial markets, 'Pulse' offers foreign exchange, futures, energy, world indices, equities and metals. Its coverage extends to most of London's commuter belt. 'Pulse' costs Pounds 99 a month to rent; users get the database plus one specific service. The pager cost Pounds 279 to buy and the monthly charge is then Pounds 79. Hutchison Paging: UK, 0992 501234</p>

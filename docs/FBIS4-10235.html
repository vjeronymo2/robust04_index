			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Apr (AFP) -- The Haitian Senate  Bloc, not recognized by the international community, today  approved a motion for the appointment of a provisional president  and the calling of elections. The bloc approved the motion by  11 votes in favor and two opposed thanks to the support of the  eight senators elected in the January 1993 partial legislative  elections which has been challenged by the international  community.    The proposals refer to the application of Article 149 of the  Constitution that foresees the appointment of the president of  the court of appeals as president of the Republic in case of a  prolonged absence by the president. The Constitution stipulates  that in such cases, elections must be called within a "45 to 90  day" period.    The senators decided to announce their decision to the  Chamber of Deputies and Appeals Court President Emile  Jonassaint. The deputies had already approved another plan,  supported by the United States and the United Nations, to solve  the country's crisis, but not with the senatorial bloc (led by  Firmin Jean-Louis) acknowledged by the international community.    Deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide rejected the  aforementioned plan that contemplates the designation of a new  prime minister after the departure of Army Chief General Raoul  Cedras, even though no mention is made of the date when he will  be able to return to the country.

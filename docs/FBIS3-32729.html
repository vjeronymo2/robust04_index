			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Feb (AFP) -- The Peruvian economy minister  and the president of the Council of Ministers reportedly  tendered their resignations to President Alberto Fujimori on  Thursday, according to unconfirmed rumors published in Lima  newspapers on Friday.    The resignations of Jorge Camet and Alfonso Bustamante y  Bustamante were especially due to the enactment on Thursday of a  law which the Peruvian Congress approved at the beginning of the  week. The law modifies the procedure that has been applied by  the Supreme Court up to now whenever it had to rule on a case of  jurisdiction between criminal justice and military justice.    According to observers, the application of this law would  allow military judges to try the "La Cantuta" case -- the  disappearance at La Cantuta University during the summer of 1992  of nine students and a professor, whose charred bodies were  found a year later -- in which several military officers are  implicated.    The voting on this law and its enactment by President  Fujimori led to a real scandal in Peru and observers have  pointed out that the text -- published in the official newspaper  on 10 February -- did not have the signature of Bustamante.    Moreover, according to other rumors disclosed by LA  REPUBLICA  newspaper, the United States, concerned over the attitude of the  Peruvian authorities regarding the La Cantuta incident, is  reportedly ready to announce its withdrawal from Peru's Support  Group.</p>

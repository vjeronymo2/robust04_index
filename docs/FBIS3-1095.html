Mr. Khalifah said he hoped that the Somalis would  be able to arrive at a joint solution. The Somali leader praised  Sudan's stance towards the Somali issue and said his country  still expected a great deal from Sudan.    The radio correspondent in Nairobi has reported that the  Somali leaders are going to hold their final meeting on 22  March, during which time the broad guidelines of the agreement  which has been arrived at will be laid down.

The transitional  period is to be fixed at two years.    It was also agreed that a conference be held in Mogadishu in  April to (?appoint) the president and members of the  presidential council and the prime minister and members of the  government.

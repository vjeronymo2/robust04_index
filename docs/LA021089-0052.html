			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT  </P> <P> Conductor Herbert von Karajan, 80, has asked for a reprieve from his contract  with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra because of failing health. In a letter  to Berlin culture authorities, he stated that he cannot keep up with the pace  demanded by his contract and wants to rest at his home near Salzburg, Austria.  A Berlin cultural affairs spokesman said that with the letter, Karajan conceded  for the first time that his ability to conduct has been affected by a stroke,  failing vision, circulatory problems and at least five operations he has  undergone in the last 12 years. Karajan has conducted the Berlin Philharmonic  since 1954 and holds the honorary title of lifetime director. One Vienna music  critic said of the conductor, "His life is a heroic exertion against illness  and pain."  </P></p>

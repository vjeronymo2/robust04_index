Commenting on the project, he suggested that such a move  would make the committee less effective. He said the committee  could be more productive under the government's command. But  within the presidential administration it would turn into a  secondary department. He voiced conviction that the plan had  been devised because of his personality and re-emphasized the  need for leading the committee by a vice-premier, as usual.  Otherwise, in his words, it is impossible to make the finance  and other ministries and departments turn their attention to  ethnic relations and regional problems. However, he added,  "there is every indication that a different decision has been  taken."    He believes that there must be a body to work out political  recommendations for the president on ethnic and regional  policies. As for the federation committee, it should implement  presidential and government decisions in this sphere.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS FEAR LAKE POLLUTION FROM LUXURY HOUSING;  </P> <P> WESTLAKE VILLAGE: ONE PLANNER CALLS THE EIGHT-ACRE LAKE ELEANOR THE 'JEWEL' OF  THE AREA'S OPEN-SPACE SYSTEM.  </P> <P> A proposal to construct 52 luxury houses on 78 acres in Westlake Village has  raised the ire of park agencies that want to acquire the site and of Thousand  Oaks officials who say the project will pollute a lake on their side of the  county line.  </P> <P> Lake Eleanor, nestled in Decker Canyon near Westlake Boulevard, west of the  county line, is an eight-acre crescent of water that planners say is the heart  of a thriving wildlife community, including many species of birds, insects and  plants.  </P> <P> They say the lake is also an important watering hole for larger animals such as  deer and coyotes that come down from the Santa Monica Mountains. Although the  lake is fenced, planners hope that it will soon be accessible to the public via  a trail connecting it to the Santa Monica Mountains backbone trail.  </P> <P> "This is the jewel of our open-space system," said Doug Nickels, a planner for  the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency. "You always see waterfowl, ducks,  egrets and a lot of animals come down from the mountains to drink here."  </P> <P> But Nickels, environmentalists and other parks agencies say the value of the  lake -- to animals and the public -- is jeopardized by a plan by M.J. Brock to  build suburban-style tract housing just upstream from the reservoir, in Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> Federal, state and local agencies have joined to oppose the proposal on the  ground that it would obliterate a seasonal drainage dubbed Decker Creek that  feeds the lake. Runoff from the tract, which would include lawn fertilizers and  other chemicals, would pollute the lake, they fear.  </P> <P> They said the project, which is to be known as Lake Eleanor Hills, would also  destroy a valuable wildlife habitat that is home to several rare and endangered  species, including Pentachaeta lyonii -- an indigenous flower found only in the  Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> Brock officials said they would be willing to sell the flat, grassy meadow  where they plan to build, but none of the agencies that oppose the project have  made any serious attempts to buy it. And unless Brock can sell the property,  said spokesman Larry Lynch, the developer is determined to go ahead with the  project.  </P> <P> The National Park Service wants to buy the property and establish a visitor  center and trail head there, said Kent Schwartzkopf of the Santa Monica  Mountains Conservancy. But he said the Park Service does not have the cash to  purchase it this year.  </P> <P> Left without the resources to acquire the land, and without the clear authority  to block the project, the parks agencies are pressuring the developer and the  Westlake Village City Council to reduce the size of the tract.  </P> <P> Based on an environmental impact report completed in March, the Westlake  Village Planning Department staff has already recommended that the council  approve the 52-unit project.  </P> <P> But planners from the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency -- which owns Lake  Eleanor and more than 600 acres nearby -- have asked Brock to cut back the  project to 31 residences, which they said would save many of the endangered  plants and several oak trees.  </P> <P> In 1988, the Westlake Village Planning Department approved a plan by the land's  previous owner, Prudential Insurance Co., that called for 64 single-family  houses, 196 multiple-family units and commercial office space on the property  that runs along the north side of Decker Road.  </P> <P> That project was rejected by the City Council because of concerns about traffic  and noise. Lynch said that Brock, which has owned the property since 1988,  considered those problems when designing the tract plan now under  consideration.  </P> <P> "We thought we would, by and large, end up with a pretty good reception," Lynch  said of the current proposal. "We were trying to have a non-controversial  project by going down so far in density."  </P> <P> However, planners from the Conejo group, the conservancy and the state  Department of Fish and Game all say that the project is still too big, and have  urged Westlake Village planners to allow only 31 residences to be built there.  </P> <P> "They would have a viable project that would be superior to what they have  currently proposed. It would create a situation where the environment wins and  the developer wins," said Peter Ireland of the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, who recently met with Brock officials to try to persuade them to  consider the plan.  </P> <P> Lynch said, however, that the reduced project would be economically unfeasible  for the developer. He also defended the proposal as "truly a sensitive project"  and denied that water runoff from the housing development would harm water  quality.  </P> <P> "The notion that that degree of runoff would create some problem is  unbelievable," he said. He said the lake is "a man-made feature installed 100  years ago" and not a natural body of water.  </P> <P> "Clearly it changed the environment of the area, but that doesn't make it  sacrosanct," he said.  </P> <P> But Nickels and others say the project would be an environmental catastrophe.  </P> <P> Last month, Deputy Atty. Gen. Gail Ruderman Fuer wrote to the Westlake Village  planning director stating that the environmental destruction the project would  cause appeared to outweigh any potential benefits.  </P> <P> She also recommended that the city require an additional botanical survey of  the site.  </P> <P> Although the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has identified at least 15  endangered or sensitive species in addition to the Pentachaeta lyonii growing  near the proposed construction site, the environmental impact report on the  Lake Eleanor Hills project concluded that no examples of those plants were  growing on the property.  </P> <P> Fuer said the developer's biology consultants toured the site during a season  when most of the plant species were not in bloom and could easily have been  overlooked. She also said the supplemental environmental impact report brushed  over the issue of the wetlands that would be destroyed if the project proceeds.  </P> <P> Nickels said the property is an important access route to the lake for animals  such as deer and coyotes from the Santa Monica Mountains. The developer has  said that the animals could easily find water elsewhere, but Nickels said the  lake is one of the only year-round watering holes in the Santa Monica  Mountains.  </P> <P> The project's supplemental environmental impact report is now being circulated,  and a public hearing on the project is scheduled for Dec. 12 before the  Westlake Village City Council.  </P></p>

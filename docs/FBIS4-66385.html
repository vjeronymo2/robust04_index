Three Research Centers established last  year were the ``Liquid State Machine and Compression Engine  Engineering Research Center'' of the Xian Jiaotong University,  the Ministry of Energy's ``Clean Coal Combustion for the Power  Plants Engineering Research Center'' of Xian Thermal Power  Research Institute, and the ``Telecommunication Exchange and  Software Support System Engineering Research Center'' of the  Tenth Research Institute of Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications. The engineering research centers aim at  conducting engineering research and systematic integration of  research institutes' important S&amp;T achievements with great  market value, and then transform these results into large-scale  industrialized production. In order to accelerate the conversion  of these results, speed up development of China's industrial  production technology, and promote international competition,  the engineering research centers are also exloring effective  models and new operation guidelines to be adopted by Chinese  government in the future.</p>

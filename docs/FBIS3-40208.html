			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pei Jianfeng: ``Appetite Grows for </F> Electronics'']    [Text] China's exports--and imports--of electronics rose  sharply last year.    According to statistics from the General Administration of  Customs, exports of electronic products amounted to $8.1 billion  in 1993, up 18.1 percent over 1992.    Imports, meanwhile, jumped 32 percent to $10.6 billion.    Imports of visual and audio merchandise and  telecommunications products hit $5.53 billion, while exports  totalled $5.01 billion.    About $3.62 billion of electronic components and instruments  were imported and $1.51 billion worth were exported.    Foreign-funded enterprises are playing a bigger role in the  exports, said a senior official from the Ministry of Electronics  Industry.    Last year foreign-funded enterprises accounted for more than  40 percent of all exports. The proportion will continue to grow  in the coming years, the official said.    Exports of consumer electronics kept rising last year. China  exported 113 million cassette tape recorders worth $150 million  and 11.31 million television sets of which 6.95 million were  black and white.    China's exports of cassette tape recorders and  black-and-white TV sets rank first in the world.    The official said China is trying to increase exports of  electronic products for investment use and basic electronic  components.    For example, China exported $558 million worth of computers  and related products last year, an increase of 85 percent over  1992.    Last year's 18.1 percent growth in electronic exports  actually was a slowdown from 1992, when they jumped by more than  40 percent over 1991.    The ministry official attributed the slower expansion to the  brisk domestic market and exporters' shortage of capital.    According to the ministry's statistics for 1993, Chinese  electronic production reached 139.8 billion yuan ($16 billion),  an increase of 26.4 percent over 1992. Sales jumped by 37.6  percent to 113.27 billion yuan ($13 billion).    The official said China now mainly exports low-grade  products, which yield low profits.    He noted that while exports of TV sets increased by 20  percent last year, their value rose by only 5 percent.    At present, China depends on Hong Kong and Macao to absorb  its exports, but the official said other markets will be  explored.    Although the imbalance in the trading of electronics  accounted for nearly 20 percent of China's entire trade deficit  last year, the ministry official said imports will probably  continue growing rapidly this year.    This expanding market for electronics has drawn the  attention  of many foreign companies, which are eager to supply the  up-to-date equipment China needs to modernize itself. For  instance, the country plans to set up nationwide economic  information networks that will need sophisticated technology  from abroad.    Last year, many big names in the international industry sent  high-profile delegations to China seeking business.    More are expected this year. Lou Gerstner, chairman of IBM  Corp., the world's largest computer maker, and William H. Gates  III, chairman of Microsoft Corp., the software giant, are  scheduled to make their first visits to China separately in  March.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Decision on LTV bids expected today A FEDERAL bankruptcy court judge will decide today which of two bids to accept for the aerospace and missiles business of steel group LTV, but his preliminary remarks last night seemed to favour of consortium of Thomson-CSF of France and Washington's Carlyle Group. LTV, which has been operating under the protection of the bankruptcy court for the past five years, needs the judge's approval for the sale of the business. After two days of bidding, Thomson and Carlyle had an offer of Dollars 440m on the table, while rivals Lockheed and Martin Marietta had one of Dollars 385m. Each bid has support among various creditors of LTV and other interested parties.</p>

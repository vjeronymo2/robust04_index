			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bank of America president quits soon after merger MR Robert Smith, the newly-named Bank of America president and chief operating officer and who was previously chairman of Security Pacific, yesterday announced plans to leave his job. The move - which comes just eight weeks after the finalisation of the Dollars 4.2bn merger between Bank of America and Secpac - was last night being seen by Wall Street banking analysts as the clearest sign yet that the recently-completed merger of Bank of America and Security Pacific was effectively a rescue of the latter. Mr George Salem, senior banking analyst at Prudential Securities, called Mr Smith's departure 'a clear manifestation that this was by no means a merger of equals'. Mr Salem claimed that recent heavy loan losses at SecPac suggested that in the months since the bank merger was announced last August 'it became more visible to Bank of America that they bought a bigger problem than they bargained for'. Mr Jim McDermott, president of Keefe Bruyette, the bank analysts, said Mr Smith's resignation - which takes effect in October - was 'a bit of a surprise because the exit came so early'. He said the departure showed how the profitable Bank of America 'clearly dominates this merger'. Mr Smith, who is 56, said he had found his new responsibilities at the combined Bank of America 'to be less than I want'. The former SecPac chairman, who will receive a severance payment of more than Dollars 1.8m, said he did not have a new job lined up. Mr Smith told the Financial Times last night: 'This had all the characteristics of a merger, except that one side is always a little stronger than the other.' He said that while the title of president 'sounded great', he and Mr Dick Rosenberg, the Bank of America chairman, 'never talked about or thought about what my specific role would be until early in May. 'The bottom line is that I didn't want to be Number Two,' Mr Smith explained. The uneven nature of the bank merger, the biggest in US banking history, became apparent when 1991 results showed Bank of America earned Dollars 1.1bn in net income, while Security Pacific suffered a loss for the year of Dollars 765m. The last set of separate results released before the merger's completion - for the first quarter of 1992 - confirmed the unequal partnership. Bank of America reported a 7 per cent rise in first-quarter net profits, to Dollars 303m, and net loan losses of Dollars 219m that were less than half the level of the first quarter of 1991. By contrast, SecPac was hit by nearly trebled loan loss provisions of Dollars 787m and a plunge into a Dollars 496m first-quarter loss, against earnings of Dollars 96.5m in the first quarter of 1991. In the nearest comparison to the Bank of America-SecPac merger, the top executives of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank in New York continue to work in harmony as chairman and chief executive of the newly-merged entity, Chemical Banking.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / The Long View: Clarke's big opportunity WHAT THE UK's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last September could not trigger the Newbury by-election apparently could: the sacking of Norman Lamont. More charitable commentators are blaming Lamont's fall more on poor presentation and unlucky timing than on policy errors, but the fact is that he never properly seized hold of economic strategy. He inherited John Major's blundering entry to the ERM at the wrong rate and at the wrong time and remained too much in the Treasury's grip. His espousal of ridiculous economic forecasts of recovery became a standing joke. During the 1992 election campaign he acquiesced in the government's cynical, albeit vote-winning, promises of economic growth and continued low taxation; the medium-term Red Book projections of March 1992 were among the more spurious ever. The electorate is now taking its revenge. Finally, having been forced out of the ERM, Lamont failed to turn policy around and rebalance fiscal and monetary policy to the proper degree. This is how we have wound up with a crazy Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement for the current financial year, after the March Budget which was far too hesitant. If only Kenneth Clarke had been given this opportunity last September. At least he has his own first Budget in November rather than next March. In some respects Clarke has been dealt a rotten hand, with big spending cuts and tax increases on the agenda. However, he is in a splendid position to blame much of the coming agony on his predecessor's errors of judgment. Meanwhile he starts from a position of low inflation, with scope for pushing short-term interest rates lower. A modest economic revival has started, too. So although the economic cards may be of low denomination there could be a few political aces tucked away. The financial markets have taken Lamont's departure fairly calmly - even casually - although the foreign exchanges are clearly apprehensive that sterling may become vulnerable to changes in policy. One of Lamont's several strategic errors has been once again to swallow Treasury and Bank of England advice and encourage a renewed overvaluation of sterling. He has been misguidedly promoting an underlying inflation target of no more than 4 per cent which has been seriously inhibiting the restoration of balance within the British economy. To get imports down and exports up, in the context of a serious European recession, sterling weakness must be tolerated. The possibility of a reassessment here is plainly going to cause nervousness, especially as foreigners have been buying gilt-edged again. But financing deficits smoothly must surely take second place to getting the real economy back on an even keel. Now the estranged Norman Lamont moves to the backbenches. Will he play the malevolent role that Geoffrey Howe performed in the latter days of Margaret Thatcher? And will Kenneth Clarke, the amiable thug, play a kind of Denis Healey part in the crumbling Major administration? The parallel may be far from strained, because Clarke will be struggling with the same scale of deficits as Healey suffered in the late 1970s, and at much higher real interest rates. It could be tempting for Clarke to engineer the same kind of financial crisis that struck Healey in 1976. Such turmoil can, of course, be very uncomfortable, and even dangerous, but in a mature democracy there may be no other way of forcing through tough measures. And perhaps Clarke needs the crisis soon, while his own hands seem reasonably clean and Norman Lamont's appear soiled. Another important factor is that Lamont has been carrying out Major's economic wishes, and the prime minister stands to lose reputation should Clarke make a better fist of managing the economy. Clarke has two basic strategy choices. The markets are assuming he will finance a big deficit for several years, then try to inflate away the accumulated burden of the debt. This seemed to be the only route that Norman Lamont could imagine, given that he was proposing to fund seemingly endless and gaping budget deficits at very high real interest rates. However, there is little or no domestic private sector inflation being generated in the British economy at present. This is not at all like 1989, when Nigel Lawson was forced out. The banks are battening down the hatches, and pay inflation is 4 per cent and declining. Another possibility thus presents itself, that the new chancellor could seek a way out through an interest rate offensive, unhindered by fears of inflation, at least in the short term. Instead of pushing long bond rates up, as Lamont has been doing recently, there would be a concerted attempt to force down both short and long rates aggressively. Imagine a serious attack on the fiscal deficit this autumn, along with a sharp cut in short-term interest rates. Sterling would weaken, helping to sustain an export-led recovery. Would the gilt-edged market become alarmed about inflation in the medium term? Maybe, but suppose the supply of gilts were reduced, and suppose short-term rates were low enough, then it might be possible to engineer a buying panic as investors chased a declining supply of paper with a worthwhile yield. This is not standard Treasury or Bank of England thinking, but Kenneth Clarke has little grounding in establishment thinking on the economy. He may ponder on the fact that of Tory chancellors since 1979 only Howe has retained much of a permanent reputation, and that is because he was prepared to challenge the standard thinking of his time and propose a radical alternative. He was also prepared to tear up an election manifesto and raise taxes. On the other hand, he never became prime minister.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has rescued 2,000  people in Bugesera in the southeastern part of Rwanda. The  2,000 people, who had been hiding in river swamps called  nyamwiza, are the few people who have survived the massacres  committed by Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development [MRND]'s militias and government soldiers. The  survivors are telling stories of horror that thousands of  people, men, women, and children were hacked to death while many  others were tied with their hands behind their back and thrown  into River Nyabarongo which flows into the River Akagera. These  bodies have been flowing into Lake Victoria causing a health  hazard along the Akagera River course through Tanzania and  Uganda. The RPF has now taken control of Bugesera and restored  calm in these areas. There are no more people being thrown into  the River Nyabarongo, for the MRND's youthwingers who have been  committing atrocities are now on the run. The dead bodies  flowing down Akagera River are said to be decomposing and not  fresh corpses. This has confirmed that the killings by the MRND  youthwingers have been greatly reduced and peace is slowly  returning to these areas.</p>

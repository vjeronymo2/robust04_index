			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Patients 'denied access to records' Doctors are denying patients access to their medical records, the Association of Community Health Councils said yesterday. It said patients wanting to see their documents faced unnecessary barriers. Under the law - and the Patient's Charter - patients have the right to access unless the information will cause them harm.</p>

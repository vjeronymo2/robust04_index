The sale evidently clears the way for some sort of combination among  Fuqua, Intermark and Triton, Katz said.  </P> <P> La Jolla Bancorp recorded a new high of $8 as the smaller San Diego banks  continued to respond to the announcement that Southwest Bank will be acquired  at 2.5 times book value by Security Pacific.

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Euroc earnings tumble 75% to SKr27m EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, yesterday reported a 75 per cent fall in profits to SKr27m (Dollars 4.88m) for the first eight months, due to a sharp decline in its main markets and stiffer price competition, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Sales fell to SKr6.19bn from SKr6.91bn, mainly reflecting lower sales in Sweden and the UK. The company suffered an extraordinary loss of SKr270m on the July sale of its stake in Valenciana, the Spanish cement and ready-mix company. This meant the group made an overall pre-tax loss of SKr243m for the period, compared with a SKr260m profit in the first eight months of 1991. The group is implementing a rationalisation programme to counter the impact of depressed markets, and expects to cut its 1992 fixed costs by around SKr330m.</p>

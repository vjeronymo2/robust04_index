			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PINHOLE PHOTOGRAPHY WILL BE EXPLORED AT OCC  </P> <P> A group exhibition of pinhole photography and the handmade cameras used to  create it will be on display Jan. 31 through March 6 at Orange Coast College's  Art Gallery.  </P> <P> The exhibition, titled "Oracular Orifices," features works by 13 artists  dedicated to the distinct signature image of the camera obscura.  </P> <P> The pinhole camera obscura requires neither lens, mirror nor other optical  components and can be constructed from any "light-tight" container that has a  singular pinhole aperture made with a pushpin or laser or other device.  </P> <P> OCC photography instructor Peggy Ann Jones, curator of the exhibit, has  included her own laser-drilled camera and Japanese photographic "O Jizo Sama"  shrine in the exhibit.  </P> <P> Eric Renner, author and publisher of the Pinhole Journal and considered a  "guru" of pinhole photography, will display his underwater pinhole camera and  the abstract images it produced.  </P> <P> Other artists and photographers featured in the show include Marcus Kaiser, who  used the Berlin Wall as a pinhole camera, and Belgium-born Dominique Stroobant,  who is known for his sun tracings and other observations and recordings of  solar eclipses too bright to scrutinize with the naked eye.  </P> <P> An opening reception is planned for Feb. 2 from noon to 2 p.m. at the OCC Art  Gallery. Photo artist Jo Babcock will be on hand with his Volkswagen bus a la  camera obscura titled, "Lens on Wheels."  </P> <P> In conjunction with the exhibition, Jones will lecture on pinhole photography  Feb. 22 at 7 p.m. at OCC. She will conduct a workshop at the college on Feb. 23  from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  </P> <P> The gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more  information, call the Fine Arts Department at (714) 432-5629 or the Art Gallery  at (714) 432-5725.  </P></p>

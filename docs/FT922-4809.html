			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Phoney war for Midland Mr Purves of the Hongkong Bank would clearly like his latest offer for Midland to be seen as a knock-out. At a value of 479p, however, it is only 23p higher than the most attractive option under the original offer. The cash alternative to the loan stock portion has considerably improved the structure of the bid, but there is still room for Lloyds to top the price without undermining its own commercial case for acquiring Midland. Assuming that this is indeed what happens after the Lloyds board meeting on Friday, investors will be back to second-guessing the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But they would be wrong to assume that it is a simple question of whether or not the Lloyds case will be rejected. In that case, Takeover Panel rules would still allow HSBC immediately to slap another bid on the table, with the crucial proviso that it was recommended by the Midland board. The risk in sitting tight therefore is that Midland would refuse to endorse a second HSBC bid. That HSBC knows this is a weakness in its case is betrayed by its new sense of urgency. After all the trouble it has gone to, it is almost inconceivable that HSBC would pass up a second opportunity to bid, though it might be necessary to spice the deal to win endorsement from a jaded Midland board. In this context, it is striking that the proposed premium on the loan stock element has swung from a parsimonious 160 basis points over gilts to an exceptionally generous 240 points. If HSBC wanted to underwrite more paper for a fresh offer, it would have little difficulty at this price. As long as Lloyds can persuade investors that HSBC would remain in the game after the MMC enquiry, it still has everything to play for. To deter waverers from selling out, it will need on Friday to signal its absolute determination to beat its rival bidder if and when it gets the go-ahead from the competition authorities. That would mean indicating a new price in excess of 500p to compensate for the admittedly quite small risk that Midland would be left ultimately without any suitor at all.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Guatemalan government promised to replace the warden and all guards at a  besieged prison and work to reform prisons nationwide if armed inmates  surrender and set hostages free. The proposal was an attempt to end a  four-day-old uprising and free hundreds of inmates and family members in the  compound at the Pavon prison farm, about 15 miles east of Guatemala City.  Earlier, authorities cut off water and power to try to end the mutiny by  prisoners demanding reduced sentences, better food and treatment and  replacement of the warden. About 110 prisoners who took no part in the  rebellion escaped and were transferred to other institutions.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER'S SUIT CLAIMS SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY PRINCIPAL  </P> <P> A teacher who claims she was relieved of her coaching duties after she fended  off the sexual advances of the principal at the school where she formerly  taught has filed a $4-million lawsuit against him and the Oceanside Unified  School District.  </P> <P> The suit filed last week by Karyl Ketchum accuses Jefferson Junior High School  Principal Michael Walker of sexual harassment and discrimination. Ketchum is  seeking $3 million from Walker in connection with alleged unwelcomed advances  against her at a school event in June, 1988.  </P> <P> Besides naming Walker, 42, the lawsuit also seeks $1 million from the Oceanside  Unified School District for failing to both conduct a proper investigation of  Ketchum's complaints and take disciplinary actions against Walker.  </P> <P> Dan Armstrong, a school district spokesman, said Tuesday that he had not  received a copy of the lawsuit and declined to comment. But Armstrong insisted  that the school conducted a thorough and professional investigation of the  charges.  </P> <P> According to the suit, "Walker assaulted and battered (Ketchum) by grabbing her  from behind on the right buttock, with such force and vehemence that bruises  and physical marks of abuse resulted."  </P> <P> Ketchum, 34, claims the incident occurred within full view of students and  adults attending an intramural basketball game between faculty and students.  </P> <P> According to the suit, the academic year ended shortly after the incident and,  upon returning to school in September, Ketchum was abruptly informed -- without  any explanation from Walker -- that she had been relieved of all her coaching  duties.  </P> <P> At that time, Ketchum was a tenured teacher who -- in addition to serving as  chairwoman of the school's science department -- coached basketball,  cross-country and volleyball.  </P> <P> Ketchum said she notified district administrators of the problems, but claims  that the district's investigation was conducted in bad faith. The suit alleges  that the investigator was, and continues to be, a friend of Walker, thus  creating a conflict of interest. She also alleges that promises of  confidentiality offered during the investigation were broken repeatedly.  </P> <P> Armstrong declined to comment on the investigation's findings but denied that  it was conducted improperly.  </P> <P> "It grieves me to see a member of the district at least seemingly infer that  the district office would be less than professional about checking out such  grievances," Armstrong said. "It went to the appropriate administrator and a  thoroughly professional job was done.  </P> <P> "The investigation was reviewed by the district and an attempt was made to  reach an amicable resolution with the teacher," Armstrong said. "Unfortunately  that could not be done."  </P> <P> Armstrong said he did not know whether any disciplinary action has been taken  against Walker, the principal at Jefferson Junior High since 1980.  </P> <P> Besides the June 15 incident, Ketchum claims that Walker sexually harassed her  by kissing and embracing her on two other occasions.  </P> <P> As a result of the strained working environment, Ketchum left Jefferson in  February and now works as a temporary physical education teacher at elementary  schools in the Oceanside district.  </P> <P> Walker could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] This morning the city of Aden was subjected to  more violent artillery and missile shelling by northern Yemeni  forces. Medical sources in Aden said that 15 people were injured  in the shelling against the northern outskirts of Aden.    A southern Yemeni military source said that the battles  between the northern and southern forces resumed on all fronts  surrounding the city and said that it was noticed during  yesterday's and today's battles that the Sanaa forces used  modern tanks which were not in the possession of the northern  forces before or after unification. Southern Yemeni officials  had announced earlier that the southern forces foiled an attack  launched by northern Yemeni forces to control a main road  leading to the city of Aden in a suburb where the refinery is  situated. They said that a northern force composed of hundreds  of soldiers preceded by three tanks was able for a short while  to block the road leading to the area where the refinery is  situated but the road was reopened yesterday afternoon after the  northern forces were driven back.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, May 5 (AFP) -- The French Government on  Thursday [5 May] condemned Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels  for rejecting talks with the Kigali government and a ceasefire  to end ethnic slaughter in the central African country.    France is "concerned" at the failure of a UN peace bid in  Arusha, Tanzania, and "deplores the RPF's refusal not only to  enter talks with the other party but above all to envisage an  end to fighting," Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said.    The government "reiterates its support" for peace  initiatives  in the region, particularly that of Tanzania, and calls on the  "actors on the Rwandan stage to face up to their  responsibilities" and "end the massacres," he said.

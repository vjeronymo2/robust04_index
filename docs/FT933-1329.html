			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / IMF study warns of derivatives risks A STRONG warning has been issued in an International Monetary Fund study about risks in the Dollars 8,000bn (Pounds 5,200bn) markets in derivatives such as futures contracts and currency and interest rate swaps. It says many transactions are not fully understood by the senior managers of banks and securities houses. The IMF study is among the more cautious recent analyses of the Dollars 4,500bn market in over-the-counter derivatives which are designed and sold by relatively few banks and securities firms with strong capital. It follows a more sanguine study by the Washington-based Group of 30 large banks and financial institutions last month, which recommended management reforms to reduce risks such as default by counterparties, but argued that the risk of systemic failure was low. The risks to financial markets posed by derivatives will be one of the chief topics discussed by bankers at the World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington. Central bank supervisors are to address the issue at a meeting organised by the G30 next Monday. The IMF analysis, in a study of international capital markets, says the growth in derivatives trading, as companies have sought to hedge the risk of interest rate and currency movements, could have created unknown risks for banks. 'Participation in derivatives markets can cause firms to become connected through complicated transactions in ways that are not easily understood,' says the study. Derivatives are financial contracts, the values of which are determined by the level of an underlying instrument such as exchange rates or currency values.

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Lib Dem candidate rocks party by moving to Labour The Liberal Democrats were last night rocked by an eve-of-polling day bombshell when their candidate in the Newham North East by-election announced he was defecting to Labour. The decision by Mr Alec Kellaway, a 41-year-old Newham councillor, provided an extraordinary finale to 16 days of frenetic campaigning in the run-up to today's European elections and five parliamentary by-elections. The move provided an unexpected windfall for the increasingly buoyant Tories. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative chairman, said Mr Kellaway's decision proved the jump from Liberal Democrat to Labour was 'a very short step'. He urged voters to ask themselves whether their Liberal Democrat candidate was 'yet another Labour politician in disguise'. As the three main party leaders delivered their final campaign messages, Mr John Major talked up Britain's economic prospects and said the opposition's policies were 'out of tune with the electorate'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the Labour and Liberal Democrat approach to Europe was deeply old-fashioned and stuck in a failed economic philosophy of subsidy and regulations. Meanwhile Mr Peter Lilley, the Euro-sceptic social security secretary, put in a belated appearance on the campaign trail. He told Huddersfield Tories that voters faced a choice between 'Conservative jobs or socialist unemployment'. For Labour, Mrs Margaret Beckett, party leader, said the European elections were a referendum on a government that had failed Britain. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, predicted Labour would make the most gains. Mr Paddy Ashdown - ending his campaign in Eastleigh, the Hampshire parliamentary constituency the Liberal Democrats expect to capture from the Tories - urged voters to 'send the first Liberal Democrats to the European parliament'. He said Labour was out of the race in the south of England and added: 'If you vote for Labour you risk throwing a lifeline to the government.' Although Mr Kellaway said he had made yesterday's switch because there was 'virtually no division' on policy between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, both parties were at pains to emphasise that his decision was primarily of local relevance. Mr Kellaway, a former Labour party member and self-proclaimed 'Christian socialist', said the fact that Mr Tony Blair was 'about to become' Labour leader was instrumental in his decision. He said the shadow home secretary 'seems to now represent the mainstream' of the party. He denied his move was a stunt. It was 'a coming home rather than a conversion'. He had virtually never voted against the Labour whip on Newham council. Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, said his party was puzzled and saddened by Mr Kellaway's 'bizarre and unexpected behaviour'. He was sorry people in Newham North East would no longer be able to vote for a Liberal Democrat candidate. Newham North East, a safe Labour seat, is the former constituency of Mr Reg Prentice, the ex-minister who resigned from the Labour party and joined the Conservatives nearly 20 years ago.</p>

Turkish officials are also smarting over the shelving of a Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 938m) pipeline they had been championing to carry oil from Azerbaijan, through Turkey, to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Instead, Moscow has been putting pressure on Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to ship oil and natural gas through the Russian Black Sea port at Novorossisk. 'The West must make a distinction between support of democracy in Russia, and support for the restoration of its imperial designs,' Mr Samberk said.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S POLITICAL SUCCESSION PROPOSAL IS SLOPPY, DECEITFUL  </P> <P> Before Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan of Irvine won her office by a narrow margin  last June, she pledged to "heal Irvine." It has been interesting to watch her  healing hand at work in the city since the election.  </P> <P> First, public comment at City Council meetings has been cut short, and no  direct criticism of the council or its members is now permitted.  </P> <P> Second, the religious commitments of one group of residents is being given  preferential status at City Hall through the planned introduction of a  Christmas tree and the move to open City Council meetings with an invocation.  </P> <P> Finally, in spite of a court order directing the city to seat elected  Councilwoman Mary Ann Gaido, Sheridan and her allies on the council appear  determined to subject the taxpayers of Irvine to a costly and potentially  divisive special election in November.  </P> <P> In each of these cases, the council has imposed the political and cultural  commitments of its staunchest supporters on the city at large. These tactics --  the stifling of dissent, the association of city government with the religious  practices of one group of residents, and the attempt to exclude a fairly  elected city council member -- are designed not to "heal" the city but to  repress the healthy expression of differences within this politically and  culturally diverse community.  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether the residents of Irvine will tolerate this kind  of high-handed, repressive city government. For all our sakes, I hope that they  will not.  </P> <P> BETTY GUTHRIE  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

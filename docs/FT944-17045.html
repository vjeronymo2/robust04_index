			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: U-turn by US hits Caribbean exporters Garment and textile exporters in Central America and the Caribbean will be seriously affected by a US government U-turn on trade benefits. Central American and Caribbean nations, which thought they had secured the administration's backing for market access, were shocked by the recent decision to remove the so-called Interim Trade Programme. The ITP would have granted Caribbean and Central American states parity with Mexico in exporting to the US and Canada and thereby protected their markets. US vice-president Al Gore announced in in May that the ITP would be attached to fast-track legislation on Gatt, following months of lobbying by regional exporters who share about 14 per cent of the US market. However, the administration was forced to uncouple the preferential access from a legislative package on ratifying the Uruguay round of Gatt in an effort to speed ratification of the world trade treaty. . Central American officials feel the decision flies in the face of rhetoric on Pan-American solidarity in the run up to the Hemispheric summit to be held in Miami in December. 'It's like a bucket of cold water,' said Jose Orive, Guatemala trade negotiator with North America. Mr Orive said suppliers were already beginning to relocate to Mexico. Officials fear new buyers and investors will be increasingly difficult to attract. The clothing industry has grown rapidly in Central America in recent years, providing several hundred thousand people with jobs generally better paid than the farm sector. In Guatemala and Honduras the sometimes appalling labour conditions, the suppression of union activity, physical violence against workers, and summary dismissals, have angered US unions and human right groups who have campaigned in favour of the removal of trade benefits. According to data from the US Department of Commerce, 1993 clothing imports from Guatemala were worth Dollars 551m, from Costa Rica Dollars 653m, Honduras Dollars 509m, and El Salvador Dollars 251m. Without North American Free Trade Agreement parity, textile and apparel exports pay between 17 per cent and 21 per cent tariffs, which makes them uncompetitive with Mexico in an industry where profit margins are tight, says Mr Eduardo Gonzalez, Guatemala's economy minister. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico has agreed a three-year tariff reduction which begun this year and which will reach zero by 1997. The administration's decision is at odds with US clothing companies who source in Central America to take advantage of the low labour costs and comparative proximity to the US market, which allows for a rapid response to orders in comparison with far eastern suppliers. The decision on ITP is a further blow following the exclusion of garments and textiles from the Caribbean Basin Initiative earlier this year. The 24 countries which are beneficiaries of the 10-year old Initiative are allowed to ship some products duty free to the US. However, garments and textiles were excluded after pressure from the US industry. Mr Gonzalez says there has already been a sharp drop in growth in garment exports from CBI countries. In 1993 Mexico's exports grew 19 per cent compared to 28 per cent for CBI countries. In the first quarter of 1994 Mexican garment exports rose 39.2 per cent, and CBI exports were up by only 9.9 per cent.</p>

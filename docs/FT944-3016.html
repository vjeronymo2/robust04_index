			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / People: Coutts calls Post to account Not many US investment bankers are more anglicised than Lehman Brothers' Herschel Post (right). An Oxford Rhodes scholar and deputy chairman of the London Stock Exchange, Post has been given the ultimate establishment job - chief operating officer of Coutts, the frock-coated bankers to Britain's royal family. Not that Post, currently chief operating officer of Lehman Brothers in London, will be donning a frock-coat himself. He is joining a new management team being put in place by Coutts' parent, National Westminster Bank, and frock-coats are no longer de rigeur. After years of leaving Coutts to its own devices, NatWest is intent on turning it into a truly global private bank. Post, 55, who joined Lehman Brothers after spells with JP Morgan and Euroclear, will be the effective number two to NatWest's David Went, 47, who was installed as chief executive of the Coutts Group in June. Traditionally, Coutts &amp; Co, which accounts for roughly half the group, and Coutts' overseas businesses have been run independently. However, NatWest has set up a new management team to pull the two parts of the business together. Post will be 'responsible for all issues relating to Coutts' global operations' and will oversee the investment management side. Coutts has also recruited Lorraine Trainer, 42, the former director of human resources at the London Stock Exchange, to be director of human resources and organisational development, and Richard Wise, 37, joins from Mercury Asset Management to be Coutts' chief financial officer. The new appointments just about complete the clear-out of Coutts' old top management team which began three years ago when Ian Farnsworth, a NatWest general manager, took over from Julian Robards as managing director; though it is understood that Coutts is still looking for a new marketing director. Virtually all the top positions at Coutts are now held by either NatWest personnel or outsiders drafted in.</p>

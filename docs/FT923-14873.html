			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / MPs win spurs on Finance Bill: Labour's new backbenchers assure Emma Tucker that the party is not a 'busted flush' LABOUR'S demoralised front bench may have lost its pre-election energy but this has not stopped a handful of backbenchers engaging in vigorous opposition. Over the past 10 days a number of recently elected Labour MPs have made their debut on the standing committee on the finance bill - the legislation which implements the Budget. The sittings yielded little excitement this year. The most interesting elements of the Budget, such as the new 20p tax band, were dealt with before the general election. But a Conservative majority of only two on the 34-member committee - reflecting the balance of the House - has given Labour a sharper edge. Mr John Hutton, the youthful new MP for Barrow-in-Furness, said: 'The committee provides us with an opportunity to show the Tories that the Labour party is not a busted flush and that we are not prepared to lie down and let them roll over us. We are showing the government that if we choose to, we can make it very difficult for them.' Over the two weeks that the committee was sitting the opposition adopted the usual tactics of demoralisation through exhaustion. Conservative members were instructed to keep interventions to a minimum, so Labour in effect dictated the length of the proceedings. During the first week of discussions, two of the committee's three sittings ran until 4am. This week, one ended at 7.40am. Mr Nick Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, said the opposition's main role was to make sure the Budget was properly scrutinised. But he confessed to a certain amount of 'skirmishing and gamesmanship'. He said: 'It is only right for us, the opposition, to explore the possibilities and see if we can persuade any Conservatives to break ranks.' The proceedings have ended with no upset for the government. The 83-clause, 170-page bill is now scheduled for its final Commons stages next week. However, if the opposition failed to defeat any clauses or impose amendments, new MPs did get the opportunity, so rare in the chamber, to practise their debating skills. The dozy afternoon sessions were taken up with long speeches that roved through the rubble of Sheffield's old industrial zones, Dudley's deserted town centre, the smoky rooms of Barrow's working men's clubs and the steel sites of Wolverhampton. Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough, who has sat on the committee since 1984, said: 'I think the opposition decided the committee was a chance to give some of the bright new members a bit of a blooding - a chance to earn their spurs.' The new Labour terriers include the moustachioed Mr Geoffrey Hoon, MP for Ashfield, and an eloquent speaker on Europe. He sat next to Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's former campaigns director and now MP for Hartlepool, whose frequent references to the Hartlepool Marina soon found their way to the newsdesk of a local newspaper. Mr Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, leapt to his feet at every opportunity while ginger-haired Mr Ken Purchase, MP for Wolverhampton North-East, championed the Black Country. Mr Alan Millburn, the dapper MP for Darlington, spoke often, and at length, about the north-east, while Ms Barbara Roche, one of the three female members of the committee, wove together the links between the film industry and her London constituency of Hornsey and Wood Green. The Tory members, led by Mr Stephen Dorrell the no-nonsense financial secretary, had less fun. There was only one new face on their benches - Ms Judith Chaplin, MP for Newbury - who sat quietly scribbling through most of the proceedings. Occasionally the older Conservative hands retaliated over matters such as inheritance tax or the business expansion scheme. Some, such as Mr Watts, even introduced amendments. But most of the time they sat glumly opening piles of letters under the stern gaze of Mr Tim Wood, the government whip. All 18 Conservative members - picked more for dependability than their urge to scrutinise the economy - were present at every session and they never did break ranks. Perhaps Mr Brown was right when he remarked at the beginning of the first session: 'Some Conservative members may feel that their contribution to the committee is confined to nodding and waiting, and that they are wanted more for their bodies than for their minds.'</p>

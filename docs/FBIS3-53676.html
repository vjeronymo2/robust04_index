The talks  are progressing sluggishly and Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former  chairman of the Palestinian delegation to the talks, now warns,  during a visit to Stockholm, of the continued expansion of  Jewish settlements in occupied territories. It is the biggest  threat to the peace process in the Middle East, he thinks. Aake  Wiklund of The Echo program met him:    [Wiklund] Israel does not admit that any new Jewish  settlements are being built in occupied territories, but Dr.  Haydar says that he has reliable information, and this is  totally in breach of the meaning of the peace work and how you  view the final step toward Palestinian self-rule. In comparison  with the Israeli settlement policy, all other issues are  irrelevant, Dr. Haydar says.    [Begin Haydar recording, in English] In my opinion, it is  the  settlement process. I think it is much more important than all  the other issues. I don't think, I think the -- what they have  been arguing about, the question of control of the crossings,  the size of Jericho, all this -- in my opinion it is irrelevant.  [end recording]    [Wiklund] Dr Haydar was one of the Palestinians whom Yasir  'Arafat picked from obscurity in Gaza and the West Bank to  negotiate with Israel on behalf of the PLO. However, after  Israel elected to speak directly to 'Arafat, the Palestinian  voices have disappeared from the negotiation scene. The PLO  headquarters in Tunis has been in the limelight.    A couple of weeks ago, heading a Palestinian delegation, Dr.  Haydar travelled to Tunis and demanded a larger measure of  democracy within the PLO. They received no promise of change.  But we in the occupied areas will continue to demand a  democratic order and we refuse to sacrifice competence to  political and personal considerations, he said. That is a  diplomatic way of expressing one's dissatisfaction with Arafat's  autocratic leadership and the group around him in Tunis.    Many representatives of the PLO now view with mixed feelings  the recent summit in Geneva between President Clinton and Syrian  President al-Asad, where a settlement between Syria and Israel  seems to have moved closer. They fear that the negotiations  about Palestinian rule will now be pushed into the background.  But Dr. Haydar trusts the Syrian president.    [Begin Haydar recording] [words indistinct] President  al-Asad  did not neglect the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and talking  about the comprehensiveness of the issue of peace. [end  recording]    [Wiklund] I do not think that al-Asad will neglect our  negotiations with Israel, he says, noting that the Syrian  president stressed the importance of a comprehensive peace in  the Middle East and emphasized that the peace process is  indivisible. That satisfies us, says this old hand in  negotiations.</p>

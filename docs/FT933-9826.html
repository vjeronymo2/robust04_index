			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Landowners count cost as grouse numbers fall: Alison Maitland on why this year's shooting season may be far from glorious - and the knock-on effects for tourism THE ANNUAL grouse-shooting season is to open next Thursday, August 12, and most likely with a whimper rather than a bang. It is the owners of the upland moors, not the grouse, who will have cause to complain this year. A sharp fall in numbers of the game bird has caused many estates in northern England and Scotland to postpone the annual shoot for several weeks or to cancel it altogether. Mr Michael Clarke, managing director of Buccleuch Estates in the Borders, is delaying the season until September and limiting it to regular customers. He expects to lose at least Pounds 100,000 from the three estates. 'It's very sad and we don't like doing it, but you can't shoot your stock,' he says. 'In financial terms it's pretty painful for us.' For many landowners the Glorious Twelfth will mean digging deeper into savings. Losses on the Lloyd's insurance market have left some without the safety net they would have used in lean years. Alternative income, such as sheep farming and deer stalking, bring much lower returns, and the tax incentives that encouraged some estates to sell land for forestry have ended. The drastic decline in bird numbers has been caused by a combination of natural forces, says Mr Peter Hudson, manager of upland research at the Game Conservancy, an independent conservation trust on the edge of the Cairngorms. A heavy fall of snow on the heather moors in May froze the first brood of chicks before they hatched. Second broods are still too young to shoot. In England, flocks have been infected by strongylosis, a disease which leaves females too sick to rear their chicks. Mr Hudson estimates that the number of birds on the Scottish moors is down by nearly two-thirds on an average year. In some places the situation is even worse - a count in one part of northern England found only 50 birds to a square kilometre, compared with 650 last year. The shortage means losses for the estates, which have to pay their gamekeepers and maintain their land even if there is no shooting. Britain has 459 estates devoted to grouse, covering 4m acres. 'On many estates there's no other income,' says Mr Jamie Illingworth of Strutt and Parker, the land agents. 'They've got the heather and the rock, and grouse is the crop.' Tourism is suffering, too. The shooters - Americans and continental Europeans as well as British businessmen - tend to be big spenders. 'They don't stint themselves,' says Mr Dennis Fulford-Talbot, general manager of the George Hotel in Chollerford, Northumberland. 'They drink very good clarets and the best ports and brandies.' He usually has four or five shooting parties of up to 20 people each, bringing in between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 6,000 per party. This year there have been no bookings. On the moors, a party of eight can expect to pay Pounds 5,000 for a day's shooting in a good year, bagging 120 birds between them. 'We've cancelled about 30 days of shooting - that's about Pounds 150,000 worth,' says Mr John Ormiston, managing director of Sport in Scotland, which organises shooting holidays on 50 estates. The Treasury stands to lose on that sum to the tune of Pounds 26,250 in value added tax. There will be fewer seasonal jobs for beaters in this year's grouse season, and local shops, woollen mills and car-hire companies will suffer. A study by Strathclyde University estimated indirect expenditure of grouse-shooting parties in Scotland at Pounds 9.5m in 1989. Most estates are biting the bullet and hoping for a turnround next year  - Scotland had a poor season last year as well. Nobody is yet predicting the demise of the grouse estates. It is a business where you have to take a long-term view, and landowners tend to have deep pockets, says Mr Ormiston. 'You don't own grouse moors to make money. You own them because you've got money.' Weekend FT, Pages VIII, XIV</p>

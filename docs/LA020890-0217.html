			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING/FINANCE  </P> <P> Glenfed Shares Sold: Royal Trustco, meantime, sold 515,000 shares of stock in  Glendale Federal's parent firm to reduce its ownership stake to a little less  than 5%, approximately 1.5 million shares.  </P> <P> The Canadian firm had purchased nearly 10% of Glenfed Inc. stock in the fall of  1987 in an apparent effort to work out a friendly merger.  </P> <P> But Glenfed rebuffed Royal Trustco, and the Canadian firm did not want to  launch a hostile takeover.  </P> <P> After its purchase of Pacific Savings, Royal Trustco was required to reduce its  stake in Glenfed to less than 5%. Federal regulations prohibit the owner of one  federally insured S&amp;L from holding more than 5% of an S&amp;L that it  doesn't control, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> Last month, the Canadian firm sold 836,400 shares to cut its stake from 9.4% to  6.7%.

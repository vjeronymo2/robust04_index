			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / IRA offers conditional ceasefire THE IRA said last night it would refrain from killing loyalists if their recently announced conditional ceasefire proved genuine, writes our Belfast Correspondent. However, the Provisionals said in a statement issued in Belfast that their campaign against the British government and security forces - ultimately responsible, they said, for the conflict in Northern Ireland  - would continue. The move follows last week's statement from the main loyalist para-military groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Freedom Fighters, that they would suspend operations during the forthcoming talks between the province's political parties.</p>

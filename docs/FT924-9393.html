			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wrapping up to brave tepid flotation waters  -A mechanism designed to guard against disappointing retail demand THE FLOTATION market has tentatively reopened after the summer pause. Yet the mood is still fragile after the series of issues in the early summer which were labelled flops when retail demand dried up. One new issue expert goes as far as saying that the market is 'hibernating'. And some corporate financiers are advising companies not to float at all. There have been a few successful issues - such as Trinity Holdings and Dorling Kindersley Holdings - with more in the planning stage. But already there has been an issue pulled. Woolcombers, the textile company, cancelled its flotation plans in September after Black Wednesday happened between publication of the pathfinder prospectus and the planned pricing day. Institutional investors were simply not prepared to put the money required into a relatively small company at a time of such volatile markets. The delayed flotation of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, is not expected to take place until the second half of next year because of the absence of economic recovery. So far no companies have followed the route of a public offer for sale, daunted, no doubt, by the reception met by issues such as The Telegraph, MFI Furniture Group, Taunton Cider and Anglian Group, where public offers were undersubscribed. Some corporate finance experts are sceptical that a public offer could work at present. 'Only,' says one, 'if it was a very popular retail stock, something with a strong brand.' However, in a month or so National Express, the coach operator, is expected to brave the market with a public sale making up 25 per cent of its issue. The other 75 per cent will be placed with institutions on a firm basis. Mr Jeremy Lucas, corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, National Express's sponsoring bank, says the public offer plan reflects expected interest in the issue from retail investors who often see the double arrowhead logo whizzing along motorways on the group's white coaches. Advertising for the sale has already begun on the buses. The public issue is not being underwritten. Rather Morgan Grenfell is planning to place these shares with institutions, who will release them according to demand from retail investors. The distinction is subtle and the end result the same. This placing and clawback method is common for smaller issues, where a firm placing is joined by a conditional placing of shares available to the public through financial intermediaries. Under a financial intermediaries offer members of the public can apply for shares via stockbrokers, rather than filling in an application form printed in a prospectus or a newspaper. The brokers than apply for shares on behalf of their clients. Private investors might not like this trend. The brokers may charge clients commission, whereas applications 'off the page' involve no extra charges. Further, not all potential investors have stockbrokers. But the system has its supporters. One merchant banker says: 'The financial intermediaries mechanism is the best of both worlds. Shares are not for the man in the street. They are risky investments and the sort of person who doesn't have a broker shouldn't be going for most flotations.' Another confesses: 'It is a cheaper way of persuading the Stock Exchange that you are trying to reach beyond the usual charmed circle.' The Stock Exchange is keen that small investors should be able to subscribe for new issues if there is sufficient retail demand. But at the same time, it wants to keep a balance and not be seen to be only looking after the small investor. However, the exchange has been taking a more flexible attitude to flotations in response to market conditions. It is concerned when a flotation is seen to have flopped, especially if that means that the market in the shares is weak. Until recently a limit of Pounds 30m was imposed on the amount a company could raise without making a public offer. Even that amount was only possible if half was offered through financial intermediaries to the public. These limits have now been relaxed, and sponsoring banks have been approaching the exchange to discuss arrangements for particular flotations. Trinity, which builds chassis for fire engines and dustcarts, was first to take advantage of the relaxation. It came to market with a placing slightly over the Pounds 30m level, with a quarter of the shares offered through financial intermediaries. That issue was priced on an evening when the market had fallen by more than 100 points. The intermediaries offer was oversubscribed and the shares opened at a premium on their first day of trading. Had the offer been split evenly between a firm placing and intermediaries, then the level of subscription of the latter part would have looked much thinner. It is understood that in Trinity's case the exchange was happy to cut the intermediaries' allocation to a quarter, and was prepared to see the issue value reach Pounds 35m without pressing for an offer for sale. The Stock Exchange has to take account of a sponsoring bank's judgment about likely retail demand for an issue when deciding whether to insist on a public offer. If a series of intermediaries offers were well-oversubscribed, the exchange would have to think again about reimposing an offer for sale requirement. The issue by JD Wetherspoon, the London pub chain, might have been thought to attract strong interest from the public. But the intermediaries' portion was only 79.4 per cent subscribed, leaving the rest of the shares with the institutional placees. By contrast Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publishing group, saw its intermediaries offer, which closed a day after Wetherspoon's, subscribed six times. That left the institutions with only the shares which had been placed firmly. Unlike a public offer, if the full number of shares available in an intermediaries offer is not subscribed, instead of the ignominy of having them left with underwriters, they will have been placed. The shares may end up in the same hands at the same price. But, as one broker admits: 'If an intermediaries offer is undersubscribed, it is easier to sweep it under the carpet than in a public offer.'</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALL-STARR SHOW: RINGO'S CHARM IS BOTTOM LINE  </P> <P> Ringo Starr spent most of his own show on Saturday at the Pacific Amphitheatre  in eclipse behind his helpful friends. But at the very end, the fourth Beatle  stepped out from behind his drums and put an engaging stamp on the proceedings.  </P> <P> Starr, who ends the first solo tour of his career tonight at the Greek Theatre,  got off to a flat start fronting his All-Starr Band. Decked out in a  ringmaster's silver tux emblazoned with stars, and jumping up and down or  shifting back and forth from foot to foot in an awkward dance, Ringo had the  uneasy look of an entertainer trying too hard to make up in enthusiasm for what  he lacks in natural gifts.  </P> <P> Starr's song introductions were perfunctory, with the famous drollery that has  given him his niche in pop culture nowhere in evidence. "No No Song," a novelty  hit about saying goodby to immoderate habits, received a hurried treatment in  which the newly on-the-wagon Starr failed to exploit the song's comic  possibilities. "Yellow Submarine" was forced and premature. Only a mood of fun  and bonhomie could have made the old Beatles sing-along work, and Starr had  established nothing of the sort.  </P> <P> After three songs, Ringo retreated to his drum kit. He seemed more at home  there, smiling and keeping the beat with a sway of his head and a flap of his  ponytail. He sang four oldies from his seated perch, but mainly let All-Starrs  Dr. John, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Billy Preston, Clarence Clemons, Joe Walsh  and Nils Lofgren take turns in the spotlight.  </P> <P> Then, at the end, Starr came back out front and put a warm shine on the night.  Through a show-closing run of hits -- "Photograph," "You're Sixteen" and an  encore version of "With a Little Help From My Friends" -- Ringo was a smiling,  delightful neo-vaudevillian who capered about joyfully while making all the  hokey moves that fell flat earlier seem somehow full of life.  </P> <P> Starr also tossed out some nice deadpan Ringo-isms. He sang "You're not 16" to  an audience that probably averaged more than twice that. And he mused on the  absurdity of the meaningless, pre-planned pop encore: "You know we're coming  back. We know we're coming back. Show biz. Show biz is my life."  </P> <P> As for the All-Starrs, the World's Wealthiest Bar Band might have been a more  descriptive name, as they knocked out predictable favorites with few attempts  at risk or surprise. Still, each member except Walsh contributed some strong  moments to a 26-song set that lasted longer than two hours.  </P> <P> Keyboardist Preston was like an explosive off-the-bench scorer in basketball,  providing instant energy when called upon. His duet with Clemons, "You're a  Friend of Mine," was especially spirited and comradely.  </P> <P> After Ringo's awkward start, Dr. John lifted the show with the funky New  Orleans parade anthem "Iko Iko," during which he strutted in an elaborately  feathered Mardi Gras headdress. Danko and Helm, both alumni of the Band,  harmonized in their familiar style. Along with Lofgren, the E Street Band  guitarist whose singing and playing are both choked with impressive emotion,  they provided most of the earnest passion in a show given over mainly to  lighthearted songs.  </P> <P> Walsh turned in some good guitar work, but he squandered his spotlight moments,  which included a slogging "Rocky Mountain Way." For some reason, Walsh figured  his past as an Eagle qualified him to sing "Desperado" and "Life in the Fast  Lane," songs that other Eagles originally sang. Walsh's stringy voice certainly  was no qualification.  </P> <P> Session drummer Jim Keltner was on hand as well, proving, in a troika with  Starr and Helm, that more drummers do not necessarily make for more interesting  drumming. (Starr's son, Zack Starkey, filled in on drums during his dad's turns  out front.) The beat throughout was as basic as three times one.  </P> <P> In the end, luckily, Starr's appeal was equally basic: He's Ringo, and all he's  gotta do is act naturally.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Japan pension bill passed A bill to reform Japan's pensions system, to cope with the fast growing number of elderly, was yesterday passed by the Diet's lower house. The scheme will raise pension premiums and gradually increase eligible pension age from 60 now to 65 in 2013. By then, one in four of the population will be over 65, up from 12 per cent in 1990. Trade unions and pensioners' lobbies had objected to the increase in pension premiums included in the bill, but the government agreed to increase the pension premiums it contributes from the national budget. To ease the transition, pensioners beneath the new starting age will get a partial hand-out, equal to roughly half a full pension. The basic monthly pension will rise, from Y206,300 (Pounds 1,305) to Y214,300 next year, to be funded by a rise in pension premiums from the present 14.5 per cent of salary to 17.35 per cent. The bill gives the government a mandate to raise premiums to a 29.6 per cent limit.</p>

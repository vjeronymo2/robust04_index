A SAKINFORM [Georgian press agency] correspondent, Tengiz  Pachkoria, asked Akaki Gasviani, deputy chairman of Abkhazia's  Council of Ministers, to comment on this statement.    Gasviani said: We consider Ardzinba's statement to reflect  an attempt to revise and reconsider the Geneva agreement  envisaging the return of all refugees. Ardzinba and his  supporters, who on several occasions violated the Sochi  agreement on settling the Abkhaz conflict peacefully, are now  trying to violate the Geneva agreements and the communique.  Obviously, the return of dozens of thousands of refugees to the  Gali and Abkhazia's other rayons is not suitable for them. This  statement by Ardzinba is a fresh attempt at holding the Georgian  population and the Georgian Government responsible for the  actions committed by the Abkhaz and the north Caucasian  combatants who had killed and pillaged the civilian population  of the autonomous republic--Georgians, Russians, Greeks, and  others--and for the combatants' actions--bombing and shelling  residential areas of Sukhumi and Abkhazia's other towns and  rayons. As for the criminal offenses committed in Abkhazia in  1992-93, we must investigate thoroughly these instances, and  criminal proceedings must be instituted against perpetrators  irrespective of their nationality.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> STAR PERFORMERS AT FISCHER TRIBUTE  </P> <P> Clare Fischer must have been deeply touched by the outpouring of support and  affection for him from the Los Angeles music community at a tribute concert at  the Wadsworth Theatre in Westwood.  </P> <P> It was a benefit to help cover the pianist's recent extraordinary medical  expenses, and a long line of performers turned out. Much of the music reflected  Fischer's continuing interest in Latin rhythms. Its quality, despite the good  intentions, varied from group to group.  </P> <P> Secret 9 -- actually a quartet -- opened the Thursday evening concert with a  set that virtually bristled with electronic energy. But the ensemble's flashy  note flurries and high-speed tempos were rarely matched by an equivalent amount  of musical warmth.  </P> <P> The group was followed by the appealing pop jazz of Syndicado Brasil, sporting  two lead singers and a colorful collection of samba rhythms. Rudy Regaldo's  15-piece ensemble, Chevere, was even better. The ensemble's sizzling Afro-Cuban  rhythms, soaring vocals and powerful ensemble work provided both the musical  and the emotional high points of the the first half of the program, which  concluded with a solo-oriented set from an ensemble featuring guitarist Rick  Zunigar, bassist Jeff Berlin, drummer Alex Acuna and percussionist Luis Conte.  </P> <P> Chick Corea's unannounced appearance with his acoustic trio (Dave Weckl on  drums and John Patitucci on bass) was the musical meat and potatoes of the  program. A brief excursion through "How Deep Is The Ocean?" underlined how  effectively Corea has managed to blend the rich harmonies of mainstream jazz  with the complex rhythms of the '80s.  </P> <P> Pianist David Benoit had the misfortune to follow Corea -- a positioning that  only served to emphasize the fragile level of creativity that sometimes  afflicts his music. Typically, Benoit's best number was a light-hearted romp  through Vince Guaraldi's "Linus and Lucy."  </P> <P> The long evening finally wound to a close with a lovely a capella performance  from Fischer's vocal quartet and a funk-drenched appearance by Tom Scott's "Pat  Sajak Show Band."  </P> <P> Donations to help fund Fischer's recovery from severe head injuries continue to  be accepted by Musicians Wives, Inc./Clare Fischer Fund at P.O Box 4685, North  Hollywood, 91607.

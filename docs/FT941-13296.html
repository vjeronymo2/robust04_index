			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Equity finance sought for Ferranti buy-out The team of Ferranti International managers which is preparing a bid for the bulk of the collapsed defence electronics group is seeking equity finance to back either a full management and employee buy-out, or the management/employee element of a consortium bid. A brochure outlining the management team's planshas been sent to institutions and banks. The seven-man team, led by Mr Phil Burton, Ferranti's director of marketing, told the company's UK employees yesterday that 'discussions with institutions start this week'. The team is also exploring possible trade partners, 'including companies from the UK and overseas'. However, in a 'progress report' to employees the team, dubbed Newco, said that press reports of a Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m price for Ferranti 'do not come from Newco management and are not representative of the value we place on the businesses'. Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the administrative receivers from Arthur Andersen who were appointed to the ailing group after GEC withdrew a 1p a share rescue bid in December, have welcomed the proposed management buy-out and other bids. The management team, which is advised by Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Corporate Finance, said it understood there had been 200 expressions of interest in part or all of Ferranti. 'The Newco plans are now complete,' the management team said. 'They show a company which is profitable and capable of generating cash, although it needs early investment in people, products and facilities.' In the meantime Ferranti is continuing trading and won Pounds 1.8m of new orders last month.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Asean may act against sect South-east Asian governments will meet in Malaysia next week to co-ordinate action against an Islamic sect whose growing influence has alarmed the authorities in the Moslem countries of the region, Victor Mallet reports from Bangkok. The Al-Arqam movement, named after an early companion of the prophet Mohammed in Mecca, is a mystical sect that believes in the imminent arrival of an Islamic messiah. Called 'technological sufism' by some supporters, Al-Arqam preaches basic Islamic values but also has extensive business interests - including restaurants, software companies and advertising agencies. Malaysian police have detained 41 suspected Al-Arqam supporters in the past week, accusing them of distributing pamphlets illegally. Indonesia is also considering a ban, and the small Sultanate of Brunei has already outlawed the group.</p>

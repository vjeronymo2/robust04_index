			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Juan de la Cruz Willka, assistant secretary </F> general of the Bolivian Labor Federation, in "Friday Dialogue";  place and date not given]    [Text] Since the creation of the General Trade Union  Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), the  indigenous-peasant movement has gained greater influence in the  country. This accounts for the fact that, for example, the vice  president of the Republic is an Aymara and that in the trade  union field, the peasants have proposed that the Bolivian Labor  Federation (COB) try to bring itself into line with the national  reality.    Prior to the 10th Congress of the COB, to be opened at the  end of May, the secretary general of that organization, Juan de  la Cruz Willka, as representative of the CSUTCB, was invited to  "Friday Dialogue" to describe the expectations in that area and  to provide a general view of the peasant movement.    Willka (48 years old) was born in the community of  Chachacumani, Pantaleon Dalente de Oruro Province, although he  points out that he was really born in Ayllu Thaya Kira. He has  had a very active political and trade union career and is  considered one of the leading representatives of those who want  the COB to make a qualitative leap forward and include among its  principles the struggle of the indigenous nations.    [PRESENCIA] One subject under discussion is how  representative the different sectors of the COB are. What is the  position of the peasants in that regard?    [Willka] In two previous congresses of the COB, we  maintained  that the organic structure of the COB and of the Executive  Committee should express the national reality. That is to say,  diversity, the class struggle and the struggle of the indigenous  nations.    At the moment, they are expressions only of the class  struggle and not of the struggle of the indigenous nations. That  is why it is a classist structure.    We have made some progress, they have already given us the  General Secretariat. In the Congress of Chuquisaca, the CSUTCB  proposed this as the political thesis of the COB, but the  salaried workers ratified their political thesis and a classist  structure, as a guarantee, they said, of the revolution. Our  thesis proposes instead that the class struggle and the struggle  of the indigenous nations are based on the same thing.    [PRESENCIA] To what do you attribute the resistance against  accepting the peasants' thesis?    [Willka] To an ideological conception. They describe us  peasants as petit bourgeoisie because we own a piece of land.  They say that all property owners, according to their analysis,  are not to be trusted, and therefore we are petit bourgeoisie.    We reject that assertion. We are not a part of the petit  bourgeoisie because we own a piece of land. There is an  ideological background here that is very deeply rooted, and that  I want to explain.    In both ideological beliefs, that of the socialist states of  the former Soviet Union and that of capitalism, land is  considered an economic asset that must be exploited to obtain  economic benefits. Therefore, anyone who possesses land--one or  several hectares--possesses wealth and can improve his standard  of living.    Based on our Andean ideological conception, land is not an  economic asset; the land is part of mankind. If land did not  exist, we believe that man could not live, because where could  we produce rice, yucca, potatoes, bananas; where could we graze  our livestock? Therefore, for us land is part of the life of  mankind and of humanity, and it must be cared for, just like  human life, so that it serves humanity and not, as in other  proposals, that the land must be squeezed dry, as socialism and  capitalism have always done.    From that starting point, we reject those philosophies that  say that any proprietor is a bourgeois.    Furthermore, in Bolivian practice, if we compare a peasant  and a salaried worker, which one is better off economically? A  worker might have his radio, his television, he has his tea, he  dresses well, etc., and a peasant from north Potosi is dressed  in rags and can barely feed himself.    Therefore, it is impossible to believe that we are petit  bourgeoisie, and we think that they are wrong to analyze only on  the basis of a philosophy that Marx brought to us, which is  valid, but in a different situation, and Europe is a different  situation that is very far away.    We should take these errors into account and direct  ourselves, based on our cultural roots, toward a structure and  ideology of the COB.    [PRESENCIA] How should the COB be structured, according to  that position?    [Willka] By taking into account its societal base. The  societal expression of this country comes primarily from the  indigenous nations: Aymaras, Quechuas, Guaranies, and other  nations. They should have a real representation inside the COB.    The other sectors also have their social expressions: the  salaried workers, among them, as always, the miners, factory  workers, etc.; the trade unions and other sectors that must be  represented.    In reality, neither peasants nor factory workers nor miners  should be privileged. Nobody. The privileged should be some  distinguished leader who has been proven in the struggle, in his  honesty, in his preparation; this kind of person should be our  leadership in the COB. If they are miners, good for the miners;  if they are from other sectors, the same goes for them. This is  what we believe.    [PRESENCIA] At present, the executive secretary is elected  by  a workers' vanguard, in this case, the miners....    [Willka] Who constitutes the vanguard is a subject that is  under discussion. Why were the miners the vanguard? Because of  their struggle, more than anything else, since the beginning of  the trade union movement, which aimed at the defeat of the  mining oligarchy and afterward continued the struggle. This is  what gave it the label of vanguard. In those days there was  class consciousness because the miners were not employees of a  state enterprise; they were employees of private enterprise and,  being private enterprise, class consciousness at that time was  stronger than attachment to a job. They left their jobs and  fought for change. I believe this is what made them strong.    However, now it seems that workers do not have sufficient  class consciousness. Let us see which worker would decide to  leave his job for the struggle. None. They prefer to keep their  jobs, even with a miserable salary, and not give up their jobs  and embark on the struggle. This shows that class consciousness  has decreased and that one is just another worker. I believe  that this is what is happening now.    [PRESENCIA] On the other hand, are the peasant leaders  ready,  in a trade union sense, to lead the COB?    [Willka] I think that...some time ago, I said that I did not  know how we could qualify, whether we would all have to take an  examination. It is always that way, it is also ideological: "The  peasants are not ready yet." We have not been ready for 500  years, but when will we be? I believe that this is the question.  I believe that no one has ever taken on a responsibility,  already knowing everything. It is a matter of initiative, of a  person's decision to assume responsibility.    [PRESENCIA] Getting back to the sectors, which ones have  received the proposal most favorably?    [Willka] The miners agreed to discuss it, to think it over.  Those who do not want to hear of it are the Troskyites, who  accuse us of being back in the Middle Ages. The teachers agree.  But let us be clear: It will not be the miners or the factory  workers or the teachers who decide not to go along, but the  professional politicians, such as the Trotskyites. But I do not  believe that they represent all of the teachers. We would be  wrong, then, to say that they do not accept us.    [PRESENCIA] In your view what is the outlook for the 10th  Congress of the COB?    [Willka] There are going to be problems along the lines  indicated by this discussion, and everyone will want to speak  his mind. But I believe that there is maturity at the sector  level. I believe that in spite of these problems, the COB is  going to go forward, as it has always done. We will form the  Executive Committee, whoever might be on it, because there is no  way to calculate that. The workers say "so many of us have  died," and we wish we were able to count how many of us have  died; we have millions of dead, not only during this period but  since the arrival of the Spaniards.    [PRESENCIA] You no longer believe in vanguards?    [Willka] Not any more. The vanguard should include all the  workers, from the smallest to the biggest, without preferences.    [PRESENCIA] How long will the CSUTCB last if they do not  listen to you?    [Willka] We have realized that, having the secretary  general,  having the executive, has resolved nothing. We have to think  about making a political move; leaving the trade union struggle  to move on to a political struggle. The union movement is a form  of struggle, but it is others who wield power, and all our lives  we have been fools and nothing more. That is why I say that if  they do not give us, let us say, the executive, with a factory  worker executive, with a miner executive, or with whomever, the  peasants are going to continue offering up their lives, as in  this latest conflict. Let the peasants win the executive, we are  the ones who weep and die. That is the problem. Therefore, we  will continue on that road.    [PRESENCIA] What will be the principal disagreements at the  10th Congress of the COB?    [Willka] In reality, they will be between the official  position and those who do not share the official position, but  not so much a function of party but of concept, of the thinking  in each sector. I say that their proposal is bad because they  want to destroy the communities. By means of municipalization,  the indigenous communities--we have been independent, so  far--are now going to be dependents of popular participation. I  do not agree with that because it really means we will all be  the same. The new configuration of municipalities is going to  break up entire communities of ours. I do not agree with that  policy, and the official position is going to be one of  agreement. The fight, then, will be along those lines.    They will tell us that we are going to collect rural land  taxes through the municipalities, and some will say yes, we will  say no. Therefore, there are two different opinions.    [PRESENCIA] Will the other conflict be between the classist  concept and that of a nation?    [Willka] I believe...we will see. I am calculating that no  one will be opposed to it; I believe that everyone will sign  on--even earlier they recognized the struggle of the  nationalities in some manner. I do not believe anyone is going  to deny that. I do not believe that this feeling exists in this  Congress.    During the Congress on Bolivian Education, which was held by  the official sector, the COB, and the church, we all agreed that  to educate the children is to construct a state that is  multicultural, multinational, and socialist. (The socialist did  not please many, but we explained that this was intended in a  communitarian sense because, in the end, there cannot be a  pretty little multicultural state which is also capitalist, and  because what we are aiming for is that there should be equity.)    [PRESENCIA] Organically, also?    [Willka] There it will be different. I think it will be  difficult. There are going to be arguments, walk-outs, that kind  of thing.... I at least am coming to the realization that it  will still be a very serious problem.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  The Difficult Relationship Between Leadership and Peasant </H5> Grass Roots    [PRESENCIA] The CSUTCB has entered and is still suffering  from a very severe crisis due to ideological conflict and  corruption. Why are there so many problems and what is being  done to resolve them?    [Willka] The crisis is due more than anything to the  political positions of the peasant leaders. I would say that  there are three positions. One, racist, which says that the only  solution is finishing off the Creoles [q'aras]. Another, very  clever, is the social democratic position which, starting out  from peasant initiatives, has taken root, not directly as social  democracy, but as a proposal vindicating the rights of the  peasants. The third current position proposes neither racism nor  classism. We say that it is not possible for the class struggle  and the struggle of the indigenous nations to be separated or  even allied, but they must be a single thing, without it  disturbing anyone, and that is what is happening, to a certain  extent. These factions have confronted one another to take over  the leadership of the trade union movement, but I think that the  conflict is a thing of the past.    The last conflict was due to the fact that the social  democrats of the MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] wanted complete  domination over the CSUTCB, so that it would serve as the  political cushion of the current government; its leaders wanted  to hang on and there we fought it out, we made a problem out of  it.    At last, there is unity now through communitarian trade  union  democracy, which means that he who won has won, and nothing  more. This is where the political maturity of the comrade  delegates who attended the congress was demonstrated. They had  to elect a comrade peasant who expresses both ideas, Comrade  Felix Santos, who is a genuine peasant.    Evidently, they are not happy about this, they keep  complaining, there are many loud complaints from many sides, but  in any case, the crisis we were suffering has been resolved at  the leadership level, but only partly at the grass roots. The  leadership has influence, but the grass roots are a different  story.    [PRESENCIA] What is going on at the peasant grass roots?    [Willka] The grass roots are structured differently. There  are trade unions, indigenous authorities, cooperatives, and  associations, there are many forms of organization. The  principal authorities in the communities are the trade unions  and the indigenous authorities, and the others (cooperatives,  associations) are the economic branches of those authorities.    We lack sufficient communication with the grass roots to  keep  them well-informed. It is very hard to reach everywhere. In that  regard, the best organized are the miners, the workers. They  work together, at the blow of a whistle they have a meeting,  while with us....    [PRESENCIA] How would you describe the different positions  in  the peasant movement?    [Willka] It depends on the problems of each community, each  sector, and each region.    Those most affected by neoliberal policies and foreign  political interference recently have been the coca leaf growers.  They have had very serious problems. A coca grower is constantly  afraid that the UMOPAR [Mobile Rural Patrol Unit) will seize his  house, ransack it, and leave a kilo of cocaine, and say  afterward that they found it there; it is really serious. In  addition, the eradication of the coca plantations has hurt. It  is as if a comrade on the altiplano had his crops destroyed by  someone. Anyone would get angry. This is why the coca growers  have really radicalized their struggle.    It is the same on the altiplano: everyone has become  radicalized over the tax on rural property and against  commercialization of the land, which is a very sore subject for  the peasants. These problems come up and the comrades become  radicalized, they fight.    With regard to extreme poverty, there are many approaches.  Many comrades believe that the government is going to save them  when they experience hardship and that is why they tend, let us  say, to suffer hunger. That happens because they think that the  government might help them to improve their situation, and they  allow themselves to be used. This is a problem that we have been  unable to remedy so far.    This is why there are questions: although everyone is united  in the struggle of the indigenous nations over land, taxes,  etc., no one is united when it comes to elections. Instead,  everyone casts his vote for a political choice contrary to his  interests, believing that the government is going to take care  of his problem.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  If the COB's Business Was Conducted in Aymara! </H5>   Willka's ideas about the need for change in the COB are not  new. He proposed them some six years ago, together with other  peasant leaders. Nevertheless, there are problems of  communication.    "Even I have a problem," he admits. "It is not possible for  an urban teacher, let us say, to grasp it because my language is  different from his. I was born speaking Aymara, and I learned  Castilian at age 12. This is why our way of expressing ourselves  and of interpreting things holds us peasants back."    He explains that as Castilian is the language in which the  COB's business is conducted "we sometimes do not make ourselves  understood, but if discussions in the 10th Congress of the COB  are going to be in Aymara, Quechua, then the other sectors will  have interpreters, but they will not be able to explain to us  with perfect clarity what they are thinking. This, in fact, is  our problem, and it is present in all of the meetings."    And it has consequences: "There are some concepts that  sometimes I really have to go to the dictionary to look up, and  the following day it dawns on me. Oh hell, that is what was  said, and all this time I did not understand!"  <H5>  Hard To Change </H5>   In addition, Willka says that there is a deeply rooted  working class ideology in the cities that is hard to change and  that can be seen, "for example, in May Day parades, which are  completely working class. The peasants in the department of La  Paz customarily march on that day. There were more than 5,000  comrade peasants in the last parade. What newspaper coverage did  they receive? None. Not even a tiny photograph. There were some  50-100 miners with their little picks, and they came out in a  front page photo. It seems that the press is also working class.  That is all right. These things happen. They still do not want  to understand, it is like passing from one set of customs to  another, from one way of life to another; it is hard."    This situation is reflected in the COB. Willka says that "if  a peasant was the executive of the COB, I do not know whether  the workers would maintain their affiliation, they might decide  to disaffiliate because the roots are very strong, the class  struggle is very deeply rooted."  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Politics and Peasants </H5>   The peasant movement has experienced many changes of  fortune.  It had gained much strength by 1952 but gradually lost it later  until, with the creation of the CSUTCB, an equivocal period of  crisis began.    Willka explains this phenomenon, recognizing that "our  thinking was different before 1952. We did not even understand  the problem of the land. The MNR [National Revolutionary  Movement] said that it was going to give us land, as though they  had brought the land with them; we did not know that the land  was ours, that our history was hidden in darkness. Now, all of  the peasants are obliged to think things through."    He believes that with the foundation of the CSUTCB in 1979,  "matters are becoming much clearer, the current leaders are more  open."    "But we have still not been able to escape or deal with the  political manipulation that exists in the country. They have  manipulated us very easily, for example: The `Goni' [typical  member of an indigenous nation] has become aware of the  political accumulation of the past 500 years. On 12 October 1992  we were feeling very strong and right away an Aymara comes  along--Victor Hugo Cardenas--to be co-opted, and in the end he  ruined us politically. In other words, the indigenous nations  were a real answer for many people, but when they saw an Aymara  make common cause with the Creoles, they no longer trusted the  Aymaras."    This is why he is convinced that Cardenas's decision was a  severe blow. "We want to go forward with our own leaders. The  people have been trusting, there have been the 500 years of  Aymaras, Quechuas, and with their mobilization, we felt united,  we could do things, our grass roots believed that now we were  strong and people believed that `these leaders are raising us  up.' We even used to say that the workers, that this or that  sector, had betrayed us, when someone of our own blood sold  himself out to the neoliberal political leadership."    "What do the people at the grass roots think? That their  leaders always betray them, there is the Aymara who sold out. I  think that Victor Hugo lent himself to that game. If he had not,  he would certainly not be in the government, but perhaps he  would have had a position of such prestige as to be able to  lead, just like Mandela in South Africa, who showed us that this  kind of thing is possible."    "Imperialism has very cleverly created a problem for us.  Before, it killed us to keep us quiet, now it co-opts us and  makes us distrust our own leaders. Who is going to believe me  now? I travel among the indigenous nations, I talk, but people  are thinking `this one is just using us to get ahead. Tomorrow  or the next day he will surely sell out, just like Victor Hugo.'  This is what has happened, and it is very serious."    Nevertheless, asked whether the influence of the political  parties in the peasant movement is harmful, Willka says no. "It  was harmful before, but lately it is not very important, because  who are they influencing? On the one hand, there is the official  sector (MNR, MRTKL [Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement], UCS  [Solidarity Civic Union], MBL [Free Bolivian Movement]); on the  other, the groups represented in the union leadership, the ASD  [Social Democratic Alliance] and the Pachakuti axis," but he  says that it was decided to leave aside party labels and enter  the struggle of class and nation. "That is, first I am a  peasant, and I am expressing myself this way. This is at the  trade union level. Second, I myself feel that I must perform a  political task for the liberation of the people. It would seem  that these are very exaggerated arguments that the political  parties are using. I do not feel manipulated nor am I a  manipulator, because I am part of the political leadership."    "I do not believe that there is anyone in the COB.... Who  could politically impose a given leader? I do not think that  way. There must be very little of that now. That is how it was  before. It was said that, politically, this one must be a  leader, and everyone had to support him, but no longer."  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Production, Culture and Consciousness, Origins of the </H5> Peasant Crisis    The ever more important presence of peasants in the various  social and political movements is explained by Willka as due to  economic, cultural, and political factors, starting with the  struggle of the indigenous nations.    In his view, "the struggle is not always in the street. The  struggle can be carried out in different ways, and the struggle  of the indigenous nations has been one of resistance. They have  resisted by retaining their cultural roots, their language,  their laws, their form of organization, and even their  territories."    This is why, he explains, the peasants produce 70 percent of  the country's foodstuffs, while there is not even a single farm  operator who produces quinua, lamb, kidney beans, broad beans,  onions, cacao, lettuce, peaches, or corn. The only products the  farm operators produce are sugarcane, soy beans, cotton, and  beef. The peasants grow the coca. There are no farm operators  who grow coca."    Cultural roots are another factor. Willka refers to the  peasants' own organizations, structured "on the basis of the  philosophy of the land." In this field, the fact that the land,  under the Agrarian Reform Law, cannot be seized or divided,  "means that no one can take our land from us, and it does not  frighten us when they threaten us, saying `since you have been  obstructing us, now you are going to lose your land.'"    The final factor Willka mentions is that the peasants have  become aware that they have been exploited, excluded, and  oppressed for the past 500 years, and they have never been able  to have their own government.    With respect to the first, the peasant leader says that the  peasants are participants in two forms of struggle: the class  struggle, because they are exploited, "but we are also oppressed  and excluded as nation and culture. This, then, is a factor that  allows us to raise our consciousness."    Finally, he says that "governments have always been Creole  or  mestizo, never an Aymara nor any other indigenous nationality.  This an awareness that is taking root in the communities and  that is beginning to raise the question: when are we going to  manage our own affairs?"</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] China's military chiefs are likely to play a  commanding role in determining who will govern the country when  the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, dies. A reshuffle expected  later this year in the top military decision-making body could  offer clues as to the future political loyalties of the generals.    General Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Communist Party's  Central Military Commission (CMC) and the People's Liberation  Army's second most senior serving military officer, is tipped to  step down before the end of this year, sources in Beijing say.    Zhang, 79, was called upon by Deng at the 14th party  congress  in October 1992 to help oversee the purge of General Yang  Baibing and his supporters.    Yang, formerly the PLA's chief political commissar and CMC  secretary-general, was sacked by Deng for his aggressive  political ambitions. Yang had hoped to use his control of the  military establishment to secure a place at the top of the  political leadership.    Zhang was given the task of retiring or transferring dozens  of senior generals who had close connections to Yang and his  elder half-brother, the former CMC first vice-chairman and state  president, Yang Shangkun.    Observers say the Yangs' military power base has now been,  in  effect, crushed. Although some former associates of the Yangs  still remain in office, they have little influence.    Zhang can now step down and make room for younger blood at  the top of the military hierarchy.    The party general secretary and CMC chairman, Jiang Zemin,  wants Zhang's replacement to be the Defence Minister, General  Chi Haotian, one of his top military aides. Jiang and Chi have  forged close ties since Jiang became CMC chairman in November  1989, and Chi has worked hard to build up his  commander-in-chief's profile within the ranks.    Chi, 65, has extensive command experience. He headed the  General Staff Department (GSD), which manages the PLA's  operational activities, from 1987 until 1992, when he was  transferred to the Defence Ministry. That move was seen as a  setback for Chi, as the Defence Ministry is considered a largely  ceremonial portfolio.    Chi is regarded as a professional soldier with few obvious  political ambitions, though his past military assignments  included stints as a political commissar. There are suggestions  that Chi could also be in line for the powerful post of CMC  secretary-general, a position that has been left vacant since  Yang Baibing's dismissal. This would see Chi running the  day-to-day administration of the country's military affairs.    Although Chi is the front-runner to take over from Zhang,  other names have also been mentioned. One is General Zhao  Nanqi, president of the Academy of Military Sciences, a close  supporter of Jiang. Another candidate is General Zhu Dunfa,  commandant of the National Defence University.    Whoever replaces Zhang will have considerable influence in  military policy making. Zhang's responsibilities as CMC  vice-chairman include overseeing the appointment of senior  commanders, reorganising the PLA's structure, and the  formulation of the military's operational doctrines.    Zhang currently shares the running of the 3 million-strong  PLA with General Liu Huaqing, executive CMC vice-chairman and  the military's top-ranking officer. Liu, 78, is also the  military's representative on the Politburo standing committee.  He, too, is expected to make way for younger blood within the  next few years.    The selection of Chi as CMC vice-chairman would  substantially  enhance Jiang's consolidation of a military power base. Since  becoming CMC chairman, Jiang has worked hard in building his  military connections, making particular efforts to build up his  influence in the paramilitary People's Armed Police (PAP).    The PAP, which is responsible for internal security duties,  has been substantially beefed up after its failure to contain  public demonstrations in Beijing in the spring of 1989 led to  the military's intervention.    But Jiang still has much to do before he can be confident  the  military is fully behind him. One handicap is his lack of  military experience. Military commanders have in the past  refused to give their support to leaders who they thought lacked  military credentials.    How badly Jiang's lack of military experience will seriously  hamper his power-building efforts remains to be seen as few  other senior civilian leaders have any military background or  even ties with the PLA. Lacking alternative candidates, the  military chiefs may see Jiang as the best choice in pushing for  their interests in the post-Deng leadership.    Jiang needs to win political control over the military if  he is to have any chance to survive the power struggle that is  likely to follow Deng's death.    As party secretary-general and state president, Jiang is  formally China's top leader, but he is widely seen as a  political lightweight and his involvement in substantive  policy-making is said to be limited and uninspiring. But  control of the military apparatus would guarantee Jiang an  influential role in any post-Deng leadership.    As commander-in-chief, Jiang theoretically already has full  control over the military, but he still needs Deng's approval  before he can promote Chi and other supporters.    As the Yangs found to their cost, Deng guards his control  over the military jealously. Jiang has to be careful that he is  not seen as building a military power base that could threaten  Deng. Deng strengthened his grip over the military leadership  after the Yang purge by installing his chief personal secretary,  General Wang Ruilin, as deputy director of the PLA's General  Political Department (GPD). The GPD is responsible for watching  over the political loyalties of the military rank and file.    Wang is not expected to remain in his GPD post for long  after  Deng's death as his general's rank was the reward for long  service as Deng's military secretary.    The other important Deng loyalist in the military leadership  is Liu Huaqing. As a Politburo standing committee member, Liu's  role is to manage the military's relationship with the top party  leadership, as well as to make sure the PLA's interests are  taken into account in the making of national policies. Now 77,  Liu's advancing years means that he is unlikely to maintain his  position long after Deng's death.    The imminent passing of Liu and Zhang Zhen paves the way for  Chi and other generals from the next generation to take over the  military hierarchy. The political loyalties of this next  generation of military leaders will not be known until they take  over at the top. But as these officers are considered more  professional than their predecessors, it is likely that their  interests will be dictated more by institutional than personal  considerations.    Although Jiang is working hard to build close political  connections with the army's leadership, whether the generals  will support him will depend on how hard they think he will  fight in raising the military budget and whether they believe he  will take their views into account in making foreign policy  decisions.    But other civilian leaders, some with stronger support  networks in the regular party hierarchy, could also offer  similar assurances to the military's commanders in order to win  their support. The military's voice is, therefore, likely to be  more influential over these next few years.</p>

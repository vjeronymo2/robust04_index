			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Engen expects to benefit from S Africa referendum ENGEN, the integrated energy arm of Gencor of South Africa, outperformed market expectations to record a 21 per cent increase in earnings per share in the six months to the end of February. Although turnover was only 4 per cent higher at R3.23bn (Dollars 1.12bn), operating income was 15.2 per cent higher at R190m. Net income rose by a spectacular 68.9 per cent, to R206m, due to an enormous leap in finance income - from R5m in 1991 to R67m in 1992 - which reflected the interest receipts on the proceeds of last year's R1.1bn rights issue. Mr Rob Angel, chief executive, said the recent affirmative vote in the referendum on South Africa's political future would bring very valuable benefits to the group. He predicted the vote would lead to an early abolition of the UN oil embargo against South Africa. He also said the vote would have a very positive impact on the company's activities in Africa and enhanced the prospects of a strategic alliance with a leading world oil company. The increase in earnings per share was limited to 21 per cent - up to 134 cents from 111 cents - on account of a 40 per cent increase in the number of shares in issue. The dividend was lifted by 19 per cent to 50 cents a share. Mr Angel said that the group had recorded an overall volume increase of about 3 per cent, including a three-fold increase in exports over the previous six months. Exports now constitute about 10 per cent of total volumes. Most of these extra volumes were sent to the 15 African countries with which Engen now trades. Refining margins were Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 2 below the 1991 average, but this was compensated for by a 15 per cent increase in drilling in Gabon and the Congo.</p>

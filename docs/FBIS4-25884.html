			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First installment in a series of articles by Huang Wenfang, </F> a former official with XINHUA News Agency's Hong Kong Branch who  retired from XINHUA in 1992 and now lives in Hong Kong]    [Text] I officially joined the Hong Kong branch of the New  China News Agency (Xinhua) on January 5, 1950. Even though by  the second half of 1949 I was already acting as "underground  messenger" for the director of Xinhua, I was still not  officially within the organization.    At the time, my principal task was youth work, where I was  one of the leaders of the renowned leftist youth group, the  After-school Social Club. The date of the official  establishment of Xinhua was May 1, 1947, which means 1997 will  be its 50th anniversary.    While I was one of the earliest cadres at Xinhua, I do not  deserve to be called one of the founders of the branch.    The only founder still alive is the former head of the  Foreign' Affairs Department, Tan Gan.    Xinhua was the first public organization of the Chinese  Communist Party (CCP) that was set up abroad.    During the anti-Japanese war there was an Eighth Route Army  administrative office in Hong Kong headed by Liao Chengzhi.    But this organisation still used a business name. Xinhua was  the first to use the name of the Communist Party.    The decision to set up the branch was made by the (former  premier) Zhou Eniai, the then secretary of the party's South  China Bureau.    After the war, Zhou led the party's negotiating team from  Chongqing to Nanjing for talks with the Kuomintang.    He decided to set up the branch in November 1946, just  before  leaving Nanjing to return to Yanan.    When he left Nanjing, Zhou was already thinking that a  significant portion of the undercover work in "white areas"  (controlled by the KMT) in the struggle between the CCP and the  KMT after the war would be shifted to Hong Kong.    Hong Kong would become an important rear base for work in  the  KMT-controlled areas.    A significant portion of the core leaders would also be  shifted to Hong Kong.    To meet with changes in work at the time, it was necessary  to  set up a public organization. After Zhou returned to Yanan, a  significant portion of the work of the South China Bureau would  be handed to the South China sub-bureau. Its headquarters would  be set up in Hong Kong, headed by Fang Fang.    When Zhou left Nanjing he was already thinking that the  majority of democratic figures, as well as a considerable number  of specialist personnel within the party, should remain outside  of Yanan and other areas of conflict in order to preserve their  power.    He was also considering how to organize manpower and prepare  skilled personnel for the upcoming struggle for political power.    A significant majority of specialists within the party -- in  particular those involved in international and cultural affairs,  were sent to Hong Kong.    A great portion of the outstanding figures of the democratic  parties were also in Hong Kong at the time.    Zhou Enlai decided that, apart from leaders of the Communist  Party committee in Shanghai, most of the other party members in  Shanghai, including Qiao Guanhua, Zhang Hanfu, and Pan Hannian,  would move to Hong Kong.    Qiao Guanhua would be the first director of Xinhua.    At the time of its establishment, there were 15 staffs split  into three groups.    The first was the five members of the Hong Kong  administrative office of the East River Column (a party  organization in eastern Guangdong).    The second group of five was in charge of the underground  radio station run by the South China Bureau.    The third was the five in the editorial office of the former  CHENG PAO (a party paper in Hong Kong which folded after the  party's Shanghai newspaper moved to the territory).    At the time, there were two party organizations in Hong Kong  -- the party and the city work committees. Responsibilities  were divided between the two.    The party committee handled above-ground work such as  propaganda, united-front activities and policy research, while  the city committee handled work among the masses.    Party committee members were half-open about their  identities, but city committee members were very secretive.    Qiao Guanhua's official title was director of Xinhua, but  his  unofficial title was secretary of the party committee.    After obtaining a doctorate in Germany, Qiao worked in Hong  Kong during the war against Japan and then went to Chongqing to  act as Zhou Enlai's political secretary.    After liberation (1949), he remained in the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and eventually became minister.    Even though for a time when it was part of the underground  party committee, Xinhua, it is most accurate to say, has always  been a top-level post of the Chinese Communist Party.    No matter what time or under what circumstances this has  always been its identity and the most accurate description of  its character and position.    A "top-level post of the party" can be summed up briefly.    First, it is one set up and controlled by the party.    Second, it represents and holds responsibility for the  party's work which falls within the scope of Hong Kong.    Third, "top-level" means it is the party's top organization  in the Hong Kong region.    This is not to say Xinhua's internal identity has never  changed.    When Qiao Guanhua founded the branch, Xinhua was essentially  the same as the party committee and he was the committee  secretary.    After liberation, there was a period of time when things  were  quite chaotic.    The party committee was dissolved and its work transferred  to  the South China subbureau in Guangzhou, whose secretary was Ye  Jianying, the second secretary Zhang Yunyi and the third  secretary Fang Fang.    The official title of Xinhua's second director, Huang  Zuomei,  was the representative of the South China subbureau in Hong Kong.    In the beginning, Zhang Tiesheng had no public rank or  title.    Only when the Hong Kong government began issuing personal  identity cards in 1950 did he take an official title --  editor-in-chief of Xinhua.    I accompanied Huang and Zhang to collect their identity  cards.    Many people say that the editor-in-chief of Xinhua at the  time was Li Chong, which is not correct.    I think the only two people who know this now are Tan Gan  and  myself.    After Zhang Tiesheng was transferred, Huang Zuomei was  promoted to special representative.    In 1952-53 the party committee for Hong Kong was  reestablished in Guangzhou under the leadership of the South  China sub-bureau and called the Hong Kong and Macau work  committee of the CCP.    Its first secretary was Qu Mengjue, then the party secretary  of Guangdong province, and the second secretary was Wang Kuang.    Many people do not understand why Liao Chengzhi sent Wang  Kuang to take over as the director of Xinhua after the cultural  revolution.    They believe Wang only handled propaganda work.    In fact, he had been handling Hong Kong work since the early  1950s.    When Mao Zedong came in on an inspection tour of Guangdong  province in 1956 and checked on the Hong Kong work, he made  critical remarks to the effect that it had always been done in  Hong Kong and there was no reason to move it to Guangzhou.    He ordered the Hong Kong and Macao work committee  transferred  back to Hong Kong and sent Liang Weilin as third director of  Xinhua.    Liang had been one of the leaders of the East River Column.    After it withdrew from the north, he was a politburo member  of central Guangdong, becoming the party secretary in 1949.  Before coming to Hong Kong he was the director of the Guangdong  education bureau. He had worked for many years in Hong Kong.    His public title was director of Xinhua, but his real  position was secretary of the Hong Kong and Macao work committee  of the CCP. The deputy secretary was Qi Feng.    Only in 1990 was Hong Kong and Macao work separated. In the  past, Macao work came under Hong Kong's leadership. The Macao  branch of the New China News Agency was known internally as the  Macao sub-committee and was under the leadership of Xinhua. Its  secretary was a member of the Hong Kong and Macao work committee.    As the time approached for the return of sovereignty of  Macao  and its work took on unique features, the work was split into  two new committees, the Hong Kong work committee and the Macao  work committee of the CCP.</p>

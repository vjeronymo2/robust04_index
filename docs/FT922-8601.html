			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Observer: Why Dublin? Ireland's fourth Eurovision Song Contest win has landed the state-backed television and radio network, RTE, with a big financial headache. Tradition dictates the winning country host the next year's competition. The Irish have won the contest three times before - in 1970, 1980 and 1987 - but staging the 1993 event in Dublin could cost RTE at least IPounds 2m. Irish officials will now have to weigh up their obligations before deciding whether they can dance to Eurovision's tune.</p>

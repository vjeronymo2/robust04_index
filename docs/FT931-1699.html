			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ferrum declines to Pounds 711,000 Ferrum Holdings, the engineering group, announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.64m to Pounds 711,000 in 1992. Mr Simon Miller, chairman, blamed the fall on continuing recession in the UK, economic slowdown in the Netherlands and a lower level of activity in the North Sea. Turnover amounted to Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 44.3m). Earnings per share dropped to 1.7p (7.13p) basic, but the directors propose to hold the dividend at 2.5p with an unchanged final of 1.4p. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.35m. Following disclosure of difficulties at Teredo Petroleum, which acquired Ferrum's Spanish oil interests in 1989, Ferrum has written down the value of the convertible loan notes then acquired from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 1.1m and made further provisions of Pounds 350,000.</p>

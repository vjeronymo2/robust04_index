			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Velayati Concludes Talks in </F> Damascus Which He Describes as `Very Positive'"]    [Excerpts] Damascus -- [Iranian Foreign Minister] Dr. 'Ali  Akbar Velayati left Damascus yesterday for his country after a  two-day visit to Syria during which he delivered a message to  President Hafiz al-Asad from Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani. He also held meetings with Hizballah leaders  at the Iranian Embassy in Damascus. [passage omitted]    Before departing from Damascus International Airport  Velayati  told reporters that his visit and talks in Damascus had been  "very positive" and "extremely friendly." [passage omitted]    At another level, a Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT that Israel believes that by its aggression against  Lebanon "it can bring about changes that would achieve what it  wants and complement what it achieved in the Gaza-Jericho  agreement." The official added that "the Israelis have  forgotten -- or, rather, they deliberately pretend to have  forgotten -- that the attacks will not get them the peace they  are seeking. Because the foundations of peace are clear and the  principles and terms of peace are more than clear. And anyone  searching for peace must be fully committed to implementing UN  resolutions. Aggression and threats of more extensive aggression  will bring about nothing but further tension and will destroy  the last opportunity to salvage the peace process, which has  reached an impasse as a result of the Israeli positions opposed  to any real peace.    The Syrian official pointed out that Tel Aviv -- as all the  facts indicate -- is seeking not only to cause strain in the  situation in the region, but also to push the region toward an  atmosphere of war.    The Syrian official said that the United States and the  international community are urged to put an end to the Israeli  aggression aimed not only against Lebanon, but the U.S.  initiative and the peace process as well.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and agencies] </F>   [Text] China has confirmed it will bring treason charges  against its most famous dissident Wei Jingsheng, while another  prominent dissident Wang Dan was held by Beijing police for an  hour yesterday.    A spokesman from the Ministry of Public Security said  yesterday detectives had already completed their investigation  of Mr Wei, and the results had been handed over to the Beijing  prosecutor's office. "We have handed our results to the Beijing  Procuratorate, who will take his case before the courts," the  spokesman said, adding that he was not aware of a timetable for  the indictment or trial.    After more than a month of Foreign Ministry hints, sources  close to the Justice Ministry acknowledged that Mr Wei could  stand trial as early as next month. In what will inevitably be  a high-profile trial, prosecutors will charge Mr Wei, the  undisputed leader of China's dissident community, with "plotting  to overthrow the government using foreign forces", one source  said. The far-fetched charge of overthrowing the government,  which sources say could be only one of up to three Beijing will  bring, demonstrates the authorities' fear of their most vocal  critic as public order begins to fray. Treason carries a  possible life jail sentence.    Meanwhile, Mr Wang told foreign journalists in Beijing he  was  taken to a police station at 11 am yesterday and released an  hour later. The former student leader of 1989 pro-democracy  demonstrations was arrested by 10 policemen during an interview  with five journalists from the American television network NBC  at his home. "They held me for about an hour, mainly to  question me about how the interview was arranged, things like  that," he said.    Mr Wang said he had not been ordered to refuse interviews  and  would talk to foreign correspondents who sought him out. He  also said he planned to leave Beijing of his own accord at the  end of the month. Mr Wang said his detention probably reflected  official efforts to control news gathering by foreign reporters  in the runup to 4 June, the fifth anniversary of Beijing's  crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy protests. It is also the  date by which United States President Bill Clinton must decide  whether to renew China's low-tariff most-favoured-nation trade  privileges. "I will not refuse to give interviews to anyone," a  defiant Mr Wang said.    Members of the NBC television crew, who were detained  separately, said they were released after several hours of  questioning.    Authorities worried about possible attempts to commemorate  the Tiananmen Square massacre have been rounding up dissidents  or putting them under round-the-clock surveillance.    Sources in Shanghai said Yang Qinheng, a long-time democracy  activist, was the latest to be arrested, and that police told  his wife he might be released after 4 June. It was not clear  exactly when Mr Yang was arrested. At least six other Shanghai  dissidents have been arrested since April. The brother of one,  Lin Muchen, said police had refused to give the family any  information.    In Beijing, police moved ahead of the anniversary to  round-up  dissidents, send some temporarily out of the capital and warned  others to avoid foreign journalists and stay at home.</p>

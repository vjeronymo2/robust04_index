			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Voters list demands for Clarke - People from a range of backgrounds have been telling the FT what they want from the chancellor. They will be asked tomorrow if they think he has delivered 'I vote a definite no to increases in VAT on fuel and heating. It just is not a caring stance. Politically it sends out a signal that the government does not care about the elderly and the poor' - keen Conservative supporter Richard Goodall, 28, general manager of the Asda superstore in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. 'I understand the government is broke. It needs to raise money, the only way it can raise money is from the people. You can guarantee after this Budget that the government will be getting more money off the people' - Tory voter Sean Cockburn, 22, quality manager at a plating factory in Darlington, County Durham. It cannot be easy for Kenneth Clarke, the populist chancellor. He will tomorrow discover just how difficult it is to please anybody at all, not to mention the Tory party's own supporters. During the past few weeks a wide range of people across Britain have been telling the Financial Times what they want from the first Budget in modern times to combine spending and taxation. Tomorrow afternoon, we will obtain their first reactions. From single mother to captain of industry, each knew what they wanted. Salaries ranged from less than Pounds 10,000 to more than Pounds 185,000 and political affiliation was split evenly between the two main parties, except for three Liberal Democrat supporters. The spread of opinion was wide. All but a couple were homeowners; most had mortgages, and, apart from a housewife and a student, all were employed. They had many views in common. Taxation, for most, was more important than spending. This was because none expected handouts from a Treasury that is servicing a debt of Pounds 50bn in 1993-94. None wanted an increase in the tax base or the phasing out of existing tax breaks - anything, in fact, that might threaten a recovery. Several concerns shone through: the repeal of Norman Lamont's phased imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel bills; for books, magazines and children's clothes to remain exempt from VAT; for tax breaks on investment and childcare; for lower interest rates and the retention of mortgage interest relief. There were also many specific concerns, reflecting among others the needs of their jobs. Leslie Thomson, 76, is a retired Lloyd's underwriter living at Monkton Deverill, near Warminster, Wiltshire. He votes Labour 'out of intellectual convictions'. He says: 'I very much dislike this government's insistence on indirect taxation and I would far rather a straightforward rise in the basic rate of tax. This seems so much fairer all round. I do feel that VAT and indirect taxes take no account whatsoever of people's financial situation.' Suzana Radovic, 43, is a single mother, but resists inclusion in the 'dependent lone parent' class that the government is targeting for savings. She is one of several dreading VAT increases. She is an art teacher and head of year at Wimbledon College, a girls' comprehensive, on Pounds 20,000 a year. Her five-year-old son, who attends a state primary, is looked after by his grandmother, so she receives no state support apart from child benefit. 'I'd like the chancellor to scrap this VAT on heating. My mother is a senior citizen at home all day and the heating has to be on too.' Jennie Gentles, 29, is a mature student at North London University who lives in a two-bedroomed flat in Streatham. Her only source of income is a maintenance grant from Croydon Borough Council, and her main outgoings are rent and books for her social science postgraduate degree course. She has to go without dinner for a week to pay for a vital text. 'I would hate to see VAT on books and newspapers. I can't afford course books at the moment, VAT will make them even more inaccessible and have a knock-on effect on my course work.' Like Suzana Radovic, Miranda Thomas, a part-time teacher with two small boys, wants tax breaks on childcare. But her main concern is that tax relief on mortgage interest payments should be retained. She and her solicitor husband bought a west London two-bedroomed flat for Pounds 131,000 in 1990. It has just been sold for Pounds 108,000. The couple took out a Pounds 75,000 interest-only mortgage when interest rates were 15 per cent; after paying the building society for four years, they still owe Pounds 85,000 - more than the initial mortgage. 'We worked out that we could have lived in a penthouse in the Ritz for the whole four years,' she says. For a young couple waiting to buy their own first home, mortgage tax relief is even more vital. Sean Cockburn and Karen Jewers have just had their offer accepted on a Pounds 48,000 three-bedroom semi in Darlington. 'I think Pounds 30,000 (the current ceiling) is unfair. You can buy a house for that but it's not a very good house,' he says. Others had specific concerns related to the industry they represented. Dennis Marks, 45, is the new general director of the English National Opera. He complains: 'The voice of the arts community isn't being heard in Whitehall.' Among his wishes are that the Treasury earmarks lottery proceeds for capital projects. And he cherishes a 'pipe-dream' that it zero-rates for VAT the performing arts, which are subject to the tax in full. Martin Jay, managing director of Vosper Thornycroft, the shipbuilder, speaks for the hard-pressed defence industry. He understands the pressures of the public-spending round and the need for cuts, but hopes to hear the chancellor announce the go-ahead for the tender for a new batch of Royal Navy minehunters. In general he believes that the market-testing initiative, if properly pursued, could deliver 'much better value in certain defence areas - support activities for the RN, training, and running ranges - than it does out of leaving it to the grey-suited civil servants'. Martin Laing is chairman of John Laing, the construction group. His main worry is that public-sector spending cuts will hit capital projects hard. 'I realise there are difficulties in these straitened times but we have to keep capital projects going to create jobs.' All the business people interviewed wanted 'encouragement' for capital investment. Geoff Cross, 47, is chief executive of Aerospace Systems &amp; Technologies in Consett, County Durham, and lives in a modern four-bedroomed house on an estate in Hexham, Northumberland. He sees no virtue in kick-starts but seeks a return to long-term economic management. 'You can't run the economy on politics - we have to get away from short-term expediency. We now have more people unemployed than involved in manufacturing in the UK. That's disgusting. We have a diminishing tax revenue-raising base to operate from.' Kenneth Clarke will have a difficult task pleasing many of these voters. He is already becoming known as a political chancellor. These interviews suggest he would do well to take note that the British still seem to deem certain areas - such as tax relief on mortgages, and zero-rating of VAT on children's clothes and books - as sacrosanct.</p>

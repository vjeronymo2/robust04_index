			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EVIDENCE THAT SOME MAY BE ALIVE ADDS TO FRUSTRATION;  </P> <P> FAMILIES STILL AGONIZE OVER FATE OF MIAS  </P> <P> Only two months after he had left for Vietnam in August, 1968, Jose Antonio  Graniela was shot during a confrontation with the Viet Cong. His family learned  he was missing in action.  </P> <P> Months later, the Brentwood, N.Y., family was told that Jose, 24, had died in  the arms of a comrade they knew only as Gary.  </P> <P> His body could not be found, the family was told. Nor could officials find any  of his belongings. Even the picture of his fiancee, the one he always carried  with him, was gone.  </P> <P> The Granielas wanted to find Gary, and to find out the details of Jose's death.  But they were never given Gary's last name.  </P> <P> "This boy disappeared from the face of the Earth, and we get nothing," said  Maria Figalora, Jose's sister, in a recent telephone interview. "Three months  later, they come up with this story."  </P> <P> For more than 20 years, the Graniela family has lived life through a prism of  Jose's death. They agonize over what might have happened to him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Can't Forget'  </P> <P> "They (the U.S. government) want to forget, but we can't forget," Figalora  said.  </P> <P> For hundreds of families across America, whose primary clue to the soldier who  never came home is the name on a list of U.S. unaccounted for in Southeast  Asia, the truth about their fate remains unresolved.  </P> <P> "Unless a case is actually resolved, family members never really get it  completely out of their minds," said George Brooks, chairman of the National  League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. "It's a  relief finally knowing."  </P> <P> Three days after his 21st birthday, Sgt. Joseph A. Matejov of East Meadow,  N.Y., was flying his last reconnaissance flight, working electronic equipment  over the Laos border on Feb. 5, 1973 -- eight days after the Paris peace  accords were signed and the conflict in Southeast Asia ended.  </P> <P> Mary Matejov and her husband, Stephen, a retired Army lieutenant colonel now  deceased, then believed without a doubt the Air Force account that her son  Joseph's plane was hit by enemy gunfire. They had a military memorial ceremony  in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> For nearly six years, the Matejovs mourned the loss of their son, the third of  10 children, until one morning they heard a television show about a Laotian  transmission that indicated that four men in her son's plane were captured and  not killed. The Matejovs were later told by a government official that one of  the four was believed to be her son.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agonizing Search  </P> <P> What followed continues as an agonizing search for the truth. "I know that my  son was captured. My son is definitely a prisoner," said Mary Matejov, who is  an outspoken activist on the POW-MIA issue. "Tell me the truth about my son,  and bring him back, but don't abandon him."  </P> <P> Ever since the war ended, the Vietnamese have periodically offered the United  States remains that they claim are of American servicemen. Military officials  and veterans' groups said that cooperation between the two countries improved  dramatically after former President Ronald Reagan sent Gen. John Vessey to  Vietnam in August, 1987. More than 50 Americans in nine different shipments of  remains have been identified since then, they said.  </P> <P> Families "are getting more optimistic because we are getting an increased  number of remains back," Brooks said. "There is no question there were some men  alive who did not come back in spite of our efforts to get information from the  Vietnamese and Laotian governments."  </P> <P> But Matejov and other advocates argue that it is the U.S. government that has  not done enough to obtain the release of those who they believe are alive and  still being held prisoner.  </P> <P> "People were burying bones that were not their loved ones," said Danny DeMauro,  a Vietnam combat veteran and president of the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit  organization based in Oakdale, N.Y., that seeks to promote awareness on the  POW-MIA cause. "The U.S. is trying to close the book because of political  mistakes" on prisoners of war.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tooth in a Coffin'  </P> <P> "So many families are receiving one tooth in a coffin, and that doesn't prove  that the man is dead," Mary Matejov said. "Some families are getting pieces of  bones that in no way can be identified.  </P> <P> "I want people to be aware that there are live men over there," she said.  </P> <P> But Lt. Cmdr. John Kudla, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the government "has  been unable to prove that any of the 2,357 persons missing from the Vietnam war  are still alive."  </P> <P> The government has received reports of almost 1,200 "sightings" of U.S.  servicemen in Southeast Asia, but all but 140 were mistaken identities, people  later identified as dead or "suspected fabrications," Kudla said. The  government is continuing to pursue the 140 cases but has no proof they actually  are U.S. servicemen.  </P> <P> Still, Mary Matejov and other POW-MIA activists understand that families just  do not want to open old wounds.  </P> <P> "We haven't heard anything. There is always hope that they are going to find  the remains, said Ann Famigliette, niece of MIA William Colwell. Colwell, of  Glen Cove, N.Y., was reported missing on Christmas Eve, 1965. "We always live  in constant hope. There's no anger (toward the U.S. government). It's just a  very hard situation."  </P> <P> Lucy Caliendo, the sister of Paul Andrew Avolese of East Meadow, N.Y., who was  a major in the Air Force, said that she has accepted the idea that her brother  is probably dead.  </P> <P> "It's been 22 years, so we have to take it as it is," she said. Caliendo said  Avolese died when a plane he was flying crashed. "We have wondered, but after  all this time, you give up hope."  </P></p>

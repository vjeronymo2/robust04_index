			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FURON SELLS 3 ASSETS, GAINS $28 MILLION TOWARD DEBT  </P> <P> Furon Co. announced Wednesday that it has completed three separate asset sales  worth a total of $28 million and that it will use the proceeds to reduce  long-term debt.  </P> <P> Furon, a manufacturer of seals and plastic products, said it had sold its  Reeves Rubber Division in Albertsville, Ala., to the British rubber company  BTR.  </P> <P> The Laguna Niguel-based company also has negotiated the sale and lease-back of  nine industrial facilities around the country.  </P> <P> In addition, Furon sold a South Carolina components factory, along with one of  its product lines, to the French firm Carbon. The other three products from  that facility will now be produced at a Furon plant in Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Furon Chairman Peter Churm said the switch would increase employment in Los  Alamitos by 10 to 15 people.  </P> <P> Churm added that the asset sales were part of a "continuing process" aimed at  reducing long-term debt, which stands at $114 million after the three  transactions.  </P> <P> The Reeves Rubber unit had revenues of about $10 million but was being battered  by foreign competition and "didn't have much of a future," Churm said. BTR will  use the facility to manufacture its own rubber molding products.  </P> <P> The plants and land being sold and leased back were acquired by Furon through  various acquisitions, Churm said.  </P> <P> Churm declined to say how much of the $28 million total had come from each  transaction.  </P></p>

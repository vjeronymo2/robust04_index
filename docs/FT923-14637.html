			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Mad cow disease' hits UK cattle sales A TOTAL of 26 countries including the US, Japan, Russia and Austria are now refusing to import British cattle because of concerns over 'mad cow' disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the government has admitted. Responding to a parliamentary written question from Mr David Clark, shadow agriculture minister, Mr John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, also revealed that 19 countries were declining to accept British boneless beef. The agriculture minister said Britain planned to press these countries to accept conditions recently set out by the Office Internationale des Epizooties - a worldwide veterinary organisation - so that 'trade in these products may resume'. He said the OIE general assembly recently gave its unanimous endorsement to advice that trade with the UK in the above products was safe 'subject to certain conditions'. Many of the countries which had instituted import bans were OIE members.</p>

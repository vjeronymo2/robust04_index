			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Political uncertainty leaves the rouble without a prop: Rouble set for further falls - Brussels thinks again on aide / Anxiety over Baltic states - US expresses surprise A dam has burst for the rouble, with its fall from 1,200 to 1,607 against the dollar in less than three weeks. The pressure had been building for months, thanks to the widening differential between the Russian inflation rate, of between 12 and 20 per cent a month in the second half of last year, and the stability of the Russian currency against the dollar. But what broke the wall was the political crisis caused by the refusal of Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the most prominent reformers in the outgoing cabinet, to serve in the next one. According to some reports yesterday, Mr Fyodorov might after all be prepared to serve as finance minister in the new cabinet. Until his position clarifies, the pressure on the rouble and the Russian financial system is likely to continue. The banks are now very jittery about the future for economic reform - it was their movement out of roubles and into more stable currencies on the inter-bank market that triggered the rouble's most recent slide. The government will need to deliver a far more coherent economic policy to regain the confidence of its financial institutions. Nor will the structural need for a realignment in the currency, thanks to high inflation, be easily addressed. Yesterday, Moscow's heavily barred exchange points were surrounded by small crowds, with wads of roubles in their handbags and pockets. Just off Pushkin Square, outside an exchange that had run out of money, a cashier was screaming at the queue, who were screaming at her. In the lobby of the upmarket Slavyanskaya Hotel, where President Bill Clinton stayed last week, the branch of Dialog Bank had also run out of hard currency. By the end of the afternoon, most points in the centres appeared to be closed - with signs advertising the fact that they had run out of dollars, an implicit recognition that no one wanted to buy roubles. Most analysts were not yesterday predicting a complete collapse of the currency. There is still demand for roubles - the more so because cash transactions, from January 1, cannot be in dollars. Wages must be paid, purchases made, and for many, the dollar is still unfamiliar, even if stable. 'This has been coming for some time,' said one analyst. 'Sooner or later the difference between the growing inflation rate and the dollar rate would have had to work through, and the political crisis made it sooner'. This analyst had worked out that, had the rouble devalued parallel with inflation, it would now be trading at around 3,500 to the dollar - though he did not expect it to sink so low. It is possible a full-scale panic could now emerge: the central bank, which intervened yesterday and the day before to limit the fall to around 100 roubles, could allow the rouble to sink, or be unable to stop it though intervention. The crowds changing money are not vast, but they are significant and could grow. Whatever the outcome of the current political crisis, the structural pressure on the rouble is likely to remain for some time. Inflation is now thought to be very high - as high, according to the daily Sevodnya, as it was at the beginning of 1992, when a raft of prices were suddenly liberalised. Even as the triumph of last December, when it was brought down to the level of 12 per cent a month, was being trumpeted, prices zipped up in the week between December 27 and January 3, by at least 7 per cent. Prices are now on course to end the month more than 30 per cent higher than a month earlier. Spending decisions just before, and very soon after, the December 12 elections could exacerbate the situation. Those made before included assistance to the coal industry and to agriculture, as well as increases to pensions and the minimum wage. Those made after include the payment of part of the Rbs6,000-7,000bn in unpaid wages and other government commitments, slashed by Mr Fyodorov in the last quarter of last year and now up for payment. There have also been one-off spending commitments, such as the refurbishment of the shelled White House (set to cost Dollars 70m); to the new parliamentary centre (at around Dollars 500m) and the as yet unknown cost of the coming agreement on economic union between Belarus and Russia. Moscow's bankers, lacking hard currency, are beginning to worry that they may not survive the crisis. Mr Alexei Obozintsev, deputy head of Tokobank, said yesterday: 'Yeltsin is the only hope left, he's the only reformer we have. He must act now.' However, the classic reaction of a central bank to such a crisis - higher interest rates - has not been announced and is not foreshadowed.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RECORD SHOP CLERK ARRESTED IN SALE OF 'EXPLICIT' RAP TAPE  </P> <P> A teen-age record store clerk is facing a felony charge for allegedly selling  the sexually explicit rap recording "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" to an  11-year-old girl, officials said.  </P> <P> Chauncey Reese, a 19-year-old employee at Sarasota's Tracks record store, was  arrested Thursday on a complaint by the girl's stepmother about the recording  by the Miami Group 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> Conviction on the charge of selling harmful materials to minors carries a  maximum prison sentence of five years and a $5,000 fine, said Assistant State  Atty. Donald Hartery Jr.  </P> <P> Hartery said he filed the felony charge, rather than a misdemeanor count of  obscenity, after listening to the tape given to police by the girl's  stepmother, Ann Skolnick.  </P> <P> "The tape is just out-and-out sex," said Skolnick, 35. "They use words like  anal sex and how women want it. A child does not need to be hearing that."  </P> <P> The tape bears a label warning of explicit language in the lyrics, Skolnick  said.  </P> <P> Reese, who is accused of selling the tape to the girl in January, was released  on his own recognizance. Telephone messages left late Thursday at his home were  not immediately answered.  </P></p>

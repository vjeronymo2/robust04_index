			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THERE IS A LAW; IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED  </P> <P> Regarding the article "Golden Boys, Princes of Darkness" (May 14): The raw  emotions this touched in me were beyond belief.  </P> <P> As a resident of Dana Point, a member of the Chamber of Commerce and a  supporter of both schools and youth functions, I was flabbergasted to learn  that behavior such as was discussed in this article is allowed to persist.  </P> <P> Whatever are the adults thinking to allow this kind of behavior to exist?  Certainly no one would advocate that these students be physically accosted for  their show of physical and mental force against "the Establishment"; however,  neither would any thinking adult espouse leaving the situation alone to  escalate.  </P> <P> Something must be done. It reminds one of the "Hitler Youth" so criticized by  the world for their inhumane tactics.  </P> <P> Sheriff, let's get on the ball and do your job with the irresponsible youth as  well as with adults who act outside the law. The time to act is now -- before  someone gets hurt.  </P> <P> CAROL KIESSIG  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

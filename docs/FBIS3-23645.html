			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Kudinov: "They Fly Above the Waves"] </F>   [Text] A considerable amount of diverse information on  surface skimmers has recently appeared in the periodical press.  Many of the articles are associated in this case with the name  of Rostislav Yevgenyevich Alekseyev and the design bureau he  established.    However, some newly formed organizations also claim a role  in  building surface skimmers. There has been much criticism of the  TsKB [Central Design Bureau] for Ground Effect Vehicles imeni  Alekseyev. This is why I made a quick trip to Nizhniy Novgorod.  V. Sokolov, the chief designer for this field and for surface  skimmer planning, explained it to me:    "No matter what is said, the TsKB for Surface Effect  Vehicles  is a huge organization possessing a design, experimental and  production base, and it permits travel along the entire path  from an idea to a plan's realization."    Yes, the TsKB endured difficult times in recent years. The  work volume of military orders, which were the main source of  work, was dramatically reduced, while financing for civilian  construction of surface skimmers has not yet been found.    The TsKB drew up a federal program for development of  civilian surface skimmer building, with the necessary  feasibility study.    The regional association LIKO-Prommarket (general director,  V. Litvinenko) was one of the first among commercial structures  to become a dependable partner in joint efforts to design  passenger surface skimmers based on the Orlenok plan.  Considering the complexity of the problem's solution and the  relatively high cost of the work, the TsKB and LIKO are hoping  to attract other investors both in Russia and abroad.    The hope in Nizhniy Novgorod is that assets will also be  allocated from the state budget, especially so as to ensure the  needed life, reliability and certification of surface skimmers  as a new form of transportation. This is unfortunately  necessary. Why is it that today's commercial structures are not  living badly, and that you could earn more working for them?  Because they enjoy tax concessions, and their overhead is  lower--no laboratories, no test benches. But despite everything  the basic core of qualified designers has survived. Besides the  TsKB, the commercial enterprises Amfikon (amphibious vehicles)  and Transal (the Alekseyev transporter) are involved in the  development of surface skimmers in Nizhniy Novgorod. But as  foreign experience shows, the possibilities of small enterprises  of this kind are extremely limited.    Three types of surface skimmers are distinguished. The first  has a low wing aspect ratio--up to 1. These are known as craft  employing the dynamic principle of support. They have only a  rudder, and they possess (conditionally) two degrees of freedom,  like a car or a small boat. They are driven by boat captains.  Craft employing the dynamic principle of support include, for  example, the Volga-2 passenger boat and the Raketa-2 gas  turbo-vessel.    The second type is represented by surface skimmers with a  wing aspect ratio of up to 3. They have three degrees of  freedom, and they fly within the limits of surface effect. They  are equipped with an elevator. This type of surface skimmers  includes the KM, Strizh, Orlenok and Lun.    The third type is surface effect aircraft. When necessary,  they can fly at high altitude like airplanes. These are still  just plans and models.    Everything that could happen during testing has, including  accidents and disasters. In all cases the commissions concluded  that crew error was the main cause of the incident. During  testing of the Orlenok its tail section disintegrated and broke  off together with the sustainer engine. But the surface skimmer  did not sink, and it was able to return to base on its own power  using its starting engines.    The surface skimmers KM, Volga-2 and Raketa-2 were described  earlier in the No 11, 1991 issue of KRYLYA RODINY. Other designs  are presented below.    The small Strizh surface skimmer is a two-seat craft. It is  intended for pilot training. It is capable of taking off and  landing on a water and a snow surface. It may be used for  patrolling, communications and business flights. V. Bulanov is  the chief designer.    Length--11.4 m. Wingspan--6.6 m. Height--3.6 m. Takeoff  weight--1,630 kg. Maximum speed--200 km/hr, cruising  speed--175/hr. Takeoff run (water/snow)--600/400 m, landing  run--350/300 m. Flying range with a passenger--500 km. Ferrying  range--800 km. Flying altitude above surface--0.3-1.0 m.  Navigability: Takeoff and landing at a wave state of up to 0.5  m, capable of floating at a wave state of up to 1.3 m. Time of a  training flight with one person aboard--3 hr, with two--1-2 hr.  Engines--two rotary piston water-cooled VAZ-4133, 160 horsepower  each. Fuel consumption--0.35 liters/km. The airframe is made  from an aluminum-magnesium alloy. Structures are riveted  together. The propellers are driven by a cardan shaft through a  step-down one-step reduction gear and an automatic clutch. The  propellers are five-bladed, 1.1 m in diameter, with fixed pitch.  The engine nacelles are equipped with fire warning systems and  electrically controlled fire extinguishing systems.    The Strizh is based on shore under an awning (or in a  hangar)  on a special truck that simultaneously serves during flying as  the means of launching and raising the surface skimmer when a  ramp descending to a water depth of not less than 1 meter with a  slope of up to 6 degrees is present at the base. The surface  skimmer is serviced by one mechanic.    The Orlenok seagoing surface skimmer was designed as an  assault landing transporter for the navy, and it has been in  operation since 1979 (chief designer, V. Sokolov). Basic data:  Length--58 m. Wingspan--31.5 m. Height--16 m. Normal takeoff  weight--125 tonnes. Overloaded takeoff weight (there is a limit  on wave height during takeoff)--140 tonnes. Payload weight--up  to 20 tonnes. Maximum fuel weight--28 tonnes. Cruising  speed--350 km/hr. Range--1,100 km. Navigability: Takeoff and  landing--up to 4 points, floating and flying--4-5 points.  Amphibious capability: Emergence onto a relatively even shore  with a slope of up to 5 degrees. Basing: Parked on special  pontoon platforms or engineered shore platforms. Crew--nine  persons.    The Orlenok surface skimmer is a cantilever monoplane  consisting of a streamlined fuselage with the hydrodynamic  elements locating in its lower part, low wings with a low aspect  ratio, and an elaborate tail. The fuselage has a relatively  simple beam-and-stringer structure, and it is divided in its  layout into three sections--nose, middle and tail.    The nose section contains the crew cabin, starting engines  and compartments housing the electronic equipment, including a  radar station located in the nose tip and covered with a  radiotransparent faring. Depending on the purpose of the surface  skimmer the middle section of the fuselage may be designed as a  passenger cabin or cargo bay, or it can be filled with special  equipment. The tail section contains a compartment housing  auxiliary engines and onboard machinery for starting the main  engines and maintaining the performance of the surface skimmer's  hydraulic and electric systems.    Fuel tank compartments are in the left and right wing  panels.  As with the fuselage, the wing as a whole is a sealed watertight  structure imparting buoyancy to the surface skimmer. The  necessary stability and unsinkability are achieved in this case  by dividing the lower part of the fuselage and wings into  watertight compartments.    The main propulsion unit consists of one sustainer turboprop  NK-12MK engine and two starting turbofan NK-8-4K engines  designed by N. D. Kuznetsov. The NK-12MK provides for economical  cruising, and it is positioned on the surface skimmer's tail, at  the intersection of the fin and stabilizer. This relatively high  position of the engine is the result of the need for keeping it  away from sea spray when the surface skimmer starts, lands and  takes its landing run. It also reduces the possibility of salt  contamination of the engine in flight by aerosols in the sea  atmosphere, the saturation of which is known to depend on height  above the surface.    The starting engines work only when the surface skimmer  takes  off, and they are outfitted with swiveling gas exhaust nozzles  for changing the direction of the engine exhaust stream: During  the takeoff run--beneath the wing to create an air cushion (blow  mode), and during transition to cruising mode--horizontal  thrust, accelerating the surface skimmer to cruising speed. As  with the engines themselves, the air intakes of the starting  engines are designed flush with the outline of the surface  skimmer's nose section to reduce drag.    Blowing of the gas streams beneath the wings during the  takeoff run helps to reduce hydrodynamic resistance and external  hydrodynamic loads, which is especially important when the craft  takes off over a rough sea. Blowing is also employed for these  purposes when landing the surface skimmer in landing run modes.    The main systems of the surface skimmer--control, hydraulic,  electric power supply, life support, radio engineering and  navigation support--are designed as aircraft systems. Redundancy  and backup of systems and equipment are foreseen, which is  necessary for safe operation of the aircraft.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-56A>           Layout of the 150 Passenger Orlenok </FIG>       Initial plans for seagoing surface skimmers intended for  different purposes have been drawn up on the basis of the  Orlenok at the TsKB for Surface Effect Vehicles. The seagoing  passenger surface skimmer is intended for high-speed passenger  conveyance over inland and marginal seas at a speed of 400 km/hr  at a distance of not more than 2,000 from a port. The Lyuks  variant carries 65-75 passengers; the single-deck variant  carries 100-150; the double-deck variant carries up to 300  persons. There is a crew of five.    The seagoing cargo surface skimmer is intended to convey  express cargo. The weight of the cargo is 30 tonnes, and the  dimensions of the cargo bay are 21x3.2x3.0 m.    The seagoing arctic geological exploratory surface skimmer  is  used for geological and geophysical operations in shallow shelf  waters of the Arctic Seas, and for their transportation support.    The search-and-rescue surface skimmer is intended for  search-and-rescue support to the seagoing fleet, for delivery of  emergency rescue teams to places of accidents and natural  disasters in the vicinity of offshore drilling rigs, to  platforms, and to population centers on the coast, on the shelf  and in island zones, and to provide assistance to and evacuate  casualties and the public from these places.    The air-sea search-and-rescue system consists of the Mriya  airplane and the Orlenok surface skimmer. It is intended for  effective search and rescue of people from sunken or distressed  vessels through the combination of high speed and long range.  System takeoff weight--600 tonnes. System speed--800 km/hr.  Carrier range--6,000 km. Surface skimmer speed--400 km/hr.  Surface skimmer range--2,500 km. Navigability--4-5 points.  Number of victims taken aboard the surface skimmer--up to 150  persons.    There are great possibilities for an experimental  search-and-rescue surface skimmer currently under construction,  code-named the Spasitel (chief designer, V. Kryllovykh). Its  detail design was completed in 1991. Construction of the surface  skimmer proceeded simultaneously with this at an experimental  plant. It is 70 percent assembled. It should have a speed of 450  km/hr. Takeoff weight--400 tonnes. Capacity--up to 500 rescued  persons. A hospital fitted out with surgical and resuscitation  rooms and a casualty ward is foreseen. Had we possessed this  surface skimmer sooner, we may have avoided the tragedy that  befell the submarine "Komsomolets," in which 42 persons died.  Unfortunately, conclusion of the construction of this unique  rescue resource is in jeopardy. The main reason is a lack of  financing by the client, a role played by the navy's  search-and-rescue service. It would be a pity if this enormous  amount of labor is wasted, and the unfinished surface skimmer is  scrapped. But this is fully possible in our unpredictable times.

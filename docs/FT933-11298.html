			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Clarke counts his meagre blessings: The options for the chancellor as he meets officials at Dorneywood today to ponder his Budget strategy ON THE FACE of it the economic situation is much clearer today than it was in January, when Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, brought Treasury ministers and officials together to discuss preliminary plans for the March Budget. Then the one certainty was that public-sector finances needed to be brought under control. Economic recovery had yet to make itself known. Eight months on Mr Lamont's successor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has the blessing of several months of promising economic data showing the economy growing faster than Treasury predictions of 1.25 per cent for this year. But he and his officials, meeting today at Dorneywood, his official country residence in Buckinghamshire, may find it no less difficult to decide on an appropriate course of action for the November 30 Budget. Not only does Mr Clarke have to consider the impact of his decisions on his party's volatile backbenchers, but doubts about the apparent strength of the recovery have emerged again. Although figures for retail sales, manufacturing output and unemployment suggest a steady, and moderately strong, recovery, there is a degree of scepticism about the story being told by the figures. Wariness among economists about the recovery was reinforced this week by a Confederation of British Industry survey of manufacturers which showed exports to Europe tailing off. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'There is a sense in which the general mood is not as buoyant as official data would have you believe. I don't think it is right to conclude that the economy is recovering strongly. The pace of recovery is slowing and that looks likely to continue for the rest of the year.' By November Mr Clarke will have a better idea of whether fears about the recovery are well-founded. In the meantime many City economists are urging him and his officials to favour a policy mix of tax increases and public spending cuts to bring down the public sector borrowing requirement, with interest rate cuts to ensure that exports are not jeopardised by a strong pound. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'I can't think of a better time to get the PSBR down on an underlying basis and cut rates to help exports. This would meet economic and political objectives, with the rate cuts sweetening the political pill of tax increases.' The problem with this scenario is that with such a small government majority Mr Clarke cannot afford to upset Tory backbenchers with politically sensitive tax increases. If he does raise taxes, he is more likely to tinker with allowances than touch basic rates of income tax. Extending value added tax is also a politically dangerous option, after the outcry by Tory backbenchers that followed what they saw as Mr Lamont's unfair decision to levy VAT on domestic fuel. There is also a risk that tax increases will stifle the recovery. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University said: 'It cannot be right to put up taxes when there is a faltering recovery from the recession.' The scenario of raising taxes while cutting interest rates may not be favoured by Mr Clarke for another reason. Although the Treasury does not have a target for the exchange rate, the prevailing view of the Treasury and the Bank of England is that it should not be allowed to sink too far for fear of importing inflation. Mr Bootle said: 'The dominant philosophy of the Treasury is that the exchange rate should be used as an anti-inflation weapon, This is wrong because it constantly weakens our export industries which then leads to current account problems.' Mr Clarke still has plenty of time to decide on the Budget. It may be that the recovery fears are unfounded, leaving him with greater scope for tackling the public-sector finances. Mr Spencer believes that far from faltering, the recovery is becoming more robust. 'The exceptionally long recession means that the pent-up demand for consumer goods is also exceptionally high.' This meant, he said, that certain processes are under way which make the recovery self-sustaining - rising retail sales, higher incomes and falling unemployment. The problem for Mr Clarke is assessing the state of the economy today, and how far it will have progressed by November.</p>

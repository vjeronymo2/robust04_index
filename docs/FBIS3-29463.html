			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bangkok Feb 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel, on a state visit to Thailand since Friday [11 February],  met today with Thai Premier Chuan Likphai.    At the meeting, the Czech delegation pointed to the  stabilising role Thailand plays in South East Asia and praised  the country's economic results.    The Thai and Czech representatives agreed that the Czech  Republic can be an entrance gate to Europe for Thailand, while  Thailand serves as an entrance gate to Indochina for the Czech  Republic. That is why nothing bars mutual relations from  developing, the politicians said.    Likphai stressed that Thailand was willing to deepen its  cooperation with the Czech Republic, adding that his country of  almost 60 million inhabitants presented a big market where it  was possible to push oneself through.    Trilateral cooperation, including that between the Czech  Republic, Thailand and Vietnam was also discussed. Abolition of  the U.S. embargo on the trade with Vietnam led to opening of the  Vietnamese market, Thai representatives said.    The meeting also focused on the Central European Free Trade  Zone (CEFTA) and a similar South East Zone (AFTA). Thai  politicians see this process as a long-term one and expect it to  take some 15 years.    The Czech delegation drew attention to the considerable  possibilities of investing in the Czech Republic within the  privatisation process. They also showed their interest in Thai  financial participation in the Czech banking sector.    Czech Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, one  of the Czech delegation's members, invited Likphai to Prague on  behalf of Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus.    Havel also met with chairman of the Thai parliament, Marut  Bunnak. They agreed on a visit of Czech parliamentarians to  Thailand in late March.    Today Havel is to tour some of Bangkok's monuments. Four  inter-state agreements are also to be signed.    Havel today received an honorary degree from Chulalongkorn  University and gave a speech of thanks. On leaving the  university, which is named after a turn-of-the-century king who  abolished slavery, Havel said with a smile he saw an "enormous  gulf" between the quantity of doctorates he received and the  quantity of knowledge he had.    The way of coexistence of various cultures and powers which  would not threaten the fate of the globe, is a big task for the  present world, Havel said in a speech given at the occasion of  being awarded the title.    It is necessary in the present era that a multicultural  world  and a multipolar atmosphere in conditions of a single global  civilisation are created, Havel said.    A generally acceptable minimum must be sought within the  variety of national features, historical and cultural traditions  and different ways of thinking. This minimum must be cultivated  with full respect for all differences and equality of their  bearers. Simply, the era of new global universalism has come,  Havel said.    The several principles included in the mentioned minimum are  those of respect for the basic human rights -- those to freedom  and dignity, democracy, a respect for property, including  private property, care for material development of human  communities and generally acceptable social rights. Without  this minimum being sensibly and steadily cultivated, developed  and deepened, and without the world's identifying itself with  it, he could hardly imagine that the present civilisation does  not result in big catastrophes, Havel stressed.    A new political metaculture could gradually arise from the  new spirit of world cooperation. It would be the culture of  political existence on principles of equality and cooperation  of various cultures of the present multicultural civilisation,  he said.    Havel said that several basic tools, whose development,  strengthening and transformation in line with the emerging  political metaculture should be carried out in the decades to  come, already exist. These are universal systems, such as the  UN and other global institutions, including economic ones.  These institutions' importance will rise with the increase in  the new spirit of the multicultural world, Havel stated.    Besides these institutions, integration groupings are  important as well, Havel said. As an example of such groupings  he gave the European Union, Association of the South East Asian  Nations (ASEAN), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) and NATO. He said he viewed these  institutions as significant elements in the newly emerging  system of world cooperation, the sense of which surpasses the  pragmatic framework of the advantages of regional cooperation  and defence. They are co-creators of the world's political  metaculture at the same time, as they adhere to many principles  included in the minimum mentioned above. They cultivate and  push them through within their reach, and thus make mutual  political communication within the international community  easier, Havel emphasised.</p>

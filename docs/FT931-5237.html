			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Books: Gallic allure disembodied - Anthony Curtis finds Chevalier a bit of a cold fish THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS: THE TRUE STORY OF MAURICE CHEVALIER'S LIFE AND TIMES by Edward Behr Hutchinson Pounds 18.99, 368 pages LUCKILY we all remember Gigi otherwise Edward Behr's titles might suggest that Maurice the Marvel was some kind of secret paedophile. It emerges that he did prefer waiflike types of women to the more Rubensian ones, but they had at least to have reached the age of consent. Among his innumerable conquests were Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker and Kay Francis. But his true love was, even after marriage, his old Mum. She was 36 when she had him. Her no-good husband, Maurice's father, was a Parisian housepainter who usually arrived home at night completely plastered (both senses). Josephine Chevalier, with her pinched, pointy face, was of Flemish origin known by Maurice and his brothers as La Louque, the name he afterwards gave in her memory his magnificent estate in the South of France at La Bocca, near Cannes. As a seamstress she was the family's breadwinner as well as being a constant child-bearer (Maurice was ninth in the order). Jeanette MacDonald, with whom he made movies for Paramount in his pre-war Hollywood period - The Love Parade (1929) and Love Me Tonight (1932) - and who absolutely loathed him (this revulsion being entirely mutual) said that Mama was always Maurice's sole topic of conversation. Behr's subtitle with its emphasis on the 'true' story implies that all the previous ones have been untrue. Certainly the star's own nine volumes of memoirs need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, but which theatrical monster's memoirs do not? This new life, by a practised hand at contemporary biography, is well-researched and especially strong on the political background, enlightening about the performing arts in Paris during the murky period of the Occupation. But the main story seemed familiar, after an excellent Radio 2 biography, This Was Maurice Chevalier with recorded extracts from several friends quoted by Behr, first broadcast in 1988 compiled by Charles Castle. The working-class French lad's emergence as a dancer from the down and out suburb of Menilmontant via the world of the Paris cafe-concerts and music halls onto the stage of the Folies-Bergere is well documented. His earliest partner was a crazy woman called Frehel. Luckily, young Maurice did not succumb to her addiction to cocaine. Then he partnered the great Mistinguett when he was 23 and she 36 and with whom he at once started a prolonged affair. He had found his metier and whatever later triumphs he enjoyed on the world stage, Maurice remained au fond a French vaudevillian. He could never sing especially well, but he radiated magic, through his panache, his patter, his good looks, his mock-hesitant yet perfect articulation, equally well-timed in both English and French. He excelled at manipulation of the audience for whom he became an irresistible embodiment of sexy, gallic, garlic-breathing allure. The debonair look with straw 'boater' was adopted in the 1930s. Behr says Maurice borrowed the idea of the hat as an essential prop from Harry Richman, an American comedian whom he 'had almost certainly seen' in London. Could not both of them have got it from the Claude Hulbert upper-class, blazered, silly ass of the PG Wodehouse musicals and the Aldwych farces? After Maurice appeared jauntily sporting this headgear, sales of English straw hats soared across the Channel; like Dame Edna and her gladioli, Maurice would distribute them to his admirers after the show. Apart from such public relations munificence, paid for no doubt by the management, Maurice was in private life congenitally mean, never picking up any tab in a restaurant if he could help it, hoarding his huge earnings. These remained vast for much of his life. He hit a bad patch in 1935, when he broke with MGM and was forced to return to France to re-awaken his dormant native admirers. Then came the Second World War. Maurice had been wounded in the first and had been awarded the Croix de Guerre. As a result of that he now became an ardent Petainiste. But did Maurice turn his immaculately cut coat and perform at the behest of the Nazi masters in front of German audiences? Did he in fact collaborate? After the Liberation his reputation suffered grievously for several years from the stigma that he had. Behr goes into the whole matter carefully. Maurice does not emerge completly spotless from the detailed investigation. He performed in Germany in a French POW camp near Magdeburg which sparked the slander; but he seems to have been hardly more culpable under the Occupation than Jean Cocteau, Colette and a number of stars of that generation whom we now hold in affectionate memory. Maurice's constant companion during the war - Nita Raya  -was Jewish; he certainly helped her and her parents to survive it unscathed. After his eventual exoneration and return to Hollywood, the story has a fairy-tale quality. Maurice is not just rehabilitated, he is glowingly rejuvenated. 'I'm glad I'm not young any more' he sings with utter conviction, not believing a word of it. His success was largely thanks to the renaissance of the American musical, the lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner and the direction of Vincente Minnelli. Leslie Caron, who played opposite him as the ingenue in Gigi (1958), thought Maurice was a cold fish; but everyone else was charmed by the 70-year-old matinee idol. He was right back on top again. But it could not last for ever, and by the end of the 1960s he was in a Lear-like decline, fantasising about being elected to the Academie Francaise, cutting his faithful female friend Janie Michels and her children out of his will, manipulated by others close to him, a prey to suicidal depressions with at least one actual attempt. By now he really had been forced to retire; no one wanted to employ him, even on television. He died aged 83 on New Year's Day 1972, a sad, lonely, cheated old trouper. The book is highly informative, but it has been carelessly edited. The irritating trick of linking two sentences by a colon, eg 'In America, things were perhaps even tougher: In many vaudeville theaters, entertainment was continuous . . .' proliferates; that cannot, surely, be Behr's normal way of punctuating. If for economic reasons we have to suffer American spelling, surely we do not have to have such illiteracy foisted on us as well? The story about Maurice performing at the Waldorf Astoria during a musicians' strike is repeated word for word on pages 317 and 318. It seems incredible this error should have got right through to the finished book. Walter Hutchinson and Robert Lusty must be turning in their graves.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Holy Mecca, 10 May (SPA) -- The General  Secretariat of the Islamic World League [IWL] in Mecca has urged  the leaders of the Yemeni Republic to exercise self-restraint  and wisdom and end armed fighting in that dear country, as no  one will benefit from such a conflict except the enemies of the  Islamic nation.    The league's official spokesman added that the IWL's General  Secretariat would like to express its greatest regret at seeing  the dispute turning into armed conflict between brothers in  Yemen. He added that the IWL, which represents all Muslim  peoples, is urging all political leaders and forces in Yemen to  end the fighting, resolve their dispute, put an end to the  bloody events, and spare Muslim lives.

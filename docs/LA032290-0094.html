			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHERIMOYA: THE 'ARISTOCRAT OF FRUIT';  </P> <P> EXOTIC: BECAUSE IT MUST BE HAND-POLLINATED AND CANNOT BE PRODUCED EASILY, IT IS  VERY EXPENSIVE.  </P> <P> The cherimoya, a subtropical fruit originally from the highlands of Ecuador and  Peru, has been grown in Southern California for more than a century but has  been only recently available to consumers.  </P> <P> The mature crop appears from December through May in gourmet food markets and  variety grocery stores. Because the cherimoya produces little fruit naturally  and the flowers must be hand-pollinated, the fruit is especially expensive,  even in season ($7 per pound). Those lucky enough to have a back yard tree have  their pick of the "aristocrat of fruit," as it is called by aficionados.  </P> <P> Mark Twain hailed the cherimoya as "deliciousness itself," and Baron Alexander  von Humbolt, a German scientist and explorer, was said to have thought the  cherimoya worth a trip across the Atlantic.  </P> <P> The fruit, with its green warty skin, as exotic as something out of science  fiction, can deceive those who are not acquainted with its creamy, custard-like  white flesh and tantalizing, juicy-sweet flavor, hinting of flavors of  pineapple, papaya and pear.  </P> <P> Cherimoyas have about 94 calories per one-third-pound serving and are high in  niacin, phosphorus and thiamine.  </P> <P> You can leave cherimoyas on the counter to form a brownish green skin or until  they yield to gentle pressure, both indicate ripeness. Once ripe, however, the  fruit should be refrigerated and eaten within the week.  </P> <P> And just how does one eat it?  </P> <P> Cut the fruit in half and spoon out the flesh as you would papaya or avocado,  making sure to remove the seeds embedded into the crevices.  </P> <P> Cherimoyas also can be sliced or cubed and added raw to fruit bowls, salads or  sauces. Some hosts serve cherimoya sliced and splashed with orange juice and  sprinkled with coconut.  </P> <P> The fruit can be made into a drink by mixing the flesh in a blender with some  water or fruit juice and may be sweetened with honey or sugar. The pulp may  also be teamed with banana, pineapple or other tropical fruit flavors for an  interesting shake.  </P> <P> CHERIMOYA FRUIT SALAD DRESSING  </P> <P> 1/4 cup plain yogurt  </P> <P> 1/4 cup mayonnaise  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cherimoya puree  </P> <P> 1/2 to 1 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon lemon juice  </P> <P> Blend together yogurt, mayonnaise, cherimoya puree, sugar and lemon juice.  Makes about 2/3 cup.  </P> <P> Note: Use as dressing for fruit salad.  </P> <P> CHERIMOYA SAUCE FOR MEAT OR FISH  </P> <P> 2 shallots, minced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dry white wine  </P> <P> 1/2 cup fish, beef or chicken stock  </P> <P> 1 cherimoya, pulp removed and pureed (about 1 1/3 cups)  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Saute shallots in butter. Add wine and cook until reduced to glaze. Add stock  and cook until slightly reduced. Stir in cherimoya puree and season to taste  with salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Heat over low heat until slightly reduced and thickened. Press through sieve.  Makes 2 cups.  </P> <P> Note: Serve over fish, beef, pork or poultry or game.  </P> <P> TROPICAL CHERIMOYA TRIFLE  </P> <P> 2 (3-ounce) packages ladyfingers  </P> <P> Orange flavored liqueur  </P> <P> 3 cherimoyas, pulp removed and pureed (about 4 cups)  </P> <P> 1/2 cup raspberry or currant jam  </P> <P> 1 large banana, thinly sliced  </P> <P> Whipped cream  </P> <P> Split ladyfingers. Layer 1/2 of ladyfinger halves in bottom and upsides of  2-quart serving bowl. Sprinkle lightly with liqueur.  </P> <P> Spread 1/3 of cherimoya pulp over bottom layer. Swirl 1/3 raspberry jam into  cherimoya pulp. Top with 1/3 of sliced bananas. Layer 1/2 of remaining  ladyfingers. Sprinkle lightly with liqueur. Top with 1/3 cherimoya sauce,  raspberry jam and bananas.  </P> <P> Cover with remaining ladyfingers. Top with remaining cherimoya sauce, raspberry  and bananas. Garnish with whipped cream.  </P> <P> Refrigerate and serve within 1 day. (Prolonged standing will cause fruit to  weep.) Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Garnish with raspberries and banana slices, if desired.  </P> <P> CHERIMOYA FRUIT BREAD  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1/2 cup granulated sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/3 cup shortening  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons milk  </P> <P> 1 cup cherimoya puree  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or almonds  </P> <P> Combine flour, baking powder, soda, sugars and salt in bowl.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   Moscow June 15 TASS -- Russian newspapers report President  Boris Yeltsin's arrival in the far eastern city of  Blagoveshchensk, the results of the founding congress of  Russia's Democratic Choice party, which was created on the basis  of Russia's Choice movement headed by Yegor Gaydar, and comment  on presidential decrees.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on Russia's Democratic Choice party  congress:    "The choice has been made in favour of a party. This means  that illusions about a broad democratic orientation in  post-Soviet society in Russia are finally receding into the  past".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject.    "The congress went off well but nevertheless Russia's  Democratic Choice party did not manage to resolve all  differencies in its ranks. It can be supposed that main  struggle inside the party still lies ahead, since Russia's  Democratic Choice party is an organisation with a strong  Moscow-based centre and weak regions. However, the centre itself  is not monolithic either".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article headlined "Russia's  Foreign Policy" by First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy  Adamishin. The writer of the article expesses his ideas in  connection with the newspaper's earlier published article  "Strategy for Russia" ("theses of the council on foreign and  defence policies".    Adamishin believes, in particular, that "when advocating  rapprochement with the west, which of cardinal importance for  Russia, one should do so not by belittling what divides us, for  we run the risk of deceiving ourselves, but must have a  realistic understanding of the fact that the change of course  from confrontation to cooperation, which in itself is  exceptionaly salutary for Russia, does not guarantee  positive-to-Russia solutions to problems that are inevitably  encountered in the pursuance of this course in practice."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Russian Defence Minister Pavel  Grachev's tour of Yerevan, Tbilisi and Baku:    "Notwithstanding the lack of specific accords in Baku, the  tour can be regarded as succesful. The present round of  military diplomacy strengthens Russia's positions in the  Transcaucasus".    PRAVDA carries an article about Yuriy Andropov, former KGB  chief and subsequently the general secretary of the Soviet  Communist Party Central Committee, on the strength of  reminiscences by people from his entourage, who worked side by  side with him for many years.    TRUD comments on presidential decrees signed last Friday:    "As we see it, the new decrees are quite topical and are  designed to expedite the reform process. It is important that  they begin to work, not remain on paper. Much in this respect  will depend on the government's ability and purposefulness..."    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA analyses the presidenttial decree on  allocations to Russia's social insurance fund:    "Presidential decree no.1,004 is certain to get on a list of  inane deeds of Russian reformers. At the hardest time, the  state leaves the work collectives at the mercy of fate,  depriving them of last support".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on North Korea's decision to withdraw  from the International Atomic Energy Agency:    "The seriousness of the situation that has arisen in view of  the statement is also compounded by the fact that North Korea  continues to equate possible U.N. sanctions agains itself with  a declaration of war. It follows from the North Korean Foreign  Minustry statement that an expansion of sanctions, would entail  a wider scope of Pyongyang's 'protective measures'".</p>

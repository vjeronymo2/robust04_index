			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NHL NOTES;  </P> <P> AN EXPANDED VIEW MUST INCLUDE REFEREES  </P> <P> When the National Hockey League expands in the next two years or so, the  players that stock the new teams will come from the systems of existing  organizations. But where will new officials be found?  </P> <P> "The moment hockey expands, we will be ready," said Bryan Lewis, the NHL  director of officiating. "For each two new teams we need one referee and two  linesmen. This has to be an ongoing process or we would really get caught."  </P> <P> The league lost veteran referees Bob Myers and Bob Hall to retirement this  season and were short another, Don Koharski, who was assigned minor-league duty  for missing curfew during the playoffs last season. That is why unfamiliar  names such as Paul Devorski, Dave Jackson and Ron Martell may show up in  black-and-white stripes some nights. They are products of the NHL's search.  </P> <P> Unlike hockey teams, which rely on an organized system of scouting pulled  together by the comprehensive Central Scouting Bureau, the system of scouting  officials is less defined. Lewis believes it is just as thorough.  </P> <P> "There isn't a day goes by that we don't hear from some coach at some level of  hockey telling us about someone who works a pretty good game," Lewis said. "Our  supervisory staff acts as scouts. We have in our file about 300 names and we  check them all out. There will be times when I'm assigned to watch an NHL game  in Pittsburgh, and then I'll go to Johnstown, Pa., and be in Montreal to watch  a midget game the next night."  </P> <P> Officiating hopefuls often hold down full- or part-time jobs or are students,  so the NHL often helps with travel expenses so they may gain experience. "We  want to advance careers as quickly as possible," Lewis said. "With expansion,  the job opportunities will be fantastic. There are never enough good, talented  officials, but we do the best we can."  </P> <P> Petty larceny or grand theft?  </P> <P> Depending on the outcome of the Devils' trade of defenseman Tom Kurvers to the  Maple Leafs for their first-round draft pick in 1991, General Manager Lou  Lamoriello is guilty as charged with robbing the Maple Leafs.  </P> <P> The price of a first-round pick is prize enough, but the top prospect of 1991  is a 16-year-old center out of Toronto, Eric Lindros, who is 6-4 and 210  pounds. Lindros had scouts raving last year that he would be the next big  impact player in the NHL. Lindros is playing for the Windsor Spitfires of the  Ontario Hockey League.  </P> <P> Kurvers, who reported to the Maple Leafs in Pittsburgh to speak with coach Doug  Carpenter, left the team Tuesday and is said to be contemplating retirement.  Lamoriello said the deal became complete under NHL bylaws because Kurvers  reported.  </P> <P> If the deal holds and if the Maple Leafs continue to flounder in the cellar,  the Devils could have landed themselves a franchise player for a talented,  although spare part.  </P> <P> The Devils actually ended up trading center Mel Bridgman for the No. 1 pick. On  March 9, 1987, the Devils traded Bridgman to Detroit for a third-round pick. On  June 13, 1987, the Devils traded the Detroit pick to Buffalo for Kurvers, and  this week wheeled him to Toronto for the No. 1. Bridgman for Lindros? A steal.  </P> <P>  PRICED TO  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Old wounds still trouble Nicaragua: Land disputes have plagued the government since it took powerin 1990 AMID the lush coffee plantations of Matagalpa, central Nicaragua, about 200 peasants at the Santa Maria farm are prepared to fight rather than hand over the land to the pre-revolutionary owner. 'I fought for this country and now they want to take what little I have,' says Mr Renaldo Garcia, a worker who has lived at Santa Maria for eight years. He and his colleagues farm a few acres of corn on the state-owned plantation, on which they depend for their daily food ration. They will not let the old owner back to the plantation unless they are promised access to these plots. Similar disputes have plagued Nicaragua since Mrs Violeta Chamorro and her multi-party UNO alliance defeated the Sandinista government in February 1990 elections. The right wing is livid that more land has not been given back; the leftist peasant unions are angry that their members have been turfed off theirs; and many former Sandinista army troops and their one-time Contra rebel opponents have taken up arms again after government promises of land were not kept. Land disputes have spilled over into a fierce debate about the continued Sandinista influence in the government, a row that could topple the government. Last week, in an apparent attempt to get the US Congress to lift its hold on more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 52m) of aid, the government agreed to fire Mr Rene Vivas, the Sandinista chief of police. His removal was a principal demand of the conservative and liberal opposition in Nicaragua and of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who heads right-wing congressional efforts to put US aid on hold. They claim the police and army have favoured Sandinistas in land disputes, and aided takeovers of farms by former Sandinista soldiers. Mrs Chamorro has let the Sandinistas run the army and police - and repeatedly vetoed proposals from within the UNO alliance to reverse some of the land nationalisations carried out by them - to gain Sandinista support for her orthodox economic stabilisation programme. In the past two years the government has slashed spending, privatised industries and let in imports, turning what was once a state-run economy into one of the more liberal on the continent. Mr Francisco Mayorga, the former central bank governor, describes the result as the 'most remarkable stabilisation in all Latin America'. Inflation, exceeding 7,000 per cent in 1990, was less than 2 per cent in the first half of this year. The exchange rate of 5 cordobas to a dollar has been stable for more than a year, and the government budget is in surplus. The Sandinistas are still the most potent political party in Nicaragua. They run most of the unions and can call a general strike when they wish. Mr Antonio Lacayo, the president's son-in-law and minister of the presidency, argues: 'If the government had opted for the traditional policy of confrontation that is normal in our political culture there would have been no democratic opening, nor economic stabilisation. The social costs caused by the budget tightening could not have been undertaken without a climate of tolerance and understanding.' But the strategy is now in danger of falling apart. Last week the three leading members of UNO - Vice-President Virgilio Godoy, Mr Alfredo Cesar, president of the National Assembly, and Mr Arnoldo Aleman, mayor of Managua - called an unprecedented joint press conference to demand that the heads of the army and police stand down, and that the government return more nationalised land to its previous owners. The private sector has been equally critical of the rapprochement with the Sandinistas, blaming it for low private and foreign investment. The Chamorro government also risks being squeezed from the left. The sacking of Mr Vivas brought an angry response from Sandinistas, who blamed the change on pressures from the US. The Sandinista grassroots organisation is increasingly opposed to the government's austere economic policy. Nearly half of adult Nicaraguans are out of work, and average income is about Dollars 430 per person. Despite foreign aid equal to more than half Nicaragua's GDP this year, low coffee and cotton prices will slow economic growth from a projected 4-5 per cent to just 1.5 per cent, says Mr Lacayo. It will be the ninth successive year that per capita GNP will have fallen. Students and many workers are on strike, protesting against budget cuts or low wages. Peasants are flooding into Nicaragua, with the city estimated to grow by 8-9 per cent this year. A doctor used to visit the Santa Maria farm every eight days, says Mr Garcia  -but there has not been a visit for more than a year. About half the 80 children do not go to school and few receive the once-mandatory inoculations. Most if not all of these problems are a result of a decade of war, blockade and economic mismanagement. Nicaragua is at least now entering the world economy and, argues Mr Lacayo, the conditions for economic growth have been laid. But unless the politicians bury their differences, the economy may never have the chance to take off.</p>

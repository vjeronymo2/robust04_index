The refund report supersedes the previous filing made on February 22, 1994. Such report was submitted in compliance with Section VI(C) of the Joint Stipulation and Agreement filed September 30, 1991 and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission'') by order issued October 22, 1991. The revised refund report corrects an allocation, error found in the February 22, 1994, filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koch Gateway states that the total dollar amount was correct, however, individual shippers were allocated erroneous amounts. The previous filing inadvertently had included discounted MDQ's for a variety of shippers. The revised refund report shows the correct allocation and the net effect on all customers. Additionally, in accordance with &sect;154.67(c)(2)(iii) of the Commission's Regulations, interest is included on the refund amounts as reflected on revised Appendix A to the filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with &sect;385.211 of the Commission's Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before April 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

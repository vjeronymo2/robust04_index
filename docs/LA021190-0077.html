			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X AS TOLD TO ALEX HALEY  (BALLANTINE: $5.95)  </P> <P> Twenty-five years after his assassination, Malcolm X remains a compelling,  charismatic figure whose life has become the subject of renewed interest. Works  by many young black artists feature references to him, including Spike Lee's  hit film, "Do The Right Thing," and "Self-Destruction," a rap song by the group  Stop the Violence; while the wire-framed glasses like the pair he wore are  often referred to as "Malcolms."  </P> <P> His searing autobiography forms a journey that unconsciously mirrors "Pilgrim's  Progress": from his childhood in the rural South, through his life as a  drug-pushing hustler in Harlem, his term in prison and his role as spokesman  for Elijah Muhammad's racist doctrines, to his spiritual growth through Islam  that broadened his vision and enabled him to embrace all of humanity. Had  Malcolm X lived longer, he undoubtedly would have helped to lead America toward  genuine racial equality during the last quarter-century. Unlike many '60s  icons, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," with its double message of anger and  love, remains an inspiring document.  </P></p>

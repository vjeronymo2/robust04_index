			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Australia raises rates to counter threat of inflation The Reserve Bank of Australia yesterday raised its official money market interest rates by 1 percentage point to 6.5 per cent. It was the second rise in less than two months even though the annual inflation rate is only 1.7 per cent. The move adds Australia to the list of countries, including the UK and the US, which have tried to tighten policy early in an effort to ward off rises in inflation. Financial markets had been expecting a move, but were surprised at the size of the increase. The equity market responded with a rise of 2.8 points in the Sydney All Ordinaries Index to 2,037, while the yield on 10-year government bonds eased 13 basis points to 10 per cent. The Australian dollar gained half a US cent in European trading to 73.66 cents. but it failed to break the 74 cent barrier. London dealers said there was concern that inflation data for the quarter to the end of September, due to be published tomorrow, might show price rises accelerating. 'The decision was taken to keep inflation low in the context of continuing evidence of strong economic growth and because buoyant conditions are likely to continue through the current year and 1995-96,' said Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer. The move has echoes of the UK's decision to raise base rates by a half point in September, and its size contrasts with the quarter-point moves adopted by the US Federal Reserve when it started raising rates in February this year. Australia's economy is growing at over 4 per cent. Mr Willis said government forecasts of a growth rate of 4.25 per cent in gross domestic product in the year to June 1995 now looked 'a little bit pessimistic'. There would be 'real problems in terms of maintaining low inflation' if the growth rate moved over 5 per cent, he added. The increase was announced yesterday morning by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, who said it was a response to a faster-than-expected increase in both retail spending and investment. Interest rates were last raised by three-quarters of a point on August 17, the first increase for five years.

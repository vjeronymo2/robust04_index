			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--To meet the  needs of enterprise reform, especially those of reorganizing  state large and medium enterprises into joint-stock companies,  the Chinese Government department concerned days ago released  explicit regulations on converting state assets into shares,  stressing the need to assess assessment before reorganizing  state enterprises into joint stock companies.    The regulations say that before issuing new shares the  adjusted net book price of the enterprise assets should be  converted into the original shareholders' interest. If the net  book price is not all converted into shares, the remaining net  assets price should be regarded as a part of capital surplus  rather than being converted into liabilities.    In the meantime, the ratio at which enterprise assets are  converted into shares and the multiple of assets-turned shares  [zhe gu bi lu he zhe gu bei shu 2124 5140 3024 3764 0735 2124  5140 0223 2422], together with the planned program for issuing  new shares and the issue price, should be subject to  examination. That is to say, the multiple rate of premium at  which new shares are issued [xin gu fa xing yi jia bei lu 2450  5140 4099 5887 3300 0116 0223 3764] should not be smaller than  the multiple of assets-turned shares; otherwise, the net book  price of the enterprise assets of original shareholders will not  be fully expressed.    The regulations also stressed that the premium at which new  shares are issued should be raised as high as possible to fully  reflect the value of the original shareholders' interest.</p>

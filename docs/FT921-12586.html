			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Meeting the cost of care AN OLD woman who is living in a private nursing home is infirm and requires a lot of attention. Her resources will soon be exhausted. She has a life interest in a farm and enjoys a small income from it. On her death the farm passes to her daughter. When her money is used up will the DSS force the sale of the farm with a view to increasing the income available to go towards the cost of the nursing home? Can they touch the capital sum realised. As the person concerned has only a life interest, and no interest in capital, the DSS cannot require her to be treated as having such an interest as would require the capital value of the form to be attributed to her. The DSS cannot in any even require a sale of assets - it only limits the amount payable by way of support by assessing the subject to have the value of the asset, leaving the question of raising funds to the subject (or her family). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

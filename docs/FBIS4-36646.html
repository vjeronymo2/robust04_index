			<p>BFN     [Text] Informed military sources have unmasked the ruling  military regime in Sanaa by finding out that it has never been  serious at any time in observing the cease-fire declared by the  head of the regime following his meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi,  the special envoy of the UN secretary general.    The military sources reported that the northern commander of  the military axis in Ta'izz had asked the northern units on the  battlefronts to send a military crew to collect a cable which he  described as extremely important. The sources confirmed the  arrival of this cable to the fighting areas at 1730 today. It  has become clear that the cable contains orders that the war  operations are to continue and that the cease-fire is to be  ignored.    Meanwhile, the sources have reported that the Popular  Resistance in the (Amlin) center in al-Dali' Province repulsed  an infiltration attempt by a gang of the regular forces of the  military ruling regime in Sanaa two days ago [8th June]. The  Popular Resistance succeeded in defeating the gang and forced it  into retreat after destroying two military crews and capturing a  large lorry carrying military supplies and ammunition belonging  to the forces of the military regime in Sanaa. Meanwhile, the  Popular Resistance is gaining strength in the various areas in  driving out the aggressive invaders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A split is emerging between Bougainville  secessionists who favor a negotiated settlement of the  five-year-old war and those who are against making any  concessions in their demands for independence. Sean Dorney  reports on a flurry of conflicting statements that had followed  comments on Papua New Guinea [PNG] national radio by the  secessionist representative to the United Nations, Mike Foster.    [Begin Dorney recording] Interviewed on the PNG National  Broadcasting Commission last week, Mr. Foster said there had to  be some give and take from both sides and that the Wingti  government's expectation of an unconditional surrender was as  unrealistic as the rebel's expectation of complete and immediate  secession. A statement issued from Sydney in the name of  President Francis Ona attacked Mike Foster for letting down the  revolution. He was also accused of being the White Judas of  Bougainville by Lilian Cross, the Bougainvillian who is recently  granted political asylum in Australia. However, a statement  issued from Honiara in the name of Vice President Joseph Kabui  sharply defended Mr. Foster and said the Bougainville freedom  movement in Australia had no right to speak for the Bougainville  interim government. In Papua New Guinea, there is division too.  The minister for Bougainville affairs can't get the Wingti  cabinet to endorse his support for Pan-Bougainville talks. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation Minister of </F> Foreign Affairs: "Common European Partnership; Today It Is the  Key Concept in Russian Foreign Policy"]    [Text] It has long ago become clear that, under current  conditions, aggressive nationalism, the doctrines of Brezhnev  and the "Berlin wall," the aspirations for domination and  "sanitary cordons" are unacceptable. At the present time it is  necessary to ensure for all of Europe a strong stability and  security, and to jointly overcome conflicts on national grounds.    In order to achieve this goal, we must develop a consistent  strategy of action which strengthens the unity of all the  democratic states of Europe, a common European partnership.    Today, agreements on partnership and announcements of  intentions are clearly apparent. However, there is as yet no  regulated stable and mature partnership which is backed by the  necessary resources.    This is evidenced by the difficulties which Russia is  encountering, along with other post-communist countries, in  conducting negotiations with the Western partners regarding  access to the market without discrimination and on the basis of  free competition. For example, today the European Union proposes  for democratic Russia a ceiling of 10 percent for the export of  nuclear materials, while even quite recently the Soviet Union  had 16 percent.    Partnership in the political sphere is still being subjected  to serious trials along the sharp turns of European policy. The  latest example is the unilateral ultimatum on Sarajevo. One may  debate the expediency or inexpediency of the threat of using  forceful measures by a certain deadline. Today this matter has  passed and there is no sense in returning to a review of all the  "pros" and "cons." However, it is obvious that the adoption of  such decisions without consultation, with coordination with all  the key state officials participating in the search for Yugoslav  regulation, in this case with Russia, in itself introduces an  unnecessary element of tension and, frankly speaking, risk.    This is why today it is important not to lose the tempo, to  make use of the moment of positive movement created by the  initiative of President Boris Yeltsin, which has led to an  important breakthrough in lifting the blockade of Sarajavo. We  need energetic and necessarily joint actions. Moreover, these  may even be rather decisive measures, but they must be jointly  undertaken. In the context of unified efforts, the individual  powers, as well as their associations, including NATO, will find  their place and make their contribution.    The block, bipolar system of security is irreversably  retreating before the realities of a multipolar world. To hold  onto the illusion, as some naive political scientists do, that a  membership card in a military-political alliance is a panacea  for all ills, is to close one's eyes to the essence of the  processes going on in Europe, to the nature of the crisis of the  new generation. Such an approach initially presupposes the  presence if not of a real, then of an imagined enemy. In any  case, it is fraught with new splits and divisive tears in  Europe. Moreover, not only are the ghosts of the  past--aggressive nationalism, territorial aspirations, religious  intolerance--not retreating, but the danger of their turning  into a real factor of European policy is increasing.    We cannot agree that Europe is experiencing another  repartition in the zones of influence. According to our  conviction, it is important not to let the chance to form a  unified democratic Europe slip by. This presupposes the  provision of an equal level of security for each state, a real  partnership on the basis of the common democratic principles of  the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe].    I am sincerely concerned by the longevity of certain  outdated  dogmas and arguments. Some political leaders are even trying to  pass them off as axioms of current European policy.    The first argument: Accelerated membership by the East  European states in NATO will not only "remove the barriers  dividing Europe," but "will become a step in strengthening  democracy and stability, from which Russia itself will stand to  win." The question is, what Russia? Russia--the great power  following the path of democratic transformations and openness to  the world, or an isolated Russia, and consequently one which may  again turn into a military camp.    The second argument, which does not fully correspond with  the  first: The expansion of NATO through the East Europeans is  necessary, since Russia is unpredictable and is infected with  neoimperialist ambitions. Well, in the case of emergence of new  barriers in Europe and isolation of Russia, it will become  predictable: Armed with missiles and threatening its neighbors.    The third argument. Russia intends to hinder the states of  Central and Eastern Europe from meeting their needs for reliable  security. This too is not so. We do not dispute the sovereign  right of any country to ensure its own defense, including by  means of joining in various military-political alliances. But if  we want a peaceful life for ourselves and our children, the  criterion here must be the degree to which the steps taken  facilitate stability in the region as a whole.    We are proceeding from the fact that there are no longer  grounds to class the European countries into those which  threaten and those which are threatened. Today the Europeans are  on one side of the barrier, while the problems which they must  deal with--economic, social, and international--are on the  other. These are the three components of European security,  which cannot be divided.    For decades, dissident democrats in our countries have  struggled for common values, turning their glances to the CSCE,  the only common European structure, which became their Magna  Carta.    Today the national-patriots are encroaching on these values.  However, for the first time we have the unique capacity to  defend them, using all the wealth of the existing European  institutions.    From this stems the conception of the common European  partnership, which Russia proposes.    Here are its basic elements.    First. Developing Euro-Atlantic cooperation on the  basis of transformation of the CSCE into an effective  all-regional political organization, and the Council for North  Atlantic Cooperation (CNAC)--into an independent structure of  military-political cooperation, but one which is closely tied to  the CSCE. The goal is to coordinate the efforts of NATO, the EC  [European Community], the Council of Europe, the West European  countries and the WEU [Western European Union], and the CIS in  the sphere of strengthening stability and security, peacemaking  and protection of the rights of national minorities in Europe.    Second. Increasing cooperation within the  framework of the CNAC with the involvement of the neutral states  of Europe, including on the realization of the program,  "Partnership in the Name of Peace," on an equal basis, and  turning the CNAC into an independent agency with a compact  secretariat. The CNAC may become the common European laboratory  for peacemaking, greater openness in military activity and  conversion of the VPK [military-industrial complex].    Third. Formulating a network of  mutually-supplementing bilateral agreements on partnership,  cooperation and consultations not only between NATO, on the one  hand, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia,  Ukraine and so forth, but also between the states which are not  members of the alliance. We do not exclude the possibility that  Russia too will someday become a part of NATO, but today the key  factor is the concept of partnership. The advantage and, if you  will, the farsightedness of the program adopted by NATO leaders,  "Partnership in the Name of Peace," consists specifically of the  fact that it seems to open up NATO and takes the first step in  changing it over from a block to some other form of security  organization. And so, common European partnership fits entirely  into our conception. In the future we see also the opening of a  channel of communications between the CIS and NATO.    Fourth. Granting the countries of Central Europe  reciprocal guarantees of security on the part of Russia and its  West European partners. Such a network could be extended to all  of Europe.    Fifth. Increasing the peacemaking potential of the  European states, seeking a unified response by Europe to the  conflicts of the new generation. Giving practical aid in  peacemaking efforts of Russia and the CIS on the territory of  the former USSR.    Sixth. Strengthening the European component of the  regimen of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, other types of  mass destruction weapons and missile technologies, as well as  promises to tighten control over the sale of "dual purpose"  technologies and the most destructive types of conventional  weapons, primarily in the zones of conflict.    Seventh. Increasing economic potential for  purposes of stability and security on the continent. Including  Russia and the states of Eastern Europe in the international  division of labor on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis, and  ensuring their entry into the European and world markets.    Our proposals echo the concepts expressed in numerous  European states. We are ready to cooperate closely with our East  European colleagues in the search for the best decisions and  realization of a program of partnership.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Software ruling - Legal Briefs IN A test case for the copyright of computer software, the English High Court has ruled that a plaintiff can establish an infringement without showing that his software code has been literally copied. The case is of great significance to software developers and owners. Previously, the law had been unclear in cases where 'the look and feel' of one program duplicated another, according to solicitors Dibb Lupton Broomhead, who acted for John Richardson Computers, the successful plaintiff. The Court said that non-literal aspects of a computer program could infringe copyright. The plaintiff did not have to show copying of a substantial part of the structure and organisation of the program even where the program source code had not been copied.</p>

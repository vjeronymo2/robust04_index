			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Shake-up again at Conroy MR RICHARD Conroy has regained his chairmanship of Dublin-based Conroy Petroleum and Natural Resources, the company he founded. This has occurred less than two months after a boardroom coup led by the two main shareholders, Outokumpu and Dundee Bancorp, ousted him and the rest of the board at an extraordinary meeting in February. In what has developed into a saga of Irish corporate trench warfare over the control of a large 6m ton zinc/lead ore deposit in Ireland, Mr Conroy rallied his troops last month for the counter-attack, with the buy-out of Dundee's 16.3 per cent stake by Columbia Investments, a company controlled by Mr Tony O'Reilly, one of Ireland's leading businessmen. The battle for control of Conroy was precipitated at the end of last year by Conroy's share-swap takeover of Atlantic Resources, a company owned by Mr O'Reilly, and which was viewed by Outokumpu as a move designed to dilute its stake in Conroy. Mr Conroy maintained that Outokumpu was seeking total control over the future marketing of ore from the Galmoy zinc deposit, Conroy's principal asset still awaiting planning permission. Yesterday Outokumpu announced the resignation of its four Conroy board members, saying it had been 'unable to agree a basis for the reconstitution of the full Conroy board and management of the company' following the appointment of four new directors by Colombia last month. Outokumpu holds 22.5 per cent of Conroy while Mr Conroy and 'those who are deemed to be concert parties with him' control 28.9 per cent following Colombia's purchase of the Dundee stake.</p>

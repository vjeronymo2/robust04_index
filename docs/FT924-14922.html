			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Prudential Having swung the axe on estate agencies and the commercial broker business, Prudential looked poised to tackle its problems in general reinsurance. The approach unveiled yesterday avoids outright withdrawal, but Mercantile &amp; General will see sharply lower premium income in the years ahead. By staying in the market, the Pru hopes to safeguard valuable profits on its wholesale life business, which shares a similar customer base. Yet the Pru readily admits a sharper focus on profits at M&amp;G will lead to reduced market share. With scant sign of a general hardening of rates across the reinsurance market, the loss of share could be considerable. One effect will be to leave M&amp;G more heavily geared to losses on the long tail of general reinsurance business already written. The announcement of additional underwriting losses in the second half, only a month after the interim statement, underlines the point. There must be doubt about whether even a slimmed-down M&amp;G can make sustainable profits in a volatile, commodity business such as general reinsurance. The alternatives were hardly appealing. A trade buyer was even less likely to step forward after litigation surrounding the sale of Victory Re by Legal &amp; General. Expansion ahead of an anticipated upturn in the reinsurance cycle was too risky. The 4 per cent rise in Prudential's shares yesterday, in spite of the nasty surprise on underwriting, suggests the market appreciates the dilemma. Come the upturn, however, the Pru will have to decide whether to be fully committed or to pull right out.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH SCHOOL ;  </P> <P> BOARD TO GET LAND LEASE OFFERS  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach Union High School District Board of Trustees has scheduled  a public hearing Tuesday to receive proposals from five developers seeking to  lease district-owned land at the intersection of Golden West and Gothard  streets.  </P> <P> The district is considering leasing 14 acres at the site, which is at the rear  of Ocean View High School.  </P> <P> The special meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at the district's headquarters,  10251 Yorktown Ave.  </P> <P> David Hagen, assistant superintendent for business services, said Thursday that  the school board members will hear the development proposals but will not make  a decision at the meeting on whether to accept any of the offers. He said the  board would study the proposals and schedule a vote later on whether to lease  the property.  </P> <P> Hagen said a study group recommended about a year ago that the school board  lease or sell the surplus land. He said the site includes the district's  Guidance Center, but the district plans to move the center next year to vacant  land on the Edison High School campus. The 14-acre parcel also contains a  practice football field used by Ocean View High. The conditions of any lease of  the land would require the developer to provide another football field on other  vacant land at Ocean View High.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Union High School District governs Ocean View, Huntington  Beach, Fountain Valley, Westminster, Marina, Edison and Wintersburg  Continuation high schools.

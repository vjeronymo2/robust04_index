			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Leading figure in turbulent car industry: Obituary - Sir George Turnbull SIR George Turnbull, who died on Tuesday aged 66, was a central figure in the ambitious but unsuccessful attempt to re-organise and modernise the British-owned car manufacturers in the 1960s and 1970s. As managing director of the Austin Morris division of British Leyland from 1968 to 1973, he brought remarkable qualities of leadership, stamina and determination to what was probably the most demanding job in British industry. He began the much-needed reform of work practices and manufacturing methods, but completion would have required more time, more cash and more ruthlessness at the top of the parent company. Turnbull was immersed in the Midlands motor industry from the age of 15, when he joined Standard Motor Company (later Standard Triumph) as an apprentice; under the company's sponsorship he took an engineering degree at Birmingham University. Standard was one of the weakest of the so-called Big Five, the others being British Motor Corporation, Ford, Vauxhall and Rootes. After flirting with several possible merger partners, Standard was acquired in 1961 by Leyland, the commercial vehicle manufacturer, whose chairman, Sir Henry Spurrier, wanted to expand out of his traditional markets and to offer his dealers, as Daimler-Benz could, a full range from trucks to cars. It was the start of a long and ultimately disastrous association between Leyland and the car industry. It also marked the beginning of a close relationship between Turnbull, soon to become general manager of Standard Triumph, and Donald (later Lord) Stokes, the dynamic engineer-salesman who became managing director of Leyland after Spurrier's death in 1963. After absorbing Rover in 1966, Stokes made his boldest move two years later when, with the strong encouragement of the Labour government, he merged Leyland with BMC to form British Leyland Motor Corporation. For all his lack of big-company experience, Turnbull was an obvious choice to run the largest and weakest part of the group, volume car manufacturing. His achievement in rehabilitating Standard Triumph had been impressive, but the task at Austin Morris was of a different order. Outdated facilities, anarchic labour relations and management inertia had led to shortcomings in quality and reliability that became glaringly obvious as import competition began to bite. To tackle those troubles, Turnbull assembled an able team of executives. His straightforward approach and skills as motivator and communicator won strong staff support. Improvements were made in product quality and labour relations. Internal weaknesses at Austin Morris were compounded by uncertain direction in the parent company. There was an unresolved debate between the centralisers, who wanted to recast British Leyland as an integrated company in the mould of Ford or General Motors, and the decentralisers, who felt the culture of the group and its constituent businesses called for a small head office delegating power to largely autonomous divisions. Turnbull was in the latter school and it was the apparent victory of the centralisers in 1973 that led to his resignation. His skills were soon in demand outside the UK. Between 1974 and 1978 he worked with Hyundai in Korea and Iran National Motor Company in Iran before coming back to the UK as chairman of Talbot, the former Rootes business which, after an unhappy period with Chrysler, had passed into the control of Peugeot of France. Turnbull restored morale and saw through, with characteristic courage and firmness, a drastic contraction of capacity including the closure of the Linwood plant in Renfrewshire. For his final career, from 1984 until his retirement through ill health last year, he turned to a very different business, as managing director and then chairman of Inchcape, the international trading group. His overseas marketing experience and team-building skills proved well suited to the transformation of Inchcape from its imperial traditions into a specialised international services group. With about 30 trading companies operating in 60 countries, selling products as diverse as cars and tea, Inchcape daunted even the many predators who sized it up for takeover at the end of the 1970s, attracted by its abysmal financial performance. When Turnbull joined Inchcape, Sir David Orr was chairman. But in 1986 the two men switched jobs to give Turnbull complete authority to put his strategy for change into operation. He found most of the Inchape companies were fundamentally good businesses but in need of focus and control, and management required strengthening. In one of the most dramatic and rapid of corporate rehabilitations, he gave Inchcape a clear focus, reduced to 10 the number of businesses in which it was involved, and expanded the group's European operations. He drove profits to a record level and, two years after he joined, the Stock Exchange value of Inchcape had doubled.</p>

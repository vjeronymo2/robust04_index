At the meeting, the Chinese vice premier spoke  highly of the outcome of the conference, as reflected in the  strong desire of both sides to develop cooperation and the  intent to sign agreements on a number of cooperative projects,  especially a tentative plan for combining the development of  energy industry with environmental protection. He expressed the  hope that both Chinese and U.S. energy sectors will expand  cooperation by pooling their respective resources under the  premise of mutual benefit and common development.    The ``1993 Sino-U.S. Energy Conference'' was sponsored by  the  State Science and Technology Commission, the Society of American  Chinese Engineers in the United States, and the Chinese Energy  Society. The conference, held from 15 to 17 November in  Beijing, is a relatively comprehensive meeting between the  Chinese and U.S. energy sectors in recent years. Attending the  conference from the Chinese side were 200 officials from the  State Science and Technology Commission, the State Planning  Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, electric  power, coal, and petroleum departments, and enterprises; experts  and scholars from universities and research institutes; and  representatives from local energy companies. Jack Siegel, U.S.  assistant secretary of energy, made a special trip to China to  attend the conference on behalf of the U.S. secretary of energy.  About 60 participants from the U.S. side attended the  conference, including president Liang Youping of the Society of  American Chinese Engineers, chairman Rayken [name as published]  of the Anran [name as published] Corporation Board of Directors,  presidents and managers of some energy corporations, and experts  and scholars from relevant universities and research institutes.  The conferees studied and discussed exploitation of energy and  structural reform; energy strategies, policies, and laws;  popularization of advanced energy technology; energy  exploitation and environmental protection, Sino-U.S. cooperation  in energy, and other topics of common interests. They also  reached consensus on the intent to establish a Sino-U.S.  association for promoting energy cooperation and development; to  step up the pace of Sino-U.S. energy science and technology  cooperation; to decide on more key energy cooperative projects;  and to hold periodic seminars on energy management, legal  framework and system, on ways for fund-raising and cooperation;  on selection of key technical projects; and on energy pricing.    During the conference, Song Jian, state councillor and  minister in charge of the State Science and Technology  Commission, met with representatives from the United States.

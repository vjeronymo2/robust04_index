			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 8 March (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Milosevic,  the president of the Srpska republic, today received Charles  Redman, President Clinton's special envoy for the Balkans. The  talks related to the developments in the peace process.    President Milosevic said the Croat-Muslim agreement was  their  internal affair and there was no reason for anyone to dispute it  as long as it did not impinge on the interests of the Serb side  -- and all the more so if its was aimed at achieving peace.    At the same time it is understood that no political  obligations on the Serb side could be inferred from the  agreement, since the Serb side was not taking part in its  preparation. Since the final agreement has not yet been  reached, but has only been announced, it is impossible to take a  final position on it.    President Milosevic stressed he expected the United States  to  make efforts towards the suspension of economic sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, since the Serb side  had accepted the European Union's peace plan, to which the  United States and Russia had also given support. Such an action  by the United States would be in the spirit of impartiality and  equal treatment of all three sides in the conflict, which is of  crucial importance for the lasting resolution of the Yugoslav  crisis.    The Srpska republic will continue to make a contribution  towards peace in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and to support  efforts aimed at achieving it, in keeping with its principle  that nations should be able to exercise their unalienable rights  and protect their national interests on an equal basis.</p>

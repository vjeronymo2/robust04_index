			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 11) TURAN -- "Nobody can force us to  agree on the locating of foreign military bases on the territory  of the republic if it [the placement of bases] is not in the  interest of Azerbaijan", said Azerbaijan's Defense Minister,  Mamedrafi Mamedov.    Mamedov opposes the placement of Russian border troops on  the  Azerbaijani-Iranian and Azerbaijani-Turkish frontier.  "Azerbaijan can protect its own southern borders without  external help", said the Defense Minister.    Earlier, Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, said that  Russia intends to place one military base on Azeri territory  Azerbaijan and representatives of Russian military commandants  have repeatedly stated that they are interested in deploying  Russian border troops in the southern region of Azerbaijan.  Sources in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Turan  that Moscow is dissatisfied with Azerbaijan's refusal. A  Russian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told a  Turan correspondent that "if Baku refuses, relations between  Russia and Azerbaijan will worsen. This will cause serious  economic difficulties in Azerbaijan that will lead to further  dissatisfaction among the population".</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Brewers criticised for weakening beers NATIONAL brewers came under fire yesterday for reducing the alcoholic strength of many of their beer brands to ease the impact of a new duty system. Of the five national brewers, only Whitbread does not intend to make any changes to its beer strengths. The tax effects on its portfolio would be roughly neutral, it said. The Brewers' Society said the new system - which replaces the 113-year-old method of charging duty at the pre-fermentation stage with a tax on the alcoholic strength of the finished product - would increase overall duty by Pounds 64m a year, or 3 per cent. Customs and Excise insisted that the new system would not raise the overall revenue burden on the industry. Officials are examining the Brewers' Society calculations and said that any necessary adjustments would be made in the next Budget. Bass, the country's leading brewer, which estimates that the changes will increase taxes on its beers by more than Pounds 20m a year, is to reduce the alcohol by volume (abv) percentage of many of its brands. Though the abv of its leading lager brands, Carling Black Label and Tennent's, will not be altered, Tennent's Pilsner will be reduced from 3.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent. Worthington bitter and Stone's bitter will also be reduced. The original gravity of most of the affected brands will be raised to preserve taste and flavour, the company said. Courage is reducing the alcohol content of nine of its brands, including Webster's Yorkshire bitter, Holsten Export and Pils, and Hofmeister. Its best-selling bitters, John Smith's, Courage Best and Directors', are not being changed. 'The changes have been made in an effort to minimise the need to pass on the extra cost to our trade customers and ultimately the consumer,' the company said. Carlsberg-Tetley intends to make reductions in the abv of Skol and only two other beers among its 80 brands. Consumer groups attacked the moves, which come at a time when beer prices are again being raised above the rate of inflation. Bass has announced its wholesale beer prices will be increased by an average Pounds 6.62 for a 36-gallon barrel, a rise of 3.58 per cent. Carlsberg-Tetley is expected to increase prices by an average 3 per cent. Mr Andy Sangster, research officer for the Campaign for Real Ale, condemned the reduction in the strengths of some beer brands as a cover for higher prices. He said: 'Ford does not alter the specifications of its cars when taxes go up, and we see no reason why brewers should start fiddling the strength of their beers. It shows a lack of respect for their products.' Ms Ruth Evans, director of the National Consumer Council, said: 'If brewers are cutting the alcohol content of their beers, they should be advertising this fact widely, not trying to slip weaker beer past their customers without telling them. We are not against weaker beers in principle - but consumers who prefer the stronger variety will feel that they are being charged the same price as before, for less.' National brewers had been expected to bear a relatively higher burden of duty after the introduction of the new system on June 1 because of the higher-strength lagers and ales in their portfolios. Though the new scheme was planned to raise the same amount of revenue from the industry, it was clear from the outset that these beers would attract more duty and others would be less heavily taxed. The national brewers are also suffering the loss of benefits they have drawn in recent years from the old system which gave a 6 per cent duty-free production allowance for wastage. Wastage in many of the larger brewery operations is less than 2 per cent because of improvements in brewing technology and efficiency. Complaints from smaller brewers about the advantages the old system gave the nationals were among the reasons for the change. But the switch to end-product duty was also encouraged by the creation of the European single market. Other EC countries charge duty on the finished product. Customs and Excise officials say that they have held close consultations with the Brewers' Society throughout the planning of the new system. 'The society was informed of the approximate figure for the new rate in June 1992, and it was confirmed in early March this year,' the department said. 'The society did not challenge the rate until some three weeks ago and did not produce any data to support its challenge until May 28.' Brewers reply that it was only in the past few weeks that they have been able to calculate the full impact of the changes.</p>

			<p>Reevaluated  <H4>    Treatment Modeled on Italian `Recipe' </H4>  <F P=102> 94WD0269A Copenhagen BERLINGSKE AFTEN in Danish 23 Feb 94 p 7 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0269A </F> <F P=104>  Copenhagen BERLINGSKE AFTEN </F> <F P=105>  Danish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: ``Government </F> Appointing Working Group on Drugs'']    [Text] The government will appoint a commission to produce,  as soon as possible, a trial arrangement whereby drug addicts  could be sentenced to treatment instead of prison for drug  crimes.    Concrete proposals for a trial arrangement are expected to  be  ready by October, the justice minister announced Tuesday [22  February] in the Folketing during the first hearing of a number  of proposals from the Progress Party [FRP], which wants to make  radical changes in the war on drugs.    The FRP wants treatment sentences to begin as early as 1  April, but the system cannot be changed that quickly, according  to the justice minister, who was however quite receptive to many  of the FRP proposals which, in general, were well received by  the Folketing parties.  <H5>  Italy: No Methadone, Just Spaghetti </H5>   ``You do not have to go and hoard your food. It is neither  heroin nor methadone, just spaghetti,'' the Italian treatment  worker told a new group of drug addicts who attacked their lunch  after a sweaty morning of working the minisettlement of San  Carlo in the Alben Mountains near Rome.    This minisettlement is part of the Italian Solidarity  Center's drug treatment program called the ``Human Project''  which, since the 1970's, has tried to steer drug addicts onto  the right course. The leader of the center, Catholic priest Don  Picchi, maintains that 85 out of 100 drug addicts complete the  three-year treatment program.    Recently, the Progress Party proposed that Denmark copy the  Italian model, and Social Welfare Minister Yvonne Herlov  Andersen (Democratic Center) told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE today that  she wanted to find 20 million kroner for two pilot projects.  They would be set up according to the Italian recipe, in which  the most important ingredients are: no methadone, no  intoxicants--but hard physical labor and supervision around the  clock, particularly in the beginning.    The ``Human Project'' is divided into three main phases:    An orientation phase lasting seven to nine months, during  which the addicts are to be given motivation and discipline. The  drug users live at home during this period, but it is the  responsibility of their families to make sure he/she goes to  meetings at the center. The relatives also go to therapy.    The second phase is in the minisettlement of San Carlo: 120  addicts and 12 care providers--psychologists and former  addicts--live together for eight months. Each day consists of  hard physical labor in the morning and therapy, courses, sports,  etc. in the afternoon.    The third phase is the release phase. The former addicts  live  in a house outside Rome. Contact with their families is  reestablished. They look for jobs and the ``patients'' are  prepared for a normal life without drugs.    After a few months they move into the ``city of  temptation,''  Rome, where they live in the same house. Finally, they return  home, but continue group therapy and personal talks for seven  months.    One Dane who has been close to the treatment system is  freelance journalist Ulla Kampmann. She lives in a small town  outside Rome. For many months, Ulla and her husband served as a  ``family'' for a drug addict while he went through the ``Human  Project.''    She has arranged a conference on drug abuse and an  exhibition  Friday [25 February] in ``The House'' in Copenhagen. Italian and  Danish care providers will exchange experiences at the  conference.</p>

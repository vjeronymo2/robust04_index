			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Slick Defense That Backfires--Fourth </F> Commentary on Report by the British Foreign Affairs Select  Committee"]    [Text] Perhaps because the British Foreign Affairs Select  Committee had defended and commended him in its report, "Chris  Patten is very satisfied with his job as governor of Hong Kong"  and claims that he "will continue to be the governor of Hong  Kong until 30 June 1997."    The report, which runs into tens of thousands of words,  devotes a large portion to the defense of Chris Patten's  erroneous policy, praising him for "correctly choosing a path  which seeks to satisfy the demands of Hong Kong people" and  indicating its full support for him. The authors of the report  can be said to be Chris Patten's defense counsels.    The report describes the "assumption of the post of governor  of Hong Kong by Chris Patten, a former government minister with  cabinet duties" as a "most significant change in Hong Kong."    What have been the "changes" since Chris Patten arrived in  Hong Kong? The following, briefly stated, are some of the  notable changes: From the outset, he refused to discuss and  cooperate with China and took a course of confrontation--this  was the first change. He initiated great changes to the  political system, produced a political reform package in  contravention of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the  principle of corresponding to the Basic Law, and agreements and  understandings between China and Britain--this was the second  change. Throughout the negotiations, he kept on disrupting and  undermining the talks between China and Britain on Hong Kong's  1994/95 electoral arrangements with a double-faced  approach--this was the third change. He spoke of Hong Kong as  an "international asset" and visited the United States, Canada,  Australia, Japan, and Western Europe to beg the international  community for intervention in Hong Kong's affairs--this was the  fourth change. He supported legal revisions and formulated new  policies in order to sow dissension between civil servants and  Hong Kong citizens, divide the Hong Kong people, and create  disturbances--this was the fifth change. He distorted some  criminal cases which China has handled according to law in an  attempt to arouse discontent with the Chinese Government and  foster "anxiety" about the future in the people--this was the  sixth change.    That such changes could be lauded by the report as "most  significant changes" indicates well how much Britain's policy  has changed toward China.    As is well known, over the last few years, the British  Government has changed its China policy on the basis of a  completely erroneous assessment of the situation in China. It  is against this background that Chris Patten came to Hong Kong  to carry out Britain's mistaken policy. His point of departure,  therefore, was "change," turning cooperation into confrontation  and stability into turmoil. The core of his actions were  "unilateral moves" to make key changes to the current political  system in order to prolong Britain's control over Hong Kong  after 1997.    All of the changes made by Chris Patten in Hong Kong have  violated agreements between China and Britain, worked against  Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and impeded Hong Kong's  steady transition. But the report tried its best to look for  "grounds" for Chris Patten's "changes."    "Ground" one: "The Joint Declaration does not require that  all things remain unchanged between 1984 and 1997."    Here, let us pose a question to the authors of the report:  Does the Joint Declaration demand that Britain change the  current political system during the transition? Nowhere in the  Joint Declaration and its annexes is Britain given the power to  greatly change the political system. The theme running through  the document is one of "keeping unchanged." There are more than  20 instances of "retain," "maintain," "continue," and so on,  which are all aimed at safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity and a smooth transition. It is also a responsibility  placed by the Joint Declaration on China and Britain. This  defense by the report is obviously awkward.    "Ground" two: "The provisions of the Basic Law are at  present not legally binding on the Hong Kong Government."    This statement is clear in its connotation, namely, that  there is no need to take the Basic Law into account in actions  taken by Chris Patten before 1997 to change the political  system. But since the British Hong Kong government is not bound  by the Basic Law, why does Chris Patten keep explaining that his  "political reform package" corresponds with and does not violate  the Basic Law? Why did the report, following Chris Patten, say  that "our legally sworn witnesses, our governor, and the British  Government hold that absolutely nothing in the proposals made by  the Hong Kong governor is inconsistent with the provisions of  the Basic Law?" It is cheating to say that Chris Patten's  package "corresponds with the Basic Law" and "is absolutely not  inconsistent with the provisions of the Basic Law." The truth  is that the package violated the principle of corresponding with  the Basic Law. Because Chris Patten never wanted to be "bound"  by the Basic Law and was willing to work only under the "Letters  Patent" and the "Royal Instructions." Unexpectedly, the report  revealed the truth.    "Ground" three: "The British government and the Hong Kong  authorities are not legally obliged to stop Chris Patten's  proposals from being implemented before 1997."    This gives them away again. Chris Patten is above the  British Hong Kong Government and is in a supreme position, which  is a power given by the British Queen. Therefore, the Hong Kong  authorities have no means (or it should be said "have no  intention") of stopping him from carrying out his package. It  is easy to understand. And it shows that there is only  dictatorship and no genuine democracy in Hong Kong at the  present time. What we do not understand is who is commanding  who -- the British Government or Chris Patten? Can it be Chris  Patten who is commanding the British Government? The "Letters  Patent" expressly stipulate that the "governor obeys the rules,  ordinances, and rulings in the Letters Patent in making laws."  Since Chris Patten's package received the "full support" of the  British Government, why did the report say that the British  Government is not legally obliged to stop Chris Patten from  carrying out his package? Are they not shooting themselves in  the foot?    This was a slick move that backfired! The authors of the  report, in intending to prove the correctness of Chris Patten  with these "grounds," end up showing that his policy is wrong.  This is something they probably did not expect!</p>

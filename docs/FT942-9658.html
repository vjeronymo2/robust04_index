			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Age not a bar on directorships Sir, In your article about the appointment of Sir Michael Palliser to the board of the Exploration Company of Louisiana (People, May 10), you said that given his age (72) 'there is some surprise that he is taking on additional directorships'. May I remind you that Sir Michael, incidentally my contemporary, is 20 years younger than the late Dr Armand Hammer was when he stepped down as chief executive of Occidental.

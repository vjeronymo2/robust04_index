			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FROM SATELLITES TO SUBWAY CARS;  </P> <P> U.S. LIKES FRENCH TOUCH IN HIGH TECH  </P> <P> Mention France and Americans usually envision fine wines, stylish fashions and  gourmet meals. But it's high technology, not haute cuisine, that dominates the  French-American connection.  </P> <P> In the United States, French industries are coming on strong, especially in  aerospace, communications and transportation. Americans ride in French trains,  airplanes and subway cars; launch their satellites with French rockets, and do  a host of chores with French-inspired computer wizardry.  </P> <P> "Aircraft and aircraft engines and systems bring the most dollars back to  France," says Daniel Gagneux, a commercial counselor at the French Embassy in  Washington. "More than $2 billion worth were sold in the United States last  year."  </P> <P> That trend is likely to continue as American carriers welcome new generations  of Airbuses that feature "fly-by-wire" systems designed largely by the French.  Replacing standard mechanical links, fly-by-wire gives pilots a handy side  stick instead of a wheel. Control of the plane flows from the stick through  wires to five computers that control crucial components in the wings and tail.  </P> <P> Airbus Industrie, the consortium of French and other European manufacturers  that planned the new 150-passenger jetliners, already has sold 191 of them in  the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Launches Satellites  </P> <P> Helicopters and smaller French-manufactured aircraft are also flying American  skies. The U.S. Coast Guard operates the largest fleet: 96 French helicopters  and 41 small French jet planes.  </P> <P> The French influence extends far above U.S. airspace. Managed by France and  supported by a consortium of European governments, Arianespace regularly  launches commercial satellites from a site in French Guiana. Since 1984,  Arianespace has put 14 U.S. telecommunications satellites in orbit, and two or  three more will be lofted this year.  </P> <P> Few satellites launched by Arianespace have had more impact than SPOT, a  spacecraft that beams back high-resolution images of Earth from space. Owned  and operated by France's space agency, SPOT can produce clear images of an area  measuring only 10 meters -- about half the size of a tennis court.  </P> <P> "Customers in the United States range from farmers and government agencies to  urban planners," Pierre Bescond, president of Spot Image Corp., told National  Geographic.  </P> <P> American urban planners also are turning to French people-movers to alleviate  some of their problems.  </P> <P> At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, an elevated, dual-track French rail  system will link four major terminals with remote parking lots. The  computer-controlled, driverless robot trains, scheduled to begin operation next  year, initially will carry as many as 2,400 passengers an hour at speeds of up  to 50 miles per hour.  </P> <P> Transportation in other cities, including Atlanta and New York, gets a boost  from French-manufactured subway cars.  </P> <P> But it is on intercity rail runs that French technology soon may be making its  biggest impact in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-Speed Trains  </P> <P> Reaching speeds of 110 m.p.h., French turboliner trains, powered by motors  adapted from helicopter engines, have cut travel time between New York and  Albany from three hours to two hours and eight minutes. A new version of the  trains, proposed between New York and Boston at speeds of up to 125 m.p.h.,  would make the trip in three hours, cutting 45 minutes off existing travel  time.  </P> <P> The Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) -- train of great speed -- would carry  passengers even faster if approved for Florida service between Miami, Ft.  Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa. Flashing through the Florida  countryside at speeds sometimes reaching 185 m.p.h., the new-generation TGV  would be operated by a lone driver in the cab and controlled by a system of  computers in each car.  </P> <P> The Gallic touch in computers revolutionized videotex, a method of sending and  receiving text and graphics, usually over telephone lines, between a central  computer and a terminal or personal computer. Known as Minitel in France, the  system consists of a keyboard, a screen and a modem, an instrument that  translates telephone signals into computer-readable graphics.  </P> <P> In France, 4.4 million subscribers can use Minitel to bank, shop and read their  morning newspapers. Some even use the system as a kind of lonely-hearts  service, tapping out messages to one another's pseudonyms.  </P> <P> "These chat services are very popular in the United States, too," says Terry  Ribb, marketing director for Minitel Services of Purchase, N.Y., which is  marketing French Minitel technology in the United States.  </P> <P> Houston is one of the hottest current markets for the American version of  Minitel. Systems have been distributed to almost 10,000 households -- the  eventual target is 60,000 -- in a mass-market test financed by two U.S.  companies, Videotel and Southwestern Bell Telephone.  </P></p>

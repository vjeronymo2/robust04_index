The enactment came on the last day of the current  extraordinary Diet session, the deadline set by Hosokawa, who  had staked his political fortunes on passage of the package.    The House of Councillors approved the package in a plenary  session after the House of Representatives passed it. Each  chamber gave its blessing to the measures by a stand-up vote.

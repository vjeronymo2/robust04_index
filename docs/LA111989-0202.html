			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: CAPTAIN &amp; TENNILLE CASTING OFF STUDIO  </P> <P> The Captain &amp; Tennille, husband/wife pop stars DARYL DRAGON and TONI  TENNILLE, have put their Rumbo Studios in Canoga Park on the market so they can  spend more time on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, where they've had a home for  the last five years.  </P> <P> "They're both still recording," said Christina Paradise, who shares the  $3.3-million listing with Bruce Conover at Douglas Properties in Malibu, "but  Rumbo Studios is an ongoing business, not just for them, and the Captain is  just getting tired of flying back and forth."  </P> <P> Dragon said that he is selling the studios because "it's time to move on."  </P> <P> He and Tennille have owned the studios since the complex was built in 1979.  "They chose the location because they got their first recording deal half a  block away," Paradise said.  </P> <P> The complex has three studios and a number of separate isolation booths. It  also has a pool room, tape library, full kitchen, kitchenette, three baths, a  shower, several offices, a couple of lounges, a technical shop and a basketball  half-court. Updated electronic equipment was recently installed.  </P> <P> Among the studio's recording credits are Tom Petty's "Full Moon Fever," Roy  Orbison's "Mystery Girl," Eddie Money's "Nothing to Lose," Guns N' Roses albums  "Appetite for Destruction" and "G N R Live," as well as work by the Jefferson  Airplane, REO Speedwagon, Trevor Rabin, Cory Hart and The Smithereens.  </P> <P> TOM HAYDEN, Democratic assemblyman from Santa Monica, was due to close escrow  after our deadline last week on a new house in the Sunset Park area of Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> After he and his wife, Academy-Award winning actress Jane Fonda, separated last  February, Hayden moved from their house in the northern part of Santa Monica to  an apartment in Westwood. Fonda is still believed to be living in the Santa  Monica home they shared.  </P> <P> Hayden's new house is in Sunset Park, a neighborhood in the southern end of  Santa Monica. The house was described as a "classic California-style bungalow"  with three bedrooms and two baths. Hayden paid $750,000, according to sources  not associated with the deal.  </P> <P> The house had been listed with Shirley Bly and Bill Bolton, both in the Santa  Monica office of Fred Sands Realtors.  </P> <P> Multimillionaire sportsman BRIGGS CUNNINGHAM, 82-year-old heir to the Procter  &amp; Gamble fortune who skippered the United States to victory in the 1958  America's Cup Race, and his wife, Laura, are building a 15,000-square-foot  Italian villa at Fairbanks Ranch in the San Diego County community of Rancho  Santa Fe.  </P> <P> The couple, both of whom are former race car drivers, are perhaps best known  for their Costa Mesa automotive museum, which was sold and moved to Florida in  1987.  </P> <P> They bought three Fairbanks Ranch lots, each about an acre in size, several  years ago for a total of $900,000. Marianne Whyte of Fairbanks Ranch Realty  handled the deal.  </P> <P> Laura Cunningham created the design of her new house with the help of architect  Cliff Mills. It will have nearly 100 columns, an elaborate stereo system that  is even piped into the swimming pool and a seven-car garage when completed by  year-end.  </P> <P> RICHARD PAGE, lead singer and bassist with the rock group Mr. Mister, got so  interested in surfing when not working on the group's new album that he sold  his Zuma Beach property and bought a house at Point Dume.  </P> <P> "He got turned onto surfing, and it's better at Point Dume than at Zuma," said  Jay Rubenstein of Malibu Realty, who represented Page in the transactions. "And  now he can easily get to the beach on a pathway from his home."  </P> <P> Page's house, a wood-and-glass contemporary, was built in 1949, but it has been  remodeled and expanded. It has four bedrooms and 3 1/2 baths in 3,022 square  feet. Page plans to add a second-story master bedroom.  </P> <P> The home sits on an acre, with beautiful trees, a few hundred feet from Johnny  Carson's house. Page paid, according to public records, $1.41 million.  </P> <P> The former BOB HOPE USO BUILDING at 1641 Ivar Ave. in Hollywood has just  undergone a $1-million renovation for HKM Productions, a company that has made  TV commercials for such firms as 7-Up, General Electric, Merle Norman and  Levi's Youthwear.  </P> <P> HKM Productions and its new affiliate, HKM Films, are already occupying the  20,000-square-foot building as their new headquarters, complete with two  casting stages, an off-line video editing system and a film-cutting room. The  building was constructed in 1936 and was used for years by the Southern  California Gas Co., according to an HKM spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "Bob Hope opened it (for the USO) in 1973, dedicated it -- even had his logo  there -- and entertained there a couple times," said Ward Grant, a publicist  for Hope. The USO closed the building to relocate to Long Beach last year.  </P> <P> British rock star GEORGE MICHAELS will have plenty of room to stretch out his  6-foot frame: He's furnishing his new, $3-million home in Montecito with a  leather couch, actually a sectional, that is 18 feet long, thanks to designer  Beth Spivak and furniture creator Gina B.  </P></p>

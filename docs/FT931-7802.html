			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Japanese raise car prices in US SEVERAL Japanese carmakers have unexpectedly raised prices in the US in an apparent effort to head off protectionist pressure building up against them. The recent increases by Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mazda were in addition to the normal price rises made when models are changed. An executive at a leading carmaker said: 'These increases were mainly political. We are better able to head off protectionism if we can point to recent price increases.' He added that the surge in the yen might force further action but that the first round was not due to currency movement. The Big Three US carmakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - recently shelved plans to file an anti-dumping complaint against their Japanese competitors. Nissan increased the US price of its Infiniti luxury car range by 1.2 per cent in January, and most of the rest of its range by 1.1 per cent. The price of the Altima car went up by 1.5 per cent this month. It said the increases were designed to offset the yen's appreciation against the dollar and to improve the profitability of its US operations. Honda, which lifted prices by just under 1 per cent in January, admitted the increases were not normal. Prices normally rise in September when models change; last September its prices in the US rose by between 2.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent. It said the recent price move had been caused by sales and manufacturing cost pressures. Honda said it would consider further price increases if the yen continued to rise. However, it expects the yen's climb over the past 10 days to be temporary. Toyota increased car prices of its Lexus luxury brand and other models by 1.2 per cent this month, on top of its normal price increases in October. It blamed the move on rising costs and the yen's strength. Mazda, which generally raises its prices in August or September, increased the price of its multi-purpose vehicles sold in the US by a further Dollars 500 in December.</p>

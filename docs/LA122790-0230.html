			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW STARTS THE DAY LATE, SLIPS 11.63  </P> <P> Stock prices drifted lower today in a session delayed by problems that resulted  from an overnight fire at a financial-district building.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 11.63 points at 2,625.50.  </P> <P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a modest 102.9 million shares, with  the start of trading delayed 90 minutes. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by  about 3 to 2.  </P> <P> The fire may have slowed reaction to poor economic data.  </P> <P> The government reported that durable goods orders in November fell a sharp  10.5%. Economists had predicted a 3.1% decline.  </P> <P> "The delay gave us a chance to do a more sensible and less rushed analysis of  the (economic) data," said one analyst who thought today's decline might have  been deeper. "It lessened the chances of an emotional response."  </P> <P> Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond, James &amp; Associates, said  concern over fourth-quarter corporate profits was also rising.  </P> <P> "That can keep the market on edge," he said.  </P> <P> Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down  1/4 at 30 an hour before the close; General Electric, down 1/8 at 57 1/4, and  General Motors, down 3/8 at 34 3/8.  </P> <P> Tiffany &amp; Co. fell 2 3/8 to 34 7/8 on top of a 4 3/8-point loss Wednesday,  when the company said its holiday sales in the United States came in below  expectations.  </P> <P> Bond prices jumped in thin trading early today as traders responded to the  government report on durable goods.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000  in face amount, around midday. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped  to 8.24% from 8.28% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks pay each other on temporary loans,  gyrated amid what analysts said were end-of-the-year moves by banks that  reduced the availability of federal funds.  </P></p>

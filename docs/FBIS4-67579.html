			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Press release by Armenian Press Service: "Ecological </F> Bulletin--93"]    [Text] According to the Republic Environmental Monitoring  Center the state of the air basin of the cities in Armenia last  year created the following picture. In Yerevan of the 13 indices  taken under control, four, including that on dust, exceeded  established levels. By comparison with 1992, however, the  average annual and maximum density of harmful substances  decreased.    This is reported in the annually issued "Ecological  Handbook"  of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Evaluating the  pollution of the air basin of populated points with toxic  emissions the handbook reports an overall comparative decrease  in their amount in a number of other cities of the republic  where measurements were taken at regular intervals. But with  regard to specific compounds (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,  and others) the indices are yet to reach acceptable levels.    Samples for the analysis of water surfaces were not taken  from all of the rivers in the republic because of the lack of  transportation and fuel, which does not allow an accurate and  comprehensive general characterization. Nevertheless it was  established that permissible levels of ammonia ions, nitrites,  petroleum products, and copper are being exceeded. At the same  time changes in the average annual density of these substances  are not noted.    Inspection services of the ministry checked the work on  environmental protection at 1,645 facilities in the republic and  found 1,683 violations of environmental laws in connection with  which 25 cases were forwarded to legal investigative agencies.  The operation of three facilities was stopped. Demands for  reimbursement of damages were prepared in connection with  violations occurring at numerous enterprises, including  Ararattsement, Armenergoprom, and the Yerevan TETs [Heat and  Power Station].    The Administration for the Protection of Fisheries is  conducting an inventory of artificial water reservoirs with the  participation of interested organizations to establish a true  picture of existing fish species and populations and also for  the proper organization of state fishing. The administration  recorded 231 cases of illegal fishing and fined 200 individuals.  In the course of raids made at the Sevan National Park some 256  nets and three seines, along with eight rubber boats, and  several thousand kilograms of fish were confiscated.</p>

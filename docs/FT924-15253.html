			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Unreal air pervades campaign: Insults fly as US election candidates prepare to debate A SURREAL mood has descended on the US presidential election campaign, a week before the three candidates meet in debate and a month before the country votes, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Perhaps the oddest intervention came from President George Bush on Sunday night when he claimed in a television interview that Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, had actively supported the administration's policies of offering agricultural and other credits to Pres-ident Saddam Hussein of Iraq. This was obviously intended to deflect growing criticism of Mr Bush's role in courting the Iraqi dictator. It drew a blistering response from Mr Clinton, who said that to ascribe any significance to a five-minute courtesy call in 1986 with the then Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations showed how 'desperate and pathetic' the president had become. Stranger still was a Newsweek magazine report yesterday that several pages of Mr Clinton's passport records, held at the State Department, had apparently gone missing. The FBI was said to be making inquiries. In the unfathomable category comes the new Ross Perot campaign. The Texas billionaire, like Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, is now almost permanently on the talk show programmes and was due last night to air the first of his paid-for half-hour expositions on national television. Yesterday morning Mr Perot came close to accusing the Republican party of character assassination. However, he denied he would come out in support of Mr Clinton and spent most of an interview accusing the media of being part of the establishment plot to discredit his candidacy. Mr Bush's Sunday night performance on Larry King Live - on this occasion not live but taped in advance at the White House - was not one of his best. He seemed not to know what his party platform said on the subject of abortion and, repeatedly pressed on the state of the economy, merely responded that 'things have been tough, but they haven't been that tough'. For the first time Mr Bush said Mr Clinton's failure to serve in the military was a disqualification from serving as president. His election, the president said, would mean replacing the US eagle in the White House with 'a chameleon'. Mr Perot's entry into the presidential race pushes Mr Clinton to within six of the 270 Electoral College votes he needs to win, according to a survey released yesterday, Reuter adds. The survey of 20,400 likely voters in all 50 states by the American Research Group focused on the college - the government body that actually chooses the US president - rather than the popular vote.

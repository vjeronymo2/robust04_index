The media say the  program of the meeting between the American head of state and  President Boris Yeltsin has been agreed upon on all key matters.  It will be a continuation of the summit that took place last  April in Vancouver, Canada.    According to the press service of the Russian president, the  Moscow meeting will continue the search for ways of expanding  partnership, in particular cooperation in the light of the  strategy of reform carried out in Russia. The agenda also  includes key international problems, such as the strengthening  of security and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,  peace-making operations in regional conflicts. The talks should  cover the entire spectrum of questions of bilateral relations  too.    The Moscow summit should become a major international event,  like the meeting in Vancouver and other top-level talks between  the two great powers. This can be explained by the role that  Russian- American relations play in the world community.    Still, one can say that the coming summit talks will have  their own identity. They are going to take place in conditions  of the further advancement of reforms in Russia. The reforms  were in the centre of attention during the parliamentary  elections in Russia last month. The pros and cons of the  reforms became evident then. The election results influenced the  domestic political scene in Russia and to a certain extent  international relations too. A somewhat new situation emerged  and new questions appeared, some of which are linked to  Russian-American relations.    Vladislav Kozyakov comments on the distinctive features of  the upcoming Moscow meeting. He writes:    If you review the road between Vancouver and Moscow, that is  between last April and January, you will notice quite a few  achievements. Russia and the United States have come closer to  each other. Much of what was agreed on in Vancouver has been  done. Here one could name the decision of the United States  Congress to earmark means for support to Russia and several  concrete aid programs. What is more important, scores of  agreements in economy have been concluded. Russia will take  part in the construction of an international space station  together with the United States, while America will be involved  in the modernization of the Russian oil industry. These and  other programs should benefit both nations.    But now new tasks have come to the fore, primarily  cooperation directed at encouraging democratic changes in  Russia. The parliamentary elections in Russia clearly showed  that the reforms, the way they were carried out so far, were too  harsh for the broad masses. At a recent news conference  President Yeltsin spoke of the need for additional social  measures. The Russian reformers are determined to somewhat  amend their own strategy and take steps to raise living  standards. It is indicative that Western capitals arrived at a  similar conclusion. Declarations were made there in support of  broader efforts to back social programs in Russia. President  Clinton even spoke for doubling the efforts of Western countries  in this sphere. One can foresee that this aspect of  Russian-American partnership is going to be discussed in detail  at the Moscow summit.    However, certain aspects of relations between Moscow and  Washington should be altered in the current situation. The time  that has passed since Vancouver has demonstrated the great  potential of the establishment of fully normalized, equal  relations in trade. However, even now, far from all the  restrictions introduced by the United States during the cold war  have gone down in history. Unfortunately, in some other spheres  one can also notice that the West does not fully realize the  true needs and lawful interests of Russian reformers, conducting  democratic changes in such a mammoth country. Washington and  other Western capitals, as well as international financial  organizations, are trying to measure the progress of Russian  reforms, their scale and speed, according to their own pattern  and accordingly determine their attitudes to actual programmes  of economic cooperation. Meanwhile, such an approach is  absolutely unacceptable in relations with a great power.    There are also some other areas in which the west should  stop  being didactical in its dialogue with Moscow, to use the  expression of the Russian foreign minister, Andrey Kozyrev.  Russia expects the coming summit in Moscow to be productive and  be marked by new understanding, greater partnership in all  spheres of cooperation.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HE WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT;  </P> <P> GUATEMALAN PRIEST BATTLING FOR LAND REFORM  </P> <P> His role models are the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Bishop Oscar Arnulfo  Romero of El Salvador, two assassinated civil rights activists.  </P> <P> He nearly followed them full circle in September when attackers opened fire on  his car, killing his bodyguard-driver and wounding his adopted son.  </P> <P> Father Andres Giron, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic priest, hasn't stopped what  he has been doing -- pressing for land reform and seeking permission from the  Vatican to run for president of this Central American country.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean that he is fearless.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid," he said. "Sometimes I think it's better to be a live burro than a  dead thoroughbred."  </P> <P> Giron, a U.S.-educated cleric who taught in the slums of Memphis, Tenn., in the  1960s and marched with King in the city's garbage workers' strike, continues to  pursue land reform even though it can be mortally dangerous to do so.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slaughter Quelled  </P> <P> His father and four other relatives were among the estimated 100,000 people  killed in political violence during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Local and  international human rights groups blame government security forces for the vast  majority of the killings. The slaughter of suspected leftists quelled a  stubborn, decades-old insurgency, though pockets of guerrilla activity remain.  </P> <P> Giron spent 1981-83 in the United States because of threats on his life here.  </P> <P> "In Guatemala, land is the source of power. No land, no power," he said in an  interview beneath an almond tree next to his church in Tiquisate, 55 miles  southwest of Guatemala City.  </P> <P> Two bodyguards, one with a submachine gun and the other cradling a shotgun,  leaned against the priest's car nearby. Giron had just said Mass for about 200  parishioners, among them eight adolescent girls dressed in white lace and  finery for their First Communion.  </P> <P> He told them in the homily that his Christian duty, and theirs, included  "denouncing the terrible things going on in this country; that officials are  stealing, that the army is killing people."  </P> <P> He exhorted them to act as yeast in the figurative bread of society, to  contribute to a rising up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focusing on Election  </P> <P> Giron has enlivened a political scene already focused on 1990 presidential  elections.  </P> <P> He said he intends to use the National Campesino Assn. he formed in 1986 as the  base for a political party. The party will challenge the centrist Christian  Democrats and rightists who have dominated partisan politics since the return  to civilian government in 1986.  </P> <P> The peasant organization represents 120,000 people, he said.  </P> <P> Ultraconservatives, who with the armed forces ran the country throughout its  modern history, consider Giron a subversive. Some have called for his arrest.  </P> <P> "This country needs a spark to ignite a revolution, and I want to be part of  that revolution," he said.  </P> <P> The priest calculates that 71% of Guatemala's arable land is owned by 1% of its  population. Others dispute that figure. But there is agreement that land  distribution is among the most skewed in the hemisphere, favoring a small group  at the expense of Indian peasants, who make up nearly 60% of the population.  </P> <P> According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), enough  uncultivated land is available on big estates to provide five-acre plots to  each of the estimated 500,000 heads of peasant households with no land at all.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dangerous Challenge  </P> <P> Challenging the gentry's hold on land has always been dangerous.  </P> <P> President Jacobo Arbenz began the country's first and only land reform in the  early 1950s and his initiative galvanized rightist opposition. Military  officers supported by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency overthrew Arbenz in  1954 and returned all expropriated holdings to their previous owners, among  them the U.S.-based United Fruit Co.  </P> <P> AID subsequently described Arbenz's reform plan as "moderate and progressive"  </P> <P> Giron does not have a detailed plan yet for redistributing land. But he  describes his philosophy as radical. He envisions a Guatemala with no landless  peasants, a place where country people have enough land to grow the food they  need.  </P> <P> "It can't be done in one year, or even two, because people have to be educated.  But I would make a real revolution here, and they (the landholders) know it,"  said Giron.  </P> <P> Giron, who supported the successful presidential candidacy of Vinicio Cerezo  Arevalo in the 1985 election, said he has letters from the president in which  the Christian Democrat committed himself to land reform.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Public Commitment  </P> <P> Cerezo has made no such commitment publicly, but he has supported programs to  aid small farmers. He also has used government funds to buy about 11,000 acres  of land to divide among about 3,000 peasant families.  </P> <P> "All that has been done has been done very timidly," said Giron, who with some  followers invaded and occupied fallow farmland in 1986. The government bought  the parcel and sold it to the peasants at subsidized prices.  </P> <P> Giron's campesino association runs three cooperative farms on such land bought  cheaply from the government.  </P> <P> He said Cerezo probably would have pursued small-scale redistribution had it  not been for a coup attempt last May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More, More Dependent  </P> <P> The military high command backed Cerezo's government and put the rebellion  down. But the civilian administration, which had been barely able to assert  authority against the military in the best of times, became even more  conditioned by and dependent upon military tutelage.  </P> <P> "May was it for Vinicio," said Giron.  </P> <P> Rightists contend that breaking up large holdings would hurt production of hard  currency-earning mainstays of the economy -- coffee, sugar, bananas and cotton.  </P> <P> "Even in good export years, people are dying of hunger," Giron said. "I'm not  in favor of destroying the productive apparatus. I'm smart enough to know we  can't live without dollars.  </P> <P> "But I can't go along with a system under which a small group of the privileged  live like kings while most people live like beggars."  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Management: Ringing the changes brings mixed results It was seven years ago that a group of senior executives first recognised British Telecom's need to introduce what has become known as 'process management': the replacement of activities fragmented between departments, businesses and geographic units by processes which span them. But the UK telecoms giant is still having mixed success with the approach. This is partly because of the scale of the changes required in such a large organisation. But there have also been other reasons. For several years, BT's efforts at what has now generally become known as 're-engineering' were piecemeal. Nor were they linked to a revised corporate strategy. Top management took until 1992 to throw its weight behind the principle that BT needed to be re-engineered along process lines. Among myriad other barriers within BT, according to a new study entitled Re-engineering: The Critical Success Factors*, 'process management' has not yet been legitimised at BT by being integrated with the responsibilities and rewards of line managers. BT has also had problems combining two approaches to re-engineering: focusing on selected complete 'core processes', such as the ordering and provision of private circuits; or re-engineering service components, such as customer relations. BT's very mixed experience with re-engineering is one of several company case studies examined in the report from Business Intelligence, which looks beneath the considerable consultancy hype of the last 18 months and probes the practical experience of American and British companies which have been striving to introduce re-engineering. Other companies studied include Lucas Industries, Pilkington Optronics, Reuters, Rank Xerox and Western Provident Association, a UK health insurance company. The strength of the study is its comprehensive scope, and the rigour with which, unlike many consultants and their clients, it defines what re-engineering really is - or should be. Although 'business process re-engineering' or BPR, has been dubbed 'big people reductions' by some cynics - including within BT, which is slashing its workforce - the study stresses that it has little in common with conventional restructuring or 'downsizing'. As the study argues, re-engineering can only succeed when it is accompanied by changes in corporate strategy, management methods, behaviour and culture. Combined with these, it becomes what some consultancies call 'transformation'. The study distinguishes between two forms of re-engineering: what it calls 'business re-engineering', which it defines as the - hitherto rare - re-engineering of entire businesses or organisations; and 'process redesign', the narrower but still daunting reconfiguration of selected 'core processes' which span departmental boundaries, such as order fulfilment and the development of new products. Among a useful checklist of 'risk factors' in re-engineering, the study warns that the frequent failure to carry out a thorough initial strategic review tends to result in the re-engineering of processes which have a trivial impact on overall performance. Re-engineering is useless, it says, for an organisation which has products, services or a philosophy of business which are losing touch with market needs. Although many consultancies claim that the definition of core processes is the easiest part of re-engineering, the report warns that it can be both hard and time-consuming. It is difficult to form an accurate view of how work is actually performed when formal procedures have been replaced over the years by informal ones, the study says. Yet a failure to define core processes correctly can lead to disappointing results, since it prompts companies to target too few or too many processes. * Published by Business Intelligence in association with Management Today.

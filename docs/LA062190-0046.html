			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW SPUTTERS TO A SMALL GAIN LATE IN SESSION  </P> <P> Stocks shrugged off bearish news Wednesday on interest rates and fought back to  score small gains at the close.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve's so-called Beige Book of regional economic conditions said  the economy continues to grow slowly with little change in inflation trends.  </P> <P> The report was seen as another clue that Fed interest rate policy is on hold  for now, dashing hopes of lower rates. The news kept the Dow Jones industrial  average down slightly for most of the day.  </P> <P> But the Dow recovered late to close up 1.74 at 2,895.30. Most broader indexes  also gained. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 0.63 to 359.10, and the  NASDAQ over-the-counter composite rose 0.27 to 460.80.  </P> <P> One of the strongest indexes was the NASDAQ industrial index, which is heavy  with high-tech companies. It added 1.23 to 493.47, showing investors continue  to be interested in smaller tech stocks.  </P> <P> Traders said that selling after the Fed's report lacked conviction and that  volume was light. Still, declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6  in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 668 up,  777 down and 555 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 137.42 million shares, up from 134.93 million Tuesday.  </P> <P> Drug stocks rose, which some traders said reflected investors' desire to buy  stocks where earnings are likely to be strong even if the economy slips.  Schering-Plough rose 1 to 46 after the firm reaffirmed expectations that 1990  earnings per share will increase 18% to 20%. Upjohn rose 2 1/8 to 42 1/8;  Abbott Labs added 1 to 40.  </P> <P> Syncor International of Chatsworth rose 3/8 to 9 5/8 after signing a pact to  distribute one of Squibb's radioactive drugs that is used in diagnostics.  </P> <P> Newport Pharmaceuticals of Laguna Hills plunged 5/8 to 3, after rising 13/16  Tuesday on speculation about one of the company's AIDS treatment drugs. Federal  regulators have been skeptical about the drug.  </P> <P> Oil and oil services stocks were mostly higher despite another fall in oil  prices. Arco rose 1 1/8 to 117 7/8, Texaco added 3/4 to 58, Unocal rose 3/8 to  28 5/8 and Baker Hughes rose 1/4 to 28 3/8. But Dekalb Energy slumped 2 3/4 to  23 1/4.  </P> <P> Among growth stocks, Circus Circus added 1 1/8 to 61 7/8 on the strength of its  opening of the Excalibur hotel in Las Vegas. Elsewhere, restaurant chain  Showbiz/Pizza Time plunged 3 1/2 to 22 1/4 after an analyst lowered  current-quarter earnings estimates, though the analyst said he expected good  growth in the next two quarters.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks closed slightly higher in thin trading. The 225-share Nikkei  index closed 47.38 points higher at 32,087.76.  </P> <P> In London, stocks inched up. The Financial Times 100-share index rose 1.5 to  close at 2,371.2. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index closed up 12.81 at  1,849.55, continuing Tuesday's rebound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Beige Book Report Sinks Bond Prices  </P> <P> Treasury bond prices sank as the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on the  economy reinforced a belief that the central bank won't lower interest rates  soon.  </P> <P> In the junk bond market, prices of RJR Nabisco bonds closed sharply higher in  heavy trading as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. announced plans to retire a  large part of $6 billion in debt used to finance its record buyout of RJR.  </P> <P> Some RJR bonds jumped on the KKR news. The 14.07% bonds due in 2009 gained more  than $6 per $100 in face value to $96.75.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000  face amount. Its yield rose to 8.51% from 8.47% Tuesday.  </P> <P> Besides the Fed report, T-bonds were pushed lower by concerns about a possible  oversupply of bonds. The Treasury said it plans to sell $11.25 billion in  two-year notes and $8.25 billion in four-year notes next week. The amount of  the two-year notes was $250 million greater than anticipated, fueling concerns  about whether the market can absorb the supply.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.25%, up from 8.125% Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Gorbachev Speech Boosts the Dollar  </P> <P> The dollar gained slightly against most other major currencies in light  trading, boosted by concern about political uncertainty in the Soviet Union,  traders said.  </P> <P> Gold prices rose domestically after a mixed performance overseas. On New York's  Commodity Exchange, gold rose $1.40 an ounce to $350.50. Later, Republic  National Bank in New York reported a bid of $349.60 an ounce.  </P> <P> The dollar was helped by a comment from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  that soon he might no longer be leader of the Communist Party, traders said.  </P> <P> At a party meeting in Moscow, Gorbachev acknowledged that he could lose his  party post at a national congress in less than two weeks. The news caused a  flight to the dollar in the currency markets, typical in times of uncertainty,  said Andrew Hodge, analyst at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.  </P> <P> The dollar inched up to 153.93 yen in New York, from 153.49 Tuesday.COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Crude Oil Futures Continue to Slump  </P> <P> Prices of energy futures were mixed in trading on the New York Mercantile  Exchange as crude oil futures continued their plunge in a market plagued by  oversupply.  </P> <P> On other markets, grain and soybean prices were mixed, precious metals were  higher, copper declined and livestock and pork futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Heavy selling of the expiring July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the  benchmark grade of crude oil, weighed on the energy market, analysts said.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude settled 35 cents lower to 14 cents higher, with  the July contract at $15.30 a barrel; heating oil was 0.03 to 0.21 cent higher,  with July at 47.64 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> The decline in crude prices came in the wake of American Petroleum Institute  figures showing that U.S. crude inventories last week declined by 1.2 million  barrels to 384.4 million. Despite the decline, crude stocks remain 44.3 million  barrels above last year's level, analysts said.  </P> <P> "There is too much pumped crude for the refineries to handle," said James  Fiedler, an analyst with E. D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. in New  York.  </P> <P> There was some uncertainty in the market because of a shake-up in the Kuwaiti  government. Longtime oil minister Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah was removed,  and speculation centered on whether his successor will push more strongly for  OPEC to cut production and raise oil prices.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D7.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FED REPORT RELEASED  </P> <P> The central bank reinforced a belief that interest rates won't be lowered soon.

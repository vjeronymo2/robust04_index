			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / French Socialists look to an uncertain future 'THE Left lives, and it can win again,' Mr Michel Rocard, the French Socialist leader, yesterday told cheering delegates at the party's first conference since its crushing defeat in the March elections. It was also the first time the Socialists had convened a meeting of their Etats Generaux, a term from pre-revolutionary France in which citizens met to present their grievances to the king - in this case, the Socialist leadership. So great is his distance from the party, and from Mr Rocard, that the absentee President Francois Mitterrand did not even send the Lyons gathering a message of support. But there was little echo of Mr Rocard's pre-election call in February for a 'big bang' recomposition of the French left, with the possibility of the Socialists merging with environmentalists and moderate Communists in a new party to confront the massive parliamentary majority behind Mr Edouard Balladur's government. One left-wing Socialist leader called on Saturday for a Red-Pink-Green coalition, but the election has fractured the Greens and given the Communists enough seats to want to continue on their own. The Socialists have also ruled out changing their party's name. Ironically, some of the Lyons delegates, who were not paid up party members but billed as 'sympathisers', reproached the Socialists for being too timid to emblazon the Eurexpo conference centre with the party's traditional symbol of a red rose in a clenched fist. In his concluding speech, Mr Rocard suggested the Socialists should hold regular Etats Generaux, acknowledging that in 10 years of power the party had become cut off from its grass roots and from the French electorate. Over the three-day convention, the party leadership was accused of ignoring unemployment, of being arrogant and sometimes corrupt, and of factional warfare. Mr Rocard himself became the party's provisional head in early April by ousting Mr Laurent Fabius as party secretary. These two former prime ministers represent two of the many different 'currents' in the party, the result of a proportional representation system which was originally designed to foster pluralism of ideas but which has long since degenerated into warring clans centred around rival candidates for the presidency. This proportional system is unique to France, commented Mr Axel Hanisch, secretary general of European socialist parties, who addly acidly that 'no one else in Europe wants to copy it'. The powerful socialist federations of the Nord-Pas de Calais region want to move towards a majority voting system inside the party, which would at this stage consolidate Mr Rocard's hold on the party and his chance of being its presidential candidate in 1995. But such reform, and formal election of a new leadership, will be left to the party's regular conference in October. On the key relationship of jobs and trade, Mr Rocard distanced the party from the overt protectionism that is growing inside the Balladur government. Mr Rocard urged that Gatt participants should commit themselves to conventions of the International Labour Organisation, and so raise their standards. 'We should not stop importing the products of other countries,' he said. 'Rather, we should export our demands for basic economic and social rights.' From the brake to the accelerator, Page 11</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT A SAFEHOUSE IN IRAQ: HOLIDAY AND HEARTACHE  </P> <P> A few highs and many lows have passed in the more than three months that  Americans have been held hostage in Iraq, and Wednesday, the eve of  Thanksgiving, was a time for reflection.  </P> <P> At a diplomatic compound near the Tigris River, where an undisclosed number of  American men have taken shelter, the mood was somber. Their thoughts were  concentrated on their families and more than 100 of their compatriots held  captive at potential military targets under Iraqi guard.  </P> <P> Today, the Baghdad hostages will share a turkey dinner around a refectory table  in the dining room and on the veranda. The U.S. Embassy supplied the bird, a  reporter brought in the makings for pumpkin pie, and other traditional side  dishes have been procured by the resourceful detainees.  </P> <P> A television crew has delivered a videotape of this month's UCLA-Washington  football game. The hostages have all the trappings, but it's not home.  </P> <P> "We want to thank our countrymen for their great and undying support for those  of us that are in this miserable predicament," said Roland Bergheer, 62, a Los  Angeles-reared consultant who speaks as the press liaison for the group.  </P> <P> Bergheer, a tall, white-bearded man wearing an open-necked dress shirt and  jaunty green-checked slacks, was sitting beside a swimming pool with two  visiting reporters. His fellow hostages remained indoors. The strain of the  last few months has led them to let Bergheer handle the press. He figured that  most of them would agree with his words although he said he was speaking for  himself.  </P> <P> "This," he said of captivity without any bars -- except the ultimate cage,  denial of the right to leave Iraq -- "is the most degrading experience I've  ever been through. I'm being held at someone else's whim. I never expected  this.  </P> <P> "It strips a man of his dignity. I really don't like to be a pawn for someone  to play with."  </P> <P> Bergheer scanned the house, the pool and the comfortable grounds, overlooked by  the homes of a high-ranking Iraqi military officer and a prominent eye surgeon,  and said:  </P> <P> "It really doesn't matter that we can walk around, smell the roses, take a  swim. We're suffering."  </P> <P> At this safehouse, most of the Americans are from the South, the Midwest and  the Pacific Coast states. The average age is about 40. A number of the men,  including Bergheer, were working on a big petrochemical project when the Iraqis  closed the door on them in the weeks following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Bergheer was living at the Sheraton Hotel when the call came from the embassy  urging him to seek diplomatic sanctuary. "I just started packing," he recalled.  </P> <P> At first, some of the men brought their wives and children into the compound  for safety. When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was persuaded to let the  dependents leave, it became an all-male sanctuary -- about 50 initially, fewer  now that some have been permitted to leave on medical or humanitarian grounds.  </P> <P> Departures are difficult moments. "We have a brotherhood here," said Bergheer.  "When someone gets out, a lot of hands help with the packing. For a day or so  afterward, many of the men tend to stay in the rooms, taking a little private  space."  </P> <P> He and other Americans figure they will be the last to leave if Hussein holds  to his pledge to free all foreign hostages over a three-month period beginning  Christmas Day.  </P> <P> In the meantime, they pass their days reading, watching videos and keeping up  the house and grounds. "Boring," said a hostage passer-by at the interview.  </P> <P> News comes via the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corp. Old  magazines, even newspapers, brought in by visitors to Baghdad are scoured. The  embassy has instituted a newsletter for the men with sports scores, news  capsules and a crossword puzzle.  </P> <P> Household duties are performed according to a rotating roster, and all  decisions concerning the operation of the safehouse are made collegially at  daily meetings.  </P> <P> Bergheer, who delivers the latest news from the embassy, says there is no  command structure among the men. But, senior in age, he clearly has stature and  seems comfortable speaking for the hostages.  </P> <P> He has led an adventuresome life -- merchant sailor at 16 during World War II,  the Air Force during the Korean War, then back to the merchant marine as an  officer and on to private life with steamship companies in San Francisco and  Portland, Ore. After a brief retirement, he felt the itch to go abroad again  and worked in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates before taking the job  here, piling up nearly a decade of service in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Now divorced with four children and five grandchildren, Bergheer attended  Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles as a young refugee from Nazi Germany.  His brother, Karl, is a developer and lives in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Bergheer is a key contact between the embassy and his fellow hostages,  attending the news briefings given by U.S. Charge d'Affaires Joseph C. Wilson  IV. There is a mutual respect between the two men.  </P> <P> "I'm extremely fond of Joe Wilson," said Bergheer. "He's the type of American  that simply does not like to get pushed around."  </P> <P> Wilson, in a rare on-the-record interview for Thanksgiving, detailed the  embassy efforts on behalf of the hostages, particularly those to force their  release.  </P> <P> "We trying to get the Iraqis to behave according to international conventions,"  he explained, saying he is in regular touch with the Iraqi Foreign Ministry  "from the highest level" to press his case.  </P> <P> "We have pointed out repeatedly that these people should be released" and  should never have been held in the first place, he said.  </P> <P> Each case presents a problem. Wilson said the wife of one of the Americans held  at strategic sites had died and, forbidden direct access to the so-called  "special guests," he could not get word to the husband. He wrote a letter and  gave it to the Foreign Ministry to deliver. "I have no idea whether my letter  has reached the man," Wilson said, underlining the isolation of the hostages.  </P> <P> There is evidence that living conditions are improving slightly at the sites,  he said. Some of the hostages have been permitted to call their families.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the embassy personnel have begun a pen-pal program with the the  so-called human shields, writing to them via the Iraqis and "trying to develop  a personal rapport," said Wilson. Those ties are important to America's ranking  diplomat here, who will spend his Thanksgiving over turkey with the young  single men of the embassy staff, primarily the Marine guards.  </P> <P> An easygoing man with a sharp wit and a tart tongue, Wilson, who has headed the  embassy since the invasion, has won a few victories. More than one has taken  place at Saddam International Airport, with Wilson and Iraqi officials going  toe-to-toe over what categories of American-connected women and children  seeking refuge from Kuwait should be allowed to leave for the States.  </P> <P> "It was like two attorneys in a lawsuit, in the litigation phase before a  trial," he recalled. "When I have to be tough, I have not shied away from some  pretty strong language."  </P> <P> Generally, he said, his relations with Iraqi officials are "good, considering  we're sort of sworn enemies."  </P> <P> The hostages are his main concern. While crediting them with being "very  self-reliant," the embassy keeps a diplomat at the compound "24 hours a day,  with a diplomatic passport if there's a need to deal with any outside problem."  Wilson himself attends the compound meetings once a week.  </P> <P> And the hostages respond.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of technical experts out there," he said. "I asked one of them  to put a new stereo in the ambassador's car so I can listen to Waylon Jennings  on my way to the Foreign Ministry.  </P> <P> "They provide me with a hell of a lot of personal support."  </P> <P> Wilson and Bergheer say they are working toward the same goal with no  intentions of making any deals along the way.  </P> <P> "When I walk out of here, I want to walk out ramrod straight," the hostage  said. "My pride intact, my honor as an American."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PRICE HIKES CAUSED CANCELLATION OF JET DEAL, CHINA SAYS  </P> <P> China says that it canceled a huge deal with Grumman Corp. to modernize its jet  fighters because the company raised its prices.  </P> <P> The Defense Department said last Tuesday that Beijing had pulled out of the  deal, under which Grumman would have modernized 55 of China's F-8 fighters with  cockpit electronics and targeting radar.  </P> <P> Estimated at $502 million, it would have been the biggest U.S.-Chinese military  deal.  </P> <P> "The project to renovate the F-8 fighters can no longer proceed according to  the original agreement now, simply owing to the considerable increase of prices  by the U.S. side," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday.  </P> <P> Work under the deal had already been blocked by the current U.S. ban on arms  sales to China, imposed in reaction to Beijing's bloody crackdown on dissent  last June.  </P> <P> China gave no indication of the size of Grumman's price increase, nor did it  comment on speculation by military analysts that China would look elsewhere for  advanced cockpit technology.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy in Beijing declined to comment, except to say cost overruns on  military projects were common.  </P> <P> China's cash flow has worsened since last June because of a freeze on Western  government credits.  </P></p>

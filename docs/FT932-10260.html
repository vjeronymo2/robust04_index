			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Management: Wooing the customer - The Citizen's Charter Public services and companies that responded to the launch of the British government's Citizen's Charter initiative last year have reported mixed results from their efforts. This partly reflects the fact that elements of the Citizen's Charter are still coming into effect. Earlier this year for example, British Rail's Network SouthEast gave its first discounts to last year's delayed season ticket-holders. In addition, from the beginning of the year contractors have been obliged to explain why a road is being dug up and how long the work will take. From April, hospitals began to offer appointment and waiting-list guarantees. Private-service providers have jumped aboard the bandwagon, but they have been as prone to miscalculate the tone and content of their charters as the public sector. Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, set the ball rolling by asking the big four clearing banks to introduce charters for their business customers. Their response came in the form of modest promises. However, the banks' image was so tarnished by the time their charters came out that they were dismissed by many customers. They promised too much and were not believed. Just as bad is to promise too little. This is where many public-sector organisations fall short. They hedge their promises. British Rail asks for its customers' views, but only on comparatively trivial matters such as station cleanliness and staff behaviour. Its lntercity standards employ such sophistry that the public has no benchmark by which they can measure performance. Perceptive companies, however, see there is a competitive advantage to be gained from customer charters. 'The big banks had charters forced upon them and this has coloured people's views,' says Ian Farnfield, a partner at Dragon International, a marketing consultancy that has advised companies on preparing charters. 'But they should be viewed as a positive opportunity.' With any charter it is crucial to avoid promising what people do not really want. Payment of an average of Pounds 1.50 - the cost of one journey - from London Underground is poor compensation for a business meeting missed. So is Pounds 10 from British Gas for a broken appointment. BAA (formerly British Airports Authority) tried giving monetary vouchers to compensate for long queues, but soon stopped when research showed the policy to be counter-productive. 'People didn't really want to know if we had queue time limits because they thought we might not be checking security efficiently,' explains Jenny Bradley, director of public affairs at Heathrow Airport. On the other hand, a commitment to provide for free something that occasionally comes at a price can make a good impression - such as Shell's pledge promising free air and water at its petrol stations. Farnfield advises businesses not to issue charters if they do not have the support of both top management and the 'shop-floor' staff who are in contact with the public. Many companies have always had internal codes of practice, but saw no mileage in making them public. But more industries may soon hop aboard the customer charter bandwagon. Dragon International believes businesses with the potential to benefit include those where the customer is obliged to trust a more expert supplier, such as pharmaceuticals, the building industry and personal financial services.</p>

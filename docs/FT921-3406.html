			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading UNCERTAINTY about the election, compounded by rumours of a surge in support for the Labour party, sent stock index futures lower, writes Christopher Price. The March contract opened at 2,489, its high point of the day, and then began drifting down. A small squeeze prompted a minor rally shortly before midday, but was soon replaced by renewed nervous trading and further weakness. A strong Wall Street opening restored some buoyancy in the afternoon, but news that the weekend press would show Labour with a 6-point lead in the opinion polls sent values spiralling down. The market, which had been at a discount to fair value most of the day, closed at 2,467, down 22 on the previous session and at a 12 point discount to its three point fair value premium. Turnover was a healthy 8,776 contracts. A busy after hours market saw an additional 3,000 traded and the March contract slip further to 2,464. In the traded options market, there were 25,405 contracts traded, with half of those in the FT-SE 100 and Euro FT-SE options. Lonrho was the busiest stock option at 3,430 traded, with the March 130 particularly busy.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: EFG up to Pounds 804,000 and sees profit for full year EFG, the garden leisure and horticultural products company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 804,000 for the 26 weeks to August 1. That compared with losses of Pounds 1.19m, restated to take account of a Pounds 1.22m extraordinary charge being reclassified in accordance with the FRS 3 standard. However, the company warned that because of the seasonality of its products it was likely to show a loss in the second half, although the year as a whole should be profitable. The shares rose 2p to 14 1/2 p. Turnover declined to Pounds 10m (Pounds 13.7m). Net interest payable fell from Pounds 281,000 to Pounds 148,000. Earnings per share were 3p, against losses of 7.4p. Net borrowings at August 1 were Pounds 1.28m for gearing of 18 per cent. Borrowings, which stood at Pounds 5.35m at January 31, were reduced by the rights issue, which formed part of the restructuring. Borrowings have been further cut since the end of the period by asset sales, which have raised Pounds 1.33m.</p>

"The Trend of North Korean Economy for the Second Half of  1993," released by the National Unification Board [NUB] on 28  February revealed that agricultural production in North Korea  showed a 15 to 20 percent decrease from the previous year due to  damage by cold weather; and the mining and construction  industries maintained only the production level of the previous  year due to supply shortages of energy and raw materials.    Cho Kon-sik, an intelligence analysis officer in the NUB,  said that "the plant operation rate in North Korea last year  remained merely 40 percent of that in 1992, thus showing no  improvement. This level is very close to the lowest productivity  limit in North Korea. Therefore, we may say that the North  Korean economy has achieved no more than 'zero-point growth,' no  matter how generously one may evaluate the situation."    Viewing the result of North Korean external trade, it is  true  that trade with China has increased. However, trade with Russia  and Japan decreased. As a result, the trade amount remained  $2.7 billion--the level of 1992.    According to a latest statistic of the Korea Trade Promotion  Corporation, North Korea's export of steel, iron, and cement to  China was very active, while its import of grains and oil  drastically increased, thus marking a trade amount of $90  million -- a 29.2 percent increase from the previous year.    Meanwhile, border trade of daily necessities has been brisk  between small-scale businessmen and local governments in North  Korean-Chinese border areas. Such trade amounted to  approximately $70 million last year.    As North Korea has not been able to overcome such economic  difficulties, it applied laws and regulations pertaining to the  opening of Najin and Sonbong free economy and trade zone, and  has now launched full-scale economic cooperation with China.    Nevertheless, North Korea still tightly controls its  citizens, counter to the policy of opening. As a result, two  contradictory situations, namely "opening" and "maintaining the  system," coexist in North Korea.    In fact, North Korea concluded 11 agreements on economic  cooperation with China, Cambodia, and Finland during the second  half of last year.    Taking a step forward from merely receiving Chinese trade  investment delegations, North Korea dispatched a Nampo municipal  trade delegation on 11 October; a Chonjin municipal friendship  delegation on 1 December; and a North Hamgyong Provincial  economic delegation on 13 December, to three provinces in the  northeast China and to Yonbyon autonomous district, thus showing  the active will for opening.    It is believed that North Korea's positiveness in opening  will gradually become more visible with the ultimate change in  the political situation, including the inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency and progress in the  North-South dialogue.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAX MAN MCPHERSON BRINGS OPENING NIGHT TO LIFE  </P> <P> Saxophonist Charles McPherson kicked a sputtering rhythm section to life and  turned in a solid opening-night performance last week at Elario's.  </P> <P> McPherson, the San Diego alto man raised on be-bop, is fronting a crew of  locals, including special guest Peter Sprague on guitar, through Sunday.  </P> <P> The opening set last Wednesday included several smoking Charlie Parker  standards, plus a couple of slow tunes and a new piece by McPherson.  </P> <P> In search of perfection, the sax man strolled into the audience several times  to check the sound. That gave Sprague, who first recorded with McPherson more  than 10 years ago, plenty of room to shine. And shine he did, unleashing a  barrage of licks that showed his increasing maturity.  </P> <P> Sprague was more than up to the fast bop paces McPherson put the band through  on several tunes. McPherson lit into Charlie Parker's "Bloomdido," and he  quickly displayed the solid tone he recently described as "a compact sound with  a good core, with a little bit of buzz around it." It cuts like a knife, even  with its warm and fuzzy edges.  </P> <P> The rhythm section of Gunnar Biggs on bass, Randy Porter on piano and Charles  McPherson Jr. on drums had trouble finding the groove on the Latin-flavored  "Tangerine." Papa McPherson showed lightning speed and musical inventiveness as  he turned out long lines of extemporaneous melody, but the inconsistent  rhythmic undercurrents dragged things down.  </P> <P> McPherson had promised to debut new material, and, with a wry smile, soon  introduced "Delusions, Contusions, Confusions, Illusions and Blue."  </P> <P> If this is indicative of the direction his work is taking, McPherson should  have a new recording contract soon. The sweet, slow number unfolded gracefully,  McPherson restating the musical theme each time in a slightly higher key,  punctuating the calm with occasional funky honks. The haunting mood was  reminiscent of saxophonist Wayne Shorter's mid-'60s work.  </P> <P> McPherson seems to have succeeded where others have failed, writing music that  could reach a broad audience without dipping into bubble gum territory.  </P> <P> With "Confirmation," another Parker tune, the band started to hit its stride.  An especially nice section came with Sprague soloing as McPherson and Biggs  doubled up on background harmonies.  </P> <P> Sprague eased into the standard "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" by himself, softly  finger-picking the melody and chords. As the rhythm section faded in, it became  obvious that Porter seems most comfortable with these slow ballads.  </P></p>

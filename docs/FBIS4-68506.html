			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Delyagin, chief of the applied analysis </F> service under the Institute of Economic Problems of the  Transition Period: "Foreign Investment Goes Into Inefficient  Sectors"]    [Text] The flow of foreign capital into Russia is limited  today not only by the presence of high political and economic  risks, but also to a considerable extent by the opposition of  forces striving to prevent competition in the domestic market.    According to the Russian Federation Goskomstat [State  Committee on Statistics], in 1993 foreign investment in the  Russian economy amounted to $2.9 billion (including $2.6 billion  in direct investment, which includes the right to participate in  managing the enterprise). The regions that have been most  attractive for foreign investors are Moscow, where 26.2 percent  of all money has been invested; Krasnoyarsk Kray--14.2 percent;  Omsk Oblast--8.1 percent; Arkhangelsk Oblast--7.9 percent;  Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast--5.9 percent; the Republic of Mari  El--5.0 percent; Belgorod Oblast--4.1 percent; and the Komi  Republic--3.6 percent. No official statistical data has been  reported on the placement of the remaining 25 percent of  investment in 69 regions of Russia.    Looking at the territorial aspect of placement, one notices  the absence among the leaders of such seemingly attractive  territories as Tyumen Oblast, as well as the industrial part of  the Urals and Volga economic regions.    A high degree of development in these regions is combined  with an urgent need for a flow of capital into the modernization  and reorientation of production. However, foreign capital is in  no hurry to meet this need, and the only reasonable explanation  for this phenomenon is the existence of restrictions of a  noneconomic nature caused by the desire of some local producers  to preserve a monopoly on management and not allow competition  on the part of the world market.    Aspirations of this kind are not always unjustified from the  standpoint of the interests of the state. Suffice it to point  out the high ranking of Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast, which is  poorly developed in every respect. A considerable part of  foreign investment in this territory is a graphic example of  Chinese capital making inroads in the Russian border zone.    The structure of foreign investment by sector is much more  interesting than by region. According to Goskomstat, of the  total volume, the following has been invested in:    --machine building and metalworking--23.2 percent;    --fuel industry--16.3 percent;    --trade and public catering--15.2 percent;    --construction--5.3 percent;    --woodworking and pulp and paper industry--4.5 percent;    --construction material industry--3.8 percent.    Goskomstat does not report on the distribution of the  remaining 31 percent of investment; indirect sources indicate a  rather considerable investment of foreign capital in the  production of various consumer goods.    A comparison of the structure of attracted foreign  investment  with available data on the structural restructuring of the  Russian economy leads to certain conclusions.    The most promising sector today is the fuel industry. As a  result of lesser price disproportions as compared to those that  existed in the centrally planned economy, we now can judge the  significance of some or other sector by industrial  statistics--the share of its production in the total volume of  industrial production expressed in current prices. For the fuel  industry this indicator reached 17.5 percent in 1993, but this  is an understatement since it is an export-oriented sector and  world prices for its output are considerably higher than  domestic ones.    Meanwhile, in the volume of foreign investment the fuel  industry ranks only second, while first--and with a considerable  lead at that--is machine building and metalworking. The  inefficiency of this group of sectors has led to a situation  whereby they were damaged most by the development of market  relations. The proportional share of machine building and  metalworking has dropped over the period of reform by five  percentage points, but because of considerable state support and  thanks to an insignificant--for Russia--gap between domestic and  world prices, still remains very high (20.3 percent of  industrial production in 1993).    Currently it is precisely machine-building and metalworking  enterprises that are hurting most from the distribution crisis  and are the least competitive. Nevertheless, this particular  sphere, which overall does not have favorable prospects, is  attracting the greatest attention of foreign investors.    A similar situation exists in another pair of sectors. The  woodworking and pulp and paper industry, whose presence in the  economy has dropped by 1.7 percentage points (which is quite a  lot considering that its share in industrial production in 1993  comprised 3.9 percent), has attracted considerably greater  attention on the part of foreign investors than the construction  materials industry, which has increased its share in production  by 0.2 points--to 3.3 percent.    There is one single visible cause: The sectors that are  increasing their significance in the Russian economy (which in  an environment of overall production decline does not preclude a  drop in their output), are strong enough not to let foreign  capital in, so they do not have to share control over their  enterprises. Those sectors, however, where the situation is  becoming critical, and where their very survival is already at  issue, are relinquishing control for the sake of  self-preservation.    As a result, the sectors that are accessible to foreign  investors are those undergoing serious difficulties.    This has its positive side, since foreign capital provides  nourishment for those who need it most.    The problem is that, as the development of oil production  shows, our monopolists have a tendency to keep out potential  competition even in circumstances where they are unable on their  own to sustain not only development but even mere maintenance of  the sector at a normal level. They prefer to count on state  support, the probability (let alone expediency) of which is in  serious doubt, but which does not hold the threat of either  competition or of losing sole control over production for the  current monopolists.</p>

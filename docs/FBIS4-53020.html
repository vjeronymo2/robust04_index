			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il received a letter from Min Su-yong, a four-year-old  girl of the Kuchon kindergarten, Sariwon city, the seat of North  Hwanghae Province near Pyongyang, and sent the following  autographic letter to her:    "I hope you will become a good student.    April 27, 1994    Kim Chong-il"    In her letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il Min Su-yong said:    "Dear leader, I have appeared on TV twice because I was good  at composition, word contest and diary writing.    "My kindergartener felt very proud of this, saying if I  appeared on TV, the dear leader would be pleased to see me.    "So, I have dreamed of being received by you. And I am going  to keep diaries in a fair handwriting in the hope of having them  read by you."    Min Su-yong is very inquisitive and has a good memory. She  began to read books and learn composition from the age of 3.    In compliance with the party's intention to systematically  educate children with rare aptitude and talent, the Kuchon  kindergarten taught the three-year-old girl how to read and  write the mother tongue in various forms and ways. It also  taught the girl with keen observation and imagination how to  properly see and judge things.    With her composition capacity increasing gradually, she was  able to write to Yi In-mo, the incarnation of the faith and  will, and to soldiers of the People's Army and kept diaries  fairly, deeply impressing people.    Upon receiving the autographic letter of Comrade Kim  Chong-il, Min Su-yong vowed to study hard with brothers and  sisters and become a good little writer.</p>

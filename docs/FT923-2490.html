			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Austria moves to end anonymous accounts THE Austrian government will raise its withholding tax on savings and dividends next year to approximately 20 per cent, in a move that is intended to clear the way for outlawing the country's controversial anonymous bank accounts. The accounts are an embarrassment to Austria, as they have been used for laundering drug money. However, they are a politically sensitive issue within the country where virtually everyone uses them to avoid paying high rates of tax on their savings. The government has tolerated the situation by claiming a flat 10 per cent withholding tax on all savings account balances. Individuals are still supposed to declare their savings and, in cases where the tax payable would be higher than the withholding tax, they remain liable for it. The government hopes the withholding tax on savings will gradually make people less nervous about having to identify themselves as the owners of savings accounts. Negotiations on the fine points have not yet been completed. Some officials believe that the higher withholding tax must also displace inheritance taxes if it is to succeed in removing people's anxieties. The country has to outlaw anonymous accounts as part of its obligations on joining the European Economic Area next year.</p>

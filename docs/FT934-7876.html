			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / People: Work for economist Despite his periods at Essex University and the London School of Economics in the late 1960's, James Robertson's career has taken a most unrevolutionary path as a civil service economist. This is just as well because on Monday he will take over as the new chief economist at the Employment Department. Robertson replaces Pam Meadows, who has left to become director of the Policy Studies Institute. Robertson, 44, joined the civil service as an Employment Department economist in 1975. He has since worked in the Department of Energy; headed the Regional Economics Branch in the DTI; and after a brief spell in the Department of Transport he rejoined the DTI as head of Industrial and Regional Economics and Statistics. His promotion to under secretary, with a staff of 100, will not come as a surprise to people who have worked with him. 'He has always seemed a young man in a hurry', says a colleague. And there may be some political logic to his move, in the light of continuing discussion of a merger between the DTI and the Employment Department. 'I welcome the opportunity to draw closer links between the two departments. You cannot look at labour markets in isolation from product markets,' says Robertson.</p>

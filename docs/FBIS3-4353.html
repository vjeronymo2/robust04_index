Shen Guofang, a spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry, said  this to reporters yesterday [28 March] after talks between  President Kim Yong-sam and PRC President Jiang Zemin. He  clarified that China has no intention of pressuring North Korea  on the nuclear issue, saying that China has made efforts in its  own way, but the role it can play is restricted and that, since  North Korea is a sovereign country, no other country is in the  position of telling or requiring it to do anything.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Helena Tachinardi in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Upon meeting with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister  Phan Van Khai on 24 June, Brazilian Foreign Celso Amorim  announced that Brazil and Vietnam will sign a framework trade,  economic, scientific, and technological cooperation agreement by  the end of 1994.    The Brazilian Government is also requesting that Vietnam  agree to the appointment of Italo Zappa as the Brazilian  ambassador to Hanoi. President Franco has already authorized the  opening of an embassy in Vietnam.    Since late last year, Vietnam has expressed interest in  expanding its relations with Brazil. Vietnam sent Deputy  Foreign Minister Le Mai first, and then Van Khai. In return,  Itamaraty sent a trade delegation to Hanoi in April.    On 23 June, Khai visited Sao Paulo to hold talks with  representatives of Maxion [agricultural machinery manufacturer],  the CBPO [Companhia Brasileira de Projetos Obras] construction  firm, the Odebrecht construction group, the Brazilian  Agribusiness Association (ABAG), Ericsson [manufacturer of  telecommunications and lighting equipment], Braspetro [Petrobras  International Inc.], Baldan, and Marchezan [manufacturers of  agricultural equipment]. Vietnam is interested in purchasing  agricultural machinery, including harvesters.    Representatives of leading Brazilian construction companies  attended a luncheon hosted at Itamaraty for Phan Van Khai. The  Vietnamese market is potentially significant for Brazilian firms  that are already established in Southeast Asia. The "chairman"  of the Chinese company that is building the Three Gorges  hydroelectric plant, the largest in the world, will arrive in  Brazil on 4 July. Brazilian construction firms could form a  consortium to participate in the Chinese project.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / TUC marshals cash for adverts The Trades Union Congress is co-ordinating a Pounds 100,000 advertising campaign to urge voters in next week's European parliamentary elections to back candidates who support the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. The advertisements are being paid for by unions which have political funds but are not affiliated to the Labour party. The bulk of the campaign's finance is from Unison, the public service union. Another important contributor is the IRSF, the tax officers' union. The TUC said last night that the unions involved were not calling on voters to back Labour or any other political party. It said Britain was alone among European Union countries in opposing legal rights which made 'workers safer, more secure and more effective at work'. The campaign is aimed at women voters. It suggests that the government is opposing 10 ways under EU legislation to protect and improve the conditions of female workers. The TUC said: 'We are not endorsing Labour but we are saying that the views of candidates on the social chapter ought to be of paramount importance on who people vote for. 'We would expect all Labour candidates to back the social chapter. We think most Liberal Democrats probably would. We think some Conservatives might, despite the party's official line at national level. We don't know the attitude of the Greens, the nationalists and the other parties in the election.' The TUC has taken legal advice to avoid any charge by government ministers that unions are interfering in the European elections and misusing their political funds for that purpose. The TUC co-ordinated a similar campaign during the 1989 European parliamentary elections, when it urged voters to vote for candidates who backed workers' rights.</p>

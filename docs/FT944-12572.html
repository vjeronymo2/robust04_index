			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television If you have not seen The Crying Game, with which Channel 4 begins a new season of 'Film Premiere', and if you still do not know about the twist in the plot (I was taken entirely by surprise) it is worth watching. Not that it is as good a movie as they thought in the US where it won the Oscar for best screenplay. Americans confuse America's fight for independence with the activities of Irish terrorists so that the IRA becomes a right-on organisation on their side of the Atlantic. Still, this odd story of a black soldier from the British Army who is held hostage by the IRA and asks one of his captors to look after his lover back in London, does have an unusual sense of style (10.00). The last episode in BBC2's likeable drama series about mental patients, Takin' Over The Asylum (pity about that dropped 'g') clashes with C4's superior culture series, Without Walls. Today this includes an attack on television news values and what sounds like a mick-take of 'The Late Show' (known here as 'The Night Show') where they are trying to interview a chap called Shakespeare about one of his plays (9.00).</p>

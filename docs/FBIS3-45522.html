According to statistics by the Ministry of Labour, the  number  of unemployed receiving unemployment relief between January and  October last year were more than 700,000, more than the total  for the previous seven years after the establishment of the  unemployment insurance system.    The official of the Ministry of Labour said that the reason  for this increase in numbers last year was due to the widening  of the range of people receiving such relief and the increasing  number of people leaving their former employment.    Up until now, 70.4 million workers from 470,000 state-owned  entities have taken part in the unemployment insurance scheme as  have also workers in collectively owned enterprises in some  places.    According to the scheme on reform of social insurance worked  out by relevant departments, unemployment insurance will  gradually cover all kinds of labourers in cities and towns in  the country. At present, the unemployment insurance funds and  the insurance mechanism for the unemployed must be brought into  full utilization and the activities of job-training,  job-introduction and the issuance of relief for production must  be carried out in an active way. The basic rights and interests  of workers must be guaranteed in the process of reform.</p>

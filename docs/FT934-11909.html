			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Delors bloodied but unbowed MR Jacques Delors will not be drinking champagne today. He expects little from the special EC mini-summit, and accepts that the battle for faster European political and economic integration has been lost, at least for now. Recent visitors to Mr Delors' office report that the president of the European Commission seems less moody, more at ease with himself, almost philosophical as he heads towards the end of a 10-year career. He has been praised as the architect of the single market, but condemned as the engineer of a self-destructing timetable for European monetary union. However, one reason for the president's apparent serenity is that his magnum opus - the White Book on employment, competitiveness and growth - is in its final stages. It will be Mr Delors' Last Hurrah at the EC summit in December. Friends say he is close to resolving the challenge of reconciling his support for the European model of the welfare state and the need to reform Europe's labour markets. With just over a year more in office, Mr Delors sees the White Book as providing the framework for European countries to take the difficult measures needed to restore competitiveness, create jobs, and catch up with the US and Asia. Friends say that Mr Delors has no regrets about his drive to force the pace of political and monetary integration on the back of the single market. But he realises that the battle has been lost, for now. An Anglo-French alliance buried federalist-minded plans for a common Europe security and foreign policy at the Maastricht conference table; and the Bundesbank put paid to Emu, at least in the short-term. Above all, the recession has encouraged the president to re-examine some of his assumptions about the pace of European integration and his place in contemporary history. Some of his conclusions are unexpected. Mr Delors now believes, for example, that a Gatt world trade agreement by December 15 is in France's interests. Naturally, there are caveats about fair deals for French farmers. But he recently warned his fellow Frenchmen to snap out of their 'national psychodrama' and to avoid retreating behind a modern-day Maginot Line, the ineffective defence system built between the world wars to keep out the Germans. On a personal note, Mr Delors has realised how much authority he lost within the Commission as a result of his feud with Mr Ray MacSharry, the Irish commissioner responsible for agriculture. His support for Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, has been more clear-cut. If Mr Delors has a regret, it is how his views on Europe have been caricatured in Britain, most recently at the Conservative party conference where he was once again cast as the demon socialist/centralist. This week, he was roughed up by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, at a meeting of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg. Aides predict that Mr Delors will launch a campaign of TV and press appearances in the UK, in the hope of setting the record straight. Friends say that Mr Delors detects an intellectual vacuum within the British government led by Mr John Major. This is what most disappointed him about the prime minister's recent article in the Economist on Europe. Mr Delors cannot resist a debate among equals. You guessed it: he really does miss Lady Thatcher. High hurdles if you're not fit, page 17</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Bawden's Days of the Hawk - Concert Not enough people notice the BBC Symphony's season of concerts in the Maida Vale Studios. They are thoroughly prepared and recorded for future broadcasts, but free to their live audiences (you need only apply to the Radio Ticket Unit). Much of what they offer is out-of-the-way, in one way or another, or often brand new. On Wednesday, for example, we had 35-year-old Rupert Bawden conducting the premieres of two of his own choral works, flanked by Bartok pieces and with Berio's Chemins III in the middle. The choice of the Chemins  - a mini-concerto for viola, Berio's second expansion of his Sequenza for viola alone  - may have been prompted by Bawden's being a violist himself. (He used to be a familiar face among the strings in various modernist ensembles.) This was the first time I had heard him conduct. His excellent soloist scrubbed and buzzed away as her part requires, but the multi-levelled orchestral commentary, sprouting off in all directions from the central role, sounded opaque, too much of a muchness. Four of Bartok's choral folksong arrangements, beautiful but technically difficult, were delivered cleanly by the BBC Singers. In the same composer's Dance Suite, Bawden secured the right pungent, vociferous instrumental colours, but only a modicum of its rhythmic drive. As also in the Folksongs, there was too little electricity to carry across the sudden pauses and suspensions. (His 'body language', as they say, looks stiff still, and my companion remarked upon his unfocussed up-beat.) It may be that in other hands, Bawden's new The Days of the Hawk  - a BBC commission  - would reveal a more urgent, forward-leaning profile than it showed here. At 22 minutes long, it needed that; and yet it had other virtues that made their mark. The basis of the piece is a poetic rhapsody on, or after, a fraught episode from an Arab epic (narrated over the initial music). Against a background of orchestral whispers, deep-struck basses, solo phrases like the cries of birds, the chorus intones the text with quiet fervour. Mostly in close-knit lines and regular, even notes: the effect is more of incantation than of dramatic expression. The atmosphere is consistently sustained, and palpably, tantalisingly 'exotic' in a way that echoes, say, early Roussel or Florent Schmitt. In the absence of any sharply defined development, however  - as far as one could hear  - the piece began to seem becalmed midway through, the choral part too mild and steady to register much more than modest peaks of intensity. I imagine that more was intended.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): London Tube workers vote to strike SUPERVISORS and booking clerks on London Underground have voted to strike over cuts of up to 1,800 jobs and changes in working practices, even though the organisation says it will suspend any employee who takes part in industrial action. The ballot held by the TSSA white-collar union will be followed next week by the result of a ballot about the same issue by 13,000 members of the RMT transport union working on London Underground. The RMT has threatened a series of one-day strikes after London Underground's refusal to negotiate on job losses and changes in working patterns which are intended to help reduce an anticipated loss of Pounds 92m. The dispute has broken out at the same time as annual pay talks at British Rail which resume today. The dispute threatens a repeat of the industrial action on London Underground in 1989 at the same time as an industrial dispute at British Rail. Mr Richard Rosser, TSSA general secretary, said supervisors and booking-office workers on London Underground did not have a history of taking industrial action. He hoped managers would realise the strength of feeling among workers. The TSSA has been upset both at the size of job losses and at the effect on earnings of changes in working patterns. London Underground has guaranteed no loss of earnings to staff for the first 18 months of the new rosters. TSSA members voted for strike action by 575 votes to 289, out of a total of 1,553 ballot papers. London Underground said this result was 'certainly not an example of a popular uprising'. The RMT yesterday released a briefing paper given to London Underground managers advising them of procedures for first warning and then suspending any staff who take part in industrial action if strikes are called. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the briefing paper was 'the action of a desperate, inadequate management' and was already rebounding on them by making workers more determined to vote for and take industrial action. Mr Knapp said the savings from single staffing of stations and reductions in overtime and weekend working would amount to only Pounds 400,000. The savings would have little effect on the expected loss even if they were implemented in full.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Confusion can be avoided in contracting out Sir, The debate about the protection of employee rights in contracting out public services, including your article, 'Lyell rejects ruling on EC jobs law' (January 22), is in danger of becoming too academic. There is confusion about the extent to which contractors must take the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations into account, but this is not the only area of law in which one can state principles fairly clearly but be unable to predict accurately every outcome. The case of Rask v ISS Kantineservice A/S has highlighted that the regulations could apply to contracting out and it reiterated criteria which could be used to help identify whether an entity is being transferred. This does not mean that the regulations will apply in all cases of contracting out. Rather than complain that that creates uncertainty or threaten in advance to litigate, those involved with contracting out could take into account what can be gleaned from the legal position. For instance, tender documents could refer to the criteria set out in Rask and give a view on each of them and on the application of the regulations generally. Consideration can be given to indemnities and to consultation, including with the unions, in advance of the final draft. There need not be the sense of confusion surrounding this subject, if the parties address the issues fully in advance.

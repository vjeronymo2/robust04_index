			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved back on to the offensive, climbing confidently back above 3,100 and wiping out most of the previous two days' losses, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract led the cash market for almost the whole of the session, the premium rarely dipping below 20 points and at times moving out to 25 points. Trading volume was slightly short of Wednesday's level, but dealers said their was a much better base to business, with a number of old faces putting in a reappearance. According to one trader, there were clear signs of Continental buying for the first time since mid-summer, with a number of sizeable Swiss and Austrian deals going through. The size and apparent durability of the premium over cash equities also triggered fair levels of arbitrage activity. At the official 4.10pm close the December contract stood at 3,118, up 21 points. The premium to the cash market was 16 points, or twice that of current fair value. Just about the only disappointment was the below average trading volume, with 10,868 contracts dealt, against 12,261 on Wednesday. Traded options turnover was also lower, dipping to 18,915 lots from 28,484. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume was just above 12,000 lots. British Airways was the busiest individual stock option, with 1,041 contracts dealt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- Radoman Bozovic,  chairman of the Chamber of Citizens, one of the two chambers of  the Yugoslav parliament, said on Tuesday that Serbian and  federal authorities were ready to discuss with the Albanian  minority from the Serbian Province of Kosovo and Metohija the  utilization of rights they have been given but were unwilling to  discuss the secession of this province from Serbia and the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Albanians in the Serbian  Province of Kosovo just as other national minorities in  Yugoslavia enjoy all civil rights in accordance with the highest  international standards, Bozovic told a seven-member Norwegian  parliamentary delegation, which is on a visit to Yugoslavia. As  it was announced the Norwegian parliamentarians were interested  about the state of human rights in the Serbian Province of  Kosovo and Metohija.    They assessed that it was in the interest of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia and Norway to solve this problem in a  peaceful manner, excluding all types of secession, and at the  same time expressed the stand that the realization of human  rights in general was being made difficult due to the  international sanctions against Yugoslavia.    At a separate meeting, the chairman of the Yugoslav  parliament's Board for Foreign Policy, Borisav Jovic, told the  Norwegian parliamentarians that the Albanians in Kosovo were not  using the given rights due to their blind obedience to  separatist organizations which are politically boycotting the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Under the influence of the  separatists, Kosovo Albanians were banning their children from  going to schools thought [as received] in their own language  according to the state educational program, Jovic noted. He  warned that the recognition of the Albanian separatism would  lead to unforeseable chaos in Europe and to war in the Balkans.  Jovic said that Europe's hugest contribution would be to  convince the separatists in Kosovo that the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia was their state and that Europe would not stand  behind them if they wished to tear this state. Jovic pointed  out that not a single party in the federal parliament approves  of separatist behaviour in Kosovo.    The Norwegian parliamentarians are to stay in Yugoslavia  until February 6 and are to visit the Kosovo towns of Pristina  and Pec. They are to pay a visit to the capital city of the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Skoplje.</p>

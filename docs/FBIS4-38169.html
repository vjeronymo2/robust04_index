			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem -- Orient House [PLO headquarters in  Jerusalem] issued a statement on the Shamgar Commission report  and the omitted facts. The statement says: The Israeli Shamgar  Commission's report places a large question mark on the real aim  for which this commission was set up and whether the commission  was indeed serious in finding out the real causes behind the  Hebron massacre or if it was just an attempt to exonerate the  Israeli occupation authorities from their responsibility.    Through an elaborate examination of the report it becomes  clear, with utmost regret, that it is tantamount to an elegantly  polished facade that conceals a horrible feature. The report,  in its results, aims, and recommendations has sought to affirm  and reinforce the objective circumstances that led to the  massacre for which it held a single person responsible, without  paying attention to the causes and factors that produced this  killer and which every day are producing scores of his ilk, who  are seething with resentment against defenseless Palestinians.    It is worth noting that such a repugnant and bloody massacre  took place in a sacred site, resulting in scores of victims,  without a single Israeli military or political official being  called to justice, especially as numerous pieces of evidence and  statements had pointed an accusing finger at more than an  Israeli party whether directly or indirectly involved in this  massacre.    The report's recommendations are procedural, based on  reinforcing the status quo with all its gravity. They do not  rise to the level of analyzing the results and drawing  conclusions from this massacre and the real reasons that led to  it; namely, the settlers' presence in the heart of Hebron and  the elements of provocation and instability which this presence  represents, especially as thousands of settlers serve in the  Israeli Army and implement their objectives within sight and  earshot of their commanders. In addition, their work in various  official Israeli agencies allows them to obtain the required  information and the necessary weapons for perpetrating these  massacres against the Palestinian people's sons.    The report's results, apart from clearing Israel -- as an  occupying authority -- of responsibility for the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, bestowed legitimacy on the occupation's  measures inside the mosque and on the facts established forcibly  by Israel there. These results were established based on  measures that are basically null and void and which contravene  international law and the Geneva Conventions.    Out of concern for the rights, safety, and security of our  people, we stress that the report ignored the roots of the  problem, which is the Jewish settlement presence in the heart of  Hebron, and disregarded the daily attacks by armed settlers  against the citizens of the town. This constitutes a time bomb  of dire consequences for which the occupation authorities bear  full responsibility.    While expressing our regret over the results and  recommendations contained in the Shamgar Commission report and  its disregard of all these facts, we call on the United Nations  and its international institutions to refute this report and  what it entails and to consider it merely as an attempt to  contain the situation, exonerate the occupation from the Hebron  massacre before public opinion, and cover up its crimes against  the defenseless Palestinian people.</p>

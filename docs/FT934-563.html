			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Clinton turns over files in land affair President Bill Clinton has ordered his personal lawyer to give federal investigators all relevant files about a failed Arkansas real estate venture in which the president and his wife were once partners. The move is an apparent attempt by Mr Clinton to defuse a growing controversy about whether he might be trying to cover up financial wrongdoings. It came as separate allegations that he tried to cover up a sexual scandal by offering government jobs appeared to fade. The White House said yesterday the files on the land deal would be turned over to 'appropriate law enforcement authorities at the Justice Department'. They would include files removed from the office of Mr Vince Foster, his White House lawyer who committed suicide last July. The files relate to an investment by Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary in Whitewater Development Corp, a partnership with a close friend who owned a now defunct savings and loan association. For months the Justice Department has been investigating whether Mr Clinton's partner had channelled any money from the S&amp;L into Whitewater; if any S&amp;L money was used to retire Clinton campaign debt; and whether the then Governor Clinton had influenced treatment by state bank regulators of the S&amp;L. The White House has consistently denied any wrongdoing by Mr Clinton. Republicans have been demanding congressional hearings and the appointment of a special counsel to take over the Justice Department investigation. But Miss Janet Reno, the federal attorney general, yesterday refused to appointed a special counsel. Democrats suspected that the controversy was being fanned by Mr Clinton's opponents because of concern at his end-of-year surge in public opinion polls. In its statement, the White House said: 'There has never been any suggestion by any law enforcement officials of any impropriety regarding the Clintons' investments in Whitewater. The president has voluntarily decided to release these documents for whatever relevance they have in any Department of Justice law enforcement enquiry.' Earlier, some of the steam seemed to go out parallel allegations that Mr Clinton had used state troopers in Arkansas to help him arrange extra-marital affairs and had later tried to buy their silence by offering them federal government jobs. One state trooper signed an affidavit denying that he or his colleagues had been offered jobs by Mr Clinton in exchange for their silence. The alleged offer of a federal job would violate federal law.</p>

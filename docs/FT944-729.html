			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Sweeping reshuffle in S Korea South Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday replaced more than half of his cabinet, in a sweeping reshuffle meant to revive his faltering administration. It is the biggest cabinet shake-up since the Kim administration took office in February 1993, with 15 of 22 ministers being changed. Key appointments indicate that the president is determined to push through economic deregulation, while signalling what may become a tougher attitude toward North Korea, in spite of the recent nuclear agreement that Pyongyang signed with the US. The reshuffle had been expected after Mr Kim, earlier this month, ordered a reduction in the bureaucracy, eliminating several ministries. The president's popularity has fallen in the past 18 months from an approval rating of 90 per cent to less than 40 per cent, as his programme of economic and political reforms has lost momentum. The administration has also been damaged by corruption scandals and public disasters such as the recent collapse of a Seoul motorway bridge in which 32 people died. Mr Hong Jae-hyong, deputy prime minister for the economic planning board (EPB) and earlier a finance minister in the Kim administration, will become the head of the country's new enlarged economic ministry, the Finance and Economic Board. This powerful agency is a product of a merger of the EPB and the finance ministry, approved by parliament yesterday. Mr Hong's appointment 'reflects the president's intention that the EPB take over the finance ministry, rather than vice versa', said a presidential aide. The EPB is considered a stronger supporter of financial liberalisation and economic deregulation than the conservative finance ministry. Mr Park Jae-yoon, current finance minister, will replace Mr Kim Chul-su, trade and industry minister. Mr Park was chief economic adviser to the president before becoming finance minister in September. He is considered one of the main architects of the economic reform programme. In foreign affairs, Mr Han Sung-joo, seen as a moderate on the North Korea issue, was replaced as foreign minister by Mr Gong Ro-myung, a career diplomat and now ambassador to Japan. Mr Gong's appointment represents a victory for foreign ministry officials, who did not fully accept Mr Han because he was an academic rather than a diplomat. Mr Lee Hong-koo, deputy prime minister for unification, who was appointed the new prime minister last Saturday, is regarded as the only remaining voice in the cabinet to be urging a conciliatory approach to North Korea. His replacement as unification minister, who is responsible for inter-Korean relations, is Mr Kim Deok, current head of the intelligence organisation, the agency for national security planning, and seen as a hardliner on North Korea. The US-North Korean nuclear accord has been criticised by South Koreans for offering too many concessions to Pyongyang, including western aid and US diplomatic ties, in return for dismantling its nuclear programme. The military is also gaining influence in the cabinet after Mr Kim, a former dissident, had distanced himself from the armed forces which controlled South Korea in 1961-87. Mr Kwon Young-hae, a retired army general and former defence minister, will become the new head of the intelligence agency. Air force General Lee Yang-ho, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, will be the defence minister.</p>

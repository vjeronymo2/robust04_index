			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Main parties steady at 40% - Public opinion LAST WEEK'S public opinion polls have done little to change the overall standing of the two main parties, which have been running roughly neck and neck since the autumn. In spite of the frenetic public relations skirmishing of recent weeks, both the Conservatives and Labour remain locked together with just under 40 per cent of the vote. Neither party seems able to break this barrier and consolidate a position where they can entertain realistic hopes of winning an overall majority of seats. Indeed, the FT's weighted average of the last nine opinion polls shows them rocking back slightly from last week, as the Liberal Democrats apparently continue to benefit from Mr Paddy Ashdown's admission that he had an affair with his former secretary. The Tories will now be setting more store than ever by the opportunity for setting the agenda afforded by a tax-cutting Budget. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, must be hoping that the grim state of the economy sways more support his way. On their present performance, the FT's computer gives the Conservatives 312 seats (against 326 needed for an overall majority), Labour 296 and the Liberal Democrats 18. In the current parliament, the Conservatives have 367 seats, Labour 230 and the Liberal Democrats 22.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT POLL OF POLLS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Pub'n   Sample  Fieldwork   Cons   Lab   Lib   Cons                     date    size     date                   Dems margin  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gallup Snap/DT     7.2.92  1,119    Jan 29     42.5   37.5  14.0   5.0                                    to Feb 3 Harris/Express     7.2.92  1,097    Feb 5,6    39.0   40.0  17.0  -1.0 Ind on S/NOP       9.2.92  1,084    Feb 7      38.0   42.0  15.0  -4.0 ICM/Guardian      12.2.92  1,462    Feb 7,8    40.0   40.0  16.0   0.0 Gallup Countdown         15.2.92  2,012    Feb 5-11   40.0   37.5  17.5   2.5 S Express/ICM     16.2.92  1,098    Feb 14     40.0   39.0  16.0   1.0 Observer/Harris   16.2.92  1,066    Feb 12,13  39.0   40.0  15.0  -1.0 NOP/Ind Newsnight 21.2.92  1,413    Feb 15-17  38.0   42.0  15.0  -4.0 Gallup Countdown         22.2.92  2,958    Feb 12-18  39.0   37.0  19.0   2.0 Average                    1,479               40.0   39.0  16.0   0.0 Weighted Av                                    39.45  39.04 16.54  0.41  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

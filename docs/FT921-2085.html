			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Scandinavian hub is planned for Gatwick THE THREE partner airlines in the Scandinavian NRT Nordisk travel group plan to expand their operations to turn Gatwick into an international hub for Scandinavian air traffic in competition with Copenhagen, Paul Betts writes. The three carriers, Transwede Airways, Norway Airlines and Sterling, are developing new scheduled air services between Scandinavia and Gatwick to take advantage of the deregulation of domestic air travel in Sweden. This will enable them to compete in their domestic market against Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), the region's flag carrier, to develop feeder services to London and other European cities to connect with international networks of larger airlines. 'Domestic deregulation in Sweden this summer will enable the three carriers to develop a domestic traffic they will be able to transport to Gatwick,' Mr Anders Lidman, an aviation consultant to the three carriers, said in London yesterday. It could create a Scandinavian international hub-and-spoke system in competition with Copenhagen, he added. Transwede and Norway Airlines have reached several joint ticketing agreements with international carriers at Gatwick including British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines and Cathay Pacific. The airlines, which recently started scheduled services from Scandinavia to Gatwick, also announced yesterday plans to boost frequencies to London. Transwede, Norway Airlines and Sterling joined forces last September under the umbrella of the NRT Nordisk travel group to compete against SAS to take advantage of airline deregulation in Sweden and air-transport liberalisation in Europe. Mr Harald Rosen, Transwede's vice-president for traffic and sales, said the three smaller airlines would compete strongly against SAS because their costs were about 30 per cent lower than those of the Scandinavian flag carrier. Transwede, which started scheduled services from Stockholm to Gatwick a year ago, had now gained nearly 30 per cent of that market, said Mr Rosen. The expansion of NRT Nordisk's airline activities and their challenge to SAS is expected to lead to a change in the share-ownership of the travel group. NRT Nordisk is jointly owned by the Reso hotel and travel company and the Wallenberg group. However, Wallenberg is also a shareholder in SAS and is expected to withdraw from NRT Nordisk.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh -- Any dispute relating to foreign or  local investments in this nation shall be brought by either  party for conciliation to the Cambodian Investment Board (CIB).    CIB, as provided for under the yet to be ratified Investment  Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia, is empowered to provide its  opinion on the settlement of disputes. However, as far as  possible, the disputes should be settled amicably through  consultation between the parties in question.    Should CIB not render any opinion within one month from the  first request to provide such an opinion, or in the event of a  disagreement by one of the parties with the opinion, the dispute  shall be definitely settled through binding arbitration here, in  accordance with the rules of the United Nations Commission for  International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). This shall apply unless  other arbitration procedures and places have been agreed upon by  the parties or are provided for under an international treaty.    In the event an approved company intends to end its activity  in the kingdom, it will have to inform the CIB through an  official letter, mentioning the reasons for such a decision.    The Audit Department of the Cambodian Development Council  (CDC), shall have the responsibility of examining the cause of  the dissolution intent and also to ensure that the company's  potential creditors, suitors and taxes are properly settled  before the entity can be officially dissolved.    Once the company's liabilities are being settled, it can  transfer the remaining proceeds of its assets overseas or use  them in the kingdom.    However, in the event that the dissolving company had used  machineries and equipment which were imported duty free for less  than three years, the company will have the obligation to pay  the duties applicable to those machineries and equipment.    Among the incentives provided for by the Investment Law is  the provision for a corporate tax rate of nine percent,  non-taxation on the distribution of dividends or profits or  proceeds of investments. A corporate tax exemption of up to  eight years depending on the characteristics of the project and  the priority of the government will also be considered. The  corporate tax exemption shall be applicable from the year the  project derives its first profits and a five-year loss carried  forward shall be allowed where applicable.    These are some of the provisions made in (?39 sections of  the) "Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia" which will act  as the catalyst for industrial and investment growth in this  nation.</p>

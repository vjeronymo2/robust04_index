			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Sun Chunying (1327 2504 5391): "A </F> Comprehensive View of Public Order in Rural Areas"]    [Text] I.    What is the present situation of public order in rural areas  after all? This is an issue about which people are universally  concerned.    Since reform and opening up, party committees, governments,  and functional departments in various localities have focused  closely on economic construction as the central task, persisted  in building the material and spiritual civilizations  simultaneously, and put into comprehensive effect various  measures for the overall control of social security, so that the  public order situation in rural areas is generally stable.  People longing for stability and good order are the mainstream  of rural society at present.    It is also necessary, however, to note calmly that the  public  order problem remains comparatively conspicuous in some rural  areas. A small number of places are in a state of chaos, and the  situation in a few places -- where peasants have expressed  strong feelings of dissatisfaction -- is relatively serious.    What are the manifestations of prominent problems concerning  social security in rural areas at present?    In recent years, crime has increased continuously in rural  areas. In a few places, serious cases of violence -- including  murders, explosions, injuries, and other incidents -- have  increased by a larger margin than in cities. According to  statistics, there were more than 1.61 million cases of crime  throughout the country in 1993. Of this total, serious offenses  exceeded 530,000. In rural areas, the total number of cases  exceeded 750,000, and serious cases numbered more than 160,000.    Various kinds of evil forces -- including "village tyrants  [ba 7218]," "land tyrants," "water tyrants," "grain tyrants,"  and so -- on have emerged in a small number of rural areas and  become a ferocious force that has jeopardized social security.  Some of them have even become gangs of an underworld nature.  According to the study and analysis of these gangs, it has been  discovered that a great majority of them are composed primarily  of former criminals who were released after having served their  prison terms, but who refuse to mend their evil ways. They have  rounded up groups of rural hooligans who were idling about and  doing indecent things. These groups have gathered together,  acting like overlords [ba 7218] and endangering public order in  rural areas. Some gangs have engaged in frenzied criminal  activities, such as theft, robbery, rape, blackmail, and so on.    "Train robbers and highwaymen" have run rampant, darting  here  and there to commit crimes, and seriously affecting rural  economic development. Criminals have conducted their evil  activities unscrupulously and in broad daylight, which has made  passengers and drivers tremble with fear.    The problem of lawbreaking activities conducted by people  from other localities is particularly conspicuous in those areas  that are relatively developed economically. It has been learned  that in the river valley areas of northern and southern Jiangsu,  the alien population accounted for more that 60 percent of the  crimes committed, and for more than 80 percent in some areas.  As "nowhere under the sun is a better place to make money than  Guangdong," in a large number of cities and counties in the  economically developed Zhu Jiang Delta area, convicts on the run  and the alien population accounted for more than 70 percent of  the crimes committed, with the figure reaching 95 percent in  some localities.    Activities aimed at seizing properties, which include  stealing or looting the facilities of state key construction  projects, oil fields, power stations, waterworks, and other  installations, as well as railroad and highway materials, are  extremely serious.    Incidents of armed fighting by the masses, which were  triggered by disputes over land, forests, irrigation, roads,  clans, and other causes, have increased. According to  statistics from the public security departments or bureaus in 24  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, there were  more than 600 cases of mass armed fighting in rural areas in  1993, which caused some 100 deaths, approximately 1,000 inuries,  and direct economic losses amounting to more than 6 million yuan.    The forces of rural patriarchal clans have revived in some  areas, and activities related to feudal superstition and  reactionary secret societies have gained ground to some extent.  In a small number of areas, there emerged a situation in which  clan forces even stood up as equals to grass-roots party and  government organs, in a vain attempt to take their places.    The ugly social phenomena of practicing prostitution,  patronizing prostitutes, and gambling -- among others -- are  spreading in rural areas, and such lawbreaking activities as  abducting and selling women and children are very serious  too.   <H8>    II. </H8>   In the course of covering news at the grass-roots level,  this  reporter has learned that the increase in law-and-order problems  in the countryside was brought about by complicated factors, but  the primary reason was the ineffectiveness of leading bodies.  In some localities, rural cadres paid attention only to  economic work, while neglecting public order and the building of  socialist spiritual civilization in the rural areas. As a  result, law and order in some rural areas is out of control. In  particular, some grass-roots party branches and village  committees were not well-organized, were weak and loose, or even  were paralyzed. This resulted in a situation in which no one  was responsible for the maintenance of law and order. In some  places, there was no village committee or village party branch  at all, still less any organizations for public security and  order. Some local public security committees existed in name  only, and did not perform any function. As some people  described the situation: "Good guys dissolved their  organizations, and bad guys ganged up to do evil."    In the second place, the actual input of human and material  resources into the maintenance of law and order in rural areas  was far insufficient as compared with actual needs. This found  expression in the fact that social management and public  security functions were weakened; the comprehensive measures for  the maintenance of law and order were not implemented  effectively; the forces for guaranteeing public security in  rural areas were insufficient, their organization was loose, and  their management and operation were disorderly; and insufficient  attention was paid to security work, the means were ineffective,  and input was insufficient.    The large population and insufficient land caused a large  number of surplus rural laborers, and the ineffective management  of this population was also a major factor in the chaotic  law-and-order situation. Although the surplus labor force was  somewhat reduced -- thanks to employment offerred by town and  township enterprises and by laborers traveling away from their  homes to do business and seek work -- many people in the  countryside remained idle and were apt to become lawbreakers.  Some of these people ganged up to do evil and harm the security  of local communities. There are signs that crimes committed by  peasants account for an increasing proportion of urban crime,  and a large number of jobless peasants make up the "reserve  force" for urban crime.    The rapid expansion of people's desire for consumer goods  and  their relatively low income formed a sharp contrast, and this  also made some people lose their psychological balance and  degenerate into lawbreakers. This tendency was particularly  obvious among some peasants who had a weak sense of morals and  the law. They tended to fulfill their desires for getting rich  by means of breaking the law. In addition, although the peasant  masses -- as compared with urban residents -- gained real  benefits from the adoption in the countryside of the contract  responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, most  peasants were still short of money. This was a deep-level  problem that affected rural stability.    As for public security work, although great efforts have  been  made in recent years to consolidate law and order in rural  areas, and a great deal of work has been done, this was still  unsuited to the developing law-and-order situation in the  countryside. In most places, there were only two or three  people per rural police station, and there were even one-person  stations. In some towns and townships there was no police  station set up. Policemen have been working in difficult  conditions. The insufficient numbers, shortage of operating  funds, backward equipment, and other difficulties in police work  also constrained the effective operation of law enforcement  organs in the countryside.  <H8>  III. </H8>   Effectively maintaining law and order in the countryside is  an important condition for developing the rural economy. The  central rural work conferences in 1993 and 1994 both set out  strict requirements for the rectification of law and order in  the countryside. In order to implement the central instructions  properly, the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of  Public Security decided to focus efforts on solving problems in  rural areas, where the incidence of crime was serious, and to  strive to meet the peasants' expectations for solid results in  improving the law-and-order situation.    Mou Xinsheng, vice minister of public security in charge of  community law-and-order affairs, recently told this reporter:  "The law-and-order problems in the countryside have occurred  against the background of some major changes in people's  thinking and mentality, and in the forms of economic and social  organization in rural communities. Such problems are related to  the situation in which organizational and management work was  not suited to the rural work as a whole. Therefore, in the new  situation we should actively study and explore new ways to  strengthen rural public security work and to consolidate law and  order in the countryside."    Some people of insight have said: In view of the current  public order problems in rural areas and the fact that the  proportion of crimes among peasants is rising, the public  security organs should adopt measures more pertinent to this  situation. The party committees and local governments at all  levels should attach importance to guiding the rural public  security work, and should increase actual manpower, material,  and financial investment in rural public security work so as to  meet the needs in the arduous public security tasks in rural  areas.       Efforts should be focused on more sternly cracking down  on the conspicuous criminal activities in the countryside, such  as theft, robbery, murder, assault and battery, and the  abduction of women and children. Anticrime campaigns should be  launched in good time, on various scales, and in flexible forms  so as to crack down on certain sensational crimes. In  particular, the crackdown should be focused on criminal  syndicates and evildoing forces that endanger law and order in  certain areas. At the same time, it is necessary to explore  more effective ways of solving criminal cases and to enhance  efficiency in the solution of cases.    Of course, the settlement of the existing problems in rural  public order cannot rely only on the isolated work of the public  security organs, but also must rely on the joint efforts of all  circles in society and on the adoption of comprehensive measures.    When talking about this, Chen Jiping, member of the Central  Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security and  director of the committee's General Office, said: The primary  issue is that party and government leaders at all levels must  really shoulder political responsibility for ensuring the public  security of local communities, actually strengthen leadership  over the work of exercising comprehensive public security  management, and support law enforcement departments in sternly  cracking down on criminal activities that seriously harm law and  order in rural areas. Second, it is necessary to actually  consolidate the grass-roots party and government organizations  in the countryside, and to restore and reinvigorate the  paralyzed and semiparalyzed village organizations through  comprehensive rectification in terms of ideology, work style,  and organization. Third, the mass organizations for maintaining  law and order should be strengthened, and the mechanisms for  cooperation between local residents and the police also should  be consolidated. In particular, the rural public security  committees and the civil mediation committees should be  organized properly. Fourth, legal education should be conducted  for grass-roots cadres and the masses so that they will better  understand the law, and will carry out activities to maintain  law and order in their own communities according to the law.  Fifth, attention should be paid to making good use of the  surplus labor force in the countryside and to doing something  effective to help peasants overcome poverty and get rich.  Sixth, it is necessary to further improve relations between  cadres and peasants, correctly handle various contradictions  among the people, and prevent the intensification of such  contradictions as may affect social stability.    Public security and order in the countryside are an  important  issue China faces in the late 20th century. As long as we do  down-to-earth work with a realistic attitude, take effective  measures, and mobilize the joint efforts of all quarters for  comprehensive management, then we will change the worrisome  situation in this regard into a gratifying one, and will bring  order out of chaos. The successful settlement of this issue will  have a decisive impact on the vigorous and momentous process of  modernization in our country, which has a large rural  population, on into the 21st century.</p>

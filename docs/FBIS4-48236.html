			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>   Future Pitfalls -- While South Africa still faces political  problems, "the pitfalls for the future lie rather in another  direction," how South Africa "addresses the majority's  aspirations" as the "new South Africa will live or die by the  economic decisions it takes now," an editorial in the  Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 14-15 May on page 10  notes. "Initial signs are encouraging. Mandela has retained  Derek Keys as Finance Minister" and "surrounded him with solid  choices" Trevor Manuel and Tito Mboweni. As "aid, as illustrated  elsewhere in Africa, can become an unwelcome albatross for a  young government attempting to find its feet," "the ANC's  economists, in their dealings with the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund, have generally shown a healthy  reluctance to get tied down by terms dictated to them."  "Obviously it would be churlish for South Africa to turn its  back on nations anxious to help it through a testing period. But  the government must exercise the utmost caution before it dives  into waters containing dangerous undercurrants."  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   Acknowledging Sacrifices -- It was a "joyous week" for South  Africa, but "it is important that we acknowledge the sacrifices  that have been made by so many who have not lived to join in  this feast of our freedom," an editorial in Johannesburg NEW  NATION in English on 13 May on page 7 states. "We must recognize  that the suffering" of Mozambique "was a direct consequence of  the role that country and its people played in the struggle  against apartheid." Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] was  "spawned by those who orchestrated apartheid's defense." And the  "devasting" suffering in Angola "mainly because of the help it  gave to the ANC in its battle against apartheid." UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] "continues  to exist and fester in Angola only because it was expedient from  the point of view of apartheid." The help of Zambia's Kaunda and  Tanzania's Nyerere was not "adequately " acknowledged and "it  needs to be said very forcefully" that "we might not have been  in a position to celebrate a victory this week had it not been  for the Cubans" who "committed their lives to defeating  apartheid's defense force at Cuito Cuanavale." "While the debt  we owe these nations is not one we can pretend we will be able  to settle, we must at least acknowledge it."    Reconciliation -- "Much has been said about the need for  reconciliation" and "without a doubt" it "must be one of our  priorities," the second editorial in the 13 May NEW NATION  notes. However, "as important as reconciliation is, we must  ensure that we do not pursue this objective with romantic  enthusiasm." "We must remember that the victory we recorded was  not without immense cost." While "we cannot forget that some of  the most senior ministers in the GNU [Government of National  Unity] were among those that sat in the State Security Council  in P W Botha's government," "this is not to suggest that we need  to be suspicious of those we work with. Instead what we need is  vigilance." And truth cannot "become a casualty as we offer  indemnity to political criminals in our pursuit of  reconciliation." Murders committed to defend apartheid "cannot  be pardoned or even considered for indemity."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Parliament Gains New Wealth -- The Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans of 10 May in a page 10 editorial points out that "few  generations are privileged to witness in so short a time so many  highlights becoming instant history." "How different the  process has been to the predictions of the prophets of doom."  "Today we can look in the mirror and no longer see the monster  of oppression or the skunk of apartheid, but something beautiful  and just. Above all, something democratic, because that is the  heartbeat of of the new beginning. No institution is holy. If  South Africa had not reformed, Parliament and the Union  Buildings could have eventually become the seats of a  revolutionary regime, or useless museums standing as witness to  the absolute stupidity of generations of Afrikaners and whites  who refused to adapt. But now Parliament and the Union  Buildings have gained a new use, a new wealth, new ideas which  witness the diversity of the country." "South Africa has  completed its transition not with revolutionary rumbling, but  with dignity, courtesy, and respect for institutions  representing law and order. We wish the new rulers strength and  wisdom. Our deepest hope is that eventually all South Africans  will enjoy the fruits of this change. Because that is the  noblest ideal behind all the changes: to make South Africa a  more beautiful, better, and safer place for all."</p>

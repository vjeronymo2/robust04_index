			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China aims to revive gold mining China plans to spend Yn1.66bn (USDollars 190m) this year in an effort to revive its struggling gold mines, which have been starved of new investment because of the low state purchase price. 'The money will help improve working conditions of the gold mines and upgrade technology,' said Mr Jiao Zhi, head of China's Gold Bureau. He was speaking after a national gold conference in Beijing, at which broadening reforms of the gold-mining sector, including providing new regulations to attract foreign investment, were discussed. China's Gold Bureau, under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries, has presented a draft law to State Council, China's cabinet, aimed at facilitating foreign involvement. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, which has a monopoly of gold purchasing saw a 32 per cent decline in its gold acquisitions last year in spite of a 7.5 per cent increase in production nationally. A low official purchase price drove many hard-pressed mine managers who faced the prospect of being unable to pay workers and sustain production to sell on the black market. State purchases of gold rose in latter part of 1993 following an increase in the official purchase price to a figure that represented a discount of about 10 per cent to the international price. Venezuela has between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 140bn worth of gold reserves in the southern state of Guyana, according to Mr Francisco Layrisse, a cabinet minister and president of the state-owned Corporacion Venezolano de Guayana. 'We have regions where we have 16 ounces per tonne, while South Africa is today extracting between two and three ounces,' he told the daily Economia Hoy.</p>

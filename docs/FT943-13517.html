			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kugelfischer's ruthless survival route - The ball-bearings group says its shake-up is unparalleled Mr Peter-Jurgen Kreher, chief executive of the FAG Kugelfischer ball-bearings group, chuckles when he recalls giving a lecture to business school students about the principles of crisis management. 'They sat there with their mouths open as I explained that the most important thing was to do a daily check of your bank balance,' he says. 'You must always know whether you've got any cash - or whether you've gone broke.' Such nitty-gritty details tend to be overlooked in Germany's academically oriented business schools, Mr Kreher says. Had he not paid attention to the daily fluctuations in cash flow when he took over at Kugelfischer early last year, the group would not have survived. As it is, Mr Kreher has implemented a restructuring plan which he claims is without parallel in the Federal Republic of Germany - in terms of the speed with which the plan was executed and the severity of the measures taken to turn the group round. At the heart of the group's restructuring was the near-halving of the workforce - to 16,000 people at the beginning of 1994 from 31,000 a year earlier. Debts were halved to DM1bn (Dollars 625m) from DM2bn and turnover shrunk 13 per cent to DM3.12bn from DM3.56bn, reflecting the sale of a clutch of subsidiaries identified as non-core businesses. 'We have achieved something gigantic here,' Mr Kreher boasted recently. He predicted that the group, the second largest ball-bearings manufacturer in the world after Sweden's SKF, would make a small profit in the current year  -a reversal from heavy losses and near bankruptcy at the end of 1992. The precarious position was in part due to worldwide recession which led customers, especially car manufacturers, to cut back purchases of bearings. But Kugelfischer's problems were compounded by heavy indebtedness and the ill-fated acquisition of DKFL Deutsche Kugellagerfabrik, an east German bearings manufacturer which Kugelfischer bought in 1990. In a microcosm of the problems of eastern German industry, DKFL suffered a large drop in sales as former markets in eastern Europe evaporated over 1991-92. When the deal was done in the heady days of German reunification the assumption was that sales would reach DM1.2bn a year - but turnover in the years after the acquisition was never more than a third of that level. Recognising the gathering crisis Mr Fritz Schafer, a descendant of Kugelfischer's founders who still owns a majority stake in the company, called in a well-known company doctor in December 1992. This was Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a former chief executive of the Hoesch steel group who was hauled in by Germany's big banks last December to sort out the mess at Metallgesellschaft, the metals, mining and industrial group which which came close to bankruptcy. Mr Neukirchen became chairman of Kugelfischer's supervisory board, devising the ruthless blueprint for the company's survival. Mr Kreher, who was appointed chairman of the management board, put the plan into practice. Mr Kreher sums up the plan with a simple slogan: 'focusing replaces diversification'. Important measures included: The sale of all businesses which did not belong to the core activities: these were defined as rolling-bearing manufacturing, sewing technology and materials handling systems. By January this year the group had sold 13 subsidiaries in sectors including hydraulic brakes, textile machinery accessories, metrology and industrial gauging and control systems, businesses which generated sales of DM720m in 1992. The quick-fire sales brought in DM740m and 5,200 jobs were shed in the process. In June last year, the group pulled out of its engagement in the Leipzig-based DKFL, putting the subsidiary into liquidation and shedding 1,800 jobs. What had been one of the biggest producers of bearings in the eastern bloc had lost about DM300m in 1992. The engagement cost Kugelfischer DM1bn in total, Mr Kreher says. Personnel reduction. On top of the jobs lost as a result of divestments, Kugelfischer has made 8,200 employees redundant and plans further cuts this year and next. The group has achieved annual net savings of about DM1bn as a result. Kugelfischer has cut costs further by using fewer materials, cutting investment and stream-lining production. Management layers have been thinned and the number of product-lines made by the group has been slashed to 25,000 from 320,000. The net result of these measures was that Kugelfischer reported a sharp reduction in losses last year. At the parent company they were DM94m after DM630m in the previous year, although the losses would have been more substantial but for DM35m in extraordinary profits. Kugelfischer's restructuring is symptomatic of the kind of rationalisation set in motion at dozens of big German companies during the recession. Among German companies with a stock market listing, analysts expect large increases in earnings for the current year as rationalisation takes effect.</p>

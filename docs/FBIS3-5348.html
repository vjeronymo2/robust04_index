			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN and MINJU  CHOSON today demand that the Kim Yong-sam group immediately make  public the amount and kinds of nuclear waste dumpted into the  sea and the dumping places and apologize to the whole nation and  promptly stop such an act.    As already exposed, the nuclear waste dumpted into the sea  by  the South Korean rulers in seven years from 1986 to 1992 amounts  to 11,000 trillion becquerels.    Noting that this act of the South Korean authorities is a  never-to-be-condoned crime endangering the existence of the  nation and destroying the ecological environments of the nature,  a NODONG SINMUN analyst says:    Their dumping of nuclear waste into the sea is an  anti-national criminal act of turning the Korean peninsula and  the seas around it into a nuclear-polluted waste region. And  this is a gross violation of the international law and accord.    The nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean puppets is  unthinkable apart from their feverish nuclear arms development.    Their nuclear armament which has been accelerated from the  early 70's is now entering a very dangerous stage. The puppets  have played the role of a shock brigade in the "nuclear" racket  kicked up by the international reactionaries to isolate and  stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, charging it  with its "nuclear issue." This is chiefly aimed at stepping up  their criminal nuclear development behind the scene.    With the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique left alone, it is  impossible to prevent the devastation of the land and seas and  protect the nation from a nuclear disaster, let alone  independence, democracy and reunification.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that if the South Korean  puppets  push ahead with nuclear development, continuing nuclear waste  dumping into the sea, they will face a stern judgement by the  nation and mankind.</p>

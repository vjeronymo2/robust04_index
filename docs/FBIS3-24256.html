The government's efforts were concentrated on pursuing a  moderately tough monetary-credit policy, continuing the process  of privatization, implementing a package of measures to provide  the population with social support, broadening the autonomy of  the regions, carrying out institutional transformations,  developing relations with the CIS member states, and further  liberalizing foreign economic activity.    However, a number of important tasks in the socioeconomic  sphere were not tackled. Last year negative trends persisted,  manifesting themselves in a decline in industrial and  agricultural production, stoppages at many enterprises,  continuing financial crisis, a marked drop in investment  activity, the preservation of an irrational national economic  structure, and a drop in the standard of living of certain  population groups. The situation did not improve in January and  February 1994.    The government is caused particular concern by problems  linked with the untimely payment of wages, the drastic  deterioration in enterprises' solvency, the continuing high  level of inflation, and the increase in crime.    The adoption of the Russian Federation [RF] Constitution by  national ballot 12 December 1993 created the preconditions for  the continuation and development of economic reform based on  coordinated interaction between Russian legislative and  executive bodies.    The government sees its main task as being to ensure the  fulfillment in 1994 of the RF Council of Ministers-Government  Program for 1993-1995 "Developing Reforms and Stabilizing the  Russian Economy."    With a view to performing this task federal executive bodies  and executive bodies in RF components, guided by the provisions  of the RF president's Message to the Federal Assembly "On  Strengthening the Russian State (Basic Guidelines of Domestic  and Foreign Policy)," have been tasked with formulating and  implementing measures designed to raise the population's  standard of living, ensure the timely payment of wages, reduce  the rate of inflation, resolve the problem of nonpayment,  stabilize and increase industrial and agricultural production,  enhance the effectiveness of foreign economic activity,  strengthen the CIS, provide incentives for investment activity  and enlisting foreign investments, develop a competitive  environment, speed up institutional transformations, and improve  the structure of the national economy and the system of state  government.    The government has approved a plan for top-priority measures  to be implemented in accordance with the president's Message to  the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State (Basic  Guidelines of Domestic and Foreign Policy)."    The plan includes the drafting as soon as possible of  concrete normative acts -- draft laws, RF presidential edicts,  and government decrees designed to tackle social and regional  problems, questions of monetary-credit policy, institutional and  structural transformations, agrarian policy, foreign economic  activity, defense of citizens' rights and freedoms, and the  fight against crime.    The Russian Ministry of the Economy, the Russian Ministry of  Finance, the Russian Ministry of Science and Technology Policy,  the Russian State Committee for Industrial Policy, and the  Russian Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy,  jointly with other interested federal executive bodies and  executive bodies of RF components, have been asked to finish  shaping by 1 April 1994 the federal targeted programs adopted  for funding, allowing for the volume of funds for which the 1994  Federal Budget makes provision.

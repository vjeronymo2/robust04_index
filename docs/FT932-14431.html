			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Doubts about the price of peace: Israel's cautious approach to Middle East talks could strengthen the hand of extremists Such is the nature of Middle East politics that the closer Israel gets to achieving most of what it has sought since independence, the less appealing is the prospect of having to pay the political price. The extent to which its Arab neighbours, for four decades implacable enemies, have become supplicants has never been more obvious. Their refusal to resume negotiations with Israel in Washington as requested by the US, cannot disguise the fact that eventually, probably within a few days, they will be back at the table. Four months of protests and appeals to the international community over the mass deportation by Israel of Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza, and warnings that the process could be close to collapse, have achieved little. Just how little was emphasised yesterday by Israel's refusal to consider doing anything more to make it easier for the Arab delegations to continue negotiations. No country is more anxious to resume than Syria, so recently the main standard-bearer of anti-Israel rhetoric, and all are propelled by the same reluctant acceptance that the gains needed to bolster their own domestic political credibility will only come through negotiation. Yet the sombre mood in Jerusalem appears to recognise little of this. Eighteen months into the peace process, the question that will increasingly have to be addressed is whether the Israeli electorate feels the need to pay any sizeable price for a formal peace. Or, put another way, whether an Israeli government feels it can ask that price and still be confident of surviving. The doubts have been fostered in part by the widespread public disillusionment with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. He won last summer's general election on the dual pledge, appealing to both hawks and doves, that he would deliver peace and security. So far, he has done neither. Worse than that, by seeking to fulfil his pledge to crush Arab defiance in the occupied territories, Mr Rabin may have set back the prospects of reaching an agreement with more moderate Palestinians, enhanced the status of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two factions opposed to the entire process, and contributed to the sense of insecurity within Israel itself. Nothing has done more to heighten this than the wave of random stabbings in Israel carried out by individual Arabs, acting for the most part without apparent political direction. The attacks appear to spring from the same well of frustration that has marked the relentless decline of the Gaza Strip into impoverished semi-anarchy. More Israelis have officially been encouraged to carry guns, more Jewish settlers in the occupied territories have extracted their own revenge, and the government has now imposed an indefinite ban on most Palestinians entering Israel proper, thereby cutting them off from their work and worsening economic conditions in the territories. At the same time, Mr Rabin and his colleagues insist that the best way to break the cycle of violence is by improving living conditions in the West Bank and Gaza and by negotiating a peace agreement. But even if the public fully accepted the argument, it would not lessen the demand that security has to be the first priority. And Mr Rabin has to assume that the more he gives at the negotiating table, the more vociferous his domestic opponents will become and the more violent extremist Arabs will be in their efforts to derail the entire process. How courageous Mr Rabin will be in attempting to break out of this dilemma should become clear in the next few weeks. For the first time since the the opening conference in October 1991, this next and ninth negotiating session will be open-ended. President Bill Clinton has also promised that the US will be a 'full partner' in the process, which means that, unlike the previous Bush administration, it will actively seek to bridge differences between the delegations and put forward its own proposals. Nowhere could this approach bear fruit more quickly than in the bilateral Syrian-Israeli negotiations where a substantial degree of understanding has already been reached. Mr Rabin and his colleagues know that if they agree to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, occupied in 1967, Syria is prepared to sign a peace treaty. 'The issue is now largely technical,' said a senior Egyptian official. 'It is a question of timing, of security arrangements, of agreeing what, from a Syrian point of view amounts to full withdrawal, and from Israel's position, the content and commitment to a full peace. But the essence of what Syria is offering is thoroughly understood.' The Israeli government, however, is very far from throwing its hat into the air over an offer which, even two years ago, would have been greeted with incredulity. A generally defensive Mr Rabin understandably wants to delay the moment that he stirs the wrath of the right wing in general and the settler community in particular. In Mr Binjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the opposition Likud, he faces an opponent well versed in stoking public fears with simplistic assertions. Nothing better illustrated Mr Netanyahu's style than his opposition to Mr Rabin's concession last week that Mr Faisal al-Husseini, who has been the key behind-the-scenes co-ordinator for the Palestinians, could become the leader of their delegation. Mr al-Husseini comes from East Jerusalem. According to Mr Netanyahu, merely talking to him indicated that Israel was willing to consider handing back the eastern half of the holy city, captured by Israel in 1967 and subsequently annexed. However gross the misrepresentation of Mr Rabin's intentions, it is but a small foretaste of what will follow should the prime minister move towards a deal on the Golan Heights, including the removal of nearly 10,000 Jewish settlers. Such a move would simultaneously sound alarm bells throughout the West Bank and Gaza, where well over 100,000 Jews have settled, and which for Mr Netanyahu and the Likud is an essential God-given part of Israel. Not only would the settlers and Likud fight concessions to the Palestinians which even hinted at any eventual loss of control, but will hope within three years to have captured the government. The new electoral system, under which the prime minister will be directly elected, may well favour the younger Mr Netanyahu and his polished television skills. It is another irony of Middle East politics that increasingly Mr Rabin is finding an identity of interests with Mr Yassir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Labour leaders acknowledge that progress in the peace negotiations would provide the platform needed to win the next election. Mr Arafat similarly needs urgently to show the benefit of negotiations if he is to halt the erosion of support for the PLO in the occupied territories. President Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, their plate heaped high with complex international crises, are ultimately stuck with the task of making the two sides understand their mutual dependence. If neither can publicly concede to the other, they can separately deliver concessions to Mr Clinton as Egypt and Israel did for President Carter during the Camp David negotiations in 1978. Successive US administrations have operated on the basis that Israel should be reassured and often rewarded in advance for offers of co-operation in the future. Mr Rabin's election victory was greeted by President Bush last August with US pledges to guarantee Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in loans. His meeting with Mr Clinton last month brought reassuring political reaffirmation of strategic co-operation, and assurances that the annual Dollars 3bn in military and civil aid would continue. Mr Clinton announced then that he was convinced Mr Rabin was ready to take chances for peace. However, the interpretation of what constitutes political risk may not translate well from Washington to Jerusalem, and Mr Rabin so far has shown little enthusiasm for anything more than the most narrow definition. Until he broadens its scope, all parties to the peace process will remain vulnerable to the extremists working for its collapse.</p>

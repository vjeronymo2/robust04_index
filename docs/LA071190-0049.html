			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT GETS TENTATIVE OK  </P> <P> The Santa Paula City Council has given preliminary approval to its first  redevelopment project -- a 1,100-acre area that virtually encompasses the  southern third of the city.  </P> <P> City Administrator Bob Livingston said a $250-million plan to improve public  walkways, flood control channels and underground utility lines could begin in  three to five years, provided that there are no legal complications. It will  take that long for property values to increase enough to provide the agency  with the tax revenue to begin the redevelopment project.  </P> <P> But county planner Bruce Smith, who last week called the redevelopment plan  inadequate, said Tuesday that parts of it are internally inconsistent. For  instance, Smith said the Land Use Element of the plan does not include areas  subject to flooding.  </P> <P> Smith said that the county "can litigate or we can accept a multimillion-dollar  loss over the next 40 years." Another option is for the city to offer the  county a pass-through agreement.  </P> <P> Under such a pact, which would reduce the likelihood of friction between the  city and county, the county would receive an agreed-upon percentage of any  revenue realized by an increase in property taxes. Under redevelopment, the  city's property tax base is frozen, so that taxing agencies such as the county  no longer automatically receive such revenue when property values increase.  </P> <P> The agency has reached accord with the schools, the library district and the  water district. It is still talking with representatives of the community  college district.  </P> <P> "We have met with county officials, but they don't seem to want to negotiate,"  said Councilman John Melton, adding that city officials believe the plan is  complete.  </P> <P> Santa Paula Councilman Carl Barringer said he believed the county's actions  were financially motivated. "It's a delaying tactic to stop the implementation  of the Redevelopment Agency. It's a rear guard action on their part."  </P> <P> The next step in the adoption of the project is final approval by the City  Council, which is expected at its meeting next Monday, Melton said. If all goes  as planned, the adoption will be filed the next day and will go into effect 30  days thereafter. AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

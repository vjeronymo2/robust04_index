			<p>940413 FT  13 APR 94 / Lautro fines member Pounds 65,000 Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life assurance industry, has fined one of its members - Manulife - Pounds 65,000 after rule breaches associated with an individual company representative, Alison Smith writes. Manulife must also pay Lautro's costs of Pounds 35,000, and has undertaken to ensure that any customer adversely affected will be compensated. The disciplinary action related to the company's failure to make enough checks on someone who worked for it as a representative for about 18 months from January 1991. The fine is considerably lower than some that Lautro has levied recently, notably the Pounds 225,000 imposed on Aegon life assurance company and the Pounds 180,000 on Legal &amp; General.</p>

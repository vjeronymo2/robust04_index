It is one of the  dirtiest crimes of terrorism and the most vile crimes of war.  It is premeditated official terrorism being managed by the  Israeli Government, a policy on which she sat up her entity  since its establishment under the protection of the West and  cover up provided by the Western forces supporting her terrorist  policy which is founded on massacres. Although what happened  represents the ugliest act of terrorism ever seen in the world  and an act of blatant and gross terrorism but we challenge the  West to declare this reality and admit that the act carried out  by the Israelis is a pre planned act of official terrorism and  part of a long chain of Israeli terrorist act and to condemn the  Israelis for their terrorism.    The West, who put the names of the Palestinian people's  freedom fighters on the black list, are supplying the Israeli  terrorist with arms, nuclear weapons and F-15 and F-16 war  planes.    It is the West who are supporting Israeli terrorism and  sponsor it while they treat Palestinian freedom fighters as  criminals despite the fact that they are fighting for the most  sacred humanitarian cause in modern times. We believe that if  there was a real security council other than the one dominated  by the Christians and there was a real united nations other than  dominated by the Christians we would have seen anyone who  supported the Israeli terrorism and support it with weapons,  nuclear weapons and other supplies put on the black list and  subjected to air, naval and land embargo and be punished harshly  for being a patrner in terrorism and supplying the Israeli  terrorist camp with weapons. We challenge the international  community if there is one to fulfill their humanitarian and  required duty to assert justice. And after what the world has  seen this morning is there anyone who can claim that 'Abu Nidal  and Ahmad Jibril. [sentence as received; Tripoli JANA in Arabic  at 1710 GMT on 25 February carried a heavily garbled version of  this report. In the Arabic version, this sentence reads: "And  after what the world has seen this morning is there anyone who  can claim that 'Abu Nidal and Ahmad Jibril are terrorists?"]  After their terrorism and the premeditated and organized  official terrorism which may ensue by the Israeli entity, there  is no terrorist state in the world like the Israeli entity and  there is no state sponsoring terrorism in the world like those  states which sponser Israel and supply her with weapons and  forge with her strategic alliance. [sentence as received]    'Abu Nidal, Ahmad Jibril and other fighters of the  Palestinian people are angels if compared with the Israeli  savages for the Palestinians have never committed horrific  cirmes like those committed by the Israelis against innocent  worshippers in this holy month. The Palestinian fighters are  fighting in defence of their land occupied by the Israeli  invaders and usurpers who came to it from overseas to commit  this atrocities which shock human conscious. What is happening  nowadays confirm the credibility of our view point regarding  this issue and prove the correctness of our dicta which we have  repeatedly asserted.</p>

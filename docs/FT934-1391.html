			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Cows in the landscape There is something very Dutch about a man who has 'Work is pleasure' painted above the drawing-room mirror. Hendrik Willem Mesdag (1856-1927) devoted his life to painting and promoting modern art. His lasting memorial is the Mesdag Museum in The Hague, the first museum of modern art in the Netherlands. Mesdag built it beside his house in 1887 as a place where future generations would find art which was uninhibited by the dead hand of the academy, a fresh, passionate, celebration of the truth of Nature. Treasures of the Mesdag Collection, now at the National Gallery of Scotland, introduces the museum to a wider public. The exhibition well reflects the strong and particular character of the Mesdag Museum and its maker. Mesdag started work with the family bank,but at 35 he resolved to give up business for ever. He was set on becoming a painter, like his wife Sien van Houten and many of their circle. Four years later, a stormy sea of his won a Gold Medal at the Paris Salon and Mesdag was launched as the leading Dutch marine artist. He moved to the Hague to be close to the coast at Scheveningen, where he loved to paint the horses pulling up the fishermen's boats. When it was decided to level the dunes to make a resort, the Mesdags were aghast. They and their artist friends painted the Panorama Mesdag, a 130 metre view of the coast on the kind of grey, choppy day the Hague School liked best. This quaint relic of nascent environmentalism can still be visited, although few people do. The sketch for it is in the exhibition. Treasures from the Mesdag does not look well in the Edinburgh gallery - the ceilings are too low and the wall colour is all wrong. However, it makes perfect sense that in the adjoining room hang the gallery's Daubignys, and the little Daumier 'Portrait of the Artist', and of course the Van Goghs. What we see from the Mesdag is, after all, canvasses by many of Van Gogh's heroes. As in the Mesdag Collection itself, half the paintings are French 19th century; Delacroix, Courbet, Daumier ('Neighbours Talking', quite the best thing), Jules Breton, Millet, two late Corots, and large and boring landscapes by the Barbizon painters. Perhaps the smallest picture is the most striking - a Delacroix oil sketch, 'The Evening of the Battle', a dark and ghastly vision: a lone soldier is the sole living thing of the darkening plain, gazing out helplessly from between the bloating corpses of two cavalry horses. The rest of the paintings are by leading masters of the Hague School; Jacob, Matthijs and Willem Maris, Jozef Israels, Bosboom, Anton Mauve. One has to remember that at this period these artists were immensely sought after by English collectors. Mesdag's heroes were tremendously admired in progressive, painterly circles in the Netherlands and Britain. Dutch art-lovers expressed their concern at the flood of canvasses leaving the country; Mesdag was saving the modernist patrimony. Clear to see is the great affinity between the Dutch and French painters whom Mesdag admired. In many cases these artists knew each other. Moreover, they shared a tremendous respect for the Dutch 17th century masters, particularly Rembrandt and the landscape painters. The Hague School's subjects are quintessentially Dutch in their predilection for cows, seascapes, church interiors, genre scenes such as the feebly comical 'Knitting Lesson' by Gerke Henkes, bonneted children, and portraits of large and faintly greasy kitchen girls. Seeing the Mesdag in miniature I found a far from uplifting experience. It will be several years before the Mesdag Museum reopens. The government has bought the painter's house and it and the museum are now being restored to their circa 1900 appearance. Treasures of the Mesdag Collection is at the National Gallery of Scotland until February 7 then at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, until April 10. It is a National Touring Exhibition organised by the South Bank Centre and sponsored by BT.</p>
